      <title>Convex Optimization Boundary-Control Policies for Stability and Invariance of Traffic Flow Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we propose an optimization-based boundary controller for traffic flow dynamics capable of achieving both stability and invariance conditions. The approach is based on the definition of Boundary Control Barrier Functionals (BCBFal), from which sets of invariance-preserving boundary controllers are derived. In combination with sets of stabilizing controllers, we reformulate the problem as a convex optimization program solved at each point in time to synthesize the boundary control inputs. Sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal controllers are derived in the case of traffic flow models with stability and invariance conditions.</description>

      <title>Online Optimization with Unknown Time-varying Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study optimization problems where the cost function contains time-varying parameters that are unmeasurable and evolve according to linear, yet unknown, dynamics. We propose a solution that leverages control theoretic tools to identify the dynamics of the parameters, predict their evolution, and ultimately compute a solution to the optimization problem. The identification of the dynamics of the time-varying parameters is done online using measurements of the gradient of the cost function. This system identification problem is not standard, since the output matrix is known and the dynamics of the parameters must be estimated in the original coordinates without similarity transformations. Interestingly, our analysis shows that, under mild conditions that we characterize, the identification of the parameters dynamics and, consequently, the computation of a time-varying solution to the optimization problem, requires only a finite number of measurements of the gradient of the cost function. We illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on a series of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Structured Controller Design Using the Matrix S-Procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the data-driven optimal structured controller design for discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, considering both $H_2$ performance and $H_\infty$ performance. For each metric, we propose reliable and promising algorithms for (i) model-based structured control, (ii) data-driven unstructured control, and (iii) data-driven structured control. For the model-based control, we introduce a linearization technique that transforms the original nonconvex problem into a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. Based on this transformation, we develop an iterative linear matrix inequality (ILMI) algorithm. For the data-driven unstructured control, we describe a set of all possible system matrices that can generate the sequence of collected data. Additionally, we propose a sufficient condition to handle all possible system matrices using the matrix S-procedure. The data-driven structured control is followed by combining the previous two cases. We compare our methods with those in the existing literature and demonstrate our superiority via several numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>KKT Reformulations for Single Leader and Multi-Follower Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a bilevel optimization problem having a single leader and multiple followers. The followers choose their strategies simultaneously, and are assumed to converge to a Nash equilibrium strategy profile. We begin by providing a practical example of such a problem in an oligopoly setting. We then show the existence of a Nash equilibrium when the objective function of each follower is convex in its optimizing variable, and the feasible set is compact, convex, and nonempty. We then consider the KKT reformulation of the single leader multi-follower game (henceforth, SLMFG), and show using examples that the solutions of both the problems need not be the same, even when each of the followers' problem is convex. In particular, we show that the global minima of both the problems may differ if the follower's problem does not satisfy the Slater's condition. We then show that the local minima of the SLMFG and its KKT reformulation are the same if, in addition to convexity and Slater's constraints, the local minimum point remains a local minimum for every Lagrange multiplier in each of the followers' problem. Given that this condition is hard to verify in practice, we provide another condition for the local minima of the two problems to be the same using constant rank constraint qualification (CRCQ). We again show using examples that the local optima of the two problems may differ if the conditions are not satisfied.</description>

      <title>Convex Analysis in Spectral Decomposition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with convex analysis of so-called spectral functions of matrices that only depend on eigenvalues of the matrix. An abstract framework of spectral decomposition systems is proposed that covers a wide range of previously studied settings, including eigenvalue decomposition of Hermitian matrices and singular value decomposition of rectangular matrices and allows deriving new results in more general settings such as Euclidean Jordan algebras. The main results characterize convexity, lower semicontinuity, Fenchel conjugates, convex subdifferentials, and Bregman proximity operators of spectral functions in terms of the reduced functions. As a byproduct, a generalization of the Ky Fan majorization theorem is obtained.</description>

      <title>Box-constrained L0 Bregman-relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regularization using the L0 pseudo-norm is a common approach to promote sparsity, with widespread applications in machine learning and signal processing. However, solving such problems is known to be NP-hard. Recently, the L0 Bregman relaxation (B-rex) has been introduced as a continuous, non-convex approximation of the L0 pseudo-norm. Replacing the L0 term with B-rex leads to exact continuous relaxations that preserve the global optimum while simplifying the optimization landscape, making non-convex problems more tractable for algorithmic approaches. In this paper, we focus on box-constrained exact continuous Bregman relaxations of L0-regularized criteria with general data terms, including least-squares, logistic regression, and Kullback-Leibler fidelities. Experimental results on synthetic data, compared with Branch-and-Bound methods, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed relaxations.</description>

      <title>Proximal Gradient Dynamics and Feedback Control for Equality-Constrained Composite Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies equality-constrained composite minimization problems. This class of problems, capturing regularization terms and convex inequality constraints, naturally arises in a wide range of engineering and machine learning applications. To tackle these minimization problems, we introduce the \emph{proportional--integral proximal gradient dynamics} (PI--PGD): a closed-loop system where the Lagrange multipliers are control inputs and states are the problem decision variables. First, we establish the equivalence between the minima of the optimization problem and the equilibria of the PI--PGD. Then, leveraging tools from contraction theory, we give a comprehensive convergence analysis for the dynamics, showing linear--exponential convergence towards the equilibrium. That is, the distance between each solution and the equilibrium is upper bounded by a function that first decreases linearly and then exponentially. Our findings are illustrated numerically on a set of representative examples, which include an application to entropic-regularized optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Sparse Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming via Semismooth Newton Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) has long been recognized as a computationally challenging problem, particularly in large-scale or high-dimensional settings where solving it directly becomes intractable. The complexity further escalates when a sparsity constraint is involved, giving rise to the problem of sparse QCQP (SQCQP), which makes conventional solution methods even less effective. Existing approaches for solving SQCQP typically rely on mixed-integer programming formulations, relaxation techniques, or greedy heuristics but often suffer from computational inefficiency and limited accuracy. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm by designing an efficient algorithm that directly addresses SQCQP. To be more specific, we introduce P-stationarity to establish first- and second-order optimality conditions of the original problem, leading to a system of nonlinear equations whose generalized Jacobian is proven to be nonsingular under mild assumptions. Most importantly, these equations facilitate the development of a semismooth Newton-type method that exhibits significantly low computational complexity due to the sparsity constraint and achieves a locally quadratic convergence rate. Finally, extensive numerical experiments validate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the algorithm compared to several established solvers.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Approach to Optimal Control of the Fokker-Planck Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a spectral optimal control framework for Fokker-Planck equations based on the standard ground state transformation that maps the Fokker-Planck operator to a Schrodinger operator. Our primary objective is to accelerate convergence toward the (unique) steady state. To fulfill this objective, a gradient-based iterative algorithm with Pontryagin's maximum principle and Barzilai-Borwein update is developed to compute time-dependent controls. Numerical experiments on two-dimensional ill-conditioned normal distributions and double-well potentials demonstrate that our approach effectively targets slow-decaying modes, thus increasing the spectral gap.</description>

      <title>A Unified Model for High-Resolution ODEs: New Insights on Accelerated Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on high-resolution ordinary differential equations (HR-ODEs) captures fine nuances among different momentum-based optimization methods, leading to accurate theoretical insights. However, these HR-ODEs often appear disconnected, each targeting a specific algorithm and derived with different assumptions and techniques. We present a unifying framework by showing that these diverse HR-ODEs emerge as special cases of a general HR-ODE derived using the Forced Euler-Lagrange equation. Discretizing this model recovers a wide range of optimization algorithms through different parameter choices. Using integral quadratic constraints, we also introduce a general Lyapunov function to analyze the convergence of the proposed HR-ODE and its discretizations, achieving significant improvements across various cases, including new guarantees for the triple momentum method$'$s HR-ODE and the quasi-hyperbolic momentum method, as well as faster gradient norm minimization rates for Nesterov$'$s accelerated gradient algorithm, among other advances.</description>

      <title>Global Optimization of Gas Transportation and Storage: Convex Hull Characterizations and Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas transportation and storage has become one of the most relevant and important optimization problem in energy systems. This problem inherently includes highly nonlinear and nonconvex aspects due to gas physics, and discrete aspects due to control decisions of active network elements. Obtaining locally feasible or global solutions for this problem presents significant mathematical and computational challenges for system operators. In this paper, we formulate this problem as a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) through disjunctions. Moreover, we study the nonconvex sets induced by gas physics and propose mixed-integer second-order cone programming relaxations for the nonconvex MINLP problem. The proposed relaxations are based on the convex hull representations of the nonconvex sets as follows: We give the convex hull representation of the nonconvex set for pipes and show that it is second-order cone representable. We also give a complete characterization of the extreme points of the nonconvex set for compressors and show that the convex hull of the extreme points is power cone representable. For practical applications, we propose a second-order cone outer-approximation for the nonconvex set for compressors. To obtain (near) globally optimal solutions, we develop an algorithmic framework based on our convex hull results. We evaluate our framework through extensive computational experiments on various GasLib networks in comparison with the convex relaxations from the literature and state-of-the-art global solver. Our results highlights the computational efficiency and convergence performance of our convex relaxation method compared to other methods. Moreover, our method also consistently provides (near) global solutions as well as high-quality warm-starting points for local solvers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates optimal vaccination strategies in a metapopulation epidemic model. We consider a linear cost to better capture operational considerations, such as the total number of vaccines or hospitalizations, in contrast to the standard quadratic cost assumption on the control. The model incorporates state and mixed control-state constraints, and we derive necessary optimality conditions based on Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. We use Pontryagin's result to rule out the possibility of the occurrence of singular arcs and to provide a full characterization of the optimal control.</description>

      <title>Fast MLE and MAPE-Based Device Activity Detection for Grant-Free Access via PSCA and PSCA-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and accurate device activity detection is the critical challenge in grant-free access for supporting massive machine-type communications (mMTC) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) in 5G and beyond. The state-of-the-art methods have unsatisfactory error rates or computation times. To address these outstanding issues, we propose new maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and maximum a posterior estimation (MAPE) based device activity detection methods for known and unknown pathloss that achieve superior error rate and computation time tradeoffs using optimization and deep learning techniques. Specifically, we investigate four non-convex optimization problems for MLE and MAPE in the two pathloss cases, with one MAPE problem being formulated for the first time. For each non-convex problem, we develop an innovative parallel iterative algorithm using the parallel successive convex approximation (PSCA) method. Each PSCA-based algorithm allows parallel computations, uses up to the objective function's second-order information, converges to the problem's stationary points, and has a low per-iteration computational complexity compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. Then, for each PSCA-based iterative algorithm, we present a deep unrolling neural network implementation, called PSCA-Net, to further reduce the computation time. Each PSCA-Net elegantly marries the underlying PSCA-based algorithm's parallel computation mechanism with the parallelizable neural network architecture and effectively optimizes its step sizes based on vast data samples to speed up the convergence. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed methods can significantly reduce the error rate and computation time compared to the state-of-the-art methods, revealing their significant values for grant-free access.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient solution of moderately large-scale linear systems arising from the KKT conditions in optimal control problems (OCPs) is a critical challenge in robotics. With the stagnation of Moore's law, there is growing interest in leveraging GPU-accelerated iterative methods, and corresponding parallel preconditioners, to overcome these computational challenges. To improve the computational performance of such solvers, we introduce a parallel-friendly, parametrized multi-splitting polynomial preconditioner framework that leverages positive and negative factors. Our approach results in improved convergence of the linear systems solves needed in OCPs. We construct and prove the optimal parametrization of multi-splitting theoretically and demonstrate empirically a 76% reduction in condition number and 46% in iteration counts on a series of numerical benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Brunovsky Riccati Recursion for Linear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In almost all algorithms for Model Predictive Control (MPC), the most time-consuming step is to solve some form of Linear Quadratic (LQ) Optimal Control Problem (OCP) repeatedly. The commonly recognized best option for this is a Riccati recursion based solver, which has a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N(n_x^3 + n_x^2 n_u + n_x n_u^2 + n_u^3))$. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{Brunovsky Riccati Recursion} algorithm to solve LQ OCPs for Linear Time Invariant (LTI) systems. The algorithm transforms the system into Brunovsky form, formulates a new LQ cost (and constraints, if any) in Brunovsky coordinates, performs the Riccati recursion there, and converts the solution back. Due to the sparsity (block-diagonality and zero-one pattern per block) of Brunovsky form and the data parallelism introduced in the cost, constraints, and solution transformations, the time complexity of the new method is greatly reduced to $\mathcal{O}(n_x^3 + N(n_x^2 n_u + n_x n_u^2 + n_u^3))$ if $N$ threads/cores are available for parallel computing.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Optimal Guidance for Impact Time Control with Field-of-View Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optimal guidance law for impact time control with field-of-view constraint is presented. The guidance law is derived by first converting the inequality-constrained nonlinear optimal control problem into an equality-constrained one through a saturation function. Based on Pontryagin's maximum principle, a parameterized system satisfying the necessary optimality conditions is established. By propagating this system, a large number of extremal trajectories can be efficiently generated. These trajectories are then used to train a neural network that maps the current state and time-to-go to the optimal guidance command. The trained neural network can generate optimal commands within 0.1 milliseconds while satisfying the field-of-view constraint. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed guidance law outperforms existing methods and achieves nearly optimal performance in terms of control effort.</description>

      <title>Blocked Cholesky factorization updates of the Riccati recursion using hyperbolic Householder transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newton systems in quadratic programming (QP) methods are often solved using direct Cholesky or LDL factorizations. When the linear systems in successive iterations differ by a low-rank modification (as is common in active set and augmented Lagrangian methods), updating the existing factorization can offer significant performance improvements over recomputing a full Cholesky factorization. We review the hyperbolic Householder transformation, and demonstrate its usefulness in describing low-rank Cholesky factorization updates. By applying this hyperbolic Householder-based framework to the well-known Riccati recursion for solving saddle-point problems with optimal control structure, we develop a novel algorithm for updating the factorizations used in optimization solvers for optimal control. Specifically, the proposed method can be used to efficiently solve the semismooth Newton systems that are at the core of the augmented Lagrangian-based QPALM-OCP solver. An optimized open-source implementation of the proposed factorization update routines is provided as well.</description>

      <title>On the optimal control of viscous Cahn-Hilliard systems with hyperbolic relaxation of the chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an optimal control problem for a viscous Cahn--Hilliard system with zero Neumann boundary conditions in which a hyperbolic relaxation term involving the second time derivative of the chemical potential has been added to the first equation of the system. For the initial-boundary value problem of this system, results concerning well-posedness, continuous dependence and regularity are known. We show Fr\'echet differentiability of the associated control-to-state operator, study the associated adjoint state system, and derive first-order necessary optimality conditions. Concerning the nonlinearities driving the system, we can include the case of logarithmic potentials. In addition, we perform an asymptotic analysis of the optimal control problem as the relaxation coefficient approaches zero.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical and Distributed Nonlinear Predictive Controllers for Teams of Quadrupedal Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hierarchical, safety-critical control framework that integrates distributed nonlinear model predictive controllers (DNMPCs) with control barrier functions (CBFs) to enable cooperative locomotion of multi-agent quadrupedal robots in complex environments. While NMPC-based methods are widely adopted for enforcing safety constraints and navigating multi-robot systems (MRSs) through intricate environments, ensuring the safety of MRSs requires a formal definition grounded in the concept of invariant sets. CBFs, typically implemented via quadratic programs (QPs) at the planning layer, provide formal safety guarantees. However, their zero-control horizon limits their effectiveness for extended trajectory planning in inherently unstable, underactuated, and nonlinear legged robot models. Furthermore, the integration of CBFs into real-time NMPC for sophisticated MRSs, such as quadrupedal robot teams, remains underexplored. This paper develops computationally efficient, distributed NMPC algorithms that incorporate CBF-based collision safety guarantees within a consensus protocol, enabling longer planning horizons for safe cooperative locomotion under disturbances and rough terrain conditions. The optimal trajectories generated by the DNMPCs are tracked using full-order, nonlinear whole-body controllers at the low level. The proposed approach is validated through extensive numerical simulations with up to four Unitree A1 robots and hardware experiments involving two A1 robots subjected to external pushes, rough terrain, and uncertain obstacle information. Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed CBF-based DNMPCs achieve a 27.89% higher success rate than conventional NMPCs without CBF constraints.</description>

      <title>Matrix nearness problems and eigenvalue optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This book is about solving matrix nearness problems that are related to eigenvalues or singular values or pseudospectra. These problems arise in great diversity in various fields, be they related to dynamics, as in questions of robust stability and robust control, or related to graphs, as in questions of clustering and ranking. Algorithms for such problems work with matrix perturbations that drive eigenvalues or singular values or Rayleigh quotients to desired locations.
  Remarkably, the optimal perturbation matrices are typically of rank one or are projections of rank-1 matrices onto a linear structure, e.g. a prescribed sparsity pattern. In the approach worked out here, these optimal rank-1 perturbations will be determined in a two-level iteration: In the inner iteration, an eigenvalue optimization problem for a fixed perturbation size is to be solved via gradient-based rank-1 matrix differential equations. This amounts to numerically driving a rank-1 matrix, which is represented by two vectors, into a stationary point, mostly starting nearby. The outer iteration determines the optimal perturbation size by solving a scalar nonlinear equation.
  A wide variety of matrix nearness problems, as outlined in the introductory Chapter I, will be tackled in Chapters II to VIII by such an approach and its nontrivial extensions.</description>

      <title>A shape-optimization approach for inverse diffusion problems using a single boundary measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14764v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the reconstruction of a space-dependent parameter in inverse diffusion problems, proposing a shape-optimization-based approach. The main objective is to recover the absorption coefficient from a single boundary measurement. While conventional gradient-based methods rely on the Fr\'{e}chet derivative of a cost functional with respect to the unknown parameter, we also utilize its shape derivative with respect to the unknown boundary interface for recovery. This non-conventional approach addresses the problem of parameter recovery from a single measurement, which represents the key innovation of this work. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, even for intricate and non-convex boundary interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singularity analysis is essential in robot kinematics, as singular configurations cause loss of control and kinematic indeterminacy. This paper models singularities in bar frameworks as saddle points on constrained manifolds. Given an under-constrained, non-singular bar framework, by allowing one edge to vary its length while fixing lengths of others, we define the squared length of the free edge as an energy functional and show that its local saddle points correspond to singular and flexible frameworks. Using our constrained saddle search approach, we identify previously unknown singular and flexible bar frameworks, providing new insights into singular robotics design and analysis.</description>

      <title>Inverse Problems for Mean Field Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this book, we present a curated collection of existing results on inverse problems for Mean Field Games (MFGs), a cutting-edge and rapidly evolving field of research. Our aim is to provide fresh insights, novel perspectives, and a comprehensive foundation for future investigations into this fascinating area. MFGs, a class of differential games involving a continuum of non-atomic players, offer a powerful framework for analyzing the collective behavior of large populations of symmetric agents as the number of agents approaches infinity. This framework has proven to be an invaluable tool for quantitatively modeling the macroscopic dynamics of agents striving to minimize specific costs in complex systems, such as crowd dynamics, financial markets, traffic flows, and social networks.
  The study of MFGs has traditionally focused on forward problems, where the goal is to determine the equilibrium behavior of agents given a set of model parameters, such as cost functions, interaction mechanisms, and initial conditions. However, the inverse problems for MFGs -- which seek to infer these underlying parameters from observed data -- have received comparatively less attention in the literature. This book seeks to address this gap by delving into the fundamental aspects of MFG inverse problems, with a particular emphasis on issues of unique identifiability, stability, and reconstruction of unknown parameters. These problems are not only mathematically challenging but also of immense practical significance, as they enable the calibration and validation of MFG models using real-world data.
  This book is intended to serve as a valuable resource for researchers interested in the theory and applications of MFGs, particularly in inverse problems. Through this book, we hope to inspire further exploration and innovation in this dynamic and interdisciplinary area of study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the perspective of control theory, neural differential equations (neural ODEs) have become an important tool for supervised learning. In the fundamental work of Ruiz-Balet and Zuazua (SIAM REVIEW 2023), the authors pose an open problem regarding the connection between control theory, optimal transport theory, and neural differential equations. More precisely, they inquire how one can quantify the closeness of the optimal flows in neural transport equations to the true dynamic optimal transport. In this work, we propose a construction of neural differential equations that converge to the true dynamic optimal transport in the limit, providing a significant step in solving the formerly mentioned open problem.</description>

      <title>Global Group Fairness in Federated Learning via Function Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate group fairness regularizers in federated learning, aiming to train a globally fair model in a distributed setting. Ensuring global fairness in distributed training presents unique challenges, as fairness regularizers typically involve probability metrics between distributions across all clients and are not naturally separable by client. To address this, we introduce a function-tracking scheme for the global fairness regularizer based on a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), which incurs a small communication overhead. This scheme seamlessly integrates into most federated learning algorithms while preserving rigorous convergence guarantees, as demonstrated in the context of FedAvg. Additionally, when enforcing differential privacy, the kernel-based MMD regularization enables straightforward analysis through a change of kernel, leveraging an intuitive interpretation of kernel convolution. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in industrial applications. However, finding optimal or close-to-optimal solutions can often be extremely hard. Because some of these problems can be mapped to the ground-state search of the Ising model, tremendous effort has been devoted to developing solvers for Ising-type problems over the past decades. Recent advances in controlling and manipulating both quantum and classical systems have enabled novel computing paradigms such as quantum simulators and coherent Ising machines to tackle hard optimization problems. Here, we examine and benchmark several physics-inspired optimization algorithms, including coherent Ising machines, gain-dissipative algorithms, simulated bifurcation machines, and Hopfield neural networks, which we collectively refer to as stochastic-driven nonlinear dynamical systems. Most importantly, we benchmark these algorithms against random Ising problems with planted solutions and compare them to simulated annealing as a baseline leveraging the same software stack for all solvers. We further study how different numerical integration techniques and graph connectivity affect performance. This work provides an overview of a diverse set of new optimization paradigms.</description>

      <title>On the Sparsity of Optimal Linear Decision Rules for a Class of Robust Optimization Problems with Box Uncertainty Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10661v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of production-inventory problems with box uncertainty sets from the seminal work of Ben-Tal et al. (2004) on linear decision rules in robust optimization. We prove that there always exists an optimal linear decision rule for this class of problems in which the number of nonzero parameters in the linear decision rule grows linearly in the number of time periods. This is the first result to prove that optimal linear decision rules are sparse in a widely-studied class of robust optimization problems with many time periods. Harnessing this sparsity guarantee, we introduce a reformulation technique that allows robust optimization problems such as production-inventory problems to be solved as a compact linear optimization problem when most of the parameters of the linear decision rules are forced to be equal to zero. We also develop an active set method for identifying the parameters of linear decision rules that are equal to zero at optimality. In numerical experiments on production-inventory problems with hundreds of time periods, we find that our reformulation technique coupled with the active set method yield more than a 32x speedup over state-of-the-art linear optimization solvers in computing linear decision rules that are within 1\% of optimal. Our proofs and algorithms are based on a principled analysis of extreme points of linear optimization formulations.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Singularity Degree for Linear and Semidefinite Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Facial reduction (FR) is an important tool in linear and semidefinite programming, providing both algorithmic and theoretical insights into these problems. The maximum length of an FR sequence for a convex set is referred to as the maximum singularity degree (MSD). We observe that the behavior of certain FR algorithms can be explained through the MSD. Combined with recent applications of the MSD in the literature, this motivates our study of its fundamental properties in this paper.
  In this work, we show that an FR sequence has the longest length implies that it satisfies a certain minimal property. For linear programming (LP), we introduce two operations for manipulating the longest FR sequences. These operations enable us to characterize the longest FR sequences for LP problems. To study the MSD for semidefinite programming (SDP), we provide several useful tools including simplification and upper-bounding techniques. By leveraging these tools and the characterization for LP problems, we prove that finding a longest FR sequence for SDP problems is NP-hard. This complexity result highlights a striking difference between the shortest and the longest FR sequences for SDP problems.</description>

Abstract: Arc-search interior-point methods (IPMs) are a class of IPMs that utilize an ellipsoidal arc to approximate the central path. On the other hand, inexact IPMs solve the linear
  equation system for the search direction inexactly at each iteration. In this paper, we propose an inexact infeasible arc-search interior-point method. We establish that the
  proposed method is a polynomial-time algorithm and we show that its iteration complexity is lower than an inexact infeasible line-search IPM. We conducted numerical experiments with benchmark problems from NETLIB. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the number of iterations and the computation time compared to an existing inexact line-search IPM.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Energy Market Contracts: Dynkin Game with Doubly RBSDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines a Contract for Difference (CfD) with early exit options, a key risk management tool in electricity markets. The contract, involving a producer and a regulatory entity, is modeled as a two-player Dynkin game with mean-reverting electricity prices and penalties for early termination.
  We formulate the strategic interaction using Doubly Reflected Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (DRBSDEs), which characterize the fair contract value and optimal stopping strategies. We show that the first component of the DRBSDE solution represents the value of the Dynkin game, and that the first hitting times correspond to a Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we link the problem to a Skorokhod problem with time-dependent boundaries, deriving an explicit formula for the Skorokhod adjustment processes.
  To solve the DRBSDE, we develop a deep learning-based numerical algorithm, leveraging neural networks for efficient computation. We analyze the convergence of the deep learning algorithm, as well as the value function and optimal stopping rules. Numerical experiments, including a CfD model calibrated on French electricity prices, highlight the impact of exit penalties, price volatility, and contract design. These findings offer insights for market regulators and energy producers in designing effective risk management strategies.</description>

      <title>Global Stabilization for the BBM-KP equations on R2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present results on the energy decay of the BBM-KP equations (I and II) posed on $\R^2$ with localized damping. This model offers an alternative to the KP equations, analogous to how the regularized long-wave equation relates to the classical Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. We show that the energy associated with the Cauchy problem decays exponentially when a localized dissipative mechanism is present in a subdomain. Finally, we validate the theoretical results on the exponential stabilization of solutions to the BBM-KP equations with damping through numerical experiments using a spectral-finite difference scheme.</description>

      <title>Efficient Optimization Algorithms for Linear Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial training can be used to learn models that are robust against perturbations. For linear models, it can be formulated as a convex optimization problem. Compared to methods proposed in the context of deep learning, leveraging the optimization structure allows significantly faster convergence rates. Still, the use of generic convex solvers can be inefficient for large-scale problems. Here, we propose tailored optimization algorithms for the adversarial training of linear models, which render large-scale regression and classification problems more tractable. For regression problems, we propose a family of solvers based on iterative ridge regression and, for classification, a family of solvers based on projected gradient descent. The methods are based on extended variable reformulations of the original problem. We illustrate their efficiency in numerical examples.</description>

      <title>ANaGRAM: A Natural Gradient Relative to Adapted Model for efficient PINNs learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the recent years, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have received strong interest as a method to solve PDE driven systems, in particular for data assimilation purpose. This method is still in its infancy, with many shortcomings and failures that remain not properly understood. In this paper we propose a natural gradient approach to PINNs which contributes to speed-up and improve the accuracy of the training. Based on an in depth analysis of the differential geometric structures of the problem, we come up with two distinct contributions: (i) a new natural gradient algorithm that scales as $\min(P^2S, S^2P)$, where $P$ is the number of parameters, and $S$ the batch size; (ii) a mathematically principled reformulation of the PINNs problem that allows the extension of natural gradient to it, with proved connections to Green's function theory.</description>
