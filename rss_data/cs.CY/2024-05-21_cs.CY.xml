      <title>Gamification of IT for training in information systems management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the integration of IT competitions, in particular Capture The Flag, into an information systems management course to fill skills gaps, particularly in the field of cybersecurity. An educational CTF team has been set up at IAE Paris-Est with the aim of developing students' skills. Workshops, challenges, and events have been organised to familiarise them with the CTFs and offer them support adapted to their level. Preliminary results show the importance of soft skills in improving cybersecurity skills. The CTF pedagogical team is continuing to experiment with and evaluate these methods to improve the accessibility and effectiveness of cybersecurity training.</description>

      <title>Amplifying Academic Research through YouTube: Engagement Metrics as Predictors of Citation Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the interplay between YouTube engagement metrics and the academic impact of cited publications within video descriptions, amid declining trust in traditional journalism and increased reliance on social media for information. By analyzing data from Altmetric.com and YouTube's API, it assesses how YouTube video features relate to citation impact. Initial results suggest that videos citing scientific publications and garnering high engagement-likes, comments, and references to other publications-may function as a filtering mechanism or even as a predictor of impactful research.</description>

      <title>Scientific discourse on YouTube: Motivations for citing research in comments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: YouTube is a valuable source of user-generated content on a wide range of topics, and it encourages user participation through the use of a comment system. Video content is increasingly addressing scientific topics, and there is evidence that both academics and consumers use video descriptions and video comments to refer to academic research and scientific publications. Because commenting is a discursive behavior, this study will provide insights on why individuals post links to research publications in comments. For this, a qualitative content analysis and iterative coding approach were applied. Furthermore, the reasons for mentioning academic publications in comments were contrasted with the reasons for citing in scholarly works and with reasons for commenting on YouTube. We discovered that the primary motives for sharing research links were (1) providing more insights into the topic and (2) challenging information offered by other commentators.</description>

      <title>OpenCarbonEval: A Unified Carbon Emission Estimation Framework in Large-Scale AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, large-scale auto-regressive models have made significant progress in various tasks, such as text or video generation. However, the environmental impact of these models has been largely overlooked, with a lack of assessment and analysis of their carbon footprint. To address this gap, we introduce OpenCarbonEval, a unified framework for integrating large-scale models across diverse modalities to predict carbon emissions, which could provide AI service providers and users with a means to estimate emissions beforehand and help mitigate the environmental pressure associated with these models. In OpenCarbonEval, we propose a dynamic throughput modeling approach that could capture workload and hardware fluctuations in the training process for more precise emissions estimates. Our evaluation results demonstrate that OpenCarbonEval can more accurately predict training emissions than previous methods, and can be seamlessly applied to different modal tasks. Specifically, we show that OpenCarbonEval achieves superior performance in predicting carbon emissions for both visual models and language models. By promoting sustainable AI development and deployment, OpenCarbonEval can help reduce the environmental impact of large-scale models and contribute to a more environmentally responsible future for the AI community.</description>

      <title>Address-Specific Sustainable Accommodation Choice Through Real-World Data Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consumers wish to choose sustainable accommodation for their travels, and in the case of corporations, may be required to do so. Yet accommodation marketplaces provide no meaningful capability for sustainable choice: typically CO2 estimates are provided that are identical for all accommodation of the same type across an entire country. We propose a decision support system that enables real choice of sustainable accommodation. We develop a data-driven address- specific metric called EcoGrade, which integrates government approved datasets and uses interpolation where data is sparse. We validate the metric on 10,000 UK addresses in 10 cities, showing the match of our interpolations to reality is statistically significant. We show how the metric has been embedded into a decision support system for a global accommodation marketplace and tested by real users over several months with positive user feedback. In the EU, forty percent of final energy consumption is from buildings. We need to encourage all building owners to make their accommodation more efficient. The rental sector is one area where change can occur rapidly, as rented accommodation is renovated frequently. We anticipate our decision support system using EcoGrade will encourage this positive change.</description>

      <title>A Principled Approach for a New Bias Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread use of machine learning and data-driven algorithms for decision making has been steadily increasing over many years. The areas in which this is happening are diverse: healthcare, employment, finance, education, the legal system to name a few; and the associated negative side effects are being increasingly harmful for society. Negative data \emph{bias} is one of those, which tends to result in harmful consequences for specific groups of people. Any mitigation strategy or effective policy that addresses the negative consequences of bias must start with awareness that bias exists, together with a way to understand and quantify it. However, there is a lack of consensus on how to measure data bias and oftentimes the intended meaning is context dependent and not uniform within the research community. The main contributions of our work are: (1) a general algorithmic framework for defining and efficiently quantifying the bias level of a dataset with respect to a protected group; and (2) the definition of a new bias measure. Our results are experimentally validated using nine publicly available datasets and theoretically analyzed, which provide novel insights about the problem. Based on our approach, we also derive a bias mitigation algorithm that might be useful to policymakers.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Online Conspiracy Theorists: a Text-Based Approach and Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's digital landscape, the proliferation of conspiracy theories within the disinformation ecosystem of online platforms represents a growing concern. This paper delves into the complexities of this phenomenon. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of two distinct X (formerly known as Twitter) datasets: one comprising users with conspiracy theorizing patterns and another made of users lacking such tendencies and thus serving as a control group. The distinguishing factors between these two groups are explored across three dimensions: emotions, idioms, and linguistic features. Our findings reveal marked differences in the lexicon and language adopted by conspiracy theorists with respect to other users. We developed a machine learning classifier capable of identifying users who propagate conspiracy theories based on a rich set of 871 features. The results demonstrate high accuracy, with an average F1 score of 0.88. Moreover, this paper unveils the most discriminating characteristics that define conspiracy theory propagators.</description>

      <title>Combining Twitter and Mobile Phone Data to Observe Border-Rush: The Turkish-European Border Opening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following Turkey's 2020 decision to revoke border controls, many individuals journeyed towards the Greek, Bulgarian, and Turkish borders. However, the lack of verifiable statistics on irregular migration and discrepancies between media reports and actual migration patterns require further exploration. The objective of this study is to bridge this knowledge gap by harnessing novel data sources, specifically mobile phone and Twitter data, to construct estimators of cross-border mobility and to cultivate a qualitative comprehension of the unfolding events. By employing a migration diplomacy framework, we analyse emergent mobility patterns at the border. Our findings demonstrate the potential of mobile phone data for quantitative metrics and Twitter data for qualitative understanding. We underscore the ethical implications of leveraging Big Data, particularly considering the vulnerability of the population under study. This underscores the imperative for exhaustive research into the socio-political facets of human mobility, with the aim of discerning the potentialities, limitations, and risks inherent in these data sources and their integration. This scholarly endeavour contributes to a more nuanced understanding of migration dynamics and paves the way for the formulation of regulations that preclude misuse and oppressive surveillance, thereby ensuring a more accurate representation of migration realities.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Mitigating Bias in Algorithms Used to Disseminate Information in Social Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social connections are a conduit through which individuals communicate, information propagates, and diseases spread. Identifying individuals that are more likely to adopt ideas or technologies and spread them to others is essential in order to develop effective information campaigns, fight epidemics, and to maximize the reach of limited resources. Consequently a lot of work has focused on identifying sets of influencers. Here we show that seeding information using these influence maximization methods, only benefits connected and central individuals, consistently leaving the most vulnerable behind. Our results highlights troublesome outcomes of influence maximization algorithms: they do not disseminate information in an equitable manner threatening to create an increasingly unequal society. To overcome this issue we devise a simple, multi-objective algorithm, which maximises both influence and information equity. Our work demonstrates how to find fairer influencer sets, highlighting that in our search for maximizing information, we do not need to compromise on information equality.</description>

      <title>Topic Modelling Case Law Using a Large Language Model and a New Taxonomy for UK Law: AI Insights into Summary Judgment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in legal analytics by developing and applying a novel taxonomy for topic modelling summary judgment cases in the United Kingdom. Using a curated dataset of summary judgment cases, we use the Large Language Model Claude 3 Opus to explore functional topics and trends. We find that Claude 3 Opus correctly classified the topic with an accuracy of 87.10%. The analysis reveals distinct patterns in the application of summary judgments across various legal domains. As case law in the United Kingdom is not originally labelled with keywords or a topic filtering option, the findings not only refine our understanding of the thematic underpinnings of summary judgments but also illustrate the potential of combining traditional and AI-driven approaches in legal classification. Therefore, this paper provides a new and general taxonomy for UK law. The implications of this work serve as a foundation for further research and policy discussions in the field of judicial administration and computational legal research methodologies.</description>

      <title>Beyond static AI evaluations: advancing human interaction evaluations for LLM harms and risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model evaluations are central to understanding the safety, risks, and societal impacts of AI systems. While most real-world AI applications involve human-AI interaction, most current evaluations (e.g., common benchmarks) of AI models do not. Instead, they incorporate human factors in limited ways, assessing the safety of models in isolation, thereby falling short of capturing the complexity of human-model interactions. In this paper, we discuss and operationalize a definition of an emerging category of evaluations -- "human interaction evaluations" (HIEs) -- which focus on the assessment of human-model interactions or the process and the outcomes of humans using models. First, we argue that HIEs can be used to increase the validity of safety evaluations, assess direct human impact and interaction-specific harms, and guide future assessments of models' societal impact. Second, we propose a safety-focused HIE design framework -- containing a human-LLM interaction taxonomy -- with three stages: (1) identifying the risk or harm area, (2) characterizing the use context, and (3) choosing the evaluation parameters. Third, we apply our framework to two potential evaluations for overreliance and persuasion risks. Finally, we conclude with tangible recommendations for addressing concerns over costs, replicability, and unrepresentativeness of HIEs.</description>

      <title>AMMeBa: A Large-Scale Survey and Dataset of Media-Based Misinformation In-The-Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prevalence and harms of online misinformation is a perennial concern for internet platforms, institutions and society at large. Over time, information shared online has become more media-heavy and misinformation has readily adapted to these new modalities. The rise of generative AI-based tools, which provide widely-accessible methods for synthesizing realistic audio, images, video and human-like text, have amplified these concerns. Despite intense public interest and significant press coverage, quantitative information on the prevalence and modality of media-based misinformation remains scarce. Here, we present the results of a two-year study using human raters to annotate online media-based misinformation, mostly focusing on images, based on claims assessed in a large sample of publicly-accessible fact checks with the ClaimReview markup. We present an image typology, designed to capture aspects of the image and manipulation relevant to the image's role in the misinformation claim. We visualize the distribution of these types over time. We show the rise of generative AI-based content in misinformation claims, and that its commonality is a relatively recent phenomenon, occurring significantly after heavy press coverage. We also show "simple" methods dominated historically, particularly context manipulations, and continued to hold a majority as of the end of data collection in November 2023. The dataset, Annotated Misinformation, Media-Based (AMMeBa), is publicly-available, and we hope that these data will serve as both a means of evaluating mitigation methods in a realistic setting and as a first-of-its-kind census of the types and modalities of online misinformation.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Fairness Generalization under Covariate and Dependence Shifts Simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The endeavor to preserve the generalization of a fair and invariant classifier across domains, especially in the presence of distribution shifts, becomes a significant and intricate challenge in machine learning. In response to this challenge, numerous effective algorithms have been developed with a focus on addressing the problem of fairness-aware domain generalization. These algorithms are designed to navigate various types of distribution shifts, with a particular emphasis on covariate and dependence shifts. In this context, covariate shift pertains to changes in the marginal distribution of input features, while dependence shift involves alterations in the joint distribution of the label variable and sensitive attributes. In this paper, we introduce a simple but effective approach that aims to learn a fair and invariant classifier by simultaneously addressing both covariate and dependence shifts across domains. We assert the existence of an underlying transformation model can transform data from one domain to another, while preserving the semantics related to non-sensitive attributes and classes. By augmenting various synthetic data domains through the model, we learn a fair and invariant classifier in source domains. This classifier can then be generalized to unknown target domains, maintaining both model prediction and fairness concerns. Extensive empirical studies on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Capabilities of LLMs for Supporting Anticipatory Impact Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaining insight into the potential negative impacts of emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in society is a challenge for implementing anticipatory governance approaches. One approach to produce such insight is to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to support and guide experts in the process of ideating and exploring the range of undesirable consequences of emerging technologies. However, performance evaluations of LLMs for such tasks are still needed, including examining the general quality of generated impacts but also the range of types of impacts produced and resulting biases. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential for generating high-quality and diverse impacts of AI in society by fine-tuning completion models (GPT-3 and Mistral-7B) on a diverse sample of articles from news media and comparing those outputs to the impacts generated by instruction-based (GPT-4 and Mistral-7B-Instruct) models. We examine the generated impacts for coherence, structure, relevance, and plausibility and find that the generated impacts using Mistral-7B, a small open-source model fine-tuned on impacts from the news media, tend to be qualitatively on par with impacts generated using a more capable and larger scale model such as GPT-4. Moreover, we find that impacts produced by instruction-based models had gaps in the production of certain categories of impacts in comparison to fine-tuned models. This research highlights a potential bias in the range of impacts generated by state-of-the-art LLMs and the potential of aligning smaller LLMs on news media as a scalable alternative to generate high quality and more diverse impacts in support of anticipatory governance approaches.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Social Norms in Generative Agent Societies: Principles and Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social norms play a crucial role in guiding agents towards understanding and adhering to standards of behavior, thus reducing social conflicts within multi-agent systems (MASs). However, current LLM-based (or generative) MASs lack the capability to be normative. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture, named CRSEC, to empower the emergence of social norms within generative MASs. Our architecture consists of four modules: Creation &amp; Representation, Spreading, Evaluation, and Compliance. This addresses several important aspects of the emergent processes all in one: (i) where social norms come from, (ii) how they are formally represented, (iii) how they spread through agents' communications and observations, (iv) how they are examined with a sanity check and synthesized in the long term, and (v) how they are incorporated into agents' planning and actions. Our experiments deployed in the Smallville sandbox game environment demonstrate the capability of our architecture to establish social norms and reduce social conflicts within generative MASs. The positive outcomes of our human evaluation, conducted with 30 evaluators, further affirm the effectiveness of our approach. Our project can be accessed via the following link: https://github.com/sxswz213/CRSEC.</description>

Abstract: The proliferation of applications using artificial intelligence (AI) systems has led to a growing number of users interacting with these systems through sophisticated interfaces. Human-computer interaction research has long shown that interfaces shape both user behavior and user perception of technical capabilities and risks. Yet, practitioners and researchers evaluating the social and ethical risks of AI systems tend to overlook the impact of anthropomorphic, deceptive, and immersive interfaces on human-AI interactions. Here, we argue that design features of interfaces with adaptive AI systems can have cascading impacts, driven by feedback loops, which extend beyond those previously considered. We first conduct a scoping review of AI interface designs and their negative impact to extract salient themes of potentially harmful design patterns in AI interfaces. Then, we propose Design-Enhanced Control of AI systems (DECAI), a conceptual model to structure and facilitate impact assessments of AI interface designs. DECAI draws on principles from control systems theory -- a theory for the analysis and design of dynamic physical systems -- to dissect the role of the interface in human-AI systems. Through two case studies on recommendation systems and conversational language model systems, we show how DECAI can be used to evaluate AI interface designs.</description>

      <title>Spatial Models for Crowdsourced Internet Access Network Performance Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11138</link>

Abstract: Despite significant investments in access network infrastructure, universal access to high-quality Internet connectivity remains a challenge. Policymakers often rely on large-scale, crowdsourced measurement datasets to assess the distribution of access network performance across geographic areas. These decisions typically rest on the assumption that Internet performance is uniformly distributed within predefined social boundaries, such as zip codes, census tracts, or community areas. However, this assumption may not be valid for two reasons: (1) crowdsourced measurements often exhibit non-uniform sampling densities within geographic areas; and (2) predefined social boundaries may not align with the actual boundaries of Internet infrastructure.
  In this paper, we model Internet performance as a spatial process. We apply and evaluate a series of statistical techniques to: (1) aggregate Internet performance over a geographic region; (2) overlay interpolated maps with various sampling boundary choices; and (3) spatially cluster boundary units to identify areas with similar performance characteristics. We evaluated the effectiveness of these using a 17-month-long crowdsourced dataset from Ookla Speedtest. We evaluate several leading interpolation methods at varying spatial scales. Further, we examine the similarity between the resulting boundaries for smaller realizations of the dataset. Our findings suggest that our combination of techniques achieves a 56% gain in similarity score over traditional methods that rely on aggregates over raw measurement values for performance summarization. Our work highlights an urgent need for more sophisticated strategies in understanding and addressing Internet access disparities.</description>
