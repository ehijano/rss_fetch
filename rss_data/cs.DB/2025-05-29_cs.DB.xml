      <title>Conformance Checking for Less: Efficient Conformance Checking for Long Event Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long event sequences (termed traces) and large data logs that originate from sensors and prediction models are becoming increasingly common in our data-rich world. In such scenarios, conformance checking-validating a data log against an expected system behavior (the process model) can become computationally infeasible due to the exponential complexity of finding an optimal alignment. To alleviate scalability challenges for this task, we propose ConLES, a sliding-window conformance checking approach for long event sequences that preserves the interpretability of alignment-based methods. ConLES partitions traces into manageable subtraces and iteratively aligns each against the expected behavior, leading to significant reduction of the search space while maintaining overall accuracy. We use global information that captures structural properties of both the trace and the process model, enabling informed alignment decisions and discarding unpromising alignments, even if they appear locally optimal. Performance evaluations across multiple datasets highlight that ConLES outperforms the leading optimal and heuristic algorithms for long traces, consistently achieving the optimal or near-optimal solution. Unlike other conformance methods that struggle with long event sequences, ConLES significantly reduces the search space, scales efficiently, and uniquely supports both predefined and discovered process models, making it a viable and leading option for conformance checking of long event sequences.</description>

      <title>StreamLink: Large-Language-Model Driven Distributed Data Engineering System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in natural language understanding (NLU), opening doors for innovative applications. We introduce StreamLink - an LLM-driven distributed data system designed to improve the efficiency and accessibility of data engineering tasks. We build StreamLink on top of distributed frameworks such as Apache Spark and Hadoop to handle large data at scale. One of the important design philosophies of StreamLink is to respect user data privacy by utilizing local fine-tuned LLMs instead of a public AI service like ChatGPT. With help from domain-adapted LLMs, we can improve our system's understanding of natural language queries from users in various scenarios and simplify the procedure of generating database queries like the Structured Query Language (SQL) for information processing. We also incorporate LLM-based syntax and security checkers to guarantee the reliability and safety of each generated query. StreamLink illustrates the potential of merging generative LLMs with distributed data processing for comprehensive and user-centric data engineering. With this architecture, we allow users to interact with complex database systems at different scales in a user-friendly and security-ensured manner, where the SQL generation reaches over 10\% of execution accuracy compared to baseline methods, and allow users to find the most concerned item from hundreds of millions of items within a few seconds using natural language.</description>

      <title>Query, Don't Train: Privacy-Preserving Tabular Prediction from EHR Data via SQL Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain richly structured, longitudinal data essential for predictive modeling, yet stringent privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) often restrict access to individual-level records. We introduce Query, Don't Train (QDT): a structured-data foundation-model interface enabling tabular inference via LLM-generated SQL over EHRs. Instead of training on or accessing individual-level examples, QDT uses a large language model (LLM) as a schema-aware query planner to generate privacy-compliant SQL queries from a natural language task description and a test-time input. The model then extracts summary-level population statistics through these SQL queries and the LLM performs, chain-of-thought reasoning over the results to make predictions. This inference-time-only approach (1) eliminates the need for supervised model training or direct data access, (2) ensures interpretability through symbolic, auditable queries, (3) naturally handles missing features without imputation or preprocessing, and (4) effectively manages high-dimensional numerical data to enhance analytical capabilities. We validate QDT on the task of 30-day hospital readmission prediction for Type 2 diabetes patients using a MIMIC-style EHR cohort, achieving F1 = 0.70, which outperforms TabPFN (F1 = 0.68). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of LLM-driven, privacy-preserving structured prediction using only schema metadata and aggregate statistics - offering a scalable, interpretable, and regulation-compliant alternative to conventional foundation-model pipelines.</description>

      <title>GXJoin: Generalized Cell Transformations for Explainable Joinability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing real-world entities can vary across different sources, posing a challenge when integrating or exchanging data. We study the problem of joinability under syntactic transformations, where two columns are not equi-joinable but can become equi-joinable after some transformations. Discovering those transformations is a challenge because of the large space of possible candidates, which grows with the input length and the number of rows. Our focus is on the generality of transformations, aiming to make the relevant models applicable across various instances and domains. We explore a few generalization techniques, emphasizing those that yield transformations covering a larger number of rows and are often easier to explain. Through extensive evaluation on two real-world datasets and employing diverse metrics for measuring the coverage and simplicity of the transformations, our approach demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches by generating fewer, simpler and hence more explainable transformations as well as improving the join performance.</description>

      <title>ChatPD: An LLM-driven Paper-Dataset Networking System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific research heavily depends on suitable datasets for method validation, but existing academic platforms with dataset management like PapersWithCode suffer from inefficiencies in their manual workflow. To overcome this bottleneck, we present a system, called ChatPD, that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate dataset information extraction from academic papers and construct a structured paper-dataset network. Our system consists of three key modules: \textit{paper collection}, \textit{dataset information extraction}, and \textit{dataset entity resolution} to construct paper-dataset networks. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Graph Completion and Inference} strategy to map dataset descriptions to their corresponding entities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ChatPD not only outperforms the existing platform PapersWithCode in dataset usage extraction but also achieves about 90\% precision and recall in entity resolution tasks. Moreover, we have deployed ChatPD to continuously extract which datasets are used in papers, and provide a dataset discovery service, such as task-specific dataset queries and similar dataset recommendations. We open source ChatPD and the current paper-dataset network on this [GitHub repository]{https://github.com/ChatPD-web/ChatPD}.</description>

      <title>CSI-Bench: A Large-Scale In-the-Wild Dataset for Multi-task WiFi Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WiFi sensing has emerged as a compelling contactless modality for human activity monitoring by capturing fine-grained variations in Channel State Information (CSI). Its ability to operate continuously and non-intrusively while preserving user privacy makes it particularly suitable for health monitoring. However, existing WiFi sensing systems struggle to generalize in real-world settings, largely due to datasets collected in controlled environments with homogeneous hardware and fragmented, session-based recordings that fail to reflect continuous daily activity.
  We present CSI-Bench, a large-scale, in-the-wild benchmark dataset collected using commercial WiFi edge devices across 26 diverse indoor environments with 35 real users. Spanning over 461 hours of effective data, CSI-Bench captures realistic signal variability under natural conditions. It includes task-specific datasets for fall detection, breathing monitoring, localization, and motion source recognition, as well as a co-labeled multitask dataset with joint annotations for user identity, activity, and proximity. To support the development of robust and generalizable models, CSI-Bench provides standardized evaluation splits and baseline results for both single-task and multi-task learning. CSI-Bench offers a foundation for scalable, privacy-preserving WiFi sensing systems in health and broader human-centric applications.</description>

      <title>ClaimPKG: Enhancing Claim Verification via Pseudo-Subgraph Generation with Lightweight Specialized LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an emerging research challenge in claim verification. While KGs provide structured, semantically rich representations well-suited for reasoning, most existing verification methods rely on unstructured text corpora, limiting their ability to effectively leverage KGs. Additionally, despite possessing strong reasoning abilities, modern LLMs struggle with multi-step modular pipelines and reasoning over KGs without adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose ClaimPKG, an end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates LLM reasoning with structured knowledge from KGs. Specifically, the main idea of ClaimPKG is to employ a lightweight, specialized LLM to represent the input claim as pseudo-subgraphs, guiding a dedicated subgraph retrieval module to identify relevant KG subgraphs. These retrieved subgraphs are then processed by a general-purpose LLM to produce the final verdict and justification. Extensive experiments on the FactKG dataset demonstrate that ClaimPKG achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines in this research field by 9%-12% accuracy points across multiple categories. Furthermore, ClaimPKG exhibits zero-shot generalizability to unstructured datasets such as HoVer and FEVEROUS, effectively combining structured knowledge from KGs with LLM reasoning across various LLM backbones.</description>

      <title>Agent-UniRAG: A Trainable Open-Source LLM Agent Framework for Unified Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for unified retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using the recent emerging large language model (LLM) agent concept. Specifically, Agent LLM, which utilizes LLM as fundamental controllers, has become a promising approach to enable the interpretability of RAG tasks, especially for complex reasoning question-answering systems (e.g., multi-hop queries). Nonetheless, previous works mainly focus on solving RAG systems with either single-hop or multi-hop approaches separately, which limits the application of those approaches to real-world applications. In this study, we propose a trainable agent framework called Agent-UniRAG for unified retrieval-augmented LLM systems, which enhances the effectiveness and interpretability of RAG systems. The main idea is to design an LLM agent framework to solve RAG tasks step-by-step based on the complexity of the inputs, simultaneously including single-hop and multi-hop queries in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we introduce SynAgent-RAG, a synthetic dataset to enable the proposed agent framework for small open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama-3-8B). The results show comparable performances with closed-source and larger open-source LLMs across various RAG benchmarks. Our source code and dataset are publicly available for further exploitation.</description>

      <title>Optimize Cardinality Estimation Model Pretraining by Simplifying the Training Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cardinality estimation is a key aspect of query optimization research, and its performance has significantly improved with the integration of machine learning. To overcome the "cold start" problem or the lack of model transferability in learned cardinality estimators, some pre-training cardinality estimation models have been proposed that use learning across multiple datasets and corresponding workloads. These models typically train on a dataset created by uniformly sampling from many datasets, but this approach may not be optimal. By applying the Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (Group DRO) algorithm to training datasets, we find that some specific training datasets contribute more significantly to model performance than others. Based on this observation, we conduct extensive experiments to delve deeper into pre-training cardinality estimators. Our results show how the performance of these models can be influenced by the datasets and corresponding workloads. Finally, we introduce a simplified training dataset, which has been reduced to a fraction of the size of existing pretraining datasets. Sufficient experimental results demonstrate that the pre-trained cardinality estimator based on this simplified dataset can still achieve comparable performance to existing models in zero-shot setups.</description>

      <title>VIDEX: A Disaggregated and Extensible Virtual Index for the Cloud and AI Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtual index, also known as hypothetical indexes, play a crucial role in database query optimization. However, with the rapid advancement of cloud computing and AI-driven models for database optimization, traditional virtual index approaches face significant challenges. Cloud-native environments often prohibit direct conducting query optimization process on production databases due to stability requirements and data privacy concerns. Moreover, while AI models show promising progress, their integration with database systems poses challenges in system complexity, inference acceleration, and model hot updates. In this paper, we present VIDEX, a three-layer disaggregated architecture that decouples database instances, the virtual index optimizer, and algorithm services, providing standardized interfaces for AI model integration. Users can configure VIDEX by either collecting production statistics or by loading from a prepared file; this setup allows for high-accurate what-if analyses based on virtual indexes, achieving query plans that are identical to those of the production instance. Additionally, users can freely integrate new AI-driven algorithms into VIDEX. VIDEX has been successfully deployed at ByteDance, serving thousands of MySQL instances daily and over millions of SQL queries for index optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>Pruning in Snowflake: Working Smarter, Not Harder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern cloud-based data analytics systems must efficiently process petabytes of data residing on cloud storage. A key optimization technique in state-of-the-art systems like Snowflake is partition pruning - skipping chunks of data that do not contain relevant information for computing query results.
  While partition pruning based on query predicates is a well-established technique, we present new pruning techniques that extend the scope of partition pruning to LIMIT, top-k, and JOIN operations, significantly expanding the opportunities for pruning across diverse query types. We detail the implementation of each method and examine their impact on real-world workloads.
  Our analysis of Snowflake's production workloads reveals that real-world analytical queries exhibit much higher selectivity than commonly assumed, yielding effective partition pruning and highlighting the need for more realistic benchmarks. We show that we can harness high selectivity by utilizing min/max metadata available in modern data analytics systems and data lake formats like Apache Iceberg, reducing the number of processed micro-partitions by 99.4% across the Snowflake data platform.</description>

      <title>Federated Continual Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Managing evolving graph data presents substantial challenges in storage and privacy, and training graph neural networks (GNNs) on such data often leads to catastrophic forgetting, impairing performance on earlier tasks. Despite existing continual graph learning (CGL) methods mitigating this to some extent, they rely on centralized architectures and ignore the potential of distributed graph databases to leverage collective intelligence. To this end, we propose Federated Continual Graph Learning (FCGL) to adapt GNNs across multiple evolving graphs under storage and privacy constraints. Our empirical study highlights two core challenges: local graph forgetting (LGF), where clients lose prior knowledge when adapting to new tasks, and global expertise conflict (GEC), where the global GNN exhibits sub-optimal performance in both adapting to new tasks and retaining old ones, arising from inconsistent client expertise during server-side parameter aggregation. To address these, we introduce POWER, a framework that preserves experience nodes with maximum local-global coverage locally to mitigate LGF, and leverages pseudo-prototype reconstruction with trajectory-aware knowledge transfer to resolve GEC. Experiments on various graph datasets demonstrate POWER's superiority over federated adaptations of CGL baselines and vision-centric federated continual learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Something's Fishy In The Data Lake: A Critical Re-evaluation of Table Union Search Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent table representation learning and data discovery methods tackle table union search (TUS) within data lakes, which involves identifying tables that can be unioned with a given query table to enrich its content. These methods are commonly evaluated using benchmarks that aim to assess semantic understanding in real-world TUS tasks. However, our analysis of prominent TUS benchmarks reveals several limitations that allow simple baselines to perform surprisingly well, often outperforming more sophisticated approaches. This suggests that current benchmark scores are heavily influenced by dataset-specific characteristics and fail to effectively isolate the gains from semantic understanding. To address this, we propose essential criteria for future benchmarks to enable a more realistic and reliable evaluation of progress in semantic table union search.</description>
