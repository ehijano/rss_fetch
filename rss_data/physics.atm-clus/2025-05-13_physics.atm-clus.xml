      <title>Extreme Loss Suppression and Wide Tunability of Dipolar Interactions in an Ultracold Molecular Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold dipolar molecules hold great promise for the creation of novel quantum states of matter, but the realization of long-lived molecular bulk samples with strong dipole-dipole interactions has remained elusive. Here, we realize a collisionally stable gas of ultracold ground state molecules with a lifetime of several seconds. Utilizing double microwave dressing, we achieve an extreme suppression of inelastic two- and three-body losses by factors of more than 10,000 and 1,000, respectively. We find that losses remain suppressed across a wide range of dipole-dipole interactions, allowing the continuous tuning of the dipolar length from 0 to 1 um $\sim$ 20,000 $a_0$. Combined with the recent realization of Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules, our findings open the door to the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum liquids.</description>

      <title>Photoelectron circular dichroism of a chiral molecule induced by resonant interatomic Coulombic decay from an antenna atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a nonchiral atom can act as an antenna to induce a photoelectron circular dichroism in a nearby chiral molecule in a three-step process: The donor atom (antenna) is initially resonantly excited by circularly polarized radiation. It then transfers its excess energy to the acceptor molecule by means of resonant interatomic Coulombic decay. The latter finally absorbs the energy and emits an electron which exhibits the aforementioned circular dichroism in its angular distribution. We study the process on the basis of the retarded dipole--dipole interaction and report an asymptotic analytic expression for the distance-dependent chiral asymmetry of the photoelectron as induced by resonant interatomic Coulombic decay for random line-of-sight and acceptor orientations. In the nonretarded limit, the predicted chiral asymmetry is reversed as compared to that of a direct photoelectron circular dichroism of the molecule.</description>
