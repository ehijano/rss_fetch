      <title>Multilayer networks characterize human-mobility patterns by industry sector for the 2021 Texas winter storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding human mobility during disastrous events is crucial for emergency planning and disaster management. Here, we develop a methodology involving the construction of time-varying, multilayer networks in which edges encode observed movements between spatial regions (census tracts) and network layers encode different movement categories according to industry sectors (e.g., visitations to schools, hospitals, and grocery stores). This approach provides a rich characterization of human mobility, thereby complementing studies examining the risk-aversion activities of evacuation and sheltering in place. Focusing on the 2021 Texas winter storm as a case study which led to many casualties, we find that people largely reduced their movements to ambulatory healthcare services, restaurants, and schools, but prioritized movements to grocery stores and gas stations. Additionally, we study the predictability of nodes' in- and out-degrees in the multilayer networks, which encode movements into and out of census tracts. We find that inward movements are harder to predict than outward movements, and even more so during this winter storm. Our findings about the reduction, prioritization, and predictability of sector-specific human movements could inform mobility-related decisions arising from future extreme weather events.</description>

      <title>Strategic Analysis of Dissent and Self-Censorship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expressions of dissent against authority are an important feature of most societies, and efforts to suppress such expressions are common. Modern digital communications, social media, and Internet surveillance and censorship technologies are changing the landscape of public speech and dissent. Especially in authoritarian settings, individuals must assess the risk of voicing their true opinions or choose self-censorship, voluntarily moderating their behavior to comply with authority. We present a model in which individuals strategically manage the tradeoff between expressing dissent and avoiding punishment through self-censorship while an authority adapts its policies to minimize both total expressed dissent and punishment costs. We study the model analytically and in simulation to derive conditions separating defiant individuals who express their desired dissent in spite of punishment from self-censoring individuals who fully or partially limit their expression. We find that for any population, there exists an authority policy that leads to total self-censorship. However, the probability and time for an initially moderate, locally-adaptive authority to suppress dissent depend critically on the population's willingness to withstand punishment early on, which can deter the authority from adopting more extreme policies.</description>

      <title>Mediation, splitting and shellability in political structures modeled by simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling political structures by simplicial complexes, we investigate whether introducing a mediator into a substructure increases or decreases the stability of the overall structure. We prove theorems that quantify the stability of a political structure when $n$ mediators are introduced, either one by one or simultaneously. We also examine how the stability is affected when a single agent is split into two. In addition, stability is expressed in terms of the $h$-vector, and special attention is given to a class of political structures modeled by shellable simplicial complexes. In the latter context, we analyze weighted political structures and examples of political structures modeled by independence complexes of graphs.</description>

      <title>Coping with the Dunkelflaute: Power system implications of variable renewable energy droughts in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17683v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coping with prolonged periods of low availability of wind and solar power, also referred to as renewable energy droughts or "Dunkelflaute", emerges as a key challenge for realizing decarbonized energy systems based on renewable energy sources. Here we investigate the role of long-duration electricity storage and geographical balancing in dealing with such events, combining a time series analysis of renewable availability with power sector modeling of 35 historical weather years. We find that extreme droughts define long-duration storage operation and investment. Assuming policy-relevant interconnection, we find 351 TWh long-duration storage capacity or 7% of yearly electricity demand optimal to deal with the most extreme event in Europe. While nuclear power can partially reduce storage needs, the storage-mitigating effect of fossil backup plants in combination with carbon removal is limited. Policymakers and system planners should prepare for a rapid expansion of long-duration storage to safeguard the renewable energy transition in Europe.</description>

      <title>Increasing competitiveness by imbalanced groups: The example of the 48-team FIFA World Cup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A match played in a sports tournament can be called stakeless if at least one team is indifferent to its outcome because it already has qualified or has been eliminated. Such a game threatens fairness since teams may not exert full effort without incentives. This paper suggests a novel classification for stakeless matches based on their expected outcome: they are more costly if the indifferent team is more likely to win by playing honestly. Our approach is illustrated with the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the first edition of the competition with 48 teams. We propose a novel format based on imbalanced groups, which substantially reduces the probability of stakeless matches played by the strongest teams according to Monte Carlo simulations. The new design also increases the uncertainty of match outcomes and requires fewer matches. Governing bodies in sports are encouraged to consider our innovative idea in order to enhance the competitiveness of their tournaments.</description>
