      <title>Mass determination of two Jupiter-sized planets orbiting slightly evolved stars: TOI-2420 b and TOI-2485 b</title>

Abstract: Hot and warm Jupiters might have undergone the same formation and evolution path, but the two populations exhibit different distributions of orbital parameters, challenging our understanding on their actual origin. The present work, which is the results of our warm Jupiters survey carried out with the CHIRON spectrograph within the KESPRINT collaboration, aims to address this challenge by studying two planets that could help bridge the gap between the two populations. We report the confirmation and mass determination of a hot Jupiter (orbital period shorter than 10 days), TOI-2420\,b, and a warm Jupiter, TOI-2485\,b. We performed a joint analysis using a wide variety of spectral and photometric data in order to characterize these planetary systems. We found that TOI-2420\,b has an orbital period of P$_{\rm b}$=5.8 days, a mass of M$_{\rm b}$=0.9 M$_{\rm J}$ and a radius of R$_{\rm b}$=1.3 R$_{\rm J}$, with a planetary density of 0.477 \gc; while TOI-2485\,b has an orbital period of P$_{\rm b}$=11.2 days, a mass of M$_{\rm b}$=2.4 M$_{\rm J}$ and a radius of R$_{\rm b}$=1.1 R$_{\rm J}$ with density 2.36 \gc. With current parameters, the migration history for TOI-2420\,b and TOI-2485\,b is unclear: the high-eccentricity migration scenarios cannot be ruled out, and TOI-2485\,b's characteristics may rather support this scenario.</description>

      <title>Climate Regimes Across the Habitable Zone: a Comparison of Synchronous Rocky M- and K-dwarf Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M- and K-dwarf stars make up 86% of the stellar population and host many promising astronomical targets for detecting habitable climates in the near future. Of the two, M dwarfs currently offer greater observational advantages and are home to many of the most exciting observational discoveries in the last decade. But K dwarfs could offer even better prospects for detecting habitability by combining the advantage of a relatively dim stellar flux with a more stable stellar environment. Here we explore the climate regimes that are possible on Earth-like synchronous planets in M- and K-dwarf systems, and how they vary across the habitable zone. We focus on surface temperature patterns, water availability, and implications for habitability. We find that the risk of nightside cold-trapping decreases with increased orbital radius and is overall lower for K-dwarf planets. With reduced atmospheric shortwave absorption, K-dwarf planets have higher dayside precipitation rates and less day-to-night moisture transport, resulting in lower nightside snow rates. These results imply a higher likelihood of detecting a planet with a moist dayside climate in a habitable "eyeball" climate regime orbiting a K-dwarf star. We also show that "terminator habitability" can occur for both M- and K-dwarf land planets, but would likely be more prevalent in M-dwarf systems. Planets in a terminator habitability regime tend to have slightly lower fractional habitability, but offer alternative advantages including instellation rates more comparable to Earth in regions that have temperatures amenable to life.</description>

      <title>Comparison of uncertainty propagation techniques in small-body environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close-proximity exploration of small celestial bodies is crucial for the comprehensive and accurate characterization of their properties. However, the complex and uncertain dynamical environment around them contributes to a rapid dispersion of uncertainty and the emergence of non-Gaussian distributions. Therefore, to ensure safe operations, a precise understanding of uncertainty propagation becomes imperative. In this work, the dynamical environment is analyzed around two asteroids, Apophis, which will perform a close flyby to Earth in 2029, and Eros, which has been already explored by past missions. The performance of different uncertainty propagation methods (Linear Covariance Propagation, Unscented Transformation, and Polynomial Chaos Expansion) are compared in various scenarios of close-proximity operations around the two asteroids. Findings are discussed in terms of propagation accuracy and computational efficiency depending on the dynamical environment. By exploring these methodologies, this work contributes to the broader goal of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of spacecraft operations during close-proximity exploration of small celestial bodies.</description>

      <title>Pebble-driven migration of low-mass planets in the 2D regime of pebble accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: &lt;Context&gt; Pebbles drifting past a disk-embedded low-mass planet develop asymmetries in their distribution and exert a substantial gravitational torque on the planet, thus modifying its migration rate. &lt;Aims&gt; Our aim is to assess how the distribution of pebbles and the resulting torque change in the presence of pebble accretion, focusing on its 2D regime. &lt;Methods&gt; First, we performed 2D high-resolution multi-fluid simulations with Fargo3D but found that they are impractical for resolving pebble accretion due to the smoothing of the planetary gravitational potential. To remove the smoothing and directly trace pebbles accreted by the planet, we developed a new code, Deneb, which evolves an ensemble of pebbles, represented by Lagrangian superparticles, in a steady-state gaseous background. &lt;Results&gt; For small and moderate Stokes numbers, St $\lesssim 0.1$, pebble accretion creates two underdense regions with a front-rear asymmetry with respect to the planet. The underdensity trailing the planet is more extended. The resulting excess of pebble mass in front of the planet then makes the pebble torque positive and capable of outperforming the negative gas torque. Pebble accretion thus enables outward migration (previously thought to occur mainly for St $\gtrsim 0.1$) in a larger portion of the parameter space. It occurs for the planet mass $M_{pl}\lesssim3\,M_{\oplus}$ and for all the Stokes numbers considered in our study, St $\in$ [$10^{-2}, 0.785$], assuming a pebble-to-gas mass ratio of $Z = 0.01$. &lt;Conclusions&gt; If some of the observed planets underwent outward pebble-driven migration during their accretion, the formation sites of their progenitor embryos could have differed greatly from the usual predictions of planet formation models. To enable an update of the respective models, we provide a scaling law for the pebble torque that can be readily incorporated in N-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the dust and gas contributions of the JWST/MIRI spectrum of Sz28</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent spectra of protoplanetary disks around very low-mass stars (VLMS), captured by the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), reveal a rich carbon chemistry. Current interpretations of these spectra are based on 0D slab models and provide valuable estimates for molecular emission temperatures and column densities in the innermost disk. However, the established fitting procedures and simplified models are challenged by the many overlapping gas features. We aim to simultaneously determine the molecular and the dust composition of the disk around the VLMS Sz28 in a Bayesian way. We model the JWST/MIRI spectrum of Sz28 up to $17\,\rm \mu m$ using the Dust Continuum Kit with Line emission from Gas (DuCKLinG). Systematically excluding different molecules from the Bayesian analysis allows for an evidence determination of all investigated molecules and isotopologues. We continue by examining the emission conditions and locations of all molecules, analysing the differences to previous 0D slab fitting, and analysing the dust composition. We find very strong Bayesian evidence for the presence of C2H2, HCN, C6H6, CO2, HC3N, C2H6, C3H4, C4H2, and CH4 in the JWST/MIRI spectrum of Sz28. Additionally, we identify CH3 and find tentative indications for NH3. There is no evidence for water in the spectrum. However, we show that column densities of up to $2\times10^{17}\,\rm cm^{-2}$ could be hidden in the observational noise if assuming similar emission conditions of water as the detected hydrocarbons. Contrary to previous 0D slab results, a C4H2 quasi-continuum is robustly identified. We expect some of the stated differences to previous 0D slab fitting results to arise from an updated data reduction of the spectrum, but also due to the different modelling process. The latter reason underpins the need for more advanced models and fitting procedures.</description>

      <title>Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES). II. An Observation Strategy for the Target Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) constitutes a mission intricately designed to systematically survey approximately 100 solar-type stars located within the immediate proximity of the solar system, specifically within a range of 10 parsecs. The core objective of this mission is the detection and characterization of potentially habitable Earth-like planets or super-Earths within the habitable zone of these stars. The CHES mission obtains high-precision astrometric measurements of planets orbiting the target stars by observing angular distance variations between the target star and reference stars. As a result, we surveyed the relevant parameters of both target and reference stars in detail, conducting a thorough analysis and calculation of the required observation accuracy, the number of observations, and the priority assigned to each target star. Observational emphasis will be concentrated on targets considered of higher priority, ensuring the effectiveness of their observation capabilities. Through this approach, we formulate a five-year observation strategy that will cover all the target stars within a six-month timeframe. The strategy not only fulfills the required observing capability but also exhibit high efficiency simultaneously, providing an executable program for future mission. Over the span of the mission's five-year duration, a cumulative observation time of 29,220 hours will be available. Approximately 86 percent of this, totaling 25,120 hours, is allocated for the observation of target stars. This allocation leaves approximately 4,100 hours for extended scientific observation programs. We have also performed simulated observations based on this strategy and verified its observational capability for exoplanets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As humankind prepares to establish outposts and infrastructure on the Moon, the ability to manufacture parts and buildings on-site is crucial. While transporting raw materials from Earth can be costly and time-consuming, in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) presents an attractive alternative. This review paper aims to provide a thorough examination of the current state and future potential of Lunar-based manufacturing and construction (LBMC), with a particular focus on the prospect of utilizing in-situ resources and additive manufacturing. The paper analyzes existing research on LBMC from various perspectives, including different manufacturing techniques and compositions, the potential of ISRU for LBMC, characterization of built parts and structures, the role of energy sources and efficiency, the impact of low-gravity and vacuum conditions, and the feasibility of using artificial intelligence, automation, and robotics. By synthesizing these findings, this review offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for LBMC.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field, magnetospheric accretion and candidate planet of the young star GM Aurigae observed with SPIRou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyses spectropolarimetric observations of the classical T Tauri star (CTTS) GM Aurigae collected with SPIRou, the near-infrared spectropolarimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, as part of the SLS and SPICE Large Programs. We report for the first time results on the large-scale magnetic field at the surface of GM Aur using Zeeman Doppler imaging. Its large-scale magnetic field energy is almost entirely stored in an axisymmetric poloidal field, which places GM Aur close to other CTTSs with similar internal structures. A dipole of about 730 G dominates the large-scale field topology, while higher-order harmonics account for less than 30 per-cent of the total magnetic energy. Overall, we find that the main difference between our three reconstructed maps (corresponding to sequential epochs) comes from the evolving tilt of the magnetic dipole, likely generated by non-stationary dynamo processes operating in this largely convective star rotating with a period of about 6 d. Finally, we report a 5.5$\sigma$ detection of a signal in the activity-filtered radial velocity data of semi-amplitude 110 $\pm$ 20 m/s at a period of 8.745 $\pm$ 0.009 d. If attributed to a close-in planet in the inner accretion disc of GM Aur, it would imply that this planet candidate has a minimum mass of 1.10 $\pm$ 0.30 Mjup and orbits at a distance of 0.082 $\pm$ 0.002 au.</description>

      <title>On the Peril of Inferring Phytoplankton Properties from Remote-Sensing Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since 1978, sensors on remote-sensing satellites have provided global, multi-band images at optical wavelengths to assess ocean color. In parallel, sophisticated radiative transfer models account for attenuation and emission by the Earth's atmosphere and ocean, thereby estimating the water-leaving radiance or and remote-sensing reflectance Rrs. From these Rrs measurements, estimates of the absorption and scattering by seawater are inferred. We emphasize an inherent, physical degeneracy in the radiative transfer equation that relates Rrs to the absorption and backscattering coefficients a and b_b, aka inherent optical properties (IOPs). Because Rrs depends solely on the ratio of b_b to a, meaning one cannot retrieve independent functions for the non-water IOPs, a_nw and b_bnw, without a priori knowledge. Moreover, water generally dominates scattering at blue wavelengths and absorption at red wavelengths, further limiting retrievals of IOPs in the presence of noise. We demonstrate that all previous and current multi-spectral satellite observations lack the statistical power to measure more than 3 parameters total to describe a_nw and b_bnw. Due to the ubiquitous exponential-like absorption by color dissolved organic matter at short wavelengths (l&lt;500nm), multi-spectral Rrs do not permit the detection of phytoplankton absorption a_ph without very strict priors. Furthermore, such priors lead to biased and uncertain retrievals of a_ph. Hyperspectral observations may recover a 4th and possibly 5th parameter describing only one or two aspects of the complexity of a_ph. These results cast doubt on decades of literature on IOP retrievals, including estimates of phytoplankton growth and biomass. We further conclude that NASA/PACE will greatly enhance our ability to measure the phytoplankton biomass of Earth, but challenges remain in resolving the IOPs.</description>

      <title>On the potential origin of the circumbinary planet Delorme 1 (AB)b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many circumbinary gas giant planets have been recently discovered. The formation mechanism of circumbinary planets on wide orbits is unclear. We investigate the formation of Delorme 1 (AB)b, a 13$\pm$5M$_{\rm J}$ planet, orbiting its host binary at 84AU. The planet is accreting while having an estimated age of 40Myr, which is unexpected, as this process should have ceased due to the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc. Using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code SEREN, we model three formation scenarios for this planet. In Scenario I the planet forms in-situ on a wide orbit in a massive disc (by gravitational instability), in Scenario II closer to the binary in a massive disc (by gravitational instability), and in Scenario III much closer to the binary in a less massive disc (by core accretion). Planets in Scenario I stay at the observed separation, have mass accretion rates consistent with observed value, but their final mass is too high. In Scenario II, the planet reaches the observed separation through outward migration or scattering by the binary, and has mass accretion rate comparable to the observed; however, the planet mass is above the observed value. In Scenario III, the planet's final mass and mass accretion rate are comparable to the observed ones but the planet's separation is smaller. We conclude that all models may explain some features of the observations but not all of them, raising questions about how gas is accreted onto the planet from its circumplanetary disc, and of the presumed age of the system.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All. X. ALMA and JWST detection of neutral carbon in the externally irradiated disk d203-506: Undepleted gas-phase carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gas-phase abundance of carbon, x_C = C/H, and its depletion factors are essential parameters for understanding the gas and solid compositions that are ultimately incorporated into planets. The majority of protoplanetary disks are born in clusters and, as a result, are exposed to external FUV radiation. These FUV photons potentially affect the disk's evolution, chemical composition, and line excitation. We present the first detection of the [CI]609um fine-structure line of neutral carbon (CI), achieved with ALMA, toward one of these disks, d203-506, in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We also report the detection of CI forbidden and permitted lines (from electronically excited states up to 10 eV) observed with JWST in the IR. These lines trace the irradiated outer disk and photo-evaporative wind. Contrary to the common belief that these IR lines are C+ recombination lines, we find that they are dominated by FUV-pumping of CI followed by fluorescence cascades. They trace the transition from atomic to molecular gas, and their intensities scale with G0. The lack of outstanding IR OI fluorescent emission, however, implies a sharper attenuation of external FUV radiation with E &gt; 12 eV (~Lyman-beta). This is related to a lower effective FUV dust absorption cross section compared to that of interstellar grains, implying a more prominent role for FUV shielding by the CI photoionization continuum. The [CI]609um intensity is proportional to N(CI) and can be used to infer x_C. We derive x_C ~ 1.4E-4. This implies that there is no major depletion of volatile carbon compared to x_C measured in the natal cloud, hinting at a young disk. We also show that external FUV radiation impacts the outer disk and wind by vertically shifting the water freeze-out depth, which results in less efficient grain growth and settling. This shift leads to nearly solar gas-phase C/O abundance ratios in these irradiated layers.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Kunimoto et al. claimed that a short-lived signal in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Sector 61 database was possibly caused by a microlensing event with a terrestrial-mass free-floating planet (FFP) lens. In this study, we investigate TESS's ability to detect microlensing FFPs by considering the detailed source information (e.g., distance and radius), the TESS photometric accuracy, and finite-source effects. Using the FFP mass function from microlensing surveys toward the Galactic bulge, we find that only $0.0018$ microlensing events are expected to be detected in TESS Sector 61 for the entire planetary mass range. The reported signal is unlikely to be a real microlensing event, which is consistent with the evidence from the long-term OGLE data that the signal was likely due to a stellar flare. By extrapolating our result to fainter stars until $T = 16$ mag and adopting a possible optimized search algorithm, we find that only $\sim 1$ FFP events can be detected in the entire TESS mission within the first 7 years. Significant improvments of our understanding of FFPs still requires future satellite missions, such as Roman and Earth 2.0, which can detect thousands of FFPs.</description>

Abstract: The 2050 14C yBP caldera-forming eruption of Okmok volcano, Alaska, had a global atmospheric impact. The associated global climate cooling was driven by the amount of sulfur injected into the stratosphere during the climactic phase of the eruption. This phase was dominated by pyroclastic density currents, which have complex emplacement dynamics precluding direct estimates of the sulfur stratospheric load. We simulated the dynamics of the climactic phase with the two-phase flow model MFIX-TFM under axisymmetric conditions with several combinations of mass eruption rate, jet water content, vent size, particle size and density, topography, and emission duration. Results suggest that a steady mass eruption rate of 1.2-3.9e11 kg/s is consistent with field observations. Minimal stratospheric injections occur during emission as most of the volcanic gas is injected into the stratosphere by the buoyant liftoff of dilute parts of the currents at the end of the eruption. Overall, 58-64 wt percent of the total amount of gas emitted reaches the stratosphere. Combined with petrological estimates of the degassed S, our results suggest that the eruption injected 11 to 20 Tg S into the stratosphere, consistent with the subsequent climate response and Greenland ice sheet deposition. Our results also show that the combination of the source Richardson number and the mass eruption rate is able to characterize the buoyant-collapse transition at Okmok. We extended this result to 141 runs from 10 published numerical studies of eruptive jets and found that this regime diagram is able to capture the first-order layout of the buoyant-collapse transition in all studies except one. An existing multivariate criterion yields the best predictions of this regime transition.</description>
