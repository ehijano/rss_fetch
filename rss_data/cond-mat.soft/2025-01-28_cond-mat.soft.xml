      <title>Sensitive particle shape dependence of growth-induced mesoscale nematic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directed growth, anisotropic cell shapes, and confinement drive self-organization in multicellular systems. We investigate the influence of particle shape on the distribution and dynamics of nematic microdomains in a minimal in-silico model of proliferating, sterically interacting particles, akin to colonies of rod-shaped bacteria. By introducing continuously tuneable tip variations around a common rod shape with spherical caps, we find that subtle changes significantly impact the emergent dynamics, leading to distinct patterns of microdomain formation and stability. Our analysis reveals separate effects of particle shape and aspect ratio, as well as a transition from exponential to scale-free size distributions, which we recapitulate using an effective master equation model. This allows us to relate differences in microdomain size distributions to different physical mechanisms of microdomain breakup. Our results thereby contribute to the characterization of the effective dynamics in growing aggregates at large and intermediate length scales and the microscopic properties that control it. This could be relevant both for biological self-organization and design strategies for future artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal interactions drive emergent chiral crystallites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a new type of 2D active material that exhibits macroscopic phases with two emergent broken symmetries: self-propelled achiral particles that form dense hexatic clusters, which spontaneously rotate. We experimentally realise active colloids that self-organise into both polar and hexatic crystallites, exhibiting exotic emergent phenomena. This is accompanied by a field theory of coupled order parameters formulated on symmetry principles, including non-reciprocity, to capture the non-equilibrium dynamics. We find that the presence of two interacting broken symmetry fields leads to the emergence of novel chiral phases built from (2D) achiral active colloids (here Quincke rollers). These phases are characterised by the presence of both clockwise and counterclockwise rotating clusters. We thus show that spontaneous rotation can emerge in non-equilibrium systems, even when the building blocks are achiral, due to non-reciprocally coupled broken symmetries. This interplay leads to self-organized stirring through counter-rotating vortices in confined colloidal systems, with cluster size controlled by external electric fields.</description>

      <title>Binary random packing fraction of hyperspheres with small or large size difference: a geometric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16005v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random packing fraction of binary particles in D-dimensional Euclidean space R^D is studied using a geometric approach. First, the binary packing fraction of assemblies with small size difference are studied, using the excluded volume model by Onsager for particles in three-dimensional space (D = 3). According to this model the packing increase by bidispersity is proportional to (1 - f)(u^D - 1)^2, with f as monosized packing fraction, u as size ratio and D as space dimension. The model predictions are compared with computational results for disks in two dimensions (D = 2) and hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit (D to infinity), yielding good agreement. Subsequently, the packing of hyperspheres with large size difference is modeled, employing the classic theory of Furnas. This theory, developed for three dimensions, starts from an infinite size ratio of larger and smaller particles (u to infinity). Here, the pertaining equations are applied to hyperspheres, and successfully compared with computational results for hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit. Furthermore, an asymptotic approximation of the binary packing fraction for large size ratio is derived, which shows that the first order variation of the Furnas packing fraction (u^-1 = 0) is proportional to (2 - f)u^-1. Finally, a scaled D-dimensional binary packing graph is presented, governing a simplified phase diagram that borders the binary random packing fraction of amorphous assemblies. To summarize, basic space-filling and geometric (a-thermal) theories on simple hard spheres appear to be a valuable tool for the study of hyperspheres packing and amorphization.</description>

      <title>Self-propelled particles undergoing cyclic transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclic transitions between active and passive states are central to many natural and synthetic systems, ranging from light-driven active particles to animal migrations. Here, we investigate a minimal model of self-propelled Brownian particles undergoing cyclic transitions across three spatial zones: gain, loss, and neutral regions. Particles become active in the gain region, passive in the loss region, and retain their state in the neutral region. By analyzing the steady-state behavior as a function of particle number and the size of the loss region, we identify a threshold particle number, below and above which distinct structural changes are observed. Interestingly, below this threshold, increasing the particle number reduces the state-switching time (the time required for a particle to transition from active to passive and back to active). In contrast, above the threshold, further increases in particle number result in longer switching times. In the subthreshold regime, our analytical model predicts structural characteristics and switching dynamics that align well with simulations. Above the threshold, we observe an emergent spatial clustering, with particles transitioning from passive to active states in close proximity. These findings provide insights into the collective dynamics of cyclic processes between active and passive states across distinct spatial zones in active matter systems.</description>

      <title>The hidden architecture of equilibrium self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments have reached a monumental capacity for designing and synthesizing microscopic particles for self-assembly, making it possible to precisely control particle concentrations, shapes, and interactions. However, we lack a comprehensive inverse-design framework for tuning these particle-level attributes to obtain desired system-level assembly outcomes, like the yield of a user-specified target structure. This severely limits our ability to take full advantage of this vast design space to assemble nanomaterials with complex structure and function. Here we show that a hidden mathematical architecture controls equilibrium assembly outcomes and provides a single comprehensive view of the entire design space. This architecture predicts which structures can be assembled at high yield and reveals constraints that govern the coexistence of structures, which we verify through detailed, quantitative assembly experiments of nanoscale particles synthesized using DNA origami. Strong experimental agreement confirms the importance of this underlying architecture and motivates its use as a predictive tool for the rational design of self-assembly. These results uncover a universal core logic underpinning all equilibrium self-assembly that forms the basis for a robust inverse-design framework, applicable to a wide array of systems from biological protein complexes to synthetic nanomachines.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the phonon theory of liquid heat capacity: low-frequency shear modes and intramolecular vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the heat capacity of liquids present fundamental difficulties due to the strong intermolecular particle interactions and large diffusive-like displacements. Based on the experimental evidence that the microscopic dynamics of liquids closely resemble those of solids, a phonon theory of liquid thermodynamics has been developed. Despite its success, the phonon theory of liquids relies on the questionable assumption that low-frequency shear excitations are propagating in nature and follow a Debye density of states. Furthermore, the same framework does not capture the contribution of intramolecular vibrations, which play a significant role in molecular liquids. In this work, we revisit the phonon theory of liquid heat capacity, introducing alternative approaches to model low-frequency shear modes. In particular, we consider the recently proposed idea of treating such modes as pure kinetic and we propose a novel approach based on identifying those low-frequency excitations as overdamped liquid-like modes with linear in frequency density of states. Moreover, we complete the theory by incorporating the effects of intramolecular vibrations. By comparing the theoretical predictions from these different approaches with the available data for the heat capacity of several liquids, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the original model and the newly proposed extensions. Despite all approaches perform well at low-temperatures, our results indicate that modeling low-frequency modes as overdamped liquid-like excitations yields the most accurate agreement with the data in the whole temperature range. Conversely, we demonstrate that treating these excitations as purely gas-like leads to significant inaccuracies, particularly at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>The droplet size distribution and its dynamics in chemically active emulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamic theory for the droplet size distribution in chemically active emulsions, considering a simple ternary mixture with a conserved density. We show that the collective behavior of many droplets, such as monodispersity, emerges through a coupling of the conserved density in the far field. Using our theory, we determine the stationary state of such emulsions and characterize the relaxation of the droplet size distributions at late times. A key finding is a universal scaling behavior, leading to the collapse of the rescaled size distributions at late times. Our results suggest that the key features of our dynamic theory are generic and apply to the broader class of multi-component systems with conservation laws and active chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Probing Glass Formation in Perylene Derivatives via Atomic Scale Simulations and Bayesian Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the structural dynamics of chromophores are of interest for a range of applications, it is experimentally very challenging to resolve the underlying microscopic mechanisms. Glassy dynamics are also challenging for atomistic simulations due to the underlying dramatic slowdown over many orders of magnitude. Here, we address this issue by combining atomic scale simulations with autocorrelation function analysis and Bayesian regression, and apply this approach to a set of perylene derivatives as prototypical chromophores. The predicted glass transition temperatures and kinetic fragilities are in semi-quantitative agreement with experimental data. By analyzing the underlying dynamics via the normal vector autocorrelation function, we are able to connect the beta and alpha-relaxation processes in these materials to caged (or librational) dynamics and cooperative rotations of the molecules, respectively. The workflow presented in this work serves as a stepping stone toward understanding glassy dynamics in many-component mixtures of perylene derivatives and is readily extendable to other systems of chromophores.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian density fluctuations in the Dean-Kawasaki equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing analytically the $n$-point density correlations in systems of interacting particles is a long-standing problem of statistical physics, with a broad range of applications, from the interpretation of scattering experiments in simple liquids, to the quantitative description of the slow and cooperative dynamics in glass formers. For Brownian particles, i.e. with overdamped Langevin dynamics, the microscopic density obeys a stochastic evolution equation, known as the Dean-Kawasaki equation. In spite of the importance of this equation, its complexity makes it very difficult to analyze the statistics of the microscopic density beyond simple Gaussian approximations. In this work, resorting to a path-integral description of the stochastic dynamics and relying on the formalism of macroscopic fluctuation theory, we go beyond the usual linearization of the Dean-Kawasaki equation, and we compute perturbatively the three-point density correlation functions, in the limit of high-density and weak interactions between the particles. This exact result opens the way to using the Dean-Kawasaki beyond the simple Gaussian treatments, and could find applications to understand many fluctuation-related effects in soft and active matter systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We highlight the current state-of-the-art in modeling emulsion rheology, ranging from dilute to jammed dense systems. We focus on analytical and numerical methods developed for calculating, computing, and tracking drop deformation en route to developing constitutive models for flowing emulsions. We identify material properties and dimensionless parameters, collate the small deformation theories and resulting expressions for viscometric quantities, list theoretical and numerical methods, and take stock of challenges for capturing connections between drop deformation, morphology, and rheology of emulsions. We highlight the substantial progress in providing quantitative descriptions of the rheological response using analytical theories, dimensional analysis, and powerful computational fluid dynamics to determine how macroscopic rheological properties emerge from microscopic features, including deformation and dynamics of non-interacting or interacting drops and molecular aspects that control the interfacial properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.06323v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review fundamental problems involved in liquid theory including both classical and quantum liquids. Understanding classical liquids involves exploring details of their microscopic dynamics and its consequences. Here, we apply the same general idea to quantum liquids. We discuss momentum condensation in liquid helium which is consistent with microscopic dynamics in liquids and high mobility of liquid atoms. We propose that mobile transit atoms accumulate in the finite-energy state where the transit speed is close to the speed of sound. In this state, the transit energy is close to the zero-point energy. In momentum space, the accumulation operates on a sphere with the radius set by interatomic spacing and corresponds to zero net momentum. We show that this picture is supported by experiments, including the kinetic energy of helium atoms below the superfluid transition and sharp peaks of scattered intensity at predicted energy. We discuss the implications of this picture including the macroscopic wave function and superfluidity. The superfluid transition temperature is evaluated to be within 15% of the experimental value.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic Effects on the Hydrodynamics of an Active Compound Particle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the hydrodynamics of microswimmers in viscoelastic fluids and confined environments is crucial for interpreting their behaviour in natural settings and designing synthetic microswimmers for practical applications like cargo transport. In this study, we explore the hydrodynamics of a concentric active compound particle - a model microswimmer (a squirmer) positioned at the centre of a viscoelastic fluid droplet (a model cargo) suspended in another viscoelastic medium. We consider the Oldroyd-B constitutive model to characterize the fluids and employ a perturbative approach in the Deborah number to analyze viscoelastic effects analytically, assuming a small Capillary number so that the droplet remains spherical and does not deform. We examine three cases: (i) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in a Newtonian fluid, (ii) a squirmer confined within a Newtonian fluid droplet suspended in a viscoelastic fluid, and (iii) a squirmer confined within a viscoelastic fluid droplet suspended in another viscoelastic fluid. Our findings reveal that the swimming speeds of the squirmer and the droplet are determined by the complex interplay of viscoelasticity, the size ratio of the droplet to the squirmer (confinement strength), and the viscosity ratio of the surrounding fluid to the droplet fluid. A critical aspect of this interaction is the positioning of stagnation points within the fluid flow, which governs the distribution of polymeric stress. This distribution, in turn, plays a crucial role in determining the influence of viscoelasticity on the squirmer's dynamics. Our analysis suggests that viscoelastic effects can either enhance or hinder the swimming speed of the squirmer when confined in a droplet, depending on the specific configuration of the system.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Time irreversibility in systems observed at coarse resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A broken time-reversal symmetry, i.e. broken detailed balance, is central to non-equilibrium physics and is a prerequisite for life. However, it turns out to be quite challenging to unambiguously define and quantify time-reversal symmetry (and violations thereof) in practice, that is, from observations. Measurements on complex systems have a finite resolution and generally probe low-dimensional projections of the underlying dynamics, which are well known to introduce memory. In situations where many microscopic states become "lumped" onto the same observable "state" or when introducing "reaction coordinates" to reduce the dimensionality of data, signatures of a broken time-reversal symmetry in the microscopic dynamics become distorted or masked. In this perspective we highlight why in defining and discussing time-reversal symmetry, and quantifying its violations, the precise underlying assumptions on the microscopic dynamics, the coarse graining, and further reductions, are not a technical detail. These assumptions decide whether the conclusions that are drawn are physically sound or inconsistent. We summarize recent findings in the field and reflect upon key challenges.</description>
