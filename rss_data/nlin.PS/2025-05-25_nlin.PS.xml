      <title>Compound Burgers-KdV Soliton Behaviour: Refraction, Reflection and Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a coupled PDE system between the Burgers equation and the KdV equation to model the interactions between `bore'-like structures and wave-like solitons in shallow water. Two derivations of the resulting Burgers-swept KdV system are presented, based on Lie group symmetry and reduced variational principles. Exact compound soliton solutions are obtained, and numerical simulations show that the Burgers and KdV momenta tend toward a balance at which the coupled system reduces to the integrable Gardner equation. The numerical simulations also reveal rich nonlinear solution behaviours that include refraction, reflection, and soliton fusion, before the balance is finally achieved.</description>

      <title>Chase-and-Run and Chirality in Nonlocal Models of Pattern Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chase-and-run dynamics, in which one population pursues another that flees from it, are found throughout nature, from predator-prey interactions in ecosystems to the collective motion of cells during development. Intriguingly, in many of these systems, the movement is not straight; instead, 'runners' veer off at an angle from their pursuers. This angled movement often exhibits a consistent left-right asymmetry, known as lateralisation or chirality. Inspired by such phenomena in zebrafish skin patterns and evasive animal motion, we explore how chirality shapes the emergence of patterns in nonlocal (integro-differential) advection-diffusion models. We extend such models to allow movement at arbitrary angles, uncovering a rich landscape of behaviours. We find that chirality can enhance pattern formation, suppress oscillations, and give rise to entirely new dynamical structures, such as rotating pulses of chasers and runners. We also uncover how chase-and-run dynamics can cause populations to mix or separate. Through linear stability analysis, we identify physical mechanisms that drive some of these effects, whilst also exposing striking limitations of this theory in capturing more complex dynamics. Our findings suggest that chirality could have roles in ecological and cellular patterning beyond simply breaking left-right symmetry.</description>

      <title>Self-induced transparency and optical transients in atomic vapors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid turn-on of a strong, resonant, continuous wave laser field may trigger the formation of a transient oscillation akin to a train of damped solitons, before the vapor-field system relaxes into a stationary state. We study this transient dynamic on theoretical models of a rubidium vapor. We also consider doubly resonant V-systems, for which the transients take the form of trains of damped simultons. We compute the propagating field(s) by solving the Maxwell-Bloch equations, taking homogeneous broadening, Doppler broadening and the full hyperfine structure of the atoms into account. We also compare the actual fields to the stationary dnoidal fields predicted by the Maxwell-Bloch equations in conditions of self-induced transparency. A similar dynamics is expected to occur in any atomic vapor at the turn-on of a strong resonant continuous wave field provided the turn-on is sufficiently fast compared to relaxation.</description>

      <title>Nonlocally coupled moisture model for convective self-aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clouds play a central role in climate physics by interacting with precipitation, radiation, and circulation. Despite being a fundamental issue in convective organization, the self-aggregation of clouds lacks a theoretical explanation due to its complexity. In this study, we introduce an idealized mathematical model where the system's state is represented solely by the vertically integrated water vapor content of atmospheric columns under the weak temperature gradient approximation. By analyzing the nonlinear dynamics of this simplified system, we mathematically elucidate the mechanisms that determine the onset of self-aggregation and the spatial scale of the self-aggregated state. Nonlocal coupling between atmospheric columns induces bistability, leading to dry and moist equilibria. This reflects the circulation effects driven by horizontal differential heating due to convection and radiation. The bistable self-aggregated state realizes when destabilization by nonlocal coupling, triggered by finite-amplitude disturbances in the uniform state, overcomes stabilization by diffusion. For globally coupled systems where all columns are equally coupled, perturbations with the maximum wavelength exhibit the highest growth rate. This results in a solution with an infinitely long wavelength, understood as the dynamical system's heteroclinic trajectories describing the steady state's spatial evolution. Conversely, for nonlocally coupled systems with finite filter lengths, perturbations with wavelengths close to the characteristic length of the coupling are preferred. The results reveal that the balance between nonlocal coupling and diffusion is essential for understanding convective self-aggregation. Moreover, this study suggests a physical similarity between convective self-aggregation and moisture mode.</description>
