      <title>Fluctuation-dominated phase ordering in the one dimensional Truncated Inverse Distance Square Ising (TIDSI) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many physical systems, including some examples of active matter, granular assemblies, and biological systems, show fluctuation-dominated phase ordering (FDPO), where macroscopic fluctuations coexist with long-range order. Most of these systems are out of equilibrium. By contrast, a recent work has analytically demonstrated that an equilibrium one-dimensional Truncated Inverse Distance Square Ising (TIDSI) model shows FDPO. The analytical results rely on a cluster representation of the model that we term TIDSI-CL and are governed by the ratio, $c$, of the long-range interaction strength to the critical temperature. We show that the allowed range of $c$ is very narrow in the TIDSI model while it is unbounded in TIDSI-CL. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations for the TIDSI model and show consistency with the analytical results in the allowed range of $c$. The correlation length grows strongly on approaching the critical point, leading to a broad near-critical region. Within this region, $\alpha$, which is the cusp exponent of the power-law decay of the scaled correlation function at criticality, changes to $\alpha^\text{eff}$. We also investigate the coarsening dynamics of the model: the correlation function, domain size distribution, and aging behavior are consistent with the equilibrium properties upon replacing the system size, $L$, with the coarsening length, $\mathcal{L}(t)$. The mean largest cluster size shows logarithmic corrections due to finite $L$ and waiting time, $t_w$. The aging autocorrelation function exhibits two different scaling forms, characterized by exponents $\beta$ and $\gamma$, at short and long times compared to $t_w$, where $\beta=\alpha/2$.</description>

      <title>Single cells can resolve graded stimuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cells use signalling pathways as windows into the environment to gather information, transduce it into their interior, and use it to drive behaviours. MAPK (ERK) is a highly conserved signalling pathway in eukaryotes, directing multiple fundamental cellular behaviours such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation, making it of few central hubs in the signalling circuitry of cells. Despite this versatility of behaviors, population-level measurements have reported low information content (\textless 1 bit) relayed through the ERK pathway, rendering the population barely able to distinguish the presence or absence of stimuli. Here, we contrast the information transmitted by a single cell and a population of cells. Using a combination of optogenetic experiments, data analysis based on information theory framework, and numerical simulations we quantify the amount of information transduced from the receptor to ERK, from responses to singular, brief and sparse input pulses. We show that single cells are indeed able to resolve between graded stimuli, yielding over 2 bit of information, however showing a large population heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Heavy-element damage seeding in proteins under XFEL illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10298v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (SFX) captures the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The ultrashort pulse produced by an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) 'outruns' much of the radiation damage that impairs conventional crystallography. However, the rapid onset of 'electronic damage' due to electron ionization limits this benefit. Here, we distinguish the influence of different atomic species on the electronic damage to protein crystals in SFX by employing a plasma code that tracks the unbound electrons as a continuous energy distribution. The simulations show that trace quantities of heavy atoms ($Z &gt; 10$) contribute a substantial proportion of global radiation damage by inducing electron ionization processes that are highly damaging on the XFEL pulse timescale. Native sulfur atoms have a considerable effect on damage-induced noise. Likewise, proteins suffer less damage when the crystal solvent contains lower concentrations of heavy elements. The proximity of the X-ray energy to a heavy-element absorption edge has a strong and non-trivial influence on the damage induced in these models. In one representative protein (lysozyme substituted with selenomethionine), adjusting the X-ray energy from 14 keV to 12 keV is as effective at reducing the ionization of light atoms as compressing the pulse width from 50 fs to 5 fs. These results indicate that relatively small quantities of heavy elements can substantially affect global radiation damage in the XFEL regime.</description>

      <title>Src Kinase Slows Collective Rotation of Confined Epithelial Cell Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective cell migration is key during development, wound healing and metastasis and relies on coordinated cell behaviors at the group level. Src kinase is a key signalling protein for physiological functions of epithelia, as it regulates many cellular processes, including adhesion, motility, and mechanotransduction. Its over-activation is associated to cancer aggressiveness. Here, we take advantage of optogenetics to precisely control Src activation in time and show that its pathological-like activation slows collective rotation of epithelial cells confined into circular adhesive patches. We interpret velocity, force and stress data during period of non-activation and period of activation of Src thanks to an hydrodynamic description of the cell assembly as a polar active fluid. Src activation leads to a 2-fold decrease in the ratio of polar angle to friction, which could result from increased adhesiveness at the cell-substrate interface. Measuring internal stress allows us to show that active stresses are subdominant compared to traction forces. Our work reveals the importance of fine-tuning the level of Src activity for coordinated collective behaviors.</description>

      <title>AMARO: All Heavy-Atom Transferable Neural Network Potentials of Protein Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: All-atom molecular simulations offer detailed insights into macromolecular phenomena, but their substantial computational cost hinders the exploration of complex biological processes. We introduce Advanced Machine-learning Atomic Representation Omni-force-field (AMARO), a new neural network potential (NNP) that combines an O(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network architecture, TensorNet, with a coarse-graining map that excludes hydrogen atoms. AMARO demonstrates the feasibility of training coarser NNP, without prior energy terms, to run stable protein dynamics with scalability and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic uncertainty relation for systems with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) delineate tradeoff relations between the thermodynamic cost and the magnitude of an observable's fluctuation. While TURs have been established for various nonequilibrium systems, their applicability to systems influenced by active noise remains largely unexplored. Here, we present an explicit expression of TUR for systems with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs). Our findings reveal that active noise introduces modifications to the terms associated with the thermodynamic cost in the TUR expression. The altered thermodynamic cost encompasses not only the conventional entropy production but also the energy consumption induced by the active noise. We examine the capability of this TUR as an accurate estimator of the extent of anomalous diffusion in systems with active noise driven by a constant force in free space. By introducing the concept of a contracted probability density function, we derive a steady-state TUR tailored to this system. Moreover, through the adoption of a new scaling parameter, we enhance and optimize the TUR bound further. Our results demonstrate that active noise tends to hinder accurate estimation of the anomalous diffusion extent. Our study offers a systematic approach for exploring the fluctuation nature of biological systems operating in active environments.</description>
