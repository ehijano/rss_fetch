      <title>Metric and Geometric Spanners that are Resilient to Degree-Bounded Edge Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be an edge-weighted graph, and let $G$ be a subgraph of $H$. We say that $G$ is an $f$-fault-tolerant $t$-spanner for $H$, if the following is true for any subset $F$ of at most $f$ edges of $G$: For any two vertices $p$ and $q$, the shortest-path distance between $p$ and $q$ in the graph $G \setminus F$ is at most $t$ times the shortest-path distance between $p$ and $q$ in the graph $H \setminus F$.
  Recently, Bodwin, Haeupler, and Parter generalized this notion to the case when $F$ can be any set of edges in $G$, as long as the maximum degree of $F$ is at most $f$. They gave constructions for general graphs $H$.
  We first consider the case when $H$ is a complete graph whose vertex set is an arbitrary metric space. We show that if this metric space contains a $t$-spanner with $m$ edges, then it also contains a graph $G$ with $O(fm)$ edges, that is resilient to edge faults of maximum degree $f$ and has stretch factor $O(ft)$.
  Next, we consider the case when $H$ is a complete graph whose vertex set is a metric space that admits a well-separated pair decomposition. We show that, if the metric space has such a decomposition of size $m$, then it contains a graph with at most $(2f+1)^2 m$ edges, that is resilient to edge faults of maximum degree $f$ and has stretch factor at most $1+\varepsilon$, for any given $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. For example, if the vertex set is a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d$ being a constant) or a set of $n$ points in a metric space of bounded doubling dimension, then the spanner has $O(f^2 n)$ edges.
  Finally, for the case when $H$ is a complete graph on $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we show how natural variants of the Yao- and $\Theta$-graphs lead to graphs with $O(fn)$ edges, that are resilient to edge faults of maximum degree $f$ and have stretch factor at most $1+\varepsilon$, for any given $\varepsilon &gt; 0$.</description>

The densest subgraph problem is a well studied problem in computer science. Existing exact and approximation algorithms for computing the densest subgraph require $\Omega(m)$ time. We present near-linear time (in $n$) approximation algorithms for the densest subgraph problem on \emph{implicit} geometric intersection graphs, where the vertices are explicitly given but not the edges. As a concrete example, we consider $n$ disks in the plane with arbitrary radii and present two different approximation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Explicit Formulae to Interchangeably use Hyperplanes and Hyperballs using Inversive Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many algorithms require discriminative boundaries, such as separating hyperplanes or hyperballs, or are specifically designed to work on spherical data. By applying inversive geometry, we show that the two discriminative boundaries can be used interchangeably, and that general Euclidean data can be transformed into spherical data, whenever a change in point distances is acceptable. We provide explicit formulae to embed general Euclidean data into spherical data and to unembed it back. We further show a duality between hyperspherical caps, i.e., the volume created by a separating hyperplane on spherical data, and hyperballs and provide explicit formulae to map between the two. We further provide equations to translate inner products and Euclidean distances between the two spaces, to avoid explicit embedding and unembedding. We also provide a method to enforce projections of the general Euclidean space onto hemi-hyperspheres and propose an intrinsic dimensionality based method to obtain "all-purpose" parameters. To show the usefulness of the cap-ball-duality, we discuss example applications in machine learning and vector similarity search.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Topology and the Geometry of the Space of Persistence Diagrams via Optimal Partial Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.03048v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the obvious similarities between the metrics used in topological data analysis and those of optimal transport, an optimal-transport based formalism to study persistence diagrams and similar topological descriptors has yet to come. In this article, by considering the space of persistence diagrams as a space of discrete measures, and by observing that its metrics can be expressed as optimal partial transport problems, we introduce a generalization of persistence diagrams, namely Radon measures supported on the upper half plane. Such measures naturally appear in topological data analysis when considering continuous representations of persistence diagrams (e.g.\ persistence surfaces) but also as limits for laws of large numbers on persistence diagrams or as expectations of probability distributions on the persistence diagrams space. We explore topological properties of this new space, which will also hold for the closed subspace of persistence diagrams. New results include a characterization of convergence with respect to Wasserstein metrics, a geometric description of barycenters (Fr\'echet means) for any distribution of diagrams, and an exhaustive description of continuous linear representations of persistence diagrams. We also showcase the strength of this framework to study random persistence diagrams by providing several statistical results made meaningful thanks to this new formalism.</description>

      <title>Greedy Spanners in Euclidean Spaces Admit Sublinear Separators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.06490v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The greedy spanner in a low dimensional Euclidean space is a fundamental geometric construction that has been extensively studied over three decades as it possesses the two most basic properties of a good spanner: constant maximum degree and constant lightness. Recently, Eppstein and Khodabandeh showed that the greedy spanner in $\mathbb{R}^2$ admits a sublinear separator in a strong sense: any subgraph of $k$ vertices of the greedy spanner in $\mathbb{R}^2$ has a separator of size $O(\sqrt{k})$. Their technique is inherently planar and is not extensible to higher dimensions. They left showing the existence of a small separator for the greedy spanner in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for any constant $d\geq 3$ as an open problem. In this paper, we resolve the problem of Eppstein and Khodabandeh by showing that any subgraph of $k$ vertices of the greedy spanner in $\mathbb{R}^d$ has a separator of size $O(k^{1-1/d})$. We introduce a new technique that gives a simple characterization for any geometric graph to have a sublinear separator that we dub $\tau$-lanky: a geometric graph is $\tau$-lanky if any ball of radius $r$ cuts at most $\tau$ edges of length at least $r$ in the graph. We show that any $\tau$-lanky geometric graph of $n$ vertices in $\mathbb{R}^d$ has a separator of size $O(\tau n^{1-1/d})$. We then derive our main result by showing that the greedy spanner is $O(1)$-lanky. We indeed obtain a more general result that applies to unit ball graphs and point sets of low fractal dimensions in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Our technique naturally extends to doubling metrics. We use the $\tau$-lanky characterization to show that there exists a $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner for doubling metrics of dimension $d$ with a constant maximum degree and a separator of size $O(n^{1-\frac{1}{d}})$; this result resolves an open problem posed by Abam and Har-Peled a decade ago.</description>

      <title>A Method for Auto-Differentiation of the Voronoi Tessellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voronoi tessellation, also known as Voronoi diagram, is an important computational geometry technique that has applications in various scientific disciplines. It involves dividing a given space into regions based on the proximity to a set of points. Autodifferentiation is a powerful tool for solving optimization tasks. Autodifferentiation assumes constructing a computational graph that allows to compute gradients using backpropagation algorithm. However, often the Voronoi tessellation remains the only non-differentiable part of a pipeline, prohibiting end-to-end differentiation. We present the method for autodifferentiation of the 2D Voronoi tessellation. The method allows one to construct the Voronoi tessellation and pass gradients, making the construction end-to-end differentiable. We provide the implementation details and present several important applications. To the best of our knowledge this is the first autodifferentiable realization of the Voronoi tessellation providing full set of Voronoi geometrical parameters in a differentiable way.</description>
