      <title>Roger Carter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Roger Carter (1934--2022) was a very well known mathematician working in algebra, representation theory and Lie theory. He spent most of his mathematical career in Warwick. Roger was a great communicator of mathematics: the clarity, precision and enthusiasm of his lectures delivered in his beautiful handwriting were hallmark features recalled by numerous students and colleagues. His books have been described as marvelous pieces of scholarship and service to the general mathematical community. We both met Roger early in our careers, and were encouraged and influenced by him~ -- ~and his lovely sense of humour. This text is our tribute, both to his mathematical achievements, and to his kindness and generosity towards his students, his colleagues, his collaborators, and his family.</description>

      <title>A First Course in Monte Carlo Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a concise mathematical introduction to Monte Carlo methods, a rich family of algorithms with far-reaching applications in science and engineering. Monte Carlo methods are an exciting subject for mathematical statisticians and computational and applied mathematicians: the design and analysis of modern algorithms are rooted in a broad mathematical toolbox that includes ergodic theory of Markov chains, Hamiltonian dynamical systems, transport maps, stochastic differential equations, information theory, optimization, Riemannian geometry, and gradient flows, among many others. These lecture notes celebrate the breadth of mathematical ideas that have led to tangible advancements in Monte Carlo methods and their applications. To accommodate a diverse audience, the level of mathematical rigor varies from chapter to chapter, giving only an intuitive treatment to the most technically demanding subjects. The aim is not to be comprehensive or encyclopedic, but rather to illustrate some key principles in the design and analysis of Monte Carlo methods through a carefully-crafted choice of topics that emphasizes timeless over timely ideas. Algorithms are presented in a way that is conducive to conceptual understanding and mathematical analysis -- clarity and intuition are favored over state-of-the-art implementations that are harder to comprehend or rely on ad-hoc heuristics. To help readers navigate the expansive landscape of Monte Carlo methods, each algorithm is accompanied by a summary of its pros and cons, and by a discussion of the type of problems for which they are most useful. The presentation is self-contained, and therefore adequate for self-guided learning or as a teaching resource. Each chapter contains a section with bibliographic remarks that will be useful for those interested in conducting research on Monte Carlo methods and their applications.</description>

      <title>Remark on Pascal's Triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through a series of elementary exercises, we explain the fractal structure of Pascal's triangle when written modulo $p$ using an 1852 theorem due to Kummer: A prime $p$ divides $\dfrac {n!}{i!j!} $ if and only if there is a carry in the addition $i+j=n$ when written in base $p$.</description>
