      <title>Elemental abundance pattern and temperature inversion on the dayside of HAT-P-70b observed with CARMENES and PEPSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy has identified various chemical species in the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters, including neutral and ionized metals, providing key insights into planet formation through refractory element abundances. We observed the dayside thermal emission spectrum of the UHJ HAT-P-70b using the high-resolution spectrographs CARMENES and PEPSI. Through cross-correlation analysis, we detect emission signals of Al i, AlH, Ca ii, Cr i, Fe i, Fe ii, Mg i, Mn i, and Ti i, marking the first detection of Al i and AlH in an exoplanetary atmosphere. Tentative signals of C i, Ca i, Na i, NaH, and Ni i are also identified. These detections enable atmospheric retrievals to constrain the thermal profile and elemental abundances of the planet's dayside hemisphere. The retrieved temperature-pressure profile reveals a strong thermal inversion. The chemical free retrieval yields a metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.38(+0.74/-1.11), while the chemical equilibrium retrieval gives [Fe/H] = 0.23(+1.08/-0.98), both consistent with solar metallicity. We also tentatively find an enhanced abundance of Ni, possibly due to the accretion of Ni-rich planetesimals during formation. On the other hand, elements with condensation temperatures above 1400 K (e.g., Ca, Ti, and V) appear slightly depleted, which may be caused by nightside cold trapping. However, Al, with the highest condensation temperature at 1653K, displays a solar like abundance, which might reflect the formation-related enrichment of Al. Our retrieval indicates extremely high volume mixing ratios of metal ions (Fe ii and Ca ii), which are significantly inconsistent with predictions from chemical equilibrium models. This disequilibrium suggests that the atmosphere is likely undergoing significant hydrodynamic escaping, which enhances the atmospheric density at high altitudes where the ionic lines are formed.</description>

      <title>Episodic planetesimal disruptions triggered by dissipation of gas disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Catastrophic disruptions of planetesimals occur in high-velocity collisions. Radioisotope dating of planetesimal disruption events recorded in meteorites confirms frequent catastrophic collisions in the first $\sim$10 Myr of the Solar System, reflecting a violent environment of the time. However, the nebula gas can damp the eccentricity of planetesimals and suppress the frequency of planetesimal collisions. Strong dynamical mechanisms that excited the protoplanetary disk are required. Here we show that the sweeping secular resonances of Jupiter and Saturn induced by the nebular gas dissipation, together with the mean motion resonances of Jupiter, can trigger a large number of catastrophic collisions, which occur episodically when the secular resonances are at $\sim$2-3 au and continue thereafter. After the gas dissipation completes, catastrophic collisions decrease in frequency, with scattering by planetary embryos becoming the major driving force of the collisions. Our results suggest that the violent environment excited by secular and mean motion resonances can be ubiquitous in protoplanetary disks during nebula dissipation.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of lunar response to gravitational waves and its 3D topographic effect using the spectral-element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Moon has been regarded as a natural Weber bar capable of amplifying gravitational waves (GWs) for detecting events across a wide range of frequencies. However, accurately determining the amplification effects remains challenging due to the absence of 3D numerical simulation methods. In this study, we develop a high-order 3D finite element method (spectral-element method, SEM) to numerically simulate the lunar response to GWs below 20 mHz. We verify the accuracy of our method by comparing the resonant peaks of our results with those from semi-analytical solutions and find that the frequency deviation is less than 3% for the first peak at about 1 mHz and less than 0.8% for the subsequent peaks up to 10 mHz. Using this method, we evaluate the amplification of GW signals due to 3D topographic effects of the Moon, and we find enhancements at a series of specific frequency components. These results highlight the non-negligible effect of surface topography on the lunar response to GWs, as a fundamental factor that holds significant implications across both global and regional analyses. Our work paves the way for a comprehensive evaluation of the Moon's resonant response to GWs, helpful for the strategic planning of lunar GW detections.</description>

      <title>From emission to absorption: the FAST observation of the OH 18-cm lines from the Comet C2025/A6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed comet C/2025 A6 with FAST telescope equipped with the ultra-wideband receiver from 23$^{\rm rd}$ October to 8$^{\rm th}$ November 2025 and detected the OH 18-cm lines for the first time. The OH lines underwent a reversal from emission to absorption from 23$^{\rm rd}$ October to 5$^{\rm th}$ November, which is mainly caused by variations in the heliocentric velocity. Through trapezoidal fitting of the OH line profiles, we derive expansion velocities of the water that rise as the heliocentric distance decreases. Based on these results, we estimated the OH production rates of C/2025 A6 for 23$^{\rm rd}$ October, 26$^{\rm th}$ October, 4$^{\rm th}$ November, and 5$^{\rm th}$ November and it presents a significant upward trend.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced "Flux-Corrected Transport"-Based Plasmasphere Refilling Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A previously developed multi-ion, two-stream Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT) hydrodynamic model for plasmasphere refilling has been extended to incorporate self-consistent electron temperature evolution. The past assumption of a constant temperature along the modeled flux tube has been replaced by solving the electron energy equation, permitting spatially and temporally varying temperature. This improvement provides a more physically complete representation of the pressure and ambipolar electric-field gradients that influence ion transport. The extended model allows us to investigate two-stage refilling behavior established by prior observations and simulations. The model continues to reproduce the expected dominance of H+, enhanced early-time O+ contributions, and the coupling between H+ and He+ through the ambipolar electric field during the transition between stages. Sensitivity experiments with modified initial ion concentrations, including cases representing seasonal effects, highlight the distinct roles of each ion species in shaping the refilling trajectory. Comparisons across L-shells 3 and 4 further confirm the robustness of the model framework for future extension to three-dimensional geometries. Overall, by incorporating more realistic temperature variations, this enhanced model strengthens the physical understanding for interpreting complex multi-ion transport processes during plasmasphere recovery following geomagnetic storms.</description>

      <title>Habitability of exoplanets orbiting flaring stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As of late 2025 there are about 70 exoplanets that meet the formal criterion of having equilibrium temperatures allowing the presence of liquid water and about 50 of them orbit M-stars, known for their strong chromospheric activity. Most of these stars are close to the Sun and the planet-to-star mass and luminosity ratios are advantageous, allowing for a more detailed follow-up than of planets orbiting hotter and more massive stars. Many more planets orbiting late-type stars are expected to be discovered by Gaia and PLATO in the following years. However, the lingering question remains whether the UV and X-ray emission, associated with the stellar activity, allows for complex life. A comprehensive study focused on properties of flaring exoplanet hosts and their activity, on a much larger scale than these few tens (soon to become hundreds) of stars with habitable planets is called for, to answer the question if such stars can harbor habitable planets. The proposed Wide Field Survey telescope is well suited for this study.</description>

      <title>Snowball Bistability Vanishes at Moderate Orbital Eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Snowball episodes are associated with increases in atmospheric oxygen and the complexity of life on Earth, and they may be essential for the development of complex life on exoplanets. Sustained, stable Snowball episodes require a Snowball bifurcation and climate bistability between the globally ice-covered Snowball state and a state with at least some open ocean. We find that climate bistability disappears for an aquaplanet with a slab ocean in the global climate model ExoCAM when the orbital eccentricity is increased to 0.2-0.3. This happens because the Snowball state ceases to exist as seasonal insolation variations intensify, while the warm state remains stable due to the ocean's large heat capacity. We use a low-order ice-thermodynamic model to show that the Snowball state ceases to exist as seasonality increases because winter freezing at the ice bottom is reduced relative to summer melting at the ice top due to ice self-insulation. Combined with previous research showing that Snowball climate bistability diminishes for planets orbiting low-mass stars and ones with longer rotation periods, and that it disappears entirely for tidally locked planets, our work suggests that the Snowball climate bistability may not be as robust to planetary parameters as previously thought, representing one aspect of habitability more consistent with the rare Earth hypothesis than the Copernican principle.</description>

      <title>Vertically resolved minimal-set k-distribution for thermal infrared absorption: an application to the atmosphere of Venus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The FKDM $k$-distribution technique is applied to parameterize absorption of thermal radiation in the lower and middle atmosphere of Venus, targeting modeling scenarios where the cost of full radiative transfer calculations necessitates efficient parameterizations (e.g. climate modeling). Line-by-line reference modeling based on a Monte Carlo method for radiative transfer is built into the $k$-distribution terms construction process, explicitly controlling accuracy. From 16 bands across $10$--$6000~\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, the method produces 32 $k$-terms, band-averaged Planck function values and per-band spectral points for computing Venus cloud optical properties. The FKDM $k$-distribution technique does not require the inter-level correlation assumption common for the correlated $k$-distribution method. We supply height-dependent $k(z)$ functions tabulated on the same vertical grid as the input temperature-pressure profile, designed for direct use in radiative transfer solvers and avoiding additional remapping of the pre-tabulated $k$-data. Our implementation of the technique yielded acceptable accuracy below 90~km ($&lt;1.2~\mathrm{K\,day^{-1}}$ for cooling rates; $&lt;2\%$ for fluxes), while requiring substantially fewer $k$-terms than recent implementations of the correlated-$k$ method. A Fortran driver that generates $k(z)$ functions for an arbitrary Venus atmospheric profile is provided in a public repository.</description>

      <title>High-energy astrochemistry in the molecular interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant shift in astrochemistry with a renewed focus on the role of non-thermal processes on the molecular interstellar medium, in particular energetic particles (such as cosmic ray particles and fast electrons) and X-ray radiation. This has been brought about in large part due to new observations of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in environments that would inhibit their formation, such as cold, dense gas in prestellar cores or in the highly energetic environments in galactic centers. In parallel, there has been a plethora of new laboratory investigations on the role of high-energy radiation and electrons on the chemistry of astrophysical ices, demonstrating the ability of this radiation to induce complex chemistry. In recent years, theoretical models have also begun to include newer cosmic-ray-driven processes in both the gas and ice phases. In this review, we unify aspects of the chemistry driven by X-ray radiation and energetic particles into a ``high-energy astrochemistry'', defining this term and reviewing the underlying chemical processes. We conclude by examining various laboratories where high-energy astrochemistry is at play and identify future issues to be tackled.</description>
