      <title>A Novel Extensible Simulation Framework for CXL-Enabled Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compute Express Link (CXL) serves as a rising industry standard, delivering high-speed cache-coherent links to a variety of devices, including host CPUs, computational accelerators, and memory devices. It is designed to promote system scalability, enable peer-to-peer exchanges, and accelerate data transmissions. To achieve these objectives, the most recent CXL protocol has brought forth several innovative features, such as port-focused routing, device-handled coherence, and PCIe 6.0 compatibility. However, due to the limited availability of hardware prototypes and simulators compatible with CXL, earlier CXL research has largely depended on emulating CXL devices using remote NUMA nodes. Unfortunately, these NUMA-based emulators have difficulties in accurately representing the new features due to fundamental differences in hardware and protocols. Moreover, the absence of support for non-tree topology and PCIe links makes it complex to merely adapt existing simulators for CXL simulation. To overcome these problems, we introduce ESF, a simulation framework specifically designed for CXL systems. ESF has been developed to accurately reflect the unique features of the latest CXL protocol from the ground up. It uses a specialized interconnect layer to facilitate connections within a wide range of system topologies and also includes key components to carry out specific functions required by these features. By utilizing ESF, we thoroughly investigate various aspects of CXL systems, including system topology, device-handled coherence, and the effects of PCIe characteristics, leading to important findings that can guide the creation of high-performance CXL systems. The ESF source codes are fully open-source and can be accessed at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ESF-1CE3.</description>

      <title>A System Level Performance Evaluation for Superconducting Digital Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting Digital (SCD) technology offers significant potential for enhancing the performance of next generation large scale compute workloads. By leveraging advanced lithography and a 300 mm platform, SCD devices can reduce energy consumption and boost computational power. This paper presents a cross-layer modeling approach to evaluate the system-level performance benefits of SCD architectures for Large Language Model (LLM) training and inference. Our findings, based on experimental data and Pulse Conserving Logic (PCL) design principles, demonstrate substantial performance gain in both training and inference. We are, thus, able to convincingly show that the SCD technology can address memory and interconnect limitations of present day solutions for next-generation compute systems.</description>

      <title>Reducing ADC Front-end Costs During Training of On-sensor Printed Multilayer Perceptrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08674v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Printed electronics technology offers a cost-effectiveand fully-customizable solution to computational needs beyondthe capabilities of traditional silicon technologies, offering ad-vantages such as on-demand manufacturing and conformal, low-cost hardware. However, the low-resolution fabrication of printedelectronics, which results in large feature sizes, poses a challengefor integrating complex designs like those of machine learn-ing (ML) classification systems. Current literature optimizes onlythe Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) circuit within the classificationsystem, while the cost of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)is overlooked. Printed applications frequently require on-sensorprocessing, yet while the digital classifier has been extensivelyoptimized, the analog-to-digital interfacing, specifically the ADCs,dominates the total area and energy consumption. In this work,we target digital printed MLP classifiers and we propose thedesign of customized ADCs per MLP's input which involvesminimizing the distinct represented numbers for each input,simplifying thus the ADC's circuitry. Incorporating this ADCoptimization in the MLP training, enables eliminating ADC levelsand the respective comparators, while still maintaining highclassification accuracy. Our approach achieves 11.2x lower ADCarea for less than 5% accuracy drop across varying MLPs.</description>

      <title>ProactivePIM: Accelerating Weight-Sharing Embedding Layer with PIM for Scalable Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04032v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The personalized recommendation system's continuous size growth poses new challenges for model inference. Although weight-sharing algorithms have been proposed to reduce embedding table capacity, they increase memory access. Recent advancements in processing-in-memory (PIM) successfully enhance the recommendation system's throughput by exploiting memory parallelism, but our analysis shows that those algorithms introduce CPU-PIM communication overhead into prior PIM systems, compromising the PIM throughput. We propose ProactivePIM, a specialized memory architecture integrated with PIM technology tailored to accelerate the weight-sharing algorithms. ProacitvePIM integrates an SRAM cache within the PIM with an efficient prefetching scheme to leverage a unique locality of the algorithm and eliminate CPU-PIM communication.</description>

      <title>Automated Placement of Analog Integrated Circuits using Priority-based Constructive Heuristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a heuristic approach for solving the placement of Analog and Mixed-Signal Integrated Circuits. Placement is a crucial step in the physical design of integrated circuits. During this step, designers choose the position and variant of each circuit device. We focus on the specific class of analog placement, which requires so-called pockets, their possible merging, and parametrizable minimum distances between devices, which are features mostly omitted in recent research and literature. We formulate the problem using Integer Linear Programming and propose a priority-based constructive heuristic inspired by algorithms for the Facility Layout Problem. Our solution minimizes the perimeter of the circuit's bounding box and the approximated wire length. Multiple variants of the devices with different dimensions are considered. Furthermore, we model constraints crucial for the placement problem, such as symmetry groups and blockage areas. Our outlined improvements make the heuristic suitable to handle complex rules of placement. With a search guided either by a Genetic Algorithm or a Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, we show the quality of the proposed method on both synthetically generated and real-life industrial instances accompanied by manually created designs. Furthermore, we apply reinforcement learning to control the hyper-parameters of the genetic algorithm. Synthetic instances with more than 200 devices demonstrate that our method can tackle problems more complex than typical industry examples. We also compare our method with results achieved by contemporary state-of-the-art methods on the MCNC and GSRC datasets.</description>
