      <title>Anisotropic effect of regular particle distribution in elastic-plastic composites: The modified tangent cluster model and numerical homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to develop a reliable analytical approach to finding the effective elastic-plastic response of metal matrix composites (MMC) and porous metals (PM) with a predefined particle or void distribution, as well as to examine the anisotropy induced by regular inhomogeneity arrangements. The proposed framework is based on the idea of Molinari &amp; El Mouden (1996) to improve classical mean-field models of thermoelastic media by taking into account the interactions between each pair of inhomogeneities within the material volume, known as a cluster model. Both elastic and elasto-plastic regimes are examined. A new extension of the original formulation, aimed to account for the non-linear plastic regime, is performed with the use of the modified tangent linearization of the metal matrix constitutive law. The model uses the second stress moment to track the accumulated plastic strain in the matrix. In the examples, arrangements of spherical inhomogeneities in three Bravais lattices of cubic symmetry (Regular Cubic, Body-Centered Cubic and Face-Centered Cubic) are considered for two basic material scenarios: "hard-in-soft" (MMC) and "soft-in-hard" (PM). As a means of verification, the results of micromechanical mean-field modeling are compared with those of numerical homogenization performed using the Finite Element Method (FEM). In the elastic regime, a comparison is also made with several other micromechanical models dedicated to periodic composites. Within both regimes, the results obtained by the cluster model are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with FEM calculations, especially for volume fractions of inclusions up to 40%.</description>

      <title>Giant interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction in perovskite La_{0.7}Sr_{0.3}MnO_{3} films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) plays a critical role in stabilizing topological spin textures, a key area of growing interest in oxide-based spintronics. While most of reported topological phenomena found in manganites are related to the bulk-like DMI, the understanding of interfacial DMI and its origin in oxide interfaces remain limited. Here we experimentally investigate the interfacial DMI of La_{0.7}Sr_{0.3}MnO_{3} (LSMO) films grown on various substrates by employing spin-wave propagation with drift velocities at room temperature. Our findings reveal a giant interfacial DMI coefficient (\mathit{D} _{s}) of 1.96 pJ/m in LSMO/NdGaO_{3}(110) system, exceeding previously reported values in oxides by one to two orders of magnitude. First-principles calculations further show that with the aid of 6\mathit{s} electrons, the 4\mathit{f} electrons from Nd play a key role in enhancing the spin-orbit coupling of the 3\mathit{d} electrons in Mn, ultimately leading to the observed giant interfacial DMI. This discovery of giant interfacial DMI through engineering the interface of oxides provides valuable insights for advancing functional chiral magnonics and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Dislocation-induced flexoelectricity in SrTiO$_3$ nanostructure from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity refers to a linear coupling between the electric polarization and the strain gradient, such as bending or asymmetric compression. This effect is enhanced in nano-scale structures, where grain boundaries or dislocation cores induce the strain gradient. In this study, we theoretically investigate the flexoelectric polarization induced by misfit dislocations in a thin film. A nano-scale dislocation structure is modeled in a periodic SrTiO$_3$ supercell, and then the structure is optimized by using neural-network-potential and first-principles approaches. We point out that a pyramidal TiO$_5$ coordination forms near the dislocation cores, which in turn dominantly causes the sizable flexoelectric polarization.</description>

      <title>Precipitation of corrosion products in macroscopic voids at the steel-concrete interface -- observations, mechanisms and research needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic voids at the steel-concrete interface and their degree of saturation with an aqueous electrolyte are known to play an important role in the corrosion of steel in reinforced concrete. Irrespective of the exposure conditions and testing parameters, corrosion products have been reported to consistently precipitate in a unique pattern within these macroscopic voids, preferentially along the void walls and growing inward. The underlying mechanisms governing corrosion product precipitation in macroscopic voids and their effects on long-term durability remain unclear. Through in-situ X-ray computed tomography observations, thermodynamic and kinetic considerations, and numerical modelling of water transport within macroscopic voids, here, we provide plausible hypotheses of the processes responsible for the precipitation of corrosion products along the walls of the voids. Understanding the mechanisms of corrosion product precipitation can offer insights into the development of stresses in and around the macroscopic interfacial void and the durability of reinforced concrete structures. This contribution also discusses opportunities for different avenues for research to elucidate several multiscale processes that influence the durability of reinforced concrete.</description>

      <title>SPACIER: On-Demand Polymer Design with Fully Automated All-Atom Classical Molecular Dynamics Integrated into Machine Learning Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has rapidly advanced the design and discovery of new materials with targeted applications in various systems. First-principles calculations and other computer experiments have been integrated into material design pipelines to address the lack of experimental data and the limitations of interpolative machine learning predictors. However, the enormous computational costs and technical challenges of automating computer experiments for polymeric materials have limited the availability of open-source automated polymer design systems that integrate molecular simulations and machine learning. We developed SPACIER, an open-source software program that integrates RadonPy, a Python library for fully automated polymer property calculations based on all-atom classical molecular dynamics into a Bayesian optimization-based polymer design system to overcome these challenges. As a proof-of-concept study, we successfully synthesized optical polymers that surpass the Pareto boundary formed by the tradeoff between the refractive index and Abbe number.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Blue and Infrared Laser Melting Frequency on Oxide Morphology in 304L</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous Wave Laser Beam (LB) melting offers control over the localized heating and cooling of melt pools for welding, brazing, additive manufacturing, and solidification. Research into laser-liquid metal interactions have primarily focused on the heat and mass transport under large thermal gradients imposed by the localized melting conditions. However, little research has been conducted into varying input laser frequency and scan rate at fixed absorption to understand the effects of laser-light on surface oxide formation. This article conducts laser melting of 304L under Blue (450 nm) and Infrared (IR, 1064 nm) laser frequencies and examines their impact on laser oxide thickness, chemistry, and coloration. We find that laser frequencies induce changes in the oxide layer thickness and chemistry that cannot be explained using conventional thermal absorption shifts and fluid dynamics. We suggest that light coupling may have thermodynamic implications for the chemical potential of the liquid metal which may drive the observed phase behavior.</description>

      <title>Effects of colored disorder on the heat conductivity of SiGe alloys from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconducting alloys, in particular SiGe, have been employed for several decades as high-temperature thermoelectric materials. Devising strategies to reduce their thermal conductivity may provide a substantial improvement in their thermoelectric performance also at lower temperatures. We have carried out an ab initio investigation of the thermal conductivity of SiGe alloys with random and spatially correlated mass disorder employing the Quasi-Harmonic Green-Kubo (QHGK) theory with force constants computed by density functional theory. Leveraging QHGK and the hydrodynamic extrapolation to achieve size convergence, we obtained a detailed understanding of lattice heat conduction in SiGe and demonstrated that colored disorder suppresses thermal transport across the acoustic vibrational spectrum, leading to up to a 4-fold enhancement in the intrinsic thermoelectric figure of merit.</description>

      <title>Evaluating fracture energy predictions using phase-field and gradient-enhanced damage models for elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the phase field method has been increasingly used for brittle fractures in soft materials like polymers, elastomers, and biological tissues. When considering finite deformations to account for the highly deformable nature of soft materials, the convergence of the phase-field method becomes challenging, especially in scenarios of unstable crack growth. To overcome these numerical difficulties, several approaches have been introduced, with artificial viscosity being among the most widely utilized. This study investigates the energy release rate due to crack propagation in hyperelastic nearly-incompressible materials and compares the phase-field method and a novel gradient-enhanced damage (GED) approach. First, we simulate unstable loading scenarios using the phase-field method, which leads to convergence problems. To address these issues, we introduce artificial viscosity to stabilize the problem and analyze its impact on the energy release rate utilizing a domain J-integral approach giving quantitative measurements during crack propagation. It is observed that the measured energy released rate during crack propagation does not comply with the imposed critical energy release rate, and shows non-monotonic behavior. In the second part of the paper, we introduce a novel stretch-based GED model as an alternative to the phase-field method for modeling crack evolution in elastomers. It is demonstrated that in this method, the energy release rate can be obtained as an output of the simulation rather than as an input which could be useful in the exploration of rate-dependent responses, as one could directly impose chain-level criteria for damage initiation. We show that while this novel approach provides reasonable results for fracture simulations, it still suffers from some numerical issues that strain-based GED formulations are known to be susceptible to.</description>

      <title>All optical excitation of spin polarization in d-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered altermagnets exhibit collinear magnetic order with zero net magnetization but with unconventional spin-polarized d/g/i-wave band structures, expanding the known paradigms of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. In addition to novel current-driven electronic transport effects, the unconventional time-reversal symmetry breaking in these systems also makes it possible to obtain a spin response to linearly polarized fields in the optical frequency domain. We show through ab-initio calculations of the prototypical d-wave altermagnet RuO$_2$, with $[C_2\|C_{4z}]$ symmetry combining twofold spin rotation with fourfold lattice rotation, that there is an optical analogue of a spin splitter effect, as the coupling to a linearly polarized exciting laser field makes the d-wave character of the altermagnet directly visible. By magneto-optical measurements on RuO$_2$ films of a few nanometer thickness, we demonstrate the predicted connection between the polarization of an ultrashort pump pulse and the sign and magnitude of a persistent optically excited electronic spin polarization. Our results point to the possibility of exciting and controlling the electronic spin polarization in altermagnets by such ultrashort optical pulses. In addition, the possibility of exciting an electronic spin polarization by linearly polarized optical fields in a compensated system is a unique consequence of the altermagnetic material properties, and our experimental results therefore present an indication for the existence of an altermagnetic phase in ultrathin RuO$_2$ films.</description>

      <title>MaterioMiner -- An ontology-based text mining dataset for extraction of process-structure-property entities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While large language models learn sound statistical representations of the language and information therein, ontologies are symbolic knowledge representations that can complement the former ideally. Research at this critical intersection relies on datasets that intertwine ontologies and text corpora to enable training and comprehensive benchmarking of neurosymbolic models. We present the MaterioMiner dataset and the linked materials mechanics ontology where ontological concepts from the mechanics of materials domain are associated with textual entities within the literature corpus. Another distinctive feature of the dataset is its eminently fine-granular annotation. Specifically, 179 distinct classes are manually annotated by three raters within four publications, amounting to a total of 2191 entities that were annotated and curated. Conceptual work is presented for the symbolic representation of causal composition-process-microstructure-property relationships. We explore the annotation consistency between the three raters and perform fine-tuning of pre-trained models to showcase the feasibility of named-entity recognition model training. Reusing the dataset can foster training and benchmarking of materials language models, automated ontology construction, and knowledge graph generation from textual data.</description>

Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a valuable characterization tool for two dimensional (2D) materials. Although some of these materials are topological, the Raman signatures of electronic band topology have remained largely unexplored. On a theoretical study of 2D massive Dirac fermions, we report a selection rule and a peculiar phase difference between the Raman tensor elements, which are sensitive to the sign of the Dirac mass. We discuss on the applicability of our results to Chern insulators and to magnetized monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Modeling Athermal Phonons in Novel Materials using the G4CMP Simulation Toolkit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding phonon and charge propagation in superconducting devices plays an important role in both performing low-threshold dark matter searches and limiting correlated errors in superconducting qubits. The Geant4 Condensed Matter Physics (G4CMP) package, originally developed for the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment, models charge and phonon transport within silicon and germanium detectors and has been validated by experimental measurements of phonon caustics, mean charge-carrier drift velocities, and heat pulse propagation times. In this work, we present a concise framework for expanding the capabilities for phonon transport to a number of other novel substrate materials of interest to the dark matter and quantum computing communities, including sapphire (Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$), gallium arsenide (GaAs), lithium fluoride (LiF), calcium tungstate (CaWO$_{4}$), and calcium fluoride (CaF$_{2}$). We demonstrate the use of this framework in generating phonon transport properties of these materials and compare these properties with experimentally-determined values where available.</description>

      <title>A High-Temperature Thermocouple Development by Additive Manufacturing: Tungsten-Nickel (W-Ni) and Molybdenum (Mo) Integration with Ceramic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing holds more potential to enable the development of ceramic-based components. Ceramics offer high resistance to heat, high fracture toughness, and are extremely corrosion resistant. Thus, ceramics are widely used in sectors such as the aerospace industry, automotive, microelectronics, and biomedicine. Using various additive manufacturing platforms, ceramics with complex and uniquely designed geometry can be developed to suit specific applications. This project aims at innovating high-temperature thermocouples by embedding conductive metal pastes into a ceramic structure. The paste used includes tungsten, molybdenum, and antimony. The metal pastes are precisely extruded into a T-shaped trench inside the ceramic matrix. Following specific temperature ranges, the ceramic matrix is sintered to improve the properties of the material. The sensors produced can function at extremely high temperatures and are thereby suitable for high-temperature environments. Comparative testing of the 3D sintered sensors with conventional temperature sensors shows high correlation between the two classes of sensors. The resulting R-squared value of 0.9885 is satisfactory which implies the reliability and accuracy of 3D sintering sensors are satisfactory in temperature sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Hidden photoexcitations probed by multi-pulse photoluminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved photoluminescence is a validated method for tracking the photoexcited carrier dynamics in luminescent materials. This technique probes the photoluminescence decays upon a periodic excitation by short laser pulses. Herein, we demonstrate that this approach cannot directly detect hidden photoexcitations with much slower dynamics than the photoluminescence decay. We demonstrate a new method based on a multi-pulse excitation scheme that enables an unambiguous detection and an easily interpreted tracking of these hidden species. The multi-pulse excitation consists of a single pulse (Read) followed by a burst of many closely separated pulses (Write) and finally another single pulse (Read). To illustrate the efficacy of the Read-Write-Read excitation scheme, we apply it to metal halide perovskites to directly visualize carrier trapping, extract the concentration of trapped charges and determine the rate constant of trap depopulation. The developed approach allows studying performance-limiting processes in energy devices using a versatile, highly applicable all-optical method.</description>

      <title>Generalised Brillouin Zone for Non-Reciprocal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been observed that the Floquet-Bloch transform with real quasiperiodicities fails to capture the spectral properties of non-reciprocal systems. The aim of this paper is to introduce the notion of a generalised Brillouin zone by allowing the quasiperiodicities to be complex in order to rectify this. It is proved that this shift of the Brillouin zone into the complex plane accounts for the unidirectional spatial decay of the eigenmodes and leads to correct spectral convergence properties. The results in this paper clarify and prove rigorously how the spectral properties of a finite structure are associated with those of the corresponding semi-infinitely or infinitely periodic lattices and give explicit characterisations of how to extend the Hermitian theory to non-reciprocal settings. Based on our theory, we characterise the generalised Brillouin zone for both open boundary conditions and periodic boundary conditions. Our results are consistent with the physical literature and give explicit generalisations to the $k$-Toeplitz matrix cases.</description>

      <title>Disorder Driven Non-Anderson Transition in a Weyl Semimetal</title>

Abstract: For several decades, it was widely believed that a non-interacting disordered electronic system could only undergo an Anderson metal-insulator transition due to Anderson localization. However, numerous recent theoretical works have predicted the existence of a disorder-driven non-Anderson phase transition that differ from Anderson localization. The frustration lies in the fact that this non-Anderson disorder-driven transition has not yet been experimentally demonstrated in any system. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we present a case study of observing the non-Anderson disorder-driven transition by visualizing the electronic structure of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi on surfaces with varying amounts of disorder. Our observations reveal that strong disorder can effectively suppress all surface states in the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi, including the topological surface Fermi arcs. This disappearance of surface Fermi arcs is associated with the vanishing of the bulk topological invariant, indicating a quantum phase transition from a Weyl semimetal to a diffusive metal. By analyzing the changes in the electronic structure of NdAlSi, as the surface degrades, we provide a physical picture of this non-Anderson transition from a Weyl semimetal to a diffuse metal. These observations provide the first direct experimental evidence of the non-Anderson disorder-driven transition, a discovery long anticipated by theoretical physicists. The finding dispels longstanding suspicions among researchers that non-Anderson transitions exist in real quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Secondary and Backscattered Electron Energy Spectra and Yields Analysis: from Theory to Applications</title>

Abstract: Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made significant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and transport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial resolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and electron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample preparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate theoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer simulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a rapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such as electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs, nanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and computational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur when charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single and collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the generation of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the irradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio methods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion systems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in energy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for the accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative approach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and secondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and dielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of irradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological significance.</description>

      <title>Electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and viscosity of Fe-H alloys at Earth's core conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport properties (electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and viscosity) of iron-hydrogen alloy are of great significance in the stability and evolution of planetary magnetic fields. Here, we investigate the thermal transport properties of iron doped with varying hydrogen content as functions of pressure (P) and temperature (T) for the top and bottom of Earth's outer core and beyond, corresponding to pressures of about 130 to 300 GPa and temperatures of 4000 to 7000 K. Using first-principles density functional theory molecular dynamic simulations (FPMD), we verify that crystalline FeH$_x$ is superionic with H diffusing freely. We find a low frequency viscosity of 10-11 mPa$\cdot$s for liquid Fe-H alloys at Earth's outer core conditions by the linear response Green-Kubo formula. Using the KKR method within density functional theory (DFT) plus Dynamical mean-field Theory (DMFT), we find saturation of electrical resistivity with increasing temperatures in liquid iron at outer core conditions. The effect of H on electrical and thermal transport we find is small, so that the exact H content of the core is not needed. The primary effect of H is on the equation of state, decreasing the density at constant P and T. We find the Lorenz number is smaller than the ideal value, and obtain for X(H)= 0.20, or 0.45 wt% H , thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of $\sim$105 and $\sim$190 $Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$, respectively, at conditions near the core-mantle and inner-outer core boundary.</description>

      <title>Multiple Floquet Chern insulator phases in the spin-charge coupled triangular-lattice ferrimagnet: Crucial role of higher-order terms in the high-frequency expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of photoirradiation with circularly polarized light on the Dirac half-metal state induced by the ferrimagnetic order in a triangular Kondo-lattice model. Our analysis based on the Floquet theory reveals that two types of Floquet Chern insulator phases appear as photoinduced nonequilibrium steady states and that these two phases can be experimentally detected and distinguished by measurements of the Hall conductivity. It is elucidated that these rich nonequilibrium topological phases come from higher-order terms in the high-frequency expansion called Brillouin-Wigner expansion, which is in striking contrast to usually discussed Floquet Chern insulator phases originating from the lowest-order terms of the expansion. So far, the lattice electron models on simple non-multipartite lattices such as triangular lattices and square lattices have not been regarded as targets of the Floquet engineering because the lowest-order terms of the high-frequency expansion for Floquet effective Hamiltonians cancel each other to vanish in these systems. Our findings of the Floquet Chern insulator phases in a triangular Kondo-lattice model are expected to expand the range of potential models and even materials targeted by the Floquet engineering.</description>
