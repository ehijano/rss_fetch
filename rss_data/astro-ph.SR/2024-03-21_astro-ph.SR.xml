      <title>At least one in a dozen stars exhibits evidence of planetary ingestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar chemical compositions can be altered by ingestion of planetary material and/or planet formation which removes refractory material from the proto-stellar disc. These "planet signatures" appear as correlations between elemental abundance differences and the dust condensation temperature. Detecting these planet signatures, however, is challenging due to unknown occurrence rates, small amplitudes, and heterogeneous star samples with large differences in stellar ages, and therefore stars born together (i.e., co-natal) with identical compositions can facilitate such detections. While previous spectroscopic studies were limited to small number of binary stars, the Gaia satellite provides new opportunities for detecting stellar chemical signatures of planets among co-moving pairs of stars confirmed to be co-natal. Here we report high-precision chemical abundances for a homogeneous sample of 91 co-natal pairs of stars with a well-defined selection function and identify at least seven new instances of planetary ingestion, corresponding to an occurrence rate of 8%. An independent Bayesian indicator is deployed, which can effectively disentangle the planet signatures from other factors, such as random abundance variation and atomic diffusion. Our study provides new evidence of planet signatures and facilitates a deeper understanding of the star-planet-chemistry connection by providing new observational constraints on the mechanisms of planet engulfment, formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Application of hydrostatic LTE atmosphere models to interpretation of supersoft X-ray sources spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-soft X-ray sources (SSSs) are accreting white dwarfs (WDs) with stable or recurrent thermonuclear burning on their surfaces. High resolution X-ray spectra of such objects are rather complex, can consist of several components, and are difficult to interpret accurately. The main emission source is the hot surface of the WD, and the emergent radiation can potentially be described by hot WD model atmospheres. We present a new set of such model atmosphere spectra computed in the effective temperature range from $100\rm\,kK$ to $1000\rm\,kK$, for eight values of surface gravity, and three different chemical compositions. These compositions correspond to the solar one and to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds with decreased heavy element abundances, at one-half and one-tenth of the solar value. The presented model grid covers a broad range of physical parameters, and thus can be applied to a wide range of objects. It is also publicly available in XSPEC format. As an illustration, we applied it here for the interpretation of Chandra and XMM grating spectra of two classical SSSs, namely, CAL$\,83$ (RX$\,$J0543.5$-$6823) and RX$\,$J0513.9$-$6951. The obtained effective temperatures and surface gravities of $T_{\rm eff} \approx 560\,$kK, $\log g \approx 8.6-8.7$, and $T_{\rm eff} \approx 630 {\rm kK}, \log g \approx 8.5-8.6$, respectively, are in a good agreement with previous estimations for both sources. Derived WD~mass estimations are within $1.1-1.4\,M_\odot$ for CAL 83 and $1.15-1.4\, M_\odot$ for RX$\,$J0513.9$-$6951. The mass of the WD in CAL$\,83$ is consistent with the mass predicted from the respective model of recurrent thermonuclear burning.</description>

      <title>The enigmatic origin of two dormant BH binaries: Gaia BH1 and Gaia BH2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two systems that have been confirmed as dormant (no X-ray emission detected) black hole (BH) - low-mass star binaries (Gaia BH1 and Gaia BH2) in the latest Gaia mission data release (DR3) are very intriguing in the context of their evolution. Both systems consist of $\sim 9 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ BH and $\sim 1 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ star orbiting each other on a wide, eccentric orbit ($e\sim 0.5$). We argue that the formation of Gaia BH-like systems through the isolated binary evolution (IBE) channel under standard common envelope assumptions and from dynamical interactions in young massive and open clusters is equally probable, and the formation rate of those binaries is on order of $10^{-7} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}^{-1}$ in both channels. What plays an important role in formation of Gaia BH-like systems in the case of IBE channel is the mutual position of the natal kick velocity vector and the binary angular momentum vector. We find that the natal kicks of median magnitude $\sim 40$ km/s are preferred for the formation of Gaia BH1-like binaries. $\sim 94\%$ of those binaries is formed with BH spin misaligned to orbital axis by less than $40^{\circ}$. Gaia BH2-like binaries form if the low velocity natal kick (of median magnitude $\sim 20$ km/s) is directed within $15^{\circ}$ about the orbital plane. We follow the subsequent evolution of the binaries once formed as Gaia BH1 and Gaia BH2 systems to investigate their connection with the low-mass X-ray binary population.</description>

      <title>The Brown Dwarf Kinematics Project (BDKP). VI. Ultracool Dwarf Radial and Rotational Velocities from SDSS/APOGEE High-resolution Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present precise measurements of radial (RV) and projected rotational ($v\sin{i}$) velocities, effective temperatures, and surface gravities of a sample of 258 M6 to L2 dwarfs with multi-epoch, high-resolution ($\lambda/\Delta\lambda$ = 22500), near-infrared (1.514-1.696 $\mu$m) spectroscopic observations reported in the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) Data Release 17. The spectra were modeled using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo forward-modeling method which achieved median precisions of $\sigma_\text{RV}$ = 0.4 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sigma_{v\sin{i}}$ = 1.1 km s$^{-1}$. One-half of our sample (138 sources) are previously known members of nearby young clusters and moving groups, and we identified three new kinematic members of the Argus or Carina Near moving groups, 2MASS J05402570+2448090, 2MASS J14093200+4138080, and 2MASS J21272531+5553150. Excluding these sources, we find that the majority of our sample has kinematics consistent with the Galactic thin disk, and eleven sources are associated with the intermediate thin/thick disk. The field sample has a velocity dispersion of 38.2$\pm$0.3 km s$^{-1}$, equivalent to an age of 3.30$\pm$0.19 Gyr based on empirical age-velocity dispersion relations; and a median $v\sin{i}$ of 17 km s$^{-1}$. For 172 sources with multi-epoch observations, we identified 37 as having significant radial velocity variations, and determined preliminary orbit parameters for 26 sources with four or more epochs. For 40 sources with photometric variability periods from the literature less than 5 days and $v\sin{i}$ $&gt;$ 20 km s$^{-1}$, we find a decline in projected radii $R\sin{i}$ with age congruent with evolutionary models. Finally, we also present multi-epoch RV and vsini measurements for additional 444 candidate ultracool dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The VELOCE Modulation Zoo I. Spectroscopic detection of non-radial modes in the first-overtone Cepheids BG Crucis, QZ Normae, V0391 Normae, and V0411 Lacertae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photometric observations from the recent decade revolutionized our view on classical pulsators. Low-amplitude signals have been detected photometrically in addition to the dominant high-amplitude radial mode pulsations in many RR Lyrae stars and classical Cepheids. First overtone (1O) pulsators with an additional low-amplitude signal at a period ratio of around 0.61 with the main mode, the so-called 0.61 stars, form the most populous group among these stars. The nature of this signal has been attributed to non-radial pulsations. Another mysterious group are stars, where the additional signal forms a period ratio of around 0.68 - the 0.68 stars. The origin of the signal remains unknown. Here, we search for similar phenomena in spectroscopic observations of 1O classical Cepheids collected as part of the VELOCE project. We performed frequency analysis of several parameters derived from cross-correlation functions (CCFs), including radial velocity, FWHM, bisector inverse span, and CCF depth. Using standard prewhitening, we searched for additional low-amplitude signals. We identify the location of these stars in various sequences of the Petersen diagram. We detect additional signals in four 1O classical Cepheids: BG Cru, QZ Nor, V391 Nor, and V411 Lac. We classified BG Cru, QZ Nor, and V391 Nor as 0.61 stars based on period ratios. V411 Lac, however, exhibits a ratio of 0.68 between the two modes, and the additional signal has a longer period. This kind of multiperiodicity remains unexplained. VELOCE CCFs yield the first spectroscopic detections of non-radial pulsation modes in classical Cepheids. This opens an asteroseismic window for pursuing a more detailed understanding of these important stars. While the 0.61 signal of BG Cru, QZ Nor, V391 Nor is understood to originate due to non-radial modes of moderate degrees, the 0.68 signal of V411 Lac still lacks a physical explanation.</description>

      <title>Stars: Evolution, Stability and Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews the physics of stars, the type, structure, evolution and stability. Simple thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are used to show the inner working of white dwarf and neutron stars. The major concentration of the paper will be on white dwarf stars although in some places references will also be made to neutron stars where the relations can be extended easily. It can be shown that a maximum mass limit is attached to each type of star which can be derived rigorously. Maximum entropy can be used to show that the gravitational contraction is balanced by the degeneracy pressure created by the electrons in the case of white dwarfs, and neutrons and protons which constitute the matter of the neutron star. Finally the kinetic equations which describe the luminosity of the star and the radiative transfer are introduced.</description>

      <title>Sites of Planet Formation in Binary Systems. I. Evidence for Disk-Orbit Alignment in the Close Binary FO Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Close binary systems present challenges to planet formation. As binary separations decrease, so too do the occurrence rates of protoplanetary disks in young systems and planets in mature systems. For systems that do retain disks, their disk masses and sizes are altered by the presence of the binary companion. Through the study of protoplanetary disks in binary systems with known orbital parameters, we seek to determine the properties that promote disk retention and, therefore, planet formation. In this work, we characterize the young binary-disk system, FO Tau. We determine the first full orbital solution for the system, finding masses of $0.35^{+0.06}_{-0.05}\ M_\odot$ and $0.34\pm0.05\ M_\odot$ for the stellar components, a semi-major axis of $22(^{+2}_{-1})$ AU, and an eccentricity of $0.21(^{+0.04}_{-0.03})$. With long-baseline ALMA interferometry, we detect 1.3mm continuum and $^{12}{\mathrm{CO}} \ (J=2-1)$ line emission toward each of the binary components; no circumbinary emission is detected. The protoplanetary disks are compact, consistent with being truncated by the binary orbit. The dust disks are unresolved in the image plane and the more extended gas disks are only marginally resolved. Fitting the continuum and CO visibilities, we determine the inclination of each disk, finding evidence for alignment of the disk and binary orbital planes. This study is the first of its kind linking the properties of circumstellar protoplanetary disks to a precisely known binary orbit. In the case of FO Tau, we find a dynamically placid environment (coplanar, low eccentricity), which may foster its potential for planet formation.</description>

      <title>Combining Gaia and GRAVITY: Characterising Five New Directly Detected Substellar Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise mass constraints are vital for the characterisation of brown dwarfs and exoplanets. Here, we present how the combination of data obtained by Gaia and GRAVITY can help enlarge the sample of substellar companions with measured dynamical masses. We show how the Non-Single-Star (NSS) two-body orbit catalogue contained in Gaia DR3 can be used to inform high angular resolution follow-up observations with GRAVITY. Applying the method presented in this work for eight Gaia candidate systems, we detect all eight predicted companions, seven of which being previously unknown and five of substellar nature. Among the sample is Gaia DR3 2728129004119806464 B, which - detected at a angular separation of (34.01 $\pm$ 0.15) mas from the host - is the closest substellar companion ever imaged. In combination with the system's distance this translates to a physical separation of (1.054 $\pm$ 0.002) AU. The GRAVITY data are then used to break the host-companion mass degeneracy inherent to the Gaia NSS orbit solutions as well as to constrain the orbital solutions of the respective target systems. Knowledge of the companion masses enables us to further characterise them in terms of their age, effective temperature and radius by the application of evolutionary models. The results serve as an independent validation of the orbital solutions published in the NSS two-body orbit catalogue and show that the combination of astrometric survey missions and high-angular resolution direct imaging hold great promise for efficiently increasing the sample of directly-imaged companions in the future, especially in the light of the Gaia's upcoming DR4 and the advent of GRAVITY+.</description>

      <title>Tracing back the birth environments of Type Ia supernova progenitor stars: A pilot study based on 44 early-type host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The environmental dependence of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities is well-established, and efforts are being made to find its origin. Previous studies typically use the currently-observed status of the host galaxy. However, given the delay time between the birth of the progenitor star and the SN Ia explosion, the currently-observed status may differ from the birth environments of the SN Ia progenitor star. In this paper, employing the chemical evolution and accurately determined stellar population properties of 44 early-type host galaxies, we, for the first time, estimate the SN Ia progenitor star birth environment, specifically $[Fe/H]_{Birth}$ and $[\alpha/Fe]_{Birth}$. We show that $[\alpha/Fe]_{Birth}$ has a $30.4^{+10.6}_{-10.1}\%$ wider range than $[\alpha/Fe]_{Current}$, while the range of $[Fe/H]_{Birth}$ is not statistically different ($17.9^{+26.0}_{-27.1}\%$) to that of $[Fe/H]_{Current}$. The birth and current environments of [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] are sample from different populations (p-values of the KS test &lt; 0.01). We find that light-curve fit parameters are insensitive to $[Fe/H]_{Birth}$ ($&lt;0.9\sigma$ for the non-zero slope), while a linear trend is observed with HRs at the 2.4$\sigma$ significance level. With $[\alpha/Fe]_{Birth}$, no linear trends ($&lt;1.1\sigma$) are observed. Interestingly, we find that $[\alpha/Fe]_{Birth}$ clearly splits the SN Ia sample into two groups: SN Ia exploded in $[\alpha/Fe]_{Birth}$-rich or $[\alpha/Fe]_{Birth}$-poor environments. SNe Ia exploded in different $[\alpha/Fe]_{Birth}$ groups have different weighted-means of light-curve shape parameters: $0.81\pm0.33$ ($2.5\sigma$). They are thought to be drawn from different populations (p-value = 0.01). Regarding SN Ia colour and HRs, there is no difference in the weighted-means ($&lt;1.0\sigma$) and distributions (p-value &gt; 0.27) of each $[\alpha/Fe]_{Birth}$ group.</description>

      <title>Chemical Diversity on Small Scales -- Abundance Analysis of the Tucana V Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing number of Milky Way satellites detected in recent years has introduced a new focus for stellar abundance analysis. Abundances of stars in satellites have been used to probe the nature of these systems and their chemical evolution. However, for most satellites, only centrally located stars have been examined. This paper presents an analysis of three stars in the Tucana V system, one in the inner region and two at $\sim$10\arcmin\ (7--10 half-light radii) from the center. We find a remarkable chemical diversity between the stars. One star exhibits enhancements in rapid neutron-capture elements (an $r$-I star), and another is highly enhanced in C, N, and O but with low neutron-capture abundances (a CEMP-no star). The metallicities of the stars analyzed span more than 1~dex from $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-3.55$ to $-2.46$. This, combined with a large abundance range of other elements like Ca, Sc, and Ni, confirms that Tuc~V is an ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy. The variation in abundances, highlighted by [Mg/Ca] ratios ranging from $+0.89$ to $-0.75$, among the stars, demonstrates that the chemical enrichment history of Tuc~V was very inhomogeneous. Tuc~V is only the second UFD galaxy in which stars located at large distances from the galactic center have been analyzed, along with Tucana~II. The chemical diversity seen in these two galaxies, driven by the composition of the non-central member stars, suggests that distant member stars are important to include when classifying faint satellites and that these systems may have experienced more complex chemical enrichment histories than previously anticipated.</description>

      <title>Outward Migration in Nascent Stellar Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a stellar group forms within its parent molecular cloud, new members first appear in the deep interior. These overcrowded stars continually diffuse outward to the cloud boundary, and even beyond. Observations have so far documented only the interior drift. Those stars that actually leave the cloud form an expanding envelope that I call the "stellar mantle." Simple fluid models for the cloud and mantle illustrate their basic structure. The mantle's expansion speed is subsonic with respect to the cloud's dynamical temperature. I describe, in qualitative terms, how the expanding mantle and Galactic tidal radius might together shape the evolution of specific types of stellar groups. The massive stars in OB associations form in clouds that contract before extruding a substantial mantle. In contrast, the more slowly evolving clouds forming open clusters and T associations have extended mantles that encounter a shrinking tidal radius. These clouds are dispersed by internal stellar outflows. If the remaining group of stars is gravitationally bound, it appears as a long-lived open cluster, truncated by the tidal radius. If the group is unbound, it is a late-stage T association that will soon be torn apart by the tidal force. The "distributed" populations of pre-main~sequence stars observed in the outskirts of several star-forming regions are too distant to be stellar mantles. Rather, they could be the remnants of especially low-mass T associations.</description>

      <title>Gas inflows from cloud to core scales in G332.83-0.55: Hierarchical hub-filament structures and tide-regulated gravitational collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The massive star-forming region G332.83-0.55 contains at least two levels of hub-filament structures. The hub-filament structures may form through the "gravitational focusing" process. High-resolution LAsMA and ALMA observations can directly trace the gas inflows from cloud to core scales. We investigated the effects of shear and tides from the protocluster on the surrounding local dense gas structures. Our results seem to deny the importance of shear and tides from the protocluster. However, for a gas structure, it bears the tidal interactions from all external material, not only the protocluster. To fully consider the tidal interactions, we derived the tide field according to the surface density distribution. Then, we used the average strength of the external tidal field of a structure to measure the total tidal interactions that are exerted on it. For comparison, we also adopted an original pixel-by-pixel computation to estimate the average tidal strength for each structure. Both methods give comparable results. After considering the total tidal interactions, the slope of the $\sigma-N*R$ relation changes from 0.20 to 0.52, close to 0.5 of the pure free-fall gravitational collapse, and the correlation also becomes stronger. Thus, the deformation due to the external tides can effectively slow down the pure free-fall gravitational collapse of gas structures. The external tide tries to tear up the structure, but the external pressure on the structure prevents this process. The counterbalance between the external tide and external pressure hinders the free-fall gravitational collapse of the structure, which can also cause the pure free-fall gravitational collapse to be slowed down. These mechanisms can be called "tide-regulated gravitational collapse."</description>

      <title>MINDS. The DR Tau disk I: combining JWST-MIRI data with high-resolution CO spectra to characterise the hot gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MRS mode of the JWST-MIRI instrument has been shown to be a powerful tool to characterise the molecular gas emission of the inner region of planet-forming disks. Here, we analyse the spectrum of the compact T-Tauri disk DR Tau, which is complemented by high spectral resolution (R~60000-90000) CO ro-vibrational observations. Various molecular species, including CO, CO$_2$, HCN, and C$_2$H$_2$ are detected in the JWST-MIRI spectrum, for which excitation temperatures of T~325-900 K are retrieved using LTE slab models. The high-resolution CO observations allow for a full treatment of the line profiles, which show evidence for two components of the main isotopologue, $^{12}$CO: a broad component tracing the Keplerian disk and a narrow component tracing a slow disk wind. Rotational diagrams yield excitation temperatures of T&gt;725 K for CO, with consistently lower temperatures found for the narrow components, suggesting that the disk wind is launched from a larger distance. The inferred excitation temperatures for all molecules suggest that CO originates from the highest atmospheric layers close to the host star, followed by HCN and C$_2$H$_2$, which emit, together with $^{13}$CO, from slightly deeper layers, whereas the CO$_2$ originates from even deeper inside or further out in the disk. Additional analysis of the $^{12}$CO line wings hint at a misalignment between the inner (i~20 degrees) and outer disk (i~5 degrees). Finally, we emphasise the need for complementary high-resolution CO observations, as in combination with the JWST-MIRI observations they can be used to characterise the CO kinematics and the physical and chemical conditions of the other observed molecules with respect to CO.</description>

      <title>The bicoherence study of quasi-periodic oscillations in MAXI J1535-571</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bicoherence is a way to measure the phase coupling of triplets of Fourier frequencies. We use this method to analyze quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1535$-$571 during its 2017 September-October outburst. The bicoherence provides an interesting new diagnostic to uncover QPO behaviour and the relationships between QPO harmonics and broadband noise. The bicoherence pattern of type-C QPOs starts as a 'web' pattern and changes to a 'hypotenuse' pattern after the presence of type-B QPOs, indicating that MAXI J1535$-$571 is a low-inclination source. The intensity of bicoherence also exhibits variations across different energy bands. We try to explain the bicoherence results in the scenario of a dual-corona geometry.</description>

      <title>The Mass Dependence of H{\alpha} Emission and Stellar Spindown for Fully Convective M Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully convective M dwarfs typically remain rapidly rotating and magnetically active for billions of years, followed by an abrupt and mass-dependent transition to slow rotation and quiescence. A robust understanding of this process is complicated by difficulties in estimating M-dwarf ages and potential dependencies on other variables such as birth environment or metallicity. To isolate the effect of mass, we consider M dwarfs in wide binaries. We identify 67 widely separated, fully convective (0.08-0.35M$_\odot$) M-dwarf binary systems using Gaia and measure the H$\alpha$ feature for each component. We classify the pairs into three categories: systems where both components are active, systems where both are inactive, and candidate transition systems, where one component is active and the other inactive. We gather higher-resolution spectra of the candidate transition systems to verify that their behavior does not result from an unresolved third component, yielding one new triple with surprising activity levels. Neglecting this triple, we find 22 active, 36 inactive, and 8 transition pairs. Our results are consistent with the epoch of spindown for these binaries being primarily determined by mass, with mild second-order effects; we place a 1$\sigma$ upper limit of 0.5Gyr or 25% on the dispersion in the mass-dependent spindown relation. Our findings suggest that the large dispersion in spindown epoch previously observed for field stars of a given mass may stem from differences in birth environment, in addition to modest intrinsic stochasticity. We also see evidence that the wide binary population is dispersed over time due to dynamical processing.</description>

      <title>The effect of ultra-violet photon pumping of H$_2$ in dust-deficient protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform radiation hydrodynamics simulations to study the structure and evolution of a photoevaporating protoplanetary disk. Ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from the host star heats the disk surface, where H$_2$ pumping also operates efficiently. We run a set of simulations with varying the amount of dust grains, or the dust-to-gas mass ratio, which determines the relative importance between photoelectric heating and H$_2$ pumping. We show that H$_2$ pumping and X-ray heating contribute stronger to the mass-loss of the disk if the dust-to-gas mass ratio is $\mathcal{D}\leq10^{-3}$.The disk mass loss rate decreases with a lower dust amount, but remains around $10^{-10-11} M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1}$. In such dust-deficient disks, H$_2$ pumping enhances photoevaporation from the inner disk region and shapes the disk mass-loss profile. We thus argue that the late-stage disk evolution is affected by the ultra-violet H$_2$ pumping effect. The mass-loss rates derived from our simulations can be used in the study of long-term disk evolution.</description>

      <title>Study of Magnetic Field and Turbulence in the TeV halo around Monogem Pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium, including extended objects such as supernova remnants and diffuse halos around Pulsars. Its turbulent characteristics govern the diffusion of cosmic rays and the multi-wavelength emission from PWNe. However, the geometry and turbulence nature of the magnetic fields in the ambient region of PWN is still unknown. Recent gamma-ray observations from HAWC and synchrotron observations suggest a highly suppressed diffusion coefficient compared to the mean interstellar value. In this study, we present the first direct observational evidence of the orientation of the mean magnetic field and turbulent characteristics by employing a recently developed statistical parameter `Y$_{turb}$' in the extended halo around the Monogem pulsar. Our study points two possible scenarios: nearly aligned toward the line of sight (LoS) with compressible modes dominance or high inclination angle toward LoS and characterized by Alfv\'enic turbulence. The first scenario appears consistent with other observational signatures. Furthermore, we report that the magnetic field has an observed correlation length of approximately $3 \pm 0.6 {\rm pc}$ in the Monogem halo. Our study highlights the pivotal role of magnetic field and turbulence in unraveling the physical processes in TeV halos and cosmic ray transport.</description>

      <title>SN 2020zbf: A fast-rising hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova with strong carbon lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SN\,2020zbf is a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN) at $z = 0.1947$ that shows conspicuous \ion{C}{II} features at early times, in contrast to the majority of H-poor SLSNe. Its peak magnitude is $M_{\rm g}$ = $-21.2$~mag and its rise time ($\lesssim 26.4$ days from first light) places SN\,2020zbf among the fastest rising type I SLSNe. We used spectra taken from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared wavelengths to identify spectral features. We paid particular attention to the \ion{C}{II} lines as they present distinctive characteristics when compared to other events. We also analyzed UV and optical photometric data and modeled the light curves considering three different powering mechanisms: radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni, magnetar spin-down, and circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction. The spectra of SN\,2020zbf match the model spectra of a C-rich low-mass magnetar-powered supernova model well. This is consistent with our light curve modeling, which supports a magnetar-powered event with an ejecta mass $M_{\rm ej}$ = 1.5~$\rm M_\odot$. However, we cannot discard the CSM-interaction model as it may also reproduce the observed features. The interaction with H-poor, carbon-oxygen CSM near peak light could explain the presence of \ion{C}{II} emission lines. A short plateau in the light curve around 35 -- 45 days after peak, in combination with the presence of an emission line at 6580~\AA,\ can also be interpreted as being due to a late interaction with an extended H-rich CSM. Both the magnetar and CSM-interaction models of SN\,2020zbf indicate that the progenitor mass at the time of explosion is between 2 and 5~$\rm M_\odot$. Modeling the spectral energy distribution of the host galaxy reveals a host mass of 10$^{8.7}$~$\rm M_\odot$, a star formation rate of 0.24$^{+0.41}_{-0.12}$~$\rm M_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$, and a metallicity of $\sim$ 0.4~$\rm Z_\odot$.</description>

      <title>X-ray diagnostics of Cassiopeia A's "Green Monster": evidence for dense shocked circumstellar plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent survey of the core-collapse supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (CasA) with the MIRI instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) revealed a large structure in the interior region, referred to as the "Green Monster". Although its location suggests that it is an ejecta structure, the infrared properties of the "Green Monster" hint at a circumstellar medium (CSM) origin. In this companion paper to the JWST Cas A paper, we investigate the filamentary X-ray structures associated with the "Green Monster" using Chandra X-ray Observatory data. We extracted spectra along the "Green Monster" as well as from shocked CSM regions. Both the extracted spectra and a principal component analysis show that the "Green Monster" emission properties are similar to those of the shocked CSM. The spectra are well-fit by a model consisting of a combination of a non-equilibrium-ionization model and a power-law component, modified by Galactic absorption. All the "Green Monster" spectra show a blueshift corresponding to a radial velocity of around -2300 km/s, suggesting that the structure is on the near side of Cas A. The ionization age is around $n_{e}t = 1.5 \times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}s. This translates into a pre-shock density of ~12 cm$^{-3}$, higher than previous estimates of the unshocked CSM. The relatively high net and relatively low radial velocity suggest that this structure has a relatively high density compared to other shocked CSM plasma. This analysis provides yet another piece of evidence that the CSM around Cas A's progenitor was not that of a smooth steady wind profile.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Helium and Hydrogen Accretion Indicators at TWA 27B: Weak Mass Flow at Near-Freefall Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04763v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TWA 27B (2M1207b) is the first directly-imaged planetary-mass (MP ~ 5 MJ) companion (Chauvin et al. 2004) and was observed at 0.9--5.3 micron with JWST/NIRSpec (Luhman et al. 2023). To understand the accretion properties of TWA 27B, we search for continuum-subtracted near-infrared helium and hydrogen emission lines and measure their widths and luminosities. We detect the He I triplet at 4.3 sigma and all Paschen-series lines covered by NIRSpec (Pa alpha, Pa beta, Pa gamma, Pa delta) at 4--5 sigma. The three brightest Brackett-series lines (Br alpha, Br beta, Br gamma) as well as Pf gamma and Pf delta are tentative detections at 2--3 sigma. We provide upper limits on the other hydrogen lines, including on H alpha through Hubble Space Telescope archival data. Three lines can be reliably deconvolved to reveal an intrinsic width Delta v = 67+-9 km/s, which is 60% of the surface freefall velocity. The line luminosities seem significantly too high to be due to chromospheric activity. Converting line luminosities to an accretion rate yields Mdot ~ 5e-9 MJ/yr when using scaling relationships for planetary masses, and Mdot ~ 0.1e-9 MJ/yr with extrapolated stellar scalings. Several of these lines represent first detections at an accretor of such low mass. The weak accretion rate implies that formation is likely over. This analysis shows that JWST can be used to measure low line-emitting mass accretion rates onto planetary-mass objects, motivates deeper searches for the mass reservoir feeding TWA 27B, and hints that other young directly-imaged objects might -- hitherto unbeknownst -- also be accreting.</description>

      <title>Enrichment by Extragalactic First Stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the Milky Way's most massive satellite galaxy, which only recently (~2 billion years ago) fell into our Galaxy. Since stellar atmospheres preserve their natal cloud's composition, the LMC's recent infall makes its most ancient, metal-deficient ("low-metallicity") stars unique windows into early star formation and nucleosynthesis in a formerly distant region of the high-redshift universe. Previously, identifying such stars in the LMC was challenging. But new techniques have opened this window, now enabling tests of whether the earliest element enrichment and star formation in distant, extragalactic proto-galaxies deviated from what occurred in the proto-Milky Way. Here we present the elemental abundances of 10 stars in the LMC with iron-to-hydrogen ratios ranging from ~1/300th to ~1/12,000th of the Sun. Our most metal-deficient star is 50 times more metal-deficient than any in the LMC with available detailed chemical abundance patterns, and is likely enriched by a single extragalactic first star supernova. This star lacks significant carbon-enhancement, as does our overall sample, in contrast with the lowest metallicity Milky Way stars. This, and other abundance differences, affirm that the extragalactic early LMC experienced diverging enrichment processes compared to the early Milky Way. Early element production, driven by the earliest stars, thus appears to proceed in an environment-dependent manner.</description>

      <title>White Dwarf Pollution: One Star or Two?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accretion of tidally disrupted planetary bodies is the current consensus model for the presence of photospheric metals commonly detected in white dwarfs. While most dynamical studies have considered a single star and associated planetary instabilities, several investigations have instead considered the influence of widely-bound stellar companions as potential drivers of white dwarf pollution. This study examines the prevalence of wide binaries among polluted white dwarfs using Gaia Data Release 3 astrometry, where three samples are investigated: 71 DAZ stars with metals detected in the ultraviolet using the Hubble Space Telescope, and two groups of DZ stars identified via Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy, comprised of 116 warmer and 101 cooler sources. Each sample was searched for spatially-resolved, co-moving companions, and compared to the same analysis of thousands of field white dwarfs within overlapping regions of the Gaia Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The wide binary fraction of the DAZ sample is $10.6_{-3.2}^{+3.9}$ per cent, and within $1 \sigma$ of the corresponding field. However, the search yields wide binary fractions of less than 1.8 per cent for the two independent DZ star catalogues, which are each distinct from their fields by more than $3 \sigma$. Both sets of results support that pollution in white dwarfs is not the result of stellar companions, and the delivery of metals to white dwarf surfaces is caused by major planets. The discrepancy between the DAZ and DZ star wide binary fractions cannot be caused by white dwarf spectral evolution, suggesting these two populations may have distinct planetary architectures.</description>
