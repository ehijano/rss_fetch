      <title>Superradiance and Quasinormal Modes of Massive Scalar Fields around Kerr Black Holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion Theory with Perfect Fluid Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of massive scalar fields around Kerr black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) theory, incorporating the effects of perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM), characterized by the dilaton parameter $r_2$ and the PFDM parameter $\lambda$. These parameters modify both the ergosphere and the effective potential experienced by the scalar field. Using the asymptotic matching method, we compute superradiant amplification factors, while quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies are obtained via the asymptotic iteration method (AIM). Our results reveal contrasting effects: increasing $r_2$ enhances superradiance and leads to higher QNM frequencies with greater damping, whereas increasing $\lambda$ suppresses superradiance and reduces QNM frequencies with weaker damping. In combined scenarios, the influence of $\lambda$ is found to be dominant. These findings extend the understanding of Kerr black holes in EMDA backgrounds and highlight the stabilizing role of PFDM in such systems.</description>

      <title>ER = EPR in Loop Quantum Gravity: the Immirzi Parameter and the Continuum Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recast the finite-region analysis of Einstein's equations that underpins the ER=EPR program into the loop quantum gravity (LQG) framework. By translating curvature-energy uncertainty relations into holonomy-flux kinematics, and by identifying Planckian Einstein-Rosen throats with single-puncture cuts through spin networks, we obtain a precise dictionary between entanglement and quantum geometry. Within this dictionary we derive the Barbero-Immirzi parameter directly from the entanglement/area increment of a minimal bridge, and show that a boundary edge-mode construction renders the Bekenstein - Hawking entropy coefficient universal and independent of $\gamma$ under a natural complex polarization. We further establish a refinement renormalization flow for spin-foam amplitudes driven by the finite-region curvature energy bound, which suppresses bubble divergences and yields a regulator-independent continuum limit under explicit conditions. Finally, we indicate observational consequences that follow from an $N$-party generalized uncertainty relation.</description>

      <title>Scalar fields from nonlinear sigma models on black hole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar fields with non-trivial kinetic term derived from a nonlinear sigma model are motivated by UV completions of gravity such as string theory. We discuss the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathrm{O}(3)$ sigma models with interacting potentials and simulate their full nonlinear dynamics on black hole spacetimes. We study the properties of the field as a function of the curvature of the sigma model with respect to the free massive scalar case. In the accretion process, the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ model behaves as a self-interacting field with attractive interaction, while the $\mathrm{O}(3)$ one exhibits a repulsive phenomenology. In the case of a binary black hole system, these models cause a positive or negative dephasing of the gravitational waveform, respectively, when compared to the non-interacting case and as long as the field's Compton wavelength is larger than the binary separation. We observe no bosenova emission, which suggests that nonlinearities tend to suppress this phenomenon. Our results highlight how the kinetic and potential terms are both relevant in determining the field dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Noise and Gravitational-Wave Sensitivity of the Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Earth's Moon presents a uniquely advantageous environment for detecting astrophysical gravitational waves (GWs) in the frequency range of millihertz to decihertz. Unlike Terrestrial GW detectors, the quiet seismic environment of the Moon does not impede detection in this band; in fact the ground motions of the Moon will be excited by GWs, making the Moon a resonant amplifier at low frequencies. The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA) mission aims to be limited by thermal Brownian noise in its optics across most target frequencies. By taking advantage of the lunar normal mode resonances, we show that the first phase of the mission, LILA Pioneer, achieves the GW sensitivity required to study astrophysical sources through the millihertz to decihertz range. The advanced phase of the mission, LILA Horizon, would increase GW sensitivity to the cosmological horizon in this band.</description>

      <title>Imprints of screened dark energy on non-local quantum correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.</description>

      <title>Friedmann cosmology with hyperfluids of constant equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss some aspects of cosmology in metric-affine theories of gravity where metric and affine connection are independent variables. Such constructions, apart from the usual energy-momentum tensor, have an additional source, that of hypermomentum. Working with the cosmological principle assumption, we investigate the dynamics of the hypermomentum's degrees of freedom. In particular, we focus on the case where these degrees of freedom are proportional to the matter density and discuss the cosmological evolution depending on their associated indexes.</description>

      <title>Extended black hole thermodynamics in a DGP braneworld</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended black hole thermodynamics, or ``black hole chemistry,'' is usually formulated in asymptotically AdS spacetimes by promoting the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ to a thermodynamic variable and identifying $P=-\Lambda/8\pi$ as the pressure. This approach, however, is less physically motivated: $\Lambda$ is a fixed coupling of the bulk action. Moreover, in de Sitter space, the construction is even more problematic due to the absence of a global timelike Killing vector and the presence of multiple horizons. In this work, we show that extended thermodynamics arises naturally in a Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld once the brane tension $\sigma$ is varied in the Iyer--Wald formalism. A positive-tension brane is dynamically stable, ghost-free, and induces a localized vacuum energy density $T^{(\sigma)}_{\mu\nu}=-\sigma g_{\mu\nu}$, corresponding to a negative pressure $P_\sigma=-\sigma$. On the normal branch, the brane is asymptotically flat with a well-defined ADM mass and a single black hole horizon, thereby avoiding the obstructions that arise in de Sitter. We demonstrate that varying $\sigma$ produces a new work term $V_\sigma\,\delta P_\sigma$ in the first law, with $V_\sigma$ reducing exactly to the geometric volume $4\pi r_h^3/3$ for a static spherical black hole. The associated Smarr relation is derived, and we show how asymptotic flatness can be maintained along the family of solutions by co-varying the bulk cosmological constant. Our results establish that extended black hole thermodynamics is not restricted to AdS spacetimes but also arises consistently in asymptotically flat braneworlds through brane tension, providing a new setting for black hole chemistry.</description>

      <title>Lightweight posterior construction for gravitational-wave catalogs with the Kolmogorov-Arnold network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural density estimation has seen widespread applications in the gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis, which enables real-time parameter estimation for compact binary coalescences and enhances rapid inference for subsequent analysis such as population inference. In this work, we explore the application of using the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to construct efficient and interpretable neural density estimators for lightweight posterior construction of GW catalogs. By replacing conventional activation functions with learnable splines, KAN achieves superior interpretability, higher accuracy, and greater parameter efficiency on related scientific tasks. Leveraging this feature, we propose a KAN-based neural density estimator, which ingests megabyte-scale GW posterior samples and compresses them into model weights of tens of kilobytes. Subsequently, analytic expressions requiring only several kilobytes can be further distilled from these neural network weights with minimal accuracy trade-off. In practice, GW posterior samples with fidelity can be regenerated rapidly using the model weights or analytic expressions for subsequent analysis. Our lightweight posterior construction strategy is expected to facilitate user-level data storage and transmission, paving a path for efficient analysis of numerous GW events in the next-generation GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Common Envelope Evolution of Ultralight Boson Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons can be excited around spinning black holes via black hole superradiance. These boson clouds may play an important role in the orbital evolution of binary black holes. In this work, we investigate the formation and evolution of common envelopes of ultralight boson clouds in comparable mass-ratio black hole binaries. We describe the cloud evolution using gravitational molecular eigenstates and analyze the possible level transitions during orbital decay, as well as the impact on orbital dynamics. We find that the cloud can generally lead to eccentricity growth. In particular, the eccentricity may vary significantly during level transition, leaving an eccentricity of ${\cal O}(0.1)$ within the detection band of ground-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>The periastron regression of 2M1510 AB, the jet precession of M87* and Telisto/Planet Nine: three different scenarios for a possible common cause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eclipsing binary 2M1510 AB made of two brown dwarfs, the supermassive black hole M87* and our solar system may all have in common the presence of a massive pointlike distant companion perturbing in some ways their inner dynamics. That is, respectively, a circumbinary exoplanet whose orbital plane should be perpendicular to that of its host inner binary, an intermediate mass black hole potentially causing the observed jet precession, and a still unseen planet, known as Telisto or Planet Nine, which may, perhaps, have been recently spotted in archival images although in a quite different orbit with respect to that originally expected. To this aim, the long-term rates of change of all the Keplerian orbital elements of the relative motion of a gravitationally bound two-body system acted upon by a massive remote perturber are analytically worked out in full generality and presented in a way facilitating a straightforward application to those and other potentially interesting astronomical scenarios. For each of the considered cases, exclusion plots in their parameter spaces are provided.</description>

      <title>The Barrow entropies in the thermodynamics of high-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of $D$-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet black holes with Barrow entropy. It is found that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling and the Barrow factor revise the thermodynamic variables such as event horizon, Hawking temperature, entropy and heat capacity. It is interesting that the larger five-dimensional black holes exist stably and the smaller ones evaporate to disappear owing to the nature of heat capacities amended by the coupling and factor. The discussions exhibit that the $D$-dimensional black holes with $D=6, 7$ set free all of their energy to vanish because of the minus heat capacities as functions of Hawking temperature although the extra term and the fractal power bring about their revisions on the functions, but they cannot change the heat capacity signs, so they also cannot change the fate of six- or seven-dimensional black holes.</description>

      <title>Modified first law of charged dilaton black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of a charged dilaton black hole arising from Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, where the dilaton couples exponentially to the Maxwell field via a dimensionless parameter a. Treating a as a continuous solution parameter, we extend the black hole first law to include a term Psi^A da, where Psi^A is the thermodynamic potential conjugate to a. We derive Psi^A explicitly through a differential analysis of the mass, charge, and entropy, and confirm its form via an independent Hamiltonian calculation. Additionally, by promoting a to a spacetime-dependent scalar and introducing auxiliary gauge fields, we provide a geometric interpretation of Psi^A as a conserved Noether charge. We further analyze the implications of treating a as a thermodynamic variable within the extended phase space. Despite the modification to the first law, we demonstrate that the Smarr relation remains unaffected due to the dimensionless nature of a, highlighting the distinction between variational and scaling symmetries. Our analysis supports the thermodynamic relevance of coupling constants and enriches the framework of extended black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>On energy bounds in asymptotically locally AdS spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers positive energy theorems in asymptotically, locally AdS spacetimes. Particular attention is given to spacetimes where conformal infinity has compact, Einstein cross-sections admitting Killing or parallel spinors; a positive energy theorem is derived for such spacetimes in terms of geometric data intrinsic to the cross-section. This is followed by the first complete proofs of the BPS inequalities in (the bosonic sectors of) 4D and 5D minimal, gauged supergravity, including with magnetic fields. The BPS inequalities are proven for asymptotically AdS spacetimes, but also generalised to the aforementioned class of asymptotically, locally AdS spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational perturbations of the Hayward spacetime and testing the correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies axial gravitational perturbations of the Hayward black hole, a regular geometry that also arises as an effective solution in asymptotically safe gravity. By computing grey-body factors with the 6th-order WKB method and comparing them to predictions based on the quasinormal modes, the correspondence between transmission coefficients and quasinormal spectra is verified. Quantum corrections, parametrized by $\gamma$, are shown to suppress both the grey-body factors and the absorption cross-section, while the correspondence remains accurate at the percent level for low multipoles and essentially exact for higher ones.</description>

      <title>Long-lived quasinormal modes and echoes in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-Proca theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quasinormal modes and time-domain profiles of a massive scalar field in the background of black holes arising in Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet--Proca gravity. The black holes in this theory possess \emph{primary Proca hair}, which modifies the effective potential and gives rise to distinctive dynamical phenomena. Using three complementary numerical techniques -- the WKB method with Pad\'e resummation, time-domain integration, and the Frobenius (Leaver) method -- we obtain accurate spectra of quasinormal frequencies. Our analysis shows that increasing the scalar-field mass leads to arbitrarily long-lived states, known as quasi-resonances, a behavior shared by both the fundamental mode and the first overtone. The real part of the quasinormal mode decreases for the first and higher overtones and starting from the second overtone it reaches zero at some critical value of mass of the field. When the effective potential develops an additional peak, the late-time signal exhibits a sequence of echoes. Furthermore, the time-domain evolution reveals distinct regimes of intermediate power-law tails $\sim t^{-4/3-\ell}\sin(A(\mu)t)$ and a universal asymptotic tails $\sim t^{-5/6}\sin(\mu t)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the impact of the first string corrections of minimally coupled single scalar field theory on inflationary dynamics. Specifically we consider separately the string corrections $\sim \alpha'\xi(\phi)c_2\,\left( \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi\right)^2$ and $\sim \alpha'c \square \phi \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi$, where $\alpha'$ is the square of the string scale. Our aim is to develop a theory which is self consistent in the sense that the field equations reproduce themselves in the slow-roll approximation. Such a requirement for the theory with $\sim \alpha'\xi(\phi) c_2\left( \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi\right)^2$ resulted to a trivial non-minimal coupling function $\xi(\phi)$, however a self-consistent framework emerged from the theory with correction term $\sim \alpha' c \square \phi \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi$. The resulting theory can easily be worked out analytically and we obtained an inflationary theory that can easily be fitted with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope constraints on the scalar spectral index and the updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>On the Dynamics of Extended Bodies and the GravoThermo Memory Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-linearity of the theory of gravity induces a hysteresis effect in both the systems interacting with gravity and in the gravitational field. The effect is usually referred to as the memory effect. In this paper, we explore this phenomenon in the context of the dynamics of extended rotating objects in the presence of a gravitational wave pulse. Then, we consider an ensemble of such objects and show that a redistribution of spin orientations takes place as a gravitational wave passes through. We examine how this redistribution, changes the partition function and the thermodynamic quantities including entropy and energy of the system. The result shows that some information about the source of the gravitation wave is encoded in the thermodynamics of the system.</description>

      <title>Causality Detection via Symplectic Quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study whether symplectic quandle colorings can reveal causal structure encoded by "sky links" - i.e. links consisting of spheres of all light rays through two points in the space of all light rays of a spacetime. Building on the known limitations of the Alexander-Conway polynomial, we compare the connected sum of two Hopf links (which represents all causally unrelated situations) with the first two Allen-Swenberg links (that are the only known examples when this polynomial does not work). For each diagram we report both the quandle counting invariant (total number of colorings) and an enhanced version that records how many distinct colors appear in each coloring. In our tests over small finite fields, plain counts often agree across examples, but the enhanced invariant consistently separates the Hopf case from the Allen-Swenberg family, and becomes more discriminating as the field grows. A simple transfer step suggests that this effect persists along the whole sequence. These results point to enhanced symplectic quandle colorings as a practical, computable indication of causality that classical polynomials alone may miss; the first examples of this kind were discovered by Jain.</description>

      <title>Topology of the Superconducting Heart of Neutron Stars: Effects of Microphysics and Gravitational-Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general-relativistic study of the distribution of proton superconductivity in strongly magnetized neutron stars (NSs), employing the $XNS$ code to solve the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations. This work extends the previous investigation by us in a few key directions: (i) we explore equilibrium configurations with both toroidal and poloidal magnetic field geometries, (ii) we account for complex many-body effects incorporating microscopically derived pairing gaps, and (iii) our models utilize equation(s) of state (EoS) derived from microscopic many-body theory, including realistic two- and three-body nuclear forces, as well as from relativistic mean-field models. We compare superconducting topologies across our collection of EoS and explore the influences of magnetic field geometry in stellar models parameterized by central density. Our models confirm the absence of $S$-wave superconductivity in the inner core and, importantly, reveal that non-superconducting regions exhibit complex three-dimensional geometries: doughnut-shaped for toroidal fields and prolate-shaped for poloidal fields -- spatial structures that are inherently absent from one-dimensional analyses. We also compute magnetic deformations and ellipticities for several millisecond pulsars (MSPs), estimating their continuous gravitational wave (CGW) strain. While these MSPs remain undetectable by current detectors, next-generation instruments such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer may detect their signals, opening an observational window into internal superconductivity and internal magnetic field of NSs, as well as, the fundamental microphysics of dense matter.</description>

      <title>Time-Symmetric Action-at-a-Distance Electrodynamics and the Principle of Action and Reaction for Particles at Relative Rest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a theory of time-symmetric action-at-a-distance electrodynamic or gravitational interactions where the four-forces depend only on the electric charges, the rest masses, the position four-vectors, and the four-velocities of the two interacting particles, but not on their four-accelerations or higher derivatives. The goal is to prove that the principle of action and reaction is obeyed due to the fact that, for a given pair of corresponding infinitesimal segments along the worldlines of the two particles, the impulse of the advanced four-force and the impulse of the retarded four-force are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For two particles at relative rest, we derive this result as the outcome of a symmetry operation in flat conformal space. We start by assuming a positive spacetime interval between the two interacting particles, and we perform a conformal inversion (an improper inversion in a hypersphere), after which the two particles exchange their position and time coordinates and their rest masses. Then we perform an improper reflection across the axis connecting the two particles, after which the two particles recover their initial four-velocities, up to a minus sign. Two improper coordinate transformations are needed together in order to obtain a resulting positive Jacobian determinant. In the final step we go to the limit of a null spacetime interval between the endpoints of the corresponding infinitesimal segments. When the two interacting particles are at rest, or move with the same velocity, the initial and the final physical parameters that determine the four-forces are identical. Due to symmetry, the principle of action and reaction emerges. We make the conjecture that another, undetermined yet, symmetry operation must also apply, in order for the principle of action and reaction to hold even for particles moving with different velocities.</description>

      <title>Varying fundamental constants cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmography is a model-independent phenomenological approach to observational cosmology, relying on Taylor series expansions of physical quantities as a function of the cosmological redshift or other analogous variables. A recent work developed the formalism for a cosmographic analysis of astrophysical and local measurements of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, and provided first constraints on the corresponding parameters. Here we update the earlier work, both by including more recent measurements of $\alpha$, and by extending it to other fundamental dimensionless couplings. We find no statistically significant evidence for such variations, and place stringent constraints on the first two terms of all these cosmographic series: the linear coefficient in the $\alpha$ series is constrained to parts per billion level, thanks to recently improved atomic clock constraints, while the other coefficients are constrained to parts per million level. Additionally, we use the same data to place cosmographic constraints on models from a broad class of Grand Unified Theories in which varying fundamental constants occur, and highlight how future data can provide a discriminating cosmographic test between freezing and thawing dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Lightcurve Features of Magnetar-Powered Superluminous Supernovae with Gravitational-Wave Emission and High-Energy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a distinct class of stellar explosions, exhibiting peak luminosities 10-100 times brighter than those of normal SNe. Their extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and its daughter $^{56}\mathrm{Co}$ alone. Consequently, models invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed, capable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For these rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may also contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early evolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within the optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes transparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve. In this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the combined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of SLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for magnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence suppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further investigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the lightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities. Our results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and radiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new insights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines.</description>

      <title>Lensing amplitude anomaly and varying electron mass alleviate the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological measurements have revealed tensions within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, notably discrepancies in the Hubble constant and $S_8$ parameter. Additionally, recent observations suggested evidence of a possible non-flat spatial curvature and an anomalous CMB lensing amplitude that beyond the $\Lambda$CDM framework. In this study, we explore whether introducing a variation in the electron mass $m_e$, allowing non-zero spatial curvature $\Omega_K$, and a free lensing amplitude $A_{\rm lens}$ can resolve these persistent tensions. Without relying on any local Universe measurements, we obtain $H_0 = 69.61^{+0.60}_{-0.55} \rm \, km \, s^{-1} \, Mpc^{-1}$ and $S_8= 0.808\pm0.012$, with $\Delta m_e / m_e = 0.0109^{+0.0066}_{-0.0062}$ and $A_{\rm lens} = 1.030^{+0.039}_{-0.037}$, both of which exceed the $\Lambda$CDM expectations. We find no indication of spatial curvature deviating from flatness, even when including the Cosmic Chronometers and SNe Ia samples. Our results point to a promising direction for cosmological models to reconcile these discrepancies, although more precise data from future experiments will be necessary to clarify these modifications.</description>

      <title>Tracing Signatures of Modified Gravity in Redshift-Space Galaxy Bispectrum Multipoles: Prospects for Euclid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the galaxy bispectrum multipoles in the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model, where a scalar degree of freedom mediates a fifth force that is screened in high-density environments. The model is specified by $f_{R0}$, the present-day background value of the scalar field, which controls the strength of deviations from General Relativity (GR). Using perturbation theory, we compute the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum with the full scale- and time-dependent second-order kernels, incorporating corrections from the scale-dependent growth rate and nonlinear screening. Expanding the bispectrum in spherical harmonics, we analyze the sensitivity of the multipoles to modified gravity and forecast their detectability in a \textit{Euclid}-like survey. The monopole ($B_0^0$) and quadrupole ($B_2^0$) show the strongest signatures, with relative deviations of $2\%$-$8\%$ at $z=0.7$ and $k_1\simeq0.3\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for $f_{R0}=10^{-5}$. Higher multipoles provide weaker but complementary signals. Finger-of-God damping and galaxy bias significantly modulate the results, requiring joint modeling of these nuisance parameters. For \textit{Euclid}, we forecast signal-to-noise ratios up to $\sim30$ for the monopole and $\sim15$ for the quadrupole. These results demonstrate that bispectrum multipoles are a powerful probe of gravity, capable of breaking degeneracies with bias and velocity effects and strengthening constraints on deviations from $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Is Not That Into You: Variable Couplings after DESI DR2 BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In interacting dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) scenarios, the interaction function typically includes a coupling parameter $\xi$ that quantifies the strength of energy exchange between the dark sectors. While $\xi$ is often assumed to be constant, there is no fundamental reason to exclude a time-dependent coupling, which could provide a more general and realistic description of dark sector dynamics. In this work, we study two widely used interacting models involving pressureless DM and DE, where the coupling parameter is allowed to vary with the scale factor $a$. Specifically, we consider two parametrizations: $\xi(a) = \xi_0 + \xi_a (1-a)$ and $\xi(a) = \xi_0 \left(1 + \frac{1-a}{a^2 + (1-a)^2} \right)$, and constrain them using the latest cosmological observations, including Planck 2018 CMB data, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and multiple Type Ia supernovae samples. Our results show that one scenario yields evidence for a non-zero interaction at more than 95\% confidence level, while the remaining cases indicate at most mild or inconclusive signs of interaction. These findings highlight the potential of variable coupling models and the importance of continued investigation into the nature of the dark sectors.</description>

      <title>Large $n$-point Functions in Resonant Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a qualitatively new regime of inflationary models with small and rapid oscillations in the potential--resonant non-Gaussianity. In contrast to the standard scenario, where most of the observable information is encoded in the power spectrum, in this regime the oscillatory signal predominantly appears in higher-order correlation functions with large $n$. This behavior emerges when the oscillation frequency $\omega$ exceeds the naive cutoff of the theory, $4\pi f$. However, as noted by Hook and Rattazzi [2306.12489], the actual cutoff is somewhat higher--though only logarithmically--when the amplitude of the oscillations is small. We identify a phenomenologically relevant window in which $n$-point functions with $3 \lesssim n \lesssim 9$ are potentially observable. In this regime, the signal exhibits 350 - 1000 oscillations per decade in $k$.</description>

      <title>The extension of Schwarzschild line element to include uniformly accelerated mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the spacetime geometry due to a Schwarzschild object having uniform accelerated motion. In the beginning, we investigate the gravitational field due to a uniformly moving Schwarzschild object and obtain the spacetime line element for such an object. After analyzing the necessary limiting conditions, the obtained line element is found to be consistent. Next, we extend our work to a uniformly accelerated Schwarzschild object. In that case, we obtain the spacetime line element for both when the acceleration is along the $X-$direction and when the acceleration is in an arbitrary direction on the $XY$ plane (in the later case $X$ may be some third reference direction, which may be useful for future work). The limiting conditions of those line elements have been examined. Such work will have relevant applications in astrophysics when we calculate the geodesic equations of test particles in the gravitational field of objects having uniform accelerated motion.
  Our present work will find applications in various branches of Astrophysics and especially in the studies of gravitational wave and its detection.</description>

      <title>Field Sources for $f(R,R_{\mu\nu})$ Black-Bounce Solutions: The Case of K-Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of Simpson-Visser, the search for field sources that produce black-bounces in alternative gravity theories has remained unresolved. In this paper, the first in a series exploring sources for alternative theories of gravity, we identify such a source for the $2+1$ dimensional K-gravity black-bounce. The K-gravity black hole is notable for allowing asymptotically locally flat solutions in lower-dimensional spacetime, yet it possesses curvature singularities concealed within the event horizon. Using the Simpson-Visser regularization technique, we eliminate this singularity, constructing asymptotically locally flat black-bounce solutions in $2+1$ dimensions. We explore the causal structure of these solutions, identifying the conditions under which they describe regular black holes or wormholes. By calculating curvature invariants, we confirm the absence of singularities within the event horizon. Additionally, we demonstrate that, beyond non-linear electrodynamics, a non-linear scalar field is required to source the solution. Finally, we investigate the geodesic structure of this spacetime, analyzing the trajectories of both massive and massless particles. We also confirm the existence of circular orbits and assess their stability.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearly self-interacting extended bodies move as test bodies in effective external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In electromagnetism, linearized general relativity, and other contexts, previous work has shown that the laws of motion which govern compact, self-interacting bodies can be obtained by applying "Detweiler-Whiting prescriptions" to the laws of motion which govern test bodies. These prescriptions replace any field which appears in a test-body law of motion with a certain effective field which is a quasilocal functional of the physical variables -- a functional that can be interpreted as a regularization procedure in a point-particle limit. We generalize these results, presenting a formalism which allows Detweiler-Whiting prescriptions to be be directly derived for extended bodies, even in nonlinear field theories. If a generating functional with particular properties can be constructed, we find effective linear and angular momenta which evolve via Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations involving appropriate effective fields. These equations implicitly incorporate all self-force, self-torque, and extended-body effects. Although our main focus is on bodies coupled to nonlinear scalar fields, we also remark on the gravitational case.</description>

      <title>Noncovariant parabolic theories of relativistic diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new first-order theory of relativistic dissipation has been recently proposed, where viscous effects are incorporated using the traditional Navier-Stokes framework. Its main novelty is the avoidance of dynamical instabilities by allowing different observers to use equations that are not related by exact Lorentz transformations. In this work, we explore the implications of this non-covariance in depth. In particular, we discuss how predictions differ between observers moving at nearly luminal speeds relative to each other. We find that all disagreements stem from the relativity of simultaneity, which introduces frame-dependent anisotropic delays in the diffusive process. These anisotropies significantly limit the applicability of the equation used by observers who move very fast relative to the medium. However, the magnitude of the related error remains finite at infinite Lorentz factors, meaning that it is possible to find a regime where all observers agree on the outcome of experiments.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars in Causal Scalar-Tensor Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study static, spherically symmetric neutron stars in a class of scalar-tensor theories with non-canonical kinetic terms (K-essence) obeying all causality and hyperbolicity conditions. These models have non-trivial dynamics that lead to a type of anti-screening of the scalar. They lead to small corrections in the solar system due to a small coupling, but can lead to large corrections in regimes of high densities, especially neutron stars. We solve the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations numerically using realistic equations of state (SLy4, WFF1, MS1, MPA1). For a given central density, we find that two distinct configurations may exist, forming two separate branches of solutions. We find that above a certain critical central density solutions with the correct asymptotic behavior at spatial infinity cannot be obtained. We obtain precise predictions for the mass-radius relation for neutron stars for different values of the parameters in the model and we compare to data.</description>

      <title>Stability of Big Bang singularity for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field-Vlasov system in the full strong sub-critical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $3+1$ dimensions, we study the stability of Kasner solutions for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field-Vlasov system. This system incorporates gravity, electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions for the initial stage of our universe. Due to the presence of the Vlasov field, various new challenges arise. By observing detailed mathematical structures and designing new delicate arguments, we identify a new strong sub-critical regime and prove the nonlinear stability with Kasner exponents lying in this full regime. This extends the result of Fournodavlos-Rodnianski-Speck [8] from the Einstein-scalar field system to the physically more complex system with the Vlasov field.</description>

      <title>Unlocking New Paths for Science with Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals: Machine Learning-Enhanced MCMC for Accurate Parameter Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in space-borne antennas like Taiji and LISA promises deep insights into strong-field gravity and black hole physics. However, the complex, highly degenerate, and non-convex likelihood landscapes characteristic of EMRI parameter spaces pose severe challenges for conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Under realistic instrumental noise and broad priors, these methods demand impractical computational costs but are prone to becoming trapped in local maxima, leading to biased and unreliable parameter estimates. To address this, we introduce Flow-Matching Markov Chain Monte Carlo (FM-MCMC), a novel Bayesian framework that integrates continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with parallel tempering MCMC (PTMCMC). By generating high-likelihood regions via CNFs and refining them through PTMCMC, FM-MCMC enables robust exploration of the nontrivial parameter spaces, while achieving orders-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency and, more importantly, ensuring statistically reliable and unbiased inference. By enabling real-time, unbiased parameter inference, FM-MCMC could unlock the full scientific potential of EMRI observations, and would serve as a scalable pipeline for precision gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bianchi I cosmological solutions in f(T) gravity are discussed. We start from diagonal metrics and tetrads and show that their dynamical equations are pretty much tractable analytically, with a possible arena for physical applications. Then we derive a very bad unpredictability of the teleparallel connection in these configurations. Namely, even for the simple isotropic Friedmann universes, one might apply an arbitrary time-dependent spatial rotation to the standard tetrad without changing anything in the cosmological equations.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition to RS: Cool, not Supercool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the warped conifold compactification, we model the infrared (IR) dynamics of confining gauge theories in a Randall-Sundrum (RS)-like setup by modifying the stabilizing Goldberger-Wise (GW) potential so that it becomes large (in magnitude) in the IR and back-reacts on the geometry. We study the high-temperature phase by considering a black brane background in which we calculate the entropy and free energy of the strongly back-reacted solution. As with Buchel's result for the conifold (arXiv:2103.15188), we find a minimum temperature beyond which the black brane phase is thermodynamically unstable. In the context of a phase transition to the confining background, our results suggest that the amount of supercooling that the metastable black brane phase undergoes can be limited. It also suggests the first-order phase transition (and the associated gravitational waves from bubble collision) is not universal. Our results therefore have important phenomenological implications for early universe model building in these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Local Description of Decoherence of Quantum Superpositions by Black Holes and Other Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02567v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was previously shown that if an experimenter, Alice, puts a massive or charged body in a quantum spatial superposition, then the presence of a black hole (or more generally any Killing horizon) will eventually decohere the superposition [arXiv:2205.06279, arXiv:2301.00026, arXiv:2311.11461]. This decoherence was identified as resulting from the radiation of soft photons/gravitons through the horizon, thus suggesting that the global structure of the spacetime is essential for describing the decoherence. In this paper, we show that the decoherence can alternatively be described in terms of the local two-point function of the quantum field within Alice's lab, without any direct reference to the horizon. From this point of view, the decoherence of Alice's superposition in the presence of a black hole arises from the extremely low frequency Hawking quanta present in Alice's lab. We explicitly calculate the decoherence occurring in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Unruh vacuum from the local viewpoint. We then use this viewpoint to elucidate (i) the differences in decoherence effects that would occur in Schwarzschild spacetime in the Boulware and Hartle-Hawking vacua; (ii) the difference in decoherence effects that would occur in Minkowski spacetime filled with a thermal bath as compared with Schwarzschild spacetime; (iii) the lack of decoherence in the spacetime of a static star even though the vacuum state outside the star is similar in many respects to the Boulware vacuum around a black hole; and (iv) the requirements on the degrees of freedom of a material body needed to produce a decoherence effect that mimics that of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Flow of dynamical causal structures with an application to correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal models capture cause-effect relations both qualitatively - via the graphical causal structure - and quantitatively - via the model parameters. They offer a powerful framework for analyzing and constructing processes. Here, we introduce a tool - the flow of causal structures - to visualize and explore the dynamical aspect of classical-deterministic processes, arguably like those present in general relativity. The flow describes all possible ways in which the causal structure of a process can evolve. We also present an algorithm to construct its supergraph - the superflow - from the causal structure only, without invoking the model parameters. As an application, we show that if all leaves of a flow are trivial, then the corresponding process produces causal correlations only, i.e., correlations where future data cannot influence past events. This strengthens the result that processes, where every directed cycle in their causal structure is chordless, establish causal correlations only. We also discuss the main difficulties for the quantum generalization of the present algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by group-theoretical questions that arise in the context of asymptotic symmetries in gravity, we study model spaces and their quantization from the viewpoint of constrained Hamiltonian systems. More precisely, we propose that a central building block in the construction of the model space for a generic Lie group $G$ is the symplectic submanifold of $T^*G$ that one obtains when one imposes only the second class constraints in the construction of the coadjoint orbit as a symplectic quotient. Before turning to the non-compact infinite-dimensional groups relevant in the gravitational setting, we work out all details in the simplest case of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. Besides recovering well-known results on the quantum theory of angular momentum from a unified perspective, the analysis sheds some light on the definition and properties of spin-weighted/monopole spherical harmonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores the rich structure of spherically symmetric time-periodic solutions of the cubic conformal wave equation on $\mathbb{S}^{3}$. We discover that the families of solutions bifurcating from the eigenmodes of the linearised equation form patterns similar to the ones observed for the cubic wave equation. Alongside the Galerkin approaches, we study them using the new method based on the Pad\'{e} approximants. To do so, we provide a rigorous perturbative construction of solutions. Due to the conformal symmetry, the solutions presented in this work serve as examples of large time-periodic solutions of the conformally coupled scalar field on the anti-de Sitter background.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Hubble parameter with the 21 cm brightness temperature signal in a universe with inhomogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the 21\,cm brightness temperature as a probe of the Hubble tension in the framework of an inhomogeneous cosmological model. Employing Buchert's averaging formalism to study the effect of inhomogeneities on the background evolution, we consider scaling laws for the backreaction and curvature consistent with structure formation simulations. We calibrate the effective matter density using MCMC analysis using Union 2.1 Supernova Ia data. Our results show that a higher Hubble constant ($\sim73$\,km/s/Mpc) leads to a shallower absorption feature in the brightness temperature versus redshift curve. On the other hand, a lower value ($\sim67$\,km/s/Mpc) produces a remarkable dip in the brightness temperature $T_{21}$. Such a substantial difference is absent in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings indicate that inhomogeneities could significantly affect the 21\,cm signal, and may shed further light on the different measurements of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Hollow-grams: Generalized Entanglement Wedges from the Gravitational Path Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10064v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the Hubble tension with Torsion Condensation (TorC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09228v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraints on the cosmological parameters of Torsion Condensation (TorC) are investigated using Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background data. TorC is a case of Poincar\'e gauge theory -- a formulation of gravity motivated by the gauge field theories underlying fundamental forces in the standard model of particle physics. Unlike general relativity, TorC incorporates intrinsic torsion degrees of freedom while maintaining second-order field equations. At specific parameter values, it reduces to the $\Lambda$CDM model, providing a natural extension to standard cosmology. The base model of TorC introduces two parameters beyond those in $\Lambda$CDM: the initial value of the torsion scalar field and its time derivative -- one can absorb the latter by allowing the dark energy density to float. To constrain these parameters, `PolyChord` nested sampling algorithm is employed, interfaced via `Cobaya` with a modified version of `CAMB`. Our results indicate that TorC allows for a larger inferred Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Tension analysis using the $R$-statistic shows that TorC alleviates the statistical tension between the Planck 2018 and SH0Es 2020 datasets, though this improvement is not sufficient to decisively favour TorC over $\Lambda$CDM in a Bayesian model comparison. This study highlights TorC as a compelling theory of gravity, demonstrating its potential to address cosmological tensions and motivating further investigations of extended theories of gravity within a cosmological context. As current and upcoming surveys -- including Euclid, Roman Space Telescope, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, LISA, and Simons Observatory -- deliver data on gravity across all scales, they will offer critical tests of gravity models like TorC, making the present a pivotal moment for exploring extended theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Probing the nature of gravity in the low-acceleration limit: wide binaries of extreme separations with perspective effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have revealed a boost in gravitational acceleration with respect to the prediction by Newtonian gravity at low internal accelerations $\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m\,s$^{-2}$. This phenomenon is important because it does not permit the dark matter interpretation, unlike galaxy rotation curves. We extend previous analyses by increasing the maximum sky-projected separation from 30 to 50 kilo astronomical units (kau). We show that the so-called ``perspective effects'' are not negligible at this extended separation and, thus, incorporate it in our analysis. With wide binaries selected with very stringent criteria, we find that the gravitational acceleration boost factor, $\gamma_g \equiv g_{\rm obs}/g_{\mathrm N}$, is $1.61^{+0.37}_{-0.29}$ (from $\delta_{\rm obs-newt}\equiv (\log_{10}\gamma_g)/\sqrt{2}=0.147\pm0.062$) at Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-11.0}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, corresponding to separations of tens of kau for solar-mass binaries. At Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-10.3}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, we find $\gamma_g=1.26^{+0.12}_{-0.10}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.072\pm0.027$). For all binaries with $g_{\rm N}\lesssim10^{-10}$ m\,$s^{-2}$ from our sample, we find $\gamma_g=1.32^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.085\pm0.027$). These results are consistent with the generic prediction of MOND-type modified gravity, although the current data are not sufficient to pin down the low-acceleration limiting behavior. Finally, we emphasize that the observed deviation from Newtonian gravity cannot be explained by the perspective effects or any separation-dependent eccentricity variation which we have taken into account.</description>

      <title>Stellar-Mass Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15270</link>

Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes ($3$ $M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 150$ $M_\odot$) are the natural product of the evolution of heavy stars ($M_{\rm star} \gtrsim 20$ $M_\odot$). In our Galaxy, we expect $10^8$-$10^9$ stellar-mass black holes formed from the gravitational collapse of heavy stars, but currently we know fewer than 100 objects. We also know $\sim 100$ stellar-mass black holes in other galaxies, most of them discovered by gravitational wave observatories in the past 10 years. The detection of black holes is indeed extremely challenging and possible only in very special cases. This article is a short review on the physics and astrophysics of stellar-mass black holes, including Galactic and extragalactic black holes in X-ray binaries, black holes in astrometric binaries, isolated black holes, and black holes in compact binaries. The article also addresses some important open issues and introduces the idea of a possible interstellar mission to the closest black hole.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present observational evidences indicating that dark energy may be evolving with time, thereby challenging the core assumptions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. Our analysis reveals that the predicted value of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ by the DESI DR2 LRG1 and LRG3+ELG1 datapoints deviates from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction and from different supernova compilations. We find that analyzing the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers strongly affects the model predictions especially $\omega_0$, which shifts from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This suggests that the evidence of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is driven by the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers. When we exclude low-redshift supernovae data, particularly from the DES-SN5YR compilation, the model predictions are restored to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This effect is particularly evident in the GEDE model, where removing low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\Delta = 0$, effectively recovering $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy is substantial, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$). The reconstruction of $\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$, using a combination of DESI DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and supernovae datasets, further supports the evolving nature dark energy. These results favor a dynamical dark-energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0&gt;-1$, $\omega_a&lt;0$, and $\omega_0+\omega_a&lt;-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of model evidence reveals that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-redshift data are excluded.</description>

      <title>Quadratic curvature corrections to 5-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole thermodynamics by background subtraction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We justify the applicability of the background subtraction method to both Einstein's gravity and its higher derivative corrections in 5-dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetimes, where the corresponding higher derivative corrections to the expression for the ADM mass and angular momentum are also worked out. Then we further apply the background subtraction method to calculate the first order corrected Gibbs free energy by the quadratic curvature terms for the 5-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole, which is in exact agreement with the previous result obtained by the holographic renormalization method. Such an agreement in turn substantiates the applicability of the background subtraction method.</description>
