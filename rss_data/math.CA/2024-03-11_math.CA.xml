      <title>Extending the Meijer $G$-function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By replacing the Euler gamma function by the Barnes double gamma function in the definition of the Meijer $G$-function, we introduce a new family of special functions, which we call $K$-functions. This is a very general class of functions, which includes as special cases Meijer $G$-functions (thus also all hypergeometric functions ${}_p F_q$) as well as several new functions that appeared recently in the literature. Our goal is to define the $K$-function, study its analytic and transformation properties and relate it to several functions that appeared recently in the study of random processes and the fractional Laplacian. We further introduce a generalization of the Kilbas-Saigo function and show that it is a special case of $K$-function.</description>

      <title>Composition of rough singular integral operators on rearrangement invariant Banach type spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a homogeneous function of degree zero and enjoy the vanishing condition on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}(n\geq 2)$. Let $T_{\Omega}$ be the convolution singular integral operator with kernel ${\Omega(x)}{|x|^{-n}}$. In this paper, when $\Omega \in L^{\infty}(\mathbb {S}^{n-1})$, we consider the quantitative weighted bounds of the composite operators of $T_{\Omega}$ on rearrangement invariant Banach function spaces. These spaces contain the classical Lorentz spaces and Orlicz spaces as special examples. Weighted boundedness of the composite operators on rearrangement invariant quasi-Banach spaces were also given.</description>

      <title>A Linear Algebra approach to monomiality and operational methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use linear algebraic methods to obtain general results about linear operators on a space of polynomials that we apply to the operators associated with a polynomial sequence by the monomiality property. We show that all such operators are differential operators with polynomial coefficients of finite of infinite order. We consider the monomiality operators associated with several classes of polynomial sequences, such as Appell and Sheffer, and also orthogonal polynomial sequences that include the Meixner, Krawtchouk, Laguerre, Meixner-Pollaczek, and Hermite families.</description>

      <title>Bi-center conditions and bifurcation of limit cycles in a class of $Z_2$-equivariant cubic switching systems with two nilpotent points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the Poincar\'e-Lyapunov method for systems with linear type centers to study nilpotent centers in switching polynomial systems and use it to investigate the bi-center problem of planar $Z_2$-equivariant cubic switching systems associated with two symmetric nilpotent singular points. With a properly designed perturbation, 6 explicit bi-center conditions for such polynomial systems are derived. Then, based on the $6$ center conditions, by using Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation theory with general perturbations, we prove that there exist at least $20$ small-amplitude limit cycles around the nilpotent bi-center for a class of $Z_2$-equivariant cubic switching systems. This is a new lower bound of cyclicity for such cubic polynomial systems, increased from $12$ to $20$.</description>

      <title>Almost Optimal Agnostic Control of Unknown Linear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a simple control problem in which the underlying dynamics depend on a parameter $a$ that is unknown and must be learned. We study three variants of the control problem: Bayesian control, in which we have a prior belief about $a$; bounded agnostic control, in which we have no prior belief about $a$ but we assume that $a$ belongs to a bounded set; and fully agnostic control, in which $a$ is allowed to be an arbitrary real number about which we have no prior belief. In the Bayesian variant, a control strategy is optimal if it minimizes a certain expected cost. In the agnostic variants, a control strategy is optimal if it minimizes a quantity called the worst-case regret. For the Bayesian and bounded agnostic variants above, we produce optimal control strategies. For the fully agnostic variant, we produce almost optimal control strategies, i.e., for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ we produce a strategy that minimizes the worst-case regret to within a multiplicative factor of $(1+\varepsilon)$.</description>

      <title>Pointwise Assouad dimension for measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.15301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a pointwise variant of the Assouad dimension for measures on metric spaces, and study its properties in relation to the global Assouad dimension. We show that, in general, the value of the pointwise Assouad dimension differs from the global counterpart, but in many classical cases, it exhibits similar exact dimensionality properties as the classical local dimension, namely it equals the global Assouad dimension at almost every point. We also compute the Assouad dimension of invariant measures with place dependent probabilities supported on strongly separated self-conformal sets.</description>

      <title>Naive Function Theory: Real Analysis via Supremum Arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theorems crucial in elementary real function theory have proofs in which compactness arguments are used. Despite the introduction in relatively recent literature of each new highly elegant compactness argument, or of an equivalent, this work is based on the idea that, with the aid of local properties of continuous or of differentiable functions, the use of supremum arguments suffices, and the resulting development of real function theory need not involve notions more sophisticated than what immediately follows from the usual ordering of the real numbers.</description>

      <title>Painlev\'e-III Monodromy Maps Under the $D_6\to D_8$ Confluence and Applications to the Large-Parameter Asymptotics of Rational Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The third Painlev\'e equation in its generic form, often referred to as Painlev\'e-III($D_6$), is given by $$ \frac{{\rm d}^2u}{{\rm d}x^2} =\frac{1}{u}\left(\frac{{\rm d}u}{{\rm d}x}\right)^2-\frac{1}{x}\frac{{\rm d}u}{{\rm d}x}+\frac{\alpha u^2+\beta}{x}+4u^3-\frac{4}{u}, \qquad \alpha,\beta \in \mathbb C.$$ Starting from a generic initial solution $u_0(x)$ corresponding to parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$, denoted as the triple $(u_0(x),\alpha,\beta)$, we apply an explicit B\"acklund transformation to generate a family of solutions $(u_n(x),\alpha+4n,\beta+4n)$ indexed by $n \in \mathbb N$. We study the large $n$ behavior of the solutions $(u_n(x),\alpha+4n,\beta+4n)$ under the scaling $x=z/n$ in two different ways: (a) analyzing the convergence properties of series solutions to the equation, and (b) using a Riemann-Hilbert representation of the solution $u_n(z/n)$. Our main result is a proof that the limit of solutions $u_n(z/n)$ exists and is given by a solution of the degenerate Painlev\'e-III equation, known as Painlev\'e-III($D_8$), $$ \frac{{\rm d}^2U}{{\rm d}z^2} =\frac{1}{U}\left(\frac{{\rm d}U}{{\rm d}z}\right)^2-\frac{1}{z}\frac{{\rm d}U}{{\rm d}z}+\frac{4U^2+4}{z}.$$ A notable application of our result is to rational solutions of Painlev\'e-III($D_6$), which are constructed using the seed solution $(1,4m,-4m)$ where $m \in \mathbb C \setminus \big(\mathbb Z +\frac{1}{2}\big)$ and can be written as a particular ratio of Umemura polynomials. We identify the limiting solution in terms of both its initial condition at $z=0$ when it is well defined, and by its monodromy data in the general case. Furthermore, as a consequence of our analysis, we deduce the asymptotic behavior of generic solutions of Painlev\'e-III, both $D_6$ and $D_8$ at $z=0$. We also deduce the large $n$ behavior of the Umemura polynomials in a neighborhood of $z=0$.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ and any trigonometric polynomial $f$ with frequencies in the set $\{n^3: N \leq n\leq N+N^{2/3-\epsilon}\}$, one has $$ \|f\|_4 \ll \epsilon^{-1/4}\|f\|_2 $$ with implied constant being absolute. We also show that the set $\{n^3: N\leq n\leq N+(0.5N)^{1/2}\}$ is a Sidon set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first give a new interpretation of Jimbo's boundary condition for the generic Painlev\'e VI transcendents, as the shrinking phenomenon in long time behaviour of the Jimbo-Miwa-Mori-Sato equation with rank $n=3$. We then interpret Jimbo's monodromy formula from the viewpoint of the isomonodromy deformation with respect to irregular singularities.</description>

      <title>Solvability for non-smooth Schr\"{o}dinger equations with singular potentials and square integrable data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.11901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a holomorphic functional calculus for first-order operators $DB$ to solve boundary value problems for Schr\"{o}dinger equations $-\mathrm{div}\, A \nabla u + a V u = 0$ in the upper half-space $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}_+$ with $n\in\mathbb{N}$. This relies on quadratic estimates for $DB$, which are proved for coefficients $A,a,V$ that are independent of the transversal direction to the boundary, and comprised of a complex-elliptic pair $(A,a)$ that are bounded and measurable, and a singular potential $V$ in either $L^{n/2}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ or the reverse H\"{o}lder class $B^{q}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ with $q\geq\max\{\tfrac{n}{2},2\}$. In the latter case, square function bounds are also shown to be equivalent to non-tangential maximal function bounds. This allows us to prove that the (Dirichlet) Regularity and Neumann boundary value problems with $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$-data are well-posed if and only if certain boundary trace operators defined by the functional calculus are isomorphisms. We prove this property when the principal coefficient matrix $A$ has either a Hermitian or block structure. More generally, the set of all complex coefficients for which the boundary value problems are well-posed is shown to be open.</description>

      <title>A maximal oscillatory operator on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a continuation of our previous research about an oscillatory integral operator $T_{\alpha, \beta}$ on compact manifolds $\mathbb{M}$. We prove the sharp $H^{p}$-$L^{p,\infty}$ boundedness on the maximal operator $T^{*}_{\alpha, \beta}$ for all $0&lt;p&lt;1$. As applications, we first prove the sharp $H^{p}$-$L^{p,\infty}$ boundedness on the maximal operator corresponding to the Riesz means $I_{k,\alpha}(|\mathcal{L}|)$ associated with the Schr\"odinger type group $e^{is\mathcal{L}^{\alpha/2}}$ and obtain the almost everywhere convergence of $I_{k,\alpha}(|\mathcal{L}|)f(x,t)\to f(x)$ for all $f\in H^{p}$. Also, we are able to obtain the convergence speed of a combination operator from the solutions of the Cauchy problem of fractional Schr\"odinger equations. All results are even new on the n-torus $T^{n}$.</description>
