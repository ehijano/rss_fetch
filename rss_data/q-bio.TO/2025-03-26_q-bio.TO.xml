      <title>A minimal electrical model of the human heart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a minimal whole-heart model that describes cardiac electrical conduction and simulate a basic three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). We compare our 3-lead ECG model with clinical data from a database of Norwegian athletes. The results demonstrate a strong correlation with the ECGs recorded for these athletes. We simulate various pathologies of the heart's electrical conduction system, including ventricular tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, accessory pathways, and ischemia-related arrhythmias, demonstrating that the 3-lead ECGs align with the clinical data. This minimal model serves as a computationally efficient digital twin of the heart.</description>

      <title>Single Shot AI-assisted quantification of KI-67 proliferation index in breast cancer</title>

Abstract: Reliable quantification of Ki-67, a key proliferation marker in breast cancer, is essential for molecular subtyping and informed treatment planning. Conventional approaches, including visual estimation and manual counting, suffer from interobserver variability and limited reproducibility. This study introduces an AI-assisted method using the YOLOv8 object detection framework for automated Ki-67 scoring. High-resolution digital images (40x magnification) of immunohistochemically stained tumor sections were captured from Ki-67 hotspot regions and manually annotated by a domain expert to distinguish Ki-67-positive and negative tumor cells. The dataset was augmented and divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) subsets. Among the YOLOv8 variants tested, the Medium model achieved the highest performance, with a mean Average Precision at 50% Intersection over Union (mAP50) exceeding 85% for Ki-67-positive cells. The proposed approach offers an efficient, scalable, and objective alternative to conventional scoring methods, supporting greater consistency in Ki-67 evaluation. Future directions include developing user-friendly clinical interfaces and expanding to multi-institutional datasets to enhance generalizability and facilitate broader adoption in diagnostic practice.</description>

      <title>TopoGEN: topology-driven microstructure generation for in silico modeling of fiber network mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fields of mechanobiology and biomechanics are expanding our understanding of the complex behavior of soft biological tissues across multiple scales. Given the intricate connection between tissue microstructure and its macroscale mechanical behavior, unraveling this mechanistic relationship remains an ongoing challenge. Reconstituted fiber networks serve as valuable in vitro models to simplify the intricacy of in vivo systems for targeted investigations. Concurrently, advances in imaging enable microstructure visualization and, through generative pipelines, modeling as discrete element networks. These mesoscale models provide insights into macroscale tissue behavior. However, a systematic study of how microstructural variations influence nonlinear tissue mechanics is still lacking. In this work, we develop a novel framework to generate topologically-driven discrete fiber networks. Leveraging these networks, we generate models of interconnected load-bearing fiber components that exhibit softening under compression and are bending-resistant. By virtually replicating microstructural features of reconstituted collagen networks, such as fiber volume fractions and cross-link concentration, we evaluate the robustness of our simulations. Analyzing the nonlinear elastic behavior at varying polymerization temperatures, we find consistency between the in silico results and in vitro data from the literature. We extend our investigation beyond empirically measurable factors to explore microstructural effects at the single fiber level (i.e., fibril morphology and stiffness) that are challenging to investigate experimentally. TopoGEN allows us to mechanistically explore localized microstructural phenomena and relate microstructural changes to the bulk mechanical response of soft biological materials, hence providing an indispensable tool to advance the fields of tissue biomechanics and engineering.</description>
