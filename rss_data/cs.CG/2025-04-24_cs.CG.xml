      <title>Separating Two Points with Obstacles in the Plane: Improved Upper and Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two points in the plane, and a set of "obstacles" given as curves through the plane with assigned weights, we consider the point-separation problem, which asks for the minimum-weight subset of the obstacles separating the two points. A few computational models for this problem have been previously studied. We give a unified approach to this problem in all models via a reduction to a particular shortest-path problem, and obtain improved running times in essentially all cases. In addition, we also give fine-grained lower bounds for many cases.</description>

      <title>Fr\'echet Distance in Unweighted Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fr\'echet distance is a distance measure between trajectories in the plane or walks in a graph G. Given constant-time shortest path queries in a graph G, the Discrete Fr\'echet distance $F_G(P, Q)$ between two walks P and Q can be computed in $O(|P| \cdot |Q|)$ time using a dynamic program. Driemel, van der Hoog, and Rotenberg [SoCG'22] show that for weighted planar graphs this approach is likely tight, as there can be no strongly subquadratic algorithm to compute a $1.01$-approximation of $F_G(P, Q)$ unless the Orthogonal Vector Hypothesis (OVH) fails.
  Such quadratic-time conditional lower bounds are common to many Fr\'echet distance variants. However, they can be circumvented by assuming that the input comes from some well-behaved class: There exist $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximations, both in weighted graphs and in Rd, that take near-linear time for $c$-packed or $\kappa$-straight walks in the graph. In Rd, there also exists a near-linear time algorithm to compute the Fr\'echet distance whenever all input edges are long compared to the distance.
  We consider computing the Fr\'echet distance in unweighted planar graphs. We show that there exist no 1.25-approximations of the discrete Fr\'echet distance between two disjoint simple paths in an unweighted planar graph in strongly subquadratic time, unless OVH fails. This improves the previous lower bound, both in terms of generality and approximation factor. We subsequently show that adding graph structure circumvents this lower bound: If the graph is a regular tiling with unit-weighted edges, then there exists an $\tilde{O}( (|P| + |Q|)^{1.5})$-time algorithm to compute $D_F(P, Q)$. Our result has natural implications in the plane, as it allows us to define a new class of well-behaved curves that facilitate $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximations of their discrete Fr\'echet distance in subquadratic time.</description>

      <title>Subtrajectory Clustering and Coverage Maximization in Cubic Time, or Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many application areas collect unstructured trajectory data. In subtrajectory clustering, one is interested to find patterns in this data using a hybrid combination of segmentation and clustering. We analyze two variants of this problem based on the well-known \textsc{SetCover} and \textsc{CoverageMaximization} problems. In both variants the set system is induced by metric balls under the Fr\'echet distance centered at polygonal curves. Our algorithms focus on improving the running time of the update step of the generic greedy algorithm by means of a careful combination of sweeps through a candidate space. In the first variant, we are given a polygonal curve $P$ of complexity $n$, distance threshold $\Delta$ and complexity bound $\ell$ and the goal is to identify a minimum-size set of center curves $\mathcal{C}$, where each center curve is of complexity at most $\ell$ and every point $p$ on $P$ is covered. A point $p$ on $P$ is covered if it is part of a subtrajectory $\pi_p$ of $P$ such that there is a center $c\in\mathcal{C}$ whose Fr\'echet distance to $\pi_p$ is at most $\Delta$. We present an approximation algorithm for this problem with a running time of $O((n^2\ell + \sqrt{k_\Delta}n^{5/2})\log^2n)$, where $k_\Delta$ is the size of an optimal solution. The algorithm gives a bicriterial approximation guarantee that relaxes the Fr\'echet distance threshold by a constant factor and the size of the solution by a factor of $O(\log n)$. The second problem variant asks for the maximum fraction of the input curve $P$ that can be covered using $k$ center curves, where $k\leq n$ is a parameter to the algorithm. Here, we show that our techniques lead to an algorithm with a running time of $O((k+\ell)n^2\log^2 n)$ and similar approximation guarantees. Note that in both algorithms $k,k_\Delta\in O(n)$ and hence the running time is cubic, or better if $k\ll n$.</description>

      <title>Online Hitting Sets for Disks of Bounded Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present algorithms for the online minimum hitting set problem in geometric range spaces: Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane and a sequence of geometric objects that arrive one-by-one, we need to maintain a hitting set at all times. For disks of radii in the interval $[1,M]$, we present an $O(\log M \log n)$-competitive algorithm. This result generalizes from disks to positive homothets of any convex body in the plane with scaling factors in the interval $[1,M]$. As a main technical tool, we reduce the problem to the online hitting set problem for a finite subset of integer points and bottomless rectangles. Specifically, for a given $N&gt;1$, we present an $O(\log N)$-competitive algorithm for the variant where $P$ is a subset of an $N\times N$ section of the integer lattice, and the geometric objects are bottomless rectangles.</description>
