      <title>3D Modular Microrobots: Micro-Origami Cubes with Integrated Si Chips Dive, Communicate, Flash Programs, and Form Collectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular microrobotics can potentially address many information-intensive microtasks in medicine, manufacturing and the environment. However, surface area has limited the natural powering, communication, functional integration, and self-assembly of smart mass-fabricated modular robotic devices at small scales. We demonstrate the integrated self-folding and self-rolling of functionalized patterned interior and exterior membrane surfaces resulting in programmable, self-assembling, inter-communicating and self-locomoting micromodules (smartlets ess-than 1 mm3) with interior chambers for on-board buoyancy control. The microbotic divers, with 360 deg solar harvesting rolls, function with sufficient ambient power for communication and programmed locomotion in water via electrolysis. The folding faces carry rigid microcomponents including silicon chiplets as microprocessors and micro-LEDs for communication. This remodels modular microrobotics closer to the surface-rich modular autonomy of biological cells and provides an economical platform for microscopic applications.</description>

      <title>Development and Performance of a Static Pluviometer System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the frequency and severity of climate-related events such as droughts, floods, and water scarcity continue to escalate, accurate rainfall monitoring becomes increasingly critical. This paper covers various industry methods of measuring rainfall as well as our own ground pluviometer system. Our system consists of an inexpensive static rain gauge that can operate for approximately six to twelve months without maintenance. It utilizes resistive sensing technology accompanied by a microcontroller to measure the water level depth from the device vessel, recording rainfall at an hourly rate. This study also provides a side-by-side comparison of our pluviometer system with an industry rain gauge, the MeteoRain 200 Compact, from Barani Systems, with the differences in data being statistically insignificant. By prioritizing cost, sustainability, simplicity, ease of maintenance, and assembly, this research contributes to essential rainfall monitoring solutions, specifically for developing countries.</description>

      <title>Technical Report on Reinforcement Learning Control on the Lucas-N\"ulle Inverted Pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discipline of automatic control is making increased use of concepts that originate from the domain of machine learning. Herein, reinforcement learning (RL) takes an elevated role, as it is inherently designed for sequential decision making, and can be applied to optimal control problems without the need for a plant system model. To advance education of control engineers and operators in this field, this contribution targets an RL framework that can be applied to educational hardware provided by the Lucas-N\"ulle company. Specifically, the goal of inverted pendulum control is pursued by means of RL, including both, swing-up and stabilization within a single holistic design approach. Herein, the actual learning is enabled by separating corresponding computations from the real-time control computer and outsourcing them to a different hardware. This distributed architecture, however, necessitates communication of the involved components, which is realized via CAN bus. The experimental proof of concept is presented with an applied safeguarding algorithm that prevents the plant from being operated harmfully during the trial-and-error training phase.</description>

      <title>Bidding in Ancillary Service Markets: An Analytical Approach Using Extreme Value Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To encourage the participation of stochastic distributed energy resources in Nordic ancillary service markets, the Danish transmission system operator, Energinet, has introduced grid codes requiring a minimum 90% reliability for the full availability of reserve capacity bids. This paper addresses the bidding strategy of flexibility aggregators under Energinet's reliability requirement by proposing a chance-constrained optimization model. An analytical solution is developed using ideas from extreme value theory, focusing on the "tail" of the empirical data used for flexibility estimation, capturing extreme events where failures are more likely to occur. The proposed model is applied to an electric vehicle aggregator participating in the Nordic market for frequency containment reserve for disturbances (FCR-D). Our results from a realistic case study show that the proposed analytical solution outperforms a commonly used sample-based approach in terms of out-of-sample constraint violation rate.</description>

      <title>Topology Reconstruction of a Resistor Network with Limited Boundary Measurements: An Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A problem of reconstruction of the topology and the respective edge resistance values of an unknown circular planar passive resistive network using limitedly available resistance distance measurements is considered. We develop a multistage topology reconstruction method, assuming that the number of boundary and interior nodes, the maximum and minimum edge conductance, and the Kirchhoff index are known apriori. First, a maximal circular planar electrical network consisting of edges with resistors and switches is constructed; no interior nodes are considered. A sparse difference in convex program $\mathbf{\Pi}_1$ accompanied by round down algorithm is posed to determine the switch positions. The solution gives us a topology that is then utilized to develop a heuristic method to place the interior nodes. The heuristic method consists of reformulating $\mathbf{\Pi}_1$ as a difference of convex program $\mathbf{\Pi}_2$ with relaxed edge weight constraints and the quadratic cost. The interior node placement thus obtained may lead to a non-planar topology. We then use the modified Auslander, Parter, and Goldstein algorithm to obtain a set of planar network topologies and re-optimize the edge weights by solving $\mathbf{\Pi}_3$ for each topology. Optimization problems posed are difference of convex programming problem, as a consequence of constraints triangle inequality and the Kalmansons inequality. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Time-Series-Informed Closed-loop Learning for Sequential Decision Making and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Closed-loop performance of sequential decision making algorithms, such as model predictive control, depends strongly on the parameters of cost functions, models, and constraints. Bayesian optimization is a common approach to learning these parameters based on closed-loop experiments. However, traditional Bayesian optimization approaches treat the learning problem as a black box, ignoring valuable information and knowledge about the structure of the underlying problem, resulting in slow convergence and high experimental resource use. We propose a time-series-informed optimization framework that incorporates intermediate performance evaluations from early iterations of each experimental episode into the learning procedure. Additionally, probabilistic early stopping criteria are proposed to terminate unpromising experiments, significantly reducing experimental time. Simulation results show that our approach achieves baseline performance with approximately half the resources. Moreover, with the same resource budget, our approach outperforms the baseline in terms of final closed-loop performance, highlighting its efficiency in sequential decision making scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Miniature Batteryless Bioelectronic Implant Using One Magnetoelectric Transducer for Wireless Powering and PWM Backscatter Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless minimally invasive bioelectronic implants enable a wide range of applications in healthcare, medicine, and scientific research. Magnetoelectric (ME) wireless power transfer (WPT) has emerged as a promising approach for powering miniature bio-implants because of its remarkable efficiency, safety limit, and misalignment tolerance. However, achieving low-power and high-quality uplink communication using ME remains a challenge. This paper presents a pulse-width modulated (PWM) ME backscatter uplink communication enabled by a switched-capacitor energy extraction (SCEE) technique. The SCEE rapidly extracts and dissipates the kinetic energy within the ME transducer during its ringdown period, enabling time-domain PWM in ME backscatter. Various circuit techniques are presented to realize SCEE with low power consumption. This paper also describes the high-order modeling of ME transducers to facilitate the design and analysis, which shows good matching with measurement. Our prototyping system includes a millimeter-scale ME implant with a fully integrated system-on-chip (SoC) and a portable transceiver for power transfer and bidirectional communication. SCEE is proven to induce &gt;50% amplitude reduction within 2 ME cycles, leading to a PWM ME backscatter uplink with 17.73 kbps data rate and 0.9 pJ/bit efficiency. It also achieves 8.5 x 10 -5 bit-error-rate (BER) at a 5 cm distance, using a lightweight multi-layer-perception (MLP) decoding algorithm. Finally, the system demonstrates continuous wireless neural local-field potential (LFP) recording in an in vitro setup.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Informed Deep Neural Networks for Power Flow Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces PINN4PF, an end-to-end deep learning architecture for power flow (PF) analysis that effectively captures the nonlinear dynamics of large-scale modern power systems. The proposed neural network (NN) architecture consists of two important advancements in the training pipeline: (A) a double-head feed-forward NN that aligns with PF analysis, including an activation function that adjusts to active and reactive power consumption patterns, and (B) a physics-based loss function that partially incorporates power system topology information. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated through 4-bus, 15-bus, 290-bus, and 2224-bus test systems and is evaluated against two baselines: a linear regression model (LR) and a black-box NN (MLP). The comparison is based on (i) generalization ability, (ii) robustness, (iii) impact of training dataset size on generalization ability, (iv) accuracy in approximating derived PF quantities (specifically line current, line active power, and line reactive power), and (v) scalability. Results demonstrate that PINN4PF outperforms both baselines across all test systems by up to two orders of magnitude not only in terms of direct criteria, e.g., generalization ability but also in terms of approximating derived physical quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With economic development, the complexity of infrastructure has increased drastically. Similarly, with the shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy, there is a dire need for such systems that not only predict and forecast with accuracy but also help in understanding the process of predictions. Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have helped in finding out wellperforming solutions to different problems in the energy sector. However, the usage of state-of-the-art techniques like reinforcement learning is not surprisingly convincing. This paper discusses the application of reinforcement techniques in energy systems and how explanations of these models can be helpful</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explains how traditional centralized architectures are transitioning to distributed zonal approaches to address challenges in scalability, reliability, performance, and cost-effectiveness. The role of edge computing and neural networks in enabling sophisticated sensor fusion and decision-making capabilities for autonomous vehicles is examined. Additionally, this paper discusses the impact of zonal architectures on vehicle diagnostics, power distribution, and smart power management systems. Key design considerations for implementing effective zonal architectures are presented, along with an overview of current challenges and future directions. The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how zonal architectures are shaping the future of automotive technology, particularly in the context of self-driving vehicles and artificial intelligence integration.</description>

      <title>Reactive Synthesis of Sensor Revealing Strategies in Hypergames on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many security applications of cyber-physical systems, a system designer must guarantee that critical missions are satisfied against attacks in the sensors and actuators of the CPS. Traditional security design of CPSs often assume that attackers have complete knowledge of the system. In this article, we introduce a class of deception techniques and study how to leverage asymmetric information created by deception to strengthen CPS security. Consider an adversarial interaction between a CPS defender and an attacker, who can perform sensor jamming attacks. To mitigate such attacks, the defender introduces asymmetrical information by deploying a "hidden sensor," whose presence is initially undisclosed but can be revealed if queried. We introduce hypergames on graphs to model this game with asymmetric information. Building on the solution concept called subjective rationalizable strategies in hypergames, we identify two stages in the game: An initial game stage where the defender commits to a strategy perceived rationalizable by the attacker until he deviates from the equilibrium in the attacker's perceptual game; Upon the deviation, a delay-attack game stage starts where the defender plays against the attacker, who has a bounded delay in attacking the sensor being revealed. Based on backward induction, we develop an algorithm that determines, for any given state, if the defender can benefit from hiding a sensor and revealing it later. If the answer is affirmative, the algorithm outputs a sensor revealing strategy to determine when to reveal the sensor during dynamic interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our deceptive strategies through two case studies related to CPS security applications.</description>

      <title>Learning Ensembles of Vision-based Safety Control Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety filters in control systems correct nominal controls that violate safety constraints. Designing such filters as functions of visual observations in uncertain and complex environments is challenging. Several deep learning-based approaches to tackle this challenge have been proposed recently. However, formally verifying that the learned filters satisfy critical properties that enable them to guarantee the safety of the system is currently beyond reach. Instead, in this work, motivated by the success of ensemble methods in reinforcement learning, we empirically investigate the efficacy of ensembles in enhancing the accuracy and the out-of-distribution generalization of such filters, as a step towards more reliable ones. We experiment with diverse pre-trained vision representation models as filter backbones, training approaches, and output aggregation techniques. We compare the performance of ensembles with different configurations against each other, their individual member models, and large single-model baselines in distinguishing between safe and unsafe states and controls in the DeepAccident dataset. Our results show that diverse ensembles have better state and control classification accuracies compared to individual models.</description>

      <title>Linear Supervision for Nonlinear, High-Dimensional Neural Control and Differential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the dimension of a system increases, traditional methods for control and differential games rapidly become intractable, making the design of safe autonomous agents challenging in complex or team settings. Deep-learning approaches avoid discretization and yield numerous successes in robotics and autonomy, but at a higher dimensional limit, accuracy falls as sampling becomes less efficient. We propose using rapidly generated linear solutions to the partial differential equation (PDE) arising in the problem to accelerate and improve learned value functions for guidance in high-dimensional, nonlinear problems. We define two programs that combine supervision of the linear solution with a standard PDE loss. We demonstrate that these programs offer improvements in speed and accuracy in both a 50-D differential game problem and a 10-D quadrotor control problem.</description>

      <title>Stimulated Raman Scattering in Nonlinear Silicon Nanophotonic Waveguides: Theory and Applications in Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonics caught world attention since channel capacity limit of metallic interconnects approached due to research and design in high speed digital processors. Use of dielectrics, instead, suitable for light propagation was more attractive due to its extremely wide bandwidth. Many of the devices, both active and passive, have been demonstrated using these insulating materials. Due to its excellent optical characteristics, established fabrication history, and cheaper throughput, silicon found its place in photonics arena. However, due to its indirect band structure, efficient light sources are not possible using silicon as the base material. Nevertheless, techniques such as stimulated Raman scattering and third-harmonic generation have made it possible to avoid this natural hurdle in the path of silicon as a light source. This paper reviews basic theory of stimulated Raman scattering, its applications in the context of silicon based photonic integrated circuits and describes ways to improve this nonlinear effect. This paper also covers few of the most important demonstrations of stimulated Raman scattering published in literature from the last decade.</description>

      <title>Exponential Stabilization of Linear Systems using Nearest-Action Control with Countable Input Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies stabilization of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems when control actions can only be realized in finitely many directions where it is possible to actuate uniformly or logarithmically extended positive scaling factors in each direction. Furthermore, a nearest-action selection approach is used to map the continuous measurements to a realizable action where we show that the approach satisfies a weak sector condition for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Using the notion of input-to-state stability, under some assumptions imposed on the transfer function of the system, we show that the closed-loop system converges to the target ball exponentially fast. Moreover, when logarithmic extension for the scaling factors is realizable, the closed-loop system is able to achieve asymptotic stability instead of only practical stability. Finally, we present an example of the application that confirms our analysis.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Grasping Force Tracking Strategy for Nonlinear and Time-Varying Object Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate grasp force control is one of the key skills for ensuring successful and damage-free robotic grasping of objects. Although existing methods have conducted in-depth research on slip detection and grasping force planning, they often overlook the issue of adaptive tracking of the actual force to the target force when handling objects with different material properties. The optimal parameters of a force tracking controller are significantly influenced by the object's stiffness, and many adaptive force tracking algorithms rely on stiffness estimation. However, real-world objects often exhibit viscous, plastic, or other more complex nonlinear time-varying behaviors, and existing studies provide insufficient support for these materials in terms of stiffness definition and estimation. To address this, this paper introduces the concept of generalized stiffness, extending the definition of stiffness to nonlinear time-varying grasp system models, and proposes an online generalized stiffness estimator based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Based on generalized stiffness, this paper proposes an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy using a PI controller as an example, enabling dynamic force tracking for objects with varying characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high precision and short probing time, while showing better adaptability to non-ideal objects compared to existing methods. The method effectively solves the problem of grasp force tracking in unknown, nonlinear, and time-varying grasp systems, enhancing the robotic grasping ability in unstructured environments.</description>

      <title>Fast ground-to-air transition with avian-inspired multifunctional legs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most birds can navigate seamlessly between aerial and terrestrial environments. Whereas the forelimbs evolved into wings primarily for flight, the hindlimbs serve diverse functions such as walking, hopping, and leaping, and jumping take-off for transitions into flight. These capabilities have inspired engineers to aim for similar multi-modality in aerial robots, expanding their range of applications across diverse environments. However, challenges remain in reproducing multi-modal locomotion, across gaits with distinct kinematics and propulsive characteristics, such as walking and jumping, while preserving lightweight mass for flight. This tradeoff between mechanical complexity and versatility limits most existing aerial robots to only one additional locomotor mode. Here, we overcome the complexity-versatility tradeoff with RAVEN (Robotic Avian-inspired Vehicle for multiple ENvironments), which uses its bird-inspired multi-functional legs to jump rapidly into flight, walk on ground and hop over obstacles and gaps similar to the multi-modal locomotion of birds. We show that jumping for take-off contributes substantially to initial flight take-off speed and, remarkably, that it is more energy-efficient than solely propeller-based take-off. Our analysis suggests an important tradeoff in mass distribution between legs and body among birds adapted for different locomotor strategies, with greater investment in leg mass among terrestrial birds with multi-modal gait demands. Multi-functional robot legs expand opportunities to deploy traditional fixed-wing aircraft in complex terrains through autonomous take-offs and multi-modal gaits.</description>

      <title>Analysis, Design, and Fabrication of a High-Gain Low-Profile Metasurface Antenna Using Direct Feeding of Sievenpiper s HIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HISs have recently shown the ability to support leaky waves, and to excite plasmonic and HIS resonance frequency modes for use as an antenna. In this paper, we analyzed, designed, and fabricated a TMA by directly feeding edge-located HIS cells through a microstrip feeding network. In contrast to other metasurface antennas that necessitate an external antenna to excite metasurfaces, our approach is inspired by the TMA design methodology that directly feeds the HIS cells rather than using it as a reflector. We developed a circuit model for the proposed structure and compared the results with those obtained from full-wave simulations. In addition, our further objective was to simplify the structure based on the working principle of the proposed antenna. This objective was achieved by converting square patches into parallel strip lines, leading to an aperture efficiency of 0.77. This simplification also creates additional space to explore various resonant patterns on the top surface and the feeding network on the bottom surface of the TMA. Full-wave simulation results indicate that, despite the compact dimensions of the proposed array with 64 electrically small patch resonators (1.84{\lambda}*1.84{\lambda}*0.032{\lambda}, where{\lambda}is the free space wavelength at 6.0 GHz), it achieves a realized gain, HPBW of about 15.1 dBi and 28{\deg} respectively at 6 GHz. Finally, we constructed a prototype and conducted measurements to validate the design. Measured results demonstrate good agreement with simulation ones with a gain of about 13.5 (+-0.5) dBi and a HPBW of 27{\deg} at 6 GHz. The proposed TMA is scaled to fit within the required dimensions for smart handheld devices at higher frequencies, while maintaining high gain capability. The design s scalability, single-feed, and compact footprint make it optimal for diverse wireless communication systems, such as car to car communications.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Cruising: Reinforcement Learning based Time-Headway Control for Increased Traffic Efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of Connected Automated Vehicles represents an unprecedented opportunity for improving driving efficiency and alleviating traffic congestion. However, existing research fails to address realistic multi-lane highway scenarios without assuming connectivity, perception, and control capabilities that are typically unavailable in current vehicles. This paper proposes a novel AI system that is the first to improve highway traffic efficiency compared with human-like traffic in realistic, simulated multi-lane scenarios, while relying on existing connectivity, perception, and control capabilities. At the core of our approach is a reinforcement learning based controller that dynamically communicates time-headways to automated vehicles near bottlenecks based on real-time traffic conditions. These desired time-headways are then used by Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems to adjust their following distance. By (i) integrating existing traffic estimation technology and low-bandwidth vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity, (ii) leveraging safety-certified ACC systems, and (iii) targeting localized bottleneck challenges that can be addressed independently in different locations, we propose a practical, safe, and scalable system that can positively impact numerous road users.</description>

      <title>Interaction Identification of a Heterogeneous NDS with Quadratic-Bilinear Subsystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper attacks time-domain identification for the interaction parameters of a heterogeneous networked dynamic system (NDS), with each of its subsystems being described by a continuous-time descriptor quadratic-bilinear time-invariant (QBTI) model. No restrictions are put on the sampling rate. Explicit formulas are derived respectively for the transient and steady-state responses of the NDS, provided that the probing signal is generated by a linear time invariant (LTI) system. Some relations have been derived between the NDS steady-state response and its frequency domain input-output mappings. These relations reveal that the value of some NDS associated TFMs can in principle be estimated at almost any interested point of the imaginary axis from input-output experimental data, as well as its derivatives and a right tangential interpolation along an arbitrary direction. Based on these relations, an estimation algorithm is suggested respectively for the parameters of the NDS and the values of these TFMs.</description>

      <title>TAB-Fields: A Maximum Entropy Framework for Mission-Aware Adversarial Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous agents operating in adversarial scenarios face a fundamental challenge: while they may know their adversaries' high-level objectives, such as reaching specific destinations within time constraints, the exact policies these adversaries will employ remain unknown. Traditional approaches address this challenge by treating the adversary's state as a partially observable element, leading to a formulation as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). However, the induced belief-space dynamics in a POMDP require knowledge of the system's transition dynamics, which, in this case, depend on the adversary's unknown policy. Our key observation is that while an adversary's exact policy is unknown, their behavior is necessarily constrained by their mission objectives and the physical environment, allowing us to characterize the space of possible behaviors without assuming specific policies. In this paper, we develop Task-Aware Behavior Fields (TAB-Fields), a representation that captures adversary state distributions over time by computing the most unbiased probability distribution consistent with known constraints. We construct TAB-Fields by solving a constrained optimization problem that minimizes additional assumptions about adversary behavior beyond mission and environmental requirements. We integrate TAB-Fields with standard planning algorithms by introducing TAB-conditioned POMCP, an adaptation of Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning. Through experiments in simulation with underwater robots and hardware implementations with ground robots, we demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to baselines that either assume specific adversary policies or neglect mission constraints altogether. Evaluation videos and code are available at https://tab-fields.github.io.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Resource Allocation Framework for Microservices in Hybrid Cloud Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for scalable, efficient resource management in hybrid cloud environments has led to the exploration of AI-driven approaches for dynamic resource allocation. This paper presents an AI-driven framework for resource allocation among microservices in hybrid cloud platforms. The framework employs reinforcement learning (RL)-based resource utilization optimization to reduce costs and improve performance. The framework integrates AI models with cloud management tools to respond to challenges of dynamic scaling and cost-efficient low-latency service delivery. The reinforcement learning model continuously adjusts provisioned resources as required by the microservices and predicts the future consumption trends to minimize both under- and over-provisioning of resources. Preliminary simulation results indicate that using AI in the provision of resources related to costs can reduce expenditure by up to 30-40% compared to manual provisioning and threshold-based auto-scaling approaches. It is also estimated that the efficiency in resource utilization is expected to improve by 20%-30% with a corresponding latency cut of 15%-20% during the peak demand periods. This study compares the AI-driven approach with existing static and rule-based resource allocation methods, demonstrating the capability of this new model to outperform them in terms of flexibility and real-time interests. The results indicate that reinforcement learning can make optimization of hybrid cloud platforms even better, offering a 25-35% improvement in cost efficiency and the power of scaling for microservice-based applications. The proposed framework is a strong and scalable solution to managing cloud resources in dynamic and performance-critical environments.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enhanced Path Planning: Safe and Efficient Autonomous Navigation with Instructional Inputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation guided by natural language instructions is essential for improving human-robot interaction and enabling complex operations in dynamic environments. While large language models (LLMs) are not inherently designed for planning, they can significantly enhance planning efficiency by providing guidance and informing constraints to ensure safety. This paper introduces a planning framework that integrates LLMs with 2D occupancy grid maps and natural language commands to improve spatial reasoning and task execution in resource-limited settings. By decomposing high-level commands and real-time environmental data, the system generates structured navigation plans for pick-and-place tasks, including obstacle avoidance, goal prioritization, and adaptive behaviors. The framework dynamically recalculates paths to address environmental changes and aligns with implicit social norms for seamless human-robot interaction. Our results demonstrates the potential of LLMs to design context-aware system to enhance navigation efficiency and safety in industrial and dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>A Dissipativity Approach to Analyzing Composite Spreading Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of spreading processes often analyzes networks at different resolutions, e.g., at the level of individuals or countries, but it is not always clear how properties at one resolution can carry over to another. Accordingly, in this work we use dissipativity theory from control system analysis to characterize composite spreading networks that are comprised by many interacting subnetworks. We first develop a method to represent spreading networks that have inputs and outputs. Then we define a composition operation for composing multiple spreading networks into a larger composite spreading network. Next, we develop storage and supply rate functions that can be used to demonstrate that spreading dynamics are dissipative. We then derive conditions under which a composite spreading network will converge to a disease-free equilibrium as long as its constituent spreading networks are dissipative with respect to those storage and supply rate functions. To illustrate these results, we use simulations of an influenza outbreak in a primary school, and we show that an outbreak can be prevented by decreasing the average interaction time between any pair of classes to less than 79% of the original interaction time.</description>

Abstract: A key component of transformers is the attention mechanism orchestrating how each token influences the propagation of every other token through a transformer. In this paper we provide a rigorous, mathematical analysis of the asymptotic properties of attention in transformers. Although we present several results based on different assumptions, all of them point to the same conclusion, all tokens asymptotically converge to each other, a phenomenon that has been empirically reported in the literature. Our findings are carefully compared with existing theoretical results and illustrated by simulations and experimental studies using the GPT-2 model.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing is a fascinating interdisciplinary research field that promises to revolutionize computing by efficiently solving previously intractable problems. Recent years have seen tremendous progress on both the experimental realization of quantum computing devices as well as the development and implementation of quantum algorithms. Yet, realizing computational advantages of quantum computers in practice remains a widely open problem due to numerous fundamental challenges. Interestingly, many of these challenges are connected to performance, robustness, scalability, optimization, or feedback, all of which are central concepts in control theory. This paper provides a tutorial introduction to quantum computing from the perspective of control theory. We introduce the mathematical framework of quantum algorithms ranging from basic elements including quantum bits and quantum gates to more advanced concepts such as variational quantum algorithms and quantum errors. The tutorial only requires basic knowledge of linear algebra and, in particular, no prior exposure to quantum physics. Our main goal is to equip readers with the mathematical basics required to understand and possibly solve (control-related) problems in quantum computing. In particular, beyond the tutorial introduction, we provide a list of research challenges in the field of quantum computing and discuss their connections to control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Public-key cryptosystems rely on computationally difficult problems for security, traditionally analyzed using number theory methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective on cryptosystems by viewing the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptosystem as nonlinear dynamical systems. By applying Koopman theory, we transform these dynamical systems into higher-dimensional spaces and analytically derive equivalent purely linear systems. This formulation allows us to reconstruct the secret integers of the cryptosystems through straightforward manipulations, leveraging the tools available for linear systems analysis. Additionally, we establish an upper bound on the minimum lifting dimension required to achieve perfect accuracy. Our results on the required lifting dimension are in line with the intractability of brute-force attacks. To showcase the potential of our approach, we establish connections between our findings and existing results on algorithmic complexity. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to a data-driven context, where the Koopman representation is learned from data samples of the cryptosystems.</description>

      <title>Cooptimizing Safety and Performance with a Control-Constrained Formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous systems have witnessed a rapid increase in their capabilities, but it remains a challenge for them to perform tasks both effectively and safely. The fact that performance and safety can sometimes be competing objectives renders the cooptimization between them difficult. One school of thought is to treat this cooptimization as a constrained optimal control problem with a performance-oriented objective function and safety as a constraint. However, solving this constrained optimal control problem for general nonlinear systems remains challenging. In this work, we use the general framework of constrained optimal control, but given the safety state constraint, we convert it into an equivalent control constraint, resulting in a state and time-dependent control-constrained optimal control problem. This equivalent optimal control problem can readily be solved using the dynamic programming principle. We show the corresponding value function is a viscosity solution of a certain Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Partial Differential Equation (HJB-PDE). Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with a two-dimensional case study, and the experiment shows that the controller synthesized using our method consistently outperforms the baselines, both in safety and performance.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization for Traffic Light Control and Connected Automated Vehicle Coordination in Mixed-Traffic Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of coordinating traffic light systems and connected automated vehicles (CAVs) in mixed-traffic intersections. We aim to develop an optimization-based control framework that leverages both the coordination capabilities of CAVs at higher penetration rates and intelligent traffic management using traffic lights at lower penetration rates. Since the resulting optimization problem is a multi-agent mixed-integer quadratic program, we propose a penalization-enhanced maximum block improvement algorithm to solve the problem in a distributed manner. The proposed algorithm, under certain mild conditions, yields a feasible person-by-person optimal solution of the centralized problem. The performance of the control framework and the distributed algorithm is validated through simulations across various penetration rates and traffic volumes.</description>

      <title>Fault Detection and Identification via Monitoring Modules Based on Clusters of Interacting Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel control-aware distributed process monitoring methodology based on modules comprised of clusters of interacting measurements. The methodology relies on the process flow diagram (PFD) and control system structure without requiring cross-correlation data to create monitoring modules. The methodology is validated on the Tennessee Eastman Process benchmark using full Principal Component Analysis (f-PCA) in the monitoring modules. The results are comparable to nonlinear techniques implemented in a centralized manner such as Kernel PCA (KPCA), Autoencoders (AE), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or distributed techniques like the Distributed Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA). Temporal plots of fault detection by different modules show clearly the magnitude and propagation of the fault through each module, pinpointing the module where the fault originates, and separating controllable faults from other faults. This information, combined with PCA contribution plots, helps detection and identification as effectively as more complex nonlinear centralized or distributed methods.</description>

      <title>MPC-guided, Data-driven Fuzzy Controller Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful control technique for online optimization using system model-based predictions over a finite time horizon. However, the computational cost MPC requires can be prohibitive in resource-constrained computer systems. This paper presents a fuzzy controller synthesis framework guided by MPC. In the proposed framework, training data is obtained from MPC closed-loop simulations and is used to optimize a low computational complexity controller to emulate the response of MPC. In particular, autoregressive moving average (ARMA) controllers are trained using data obtained from MPC closed-loop simulations, such that each ARMA controller emulates the response of the MPC controller under particular desired conditions. Using a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system, the responses of all the trained ARMA controllers are then weighted depending on the measured system conditions, resulting in the Fuzzy-Autoregressive Moving Average (F-ARMA) controller. The effectiveness of the trained F-ARMA controllers is illustrated via numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Iteration-Free Cooperative Distributed MPC through Multiparametric Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative Distributed Model Predictive Control (DiMPC) architecture employs local MPC controllers to control different subsystems, exchanging information with each other through an iterative procedure to enhance overall control performance compared to the decentralized architecture. However, this method can result in high communication between the controllers and computational costs. In this work, the amount of information exchanged and the computational costs of DiMPC are reduced significantly by developing novel iteration-free solution algorithms based on multiparametric (mp) programming. These algorithms replace the iterative procedure with simultaneous solutions of explicit mpDiMPC control law functions. The reduced communication among local controllers decreases system latency, which is crucial for real-time control applications. The effectiveness of the proposed iteration-free mpDiMPC algorithms is demonstrated through comprehensive numerical simulations involving groups of coupled linear subsystems, which are interconnected through their inputs and a cooperative plant-wide cost function.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Partitioning Strategy for High-Dimensional Discrete Simulation-based Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a technique to enhance the computational efficiency of solution algorithms for high-dimensional discrete simulation-based optimization problems. The technique is based on innovative adaptive partitioning strategies that partition the feasible region using solutions that has already been simulated as well as prior knowledge of the problem of interesting. We integrate the proposed strategies with the Empirical Stochastic Branch-and-Bound framework proposed by Xu and Nelson (2013). This combination leads to a general-purpose discrete simulation-based optimization algorithm that is both globally convergent and has good small sample (finite-time) performance. The proposed general-purpose discrete simulation-based optimization algorithm is validated on a synthetic discrete simulation-based optimization problem and is then used to address a real-world car-sharing fleet assignment problem. Experiment results show that the proposed strategy can increase the algorithm efficiency significantly.</description>

      <title>Robustness of quantum algorithms against coherent control errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent control errors, for which ideal Hamiltonians are perturbed by unknown multiplicative noise terms, are a major obstacle for reliable quantum computing. In this paper, we present a framework for analyzing the robustness of quantum algorithms against coherent control errors using Lipschitz bounds. We derive worst-case fidelity bounds which show that the resilience against coherent control errors is mainly influenced by the norms of the Hamiltonians generating the individual gates. These bounds are explicitly computable even for large circuits, and they can be used to guarantee fault-tolerance via threshold theorems. Moreover, we apply our theoretical framework to derive a novel guideline for robust quantum algorithm design and transpilation, which amounts to reducing the norms of the Hamiltonians. Using the $3$-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform as an example application, we demonstrate that this guideline targets robustness more effectively than existing ones based on circuit depth or gate count. Furthermore, we apply our framework to study the effect of parameter regularization in variational quantum algorithms. The practicality of the theoretical results is demonstrated via implementations in simulation and on a quantum computer.</description>

      <title>BonnBot-I: A Precise Weed Management and Crop Monitoring Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cultivation and weeding are two of the primary tasks performed by farmers today. A recent challenge for weeding is the desire to reduce herbicide and pesticide treatments while maintaining crop quality and quantity. In this paper, we introduce BonnBot-I a precise weed management platform which can also performs field monitoring. Driven by crop monitoring approaches that can accurately locate and classify plants (weed and crop) we further improve their performance by fusing the platform available GNSS and wheel odometry. This improves the tracking accuracy of our crop monitoring approach from a normalized average error of 8.3% to 3.5%, evaluated on a new publicly available corn dataset. We also present a novel arrangement of weeding tools mounted on linear actuators evaluated in simulated environments. We replicate weed distributions from a real field, using the results from our monitoring approach, and show the validity of our work-space division techniques which require significantly less movement (a 50% reduction) to achieve similar results. Overall, BonnBot-I is a significant step forward in precise weed management with a novel method of selectively spraying and controlling weeds in an arable field.</description>

      <title>A Near-Field Super-Resolution Network for Accelerating Antenna Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a deep neural network-enabled method to accelerate near-field (NF) antenna measurement. We develop a Near-field Super-resolution Network (NFS-Net) to reconstruct significantly undersampled near-field data as high-resolution data, which considerably reduces the number of sampling points required for NF measurement and thus improves measurement efficiency. The high-resolution near-field data reconstructed by the network is further processed by a near-field-to-far-field (NF2FF) transformation to obtain far-field antenna radiation patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that the NFS-Net exhibits both accuracy and generalizability in restoring high-resolution near-field data from low-resolution input. The NF measurement workflow that combines the NFS-Net and the NF2FF algorithm enables accurate radiation pattern characterization with only 11% of the Nyquist rate samples. Though the experiments in this study are conducted on a planar setup with a uniform grid, the proposed method can serve as a universal strategy to accelerate measurements under different setups and conditions.</description>

      <title>ProACT: An Augmented Reality Testbed for Intelligent Prosthetic Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Upper-limb amputees face tremendous difficulty in operating dexterous powered prostheses. Previous work has shown that aspects of prosthetic hand, wrist, or elbow control can be improved through "intelligent" control, by combining movement-based or gaze-based intent estimation with low-level robotic autonomy. However, no such solutions exist for whole-arm control. Moreover, hardware platforms for advanced prosthetic control are expensive, and existing simulation platforms are not well-designed for integration with robotics software frameworks. We present the Prosthetic Arm Control Testbed (ProACT), a platform for evaluating intelligent control methods for prosthetic arms in an immersive (Augmented Reality) simulation setting. We demonstrate the use of ProACT through preliminary studies, with non-amputee participants performing an adapted Box-and-Blocks task with and without intent estimation. We further discuss how our observations may inform the design of prosthesis control methods, as well as the design of future studies using the platform. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first study of semi-autonomous control for complex whole-arm prostheses, the first study including sequential task modeling in the context of wearable prosthetic arms, and the first testbed of its kind. Towards the goal of supporting future research in intelligent prosthetics, the system is built upon on existing open-source frameworks for robotics, and is available at https://arm.stanford.edu/proact.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Machine Learning-based Physical-Layer Authentication in Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To ensure secure and reliable communication in wireless systems, authenticating the identities of numerous nodes is imperative. Traditional cryptography-based authentication methods suffer from issues such as low compatibility, reliability, and high complexity. Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA) is emerging as a promising complement due to its exploitation of unique properties in wireless environments. Recently, Machine Learning (ML)-based PLA has gained attention for its intelligence, adaptability, universality, and scalability compared to non-ML approaches. However, a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art ML-based PLA and its foundational aspects is lacking. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of characteristics and technologies that can be used in the ML-based PLA. We categorize existing ML-based PLA schemes into two main types: multi-device identification and attack detection schemes. In deep learning-based multi-device identification schemes, Deep Neural Networks are employed to train models, avoiding complex processing and expert feature transformation. Deep learning-based multi-device identification schemes are further subdivided, with schemes based on Convolutional Neural Networks being extensively researched. In ML-based attack detection schemes, receivers utilize intelligent ML techniques to set detection thresholds automatically, eliminating the need for manual calculation or knowledge of channel models. ML-based attack detection schemes are categorized into three sub-types: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. Additionally, we summarize open-source datasets used for PLA, encompassing Radio Frequency fingerprints and channel fingerprints. Finally, this paper outlines future research directions to guide researchers in related fields.</description>

      <title>On the Surprising Effectiveness of Spectrum Clipping in Learning Stable Linear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When learning stable linear dynamical systems from data, three important properties are desirable: i) predictive accuracy, ii) provable stability, and iii) computational efficiency. Unconstrained minimization of reconstruction errors leads to high accuracy and efficiency but cannot guarantee stability. Existing methods to remedy this focus on enforcing stability while also ensuring accuracy, but do so only at the cost of increased computation. In this work, we investigate if a straightforward approach can simultaneously offer all three desiderata of learning stable linear systems. Specifically, we consider a post-hoc approach that manipulates the spectrum of the learned system matrix after it is learned in an unconstrained fashion. We call this approach spectrum clipping (SC) as it involves eigen decomposition and subsequent reconstruction of the system matrix after clipping all of its eigenvalues that are larger than one to one (without altering the eigenvectors). Through detailed experiments involving two different applications and publicly available benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that this simple technique can simultaneously learn highly accurate linear systems that are provably stable. Notably, we demonstrate that SC can achieve similar or better performance than strong baselines while being orders-of-magnitude faster. We also show that SC can be readily combined with Koopman operators to learn stable nonlinear dynamics, such as those underlying complex dexterous manipulation skills involving multi-fingered robotic hands. Our codes and dataset can be found at https://github.com/GT-STAR-Lab/spec_clip.</description>
