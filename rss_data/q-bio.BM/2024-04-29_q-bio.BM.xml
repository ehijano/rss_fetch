      <title>DNA Calorimetric Force Spectroscopy at Single Base Pair Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA hybridization is a fundamental reaction with wide-ranging applications in biotechnology. The nearest-neighbor (NN) model provides the most reliable description of the energetics of duplex formation. Most DNA thermodynamics studies have been done in melting experiments in bulk, of limited resolution due to ensemble averaging. In contrast, single-molecule methods have reached the maturity to derive DNA thermodynamics with unprecedented accuracy. We combine single-DNA mechanical unzipping experiments using a temperature jump optical trap with machine learning methods and derive the temperature-dependent DNA energy parameters of the NN model. In particular, we measure the previously unknown ten heat-capacity change parameters $\Delta C_p$, relevant for thermodynamical predictions throughout the DNA stability range. Calorimetric force spectroscopy establishes a groundbreaking methodology to accurately study nucleic acids, from chemically modified DNA to RNA and DNA/RNA hybrid structures.</description>

      <title>Bacterial stress granule protects mRNA through ribonucleases exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membraneless droplets formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) play a crucial role in mRNA storage, enabling organisms to swiftly respond to environmental changes. However, the mechanisms underlying mRNA integration and protection within droplets remain unclear. Here, we unravel the role of bacterial aggresomes as stress granules (SGs) in safeguarding mRNA during stress. We discovered that upon stress onset, mobile mRNA molecules selectively incorporate into individual proteinaceous SGs based on length-dependent enthalpic gain over entropic loss. As stress prolongs, SGs undergo compaction facilitated by stronger non-specific RNA-protein interactions, thereby promoting recruitment of shorter RNA chains. Remarkably, mRNA ribonucleases are repelled from bacterial SGs, due to the influence of protein surface charge. This exclusion mechanism ensures the integrity and preservation of mRNA within SGs during stress conditions, explaining how mRNA can be stored and protected from degradation. Following stress removal, SGs facilitate mRNA translation, thereby enhancing cell fitness in changing environments. These droplets maintain mRNA physiological activity during storage, making them an intriguing new candidate for mRNA therapeutics manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Endhered patterns in matchings and RNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An endhered (end-adhered) pattern is a subset of arcs in matchings, such that the corresponding starting points are consecutive and the same holds for the ending points. Such patterns are in one-to-one correspondence with the permutations. We focus on the occurrence frequency of such patterns in matchings and real-world RNA structures with pseudoknots. We present combinatorial results related to the distribution and asymptotic behavior of the pattern 21, which corresponds to two consecutive stacked bonds frequently encountered in RNA, and the pattern 12, representing the archetypal minimal pseudoknot. We show that in matchings these two patterns are equidistributed, which is quite different from what we can find in real-world RNAs. We also examine the distribution of endhered patterns of size 3, showing how the patterns change under the transformation called endhered twist. Finally, we compute the distributions of endhered patterns of size 2 and 3 in real-world secondary RNA structures with pseudoknots and discuss possible outcomes of our study.</description>

      <title>AdaMR: Adaptable Molecular Representation for Unified Pre-training Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Adjustable Molecular Representation (AdaMR), a new large-scale uniform pre-training strategy for small-molecule drugs, as a novel unified pre-training strategy. AdaMR utilizes a granularity-adjustable molecular encoding strategy, which is accomplished through a pre-training job termed molecular canonicalization, setting it apart from recent large-scale molecular models. This adaptability in granularity enriches the model's learning capability at multiple levels and improves its performance in multi-task scenarios. Specifically, the substructure-level molecular representation preserves information about specific atom groups or arrangements, influencing chemical properties and functionalities. This proves advantageous for tasks such as property prediction. Simultaneously, the atomic-level representation, combined with generative molecular canonicalization pre-training tasks, enhances validity, novelty, and uniqueness in generative tasks. All of these features work together to give AdaMR outstanding performance on a range of downstream tasks. We fine-tuned our proposed pre-trained model on six molecular property prediction tasks (MoleculeNet datasets) and two generative tasks (ZINC250K datasets), achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on five out of eight tasks.</description>
