      <title>Generalized Onsager's Relation in Magnon Hall Effect and Its Implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analyzing the spin-group symmetry of magnons, we establish two generalized Onsager's relations in the magnon Hall effect, which reveals the rich and complicated structures of the magnon Berry curvature in the parameter space of different types of the exchange coupling. As an important consequence, we find that the isotropic exchange coupling is equally important as the DzyaloshinskiiMoriya (DM) interaction in determining the magnon Hall effect, and it can transform to the latter under proper gauge transformation. Moreover, the diagonal and off-diagonal part of the symmetric anisotropic exchange coupling together can support the magnon Hall effect without the DM interaction. Both features are exemplified in ferromagnetic honeycomb lattices. Our work lays the ground for decoding the coupling between magnon transport and different types of exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Topological phase diagram and quantum magnetotransport effects in (Pb,Sn)Se quantum wells with magnetic barriers (Pb,Eu)Se</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite several theoretical predictions regarding the physics and application of quantum wells (QWs) of topological crystalline insulators (TCI), no quantized charge transport via helical or chiral edge states has been experimentally demonstrated for such a class of systems. In this study, we report here on a successful growth by molecular beam epitaxy of high crystalline quality Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se:Bi/Pb$_{1-y}$Eu$_{y}$Se QWs with $x = 0.25$ and $y = 0.1$, and on their magnetotransport characterization as a function of the QW thickness between 10 and 50 nm, temperatures down to 300 mK, perpendicular and tilted magnetic fields up to 36 T. The character of weak antilocalization magnetoresistance and universal conductance fluctuations points to a notably long phase coherence length. It is argued that a relatively large magnitude of the dielectric constant of IV-VI compounds suppresses the decoherence by electron-electron scattering. The observation of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations and the quantum Hall effect, together with multiband $k\cdot p$ modelling, have enabled us to assess valley degeneracies, the magnitude of strain, subbands effective masses, the Berry phases, and the topological phase diagram as a function of the QW thickness. Our results demonstrate that further progress in controlling Sn content, carrier densities, and magnetism in Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se/Pb$_{1-y}$Eu$_{y}$Se QWs will allow for the exploration of the topologically protected quantized edge transport even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Furthermore, a reduced strength of electron-electron interactions will result in the absence of unpaired localized spins in the topological gap and, thus, in a substantially longer topological protection length compared to the quantum spin Hall materials explored so far.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Chirality-dependent Dynamics from Helicity-resolved Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality, a pervasive phenomenon in nature, is widely studied across diverse fields including the origins of life, chemical catalysis, drug discovery, and physical optoelectronics. The investigations of natural chiral materials have been constrained by their intrinsically weak chiral effects. Recently, significant progress has been made in the fabrication and assembly of low-dimensional micro and nanoscale chiral materials and their architectures, leading to the discovery of novel optoelectronic phenomena such as circularly polarized light emission, spin and charge flip, advocating great potential for applications in quantum information, quantum computing, and biosensing. Despite these advancements, the fundamental mechanisms underlying the generation, propagation, and amplification of chirality in low-dimensional chiral materials and architectures remain largely unexplored. To tackle these challenges, we focus on employing ultrafast spectroscopy to investigate the dynamics of chirality evolution, with the aim of attaining a more profound understanding of the microscopic mechanisms governing chirality generation and amplification. This review thus provides a comprehensive overview of the chiral micro-/nano-materials, including two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), chiral halide perovskites, and chiral metasurfaces, with a particular emphasis on the physical mechanism. This review further explores the advancements made by ultrafast chiral spectroscopy research, thereby paving the way for innovative devices in chiral photonics and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Valley-mediated singlet- and triplet-polaron interactions and quantum dynamics in a doped WSe$_2$ monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In doped transition metal dichalcogenides, optically created excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) can strongly interact with a Fermi sea of electrons to form Fermi polaron quasiparticles. When there are two distinct Fermi seas, as is the case in WSe$_2$, there are two flavors of lowest-energy (attractive) polarons -- singlet and triplet -- where the exciton is coupled to the Fermi sea in the same or opposite valley, respectively. Using two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy, we analyze how their quantum decoherence evolves with doping density and determine the condition under which stable Fermi polarons form. Because of the large oscillator strength associated with these resonances, intrinsic quantum dynamics of polarons as well as valley coherence between coupled singlet- and triplet polarons occur on sub-picosecond time scales. Surprisingly, we find that a dark-to-bright state conversion process leads to a particularly long-lived singlet polaron valley polarization, persisting up to 200-800 ps. Valley coherence between the singlet- and triplet polaron is correlated with their energy fluctuations. Our finding provides valuable guidance for the electrical and optical control of spin and valley indexes in atomically thin semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Electron-Phonon Temperature Inversion in Nanostructures under Pulsed Photoexcitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoexcitation of metallic nanostructures with short optical pulses can drive non-thermal electronic states, which, upon decay, lead to elevated electronic temperatures ($T_e \gtrapprox 1000\,\mathrm{K}$) eventually equilibrating with the lattice ($T_p$) through electron-phonon scattering. Here, we show that, in spatially extended nanostructures, the lattice temperature can locally exceed that of the electrons, a seemingly counterintuitive transient effect termed hereafter ``temperature inversion'' ($T_p &gt; T_e$). This phenomenon, fundamentally due to inhomogeneous absorption patterns and absent in smaller particles, emerges from a complex spatio-temporal interplay, between the electron-phonon coupling and competing electronic thermal diffusion. By combining rigorous three-dimensional (3D) finite-element-method-based simulations with practical reduced zero-dimensional (0D) analytical models, we identify the electron-phonon coupling coefficient ($G_{e-p}$) as the critical parameter governing this behavior. An optimal $G_{e-p}$ range allows the inversion, whereas a weak or overly strong coupling suppresses it. Among common plasmonic metals, platinum (Pt) exhibits the most pronounced and long-lived inversion, while gold (Au) and silver (Ag) show no significant inversion. Moreover, the close agreement between the 0D and 3D results, once an appropriate characteristic length is selected, highlights that the essential physics governing the inversion can be captured without full spatial complexity. These results provide insights for optimizing nanoscale energy transfer and hot-carrier-driven processes, guiding the strategic design of materials, geometries, and excitation conditions for enhanced ultrafast photothermal control.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal symmetry breaking fractional quantum spin Hall insulator in moir\'e MoTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which support flat Chern bands with enhanced interaction effects, realize a platform for fractional Chern insulators and fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) insulators. A recent experiment has reported the emergence of a FQSH insulator protected by spin-Sz conservation at a moir\'e lattice filling factor {\nu}=3 in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2. Theoretical studies have proposed both time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric ground states as possible candidates for the observed FQSH insulator, but the nature of the state remains unexplored. Here we report the observation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at generic fillings in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2 from {\nu}&lt;1 all the way to {\nu}&gt;6 except at {\nu}=2, 4, and 6. Although zero Hall response is observed at {\nu}=3 for magnetic fields higher than 20 mT, a finite anomalous Hall response accompanied by a magnetic hysteresis is observed at lower magnetic fields, demonstrating spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work shows the tendency towards ferromagnetism by doping the first three pairs of conjugate Chern bands in the material; it also sheds light on the nature of the FQSH insulator at {\nu}=3.</description>

      <title>Universal classes of disorder scatterings in in-plane anomalous Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The in-plane anomalous Hall effect (IPAHE) with planar Hall current and magnetization/magnetic fields in various quantum materials has received increasing attentions. Most of current efforts are devoted to the intrinsic part due to the Berry curvature of electronic bands, however, how the disorder scatterings affect the extrinsic part (skew scattering and side jump) still remains largely elusive. Here we theoretically investigated the three universal classes of disorder scatterings (scalar, spin-conserving and spin-flipping) on the IPAHE based on the prototypical two-dimensional massive Dirac fermion model with warping term under generic Zeeman fields. We find the different disorder scatterings result in distinct dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity on disorder strength and recover previous known results in some limits. Remarkably, the spin-flipping scattering could give rise to nontrivial contributions featuring sinusoidal oscillation with periods of $\pi$ and $2\pi$ to the extrinsic part, in contrast to the standard two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions. Our work unveils the rich features of anomalous transport in planar Hall geometry in the presence of disorder scatterings and provides some useful insights into the magnetotransport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic thermal Hall effect of optical phonons enhanced by discrete rotational symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity contributed by optical phonons in a cubic system. The discrete rotational symmetry of the system splits the degeneracy of transverse modes across most regions of wave-vector space, except along a few high-symmetry lines. Consequently, in the presence of an external magnetic field, phonon Berry curvatures become sharply peaked near the high-symmetry lines. We find that the singular distribution of the Berry curvature induces an intrinsic thermal Hall conductivity that is significantly enhanced compared to an isotropic system. It exhibits a nonlinear $B\ln B$ dependence on the magnetic field $B$ and a non-monotonic temperature dependence. At elevated temperatures, it reverses sign and approaches a non-vanishing value asymptotically. Our analysis indicates that the behavior results from competition between contributions from Berry curvatures near different high-symmetry lines.</description>

      <title>Image-charge detection of electrons on helium in an on-chip trapping device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons trapped on the surface of superfluid helium have been thought of as a useful resource for quantum computing. Such electrons show long coherence of their surface-bound (Rydberg) states combined with their easy electrostatic manipulation. Recent proposals explored the possibility of coupling the spin state of an electron and the state of its quantized motion with a promise of a highly scalable 2D architecture for a quantum computer. However, despite recent progress in the detection of quantized lateral motion of electrons using a circuit-QED setup, the manipulation of a small number of electrons and their quantum state detection remains a challenging problem. Here, we report on the detection of the Rydberg transition of electrons on superfluid helium in an on-chip microchannel device in which electrons are moved and trapped by a set of electrostatic gates. A highly sensitive image-charge detection system allows us not only to resolve the transition spectra of such electrons, but also to perform the device characterization. The demonstrated sensitivity shows the feasibility of detecting the Rydberg transition of a single electron, which can open a new pathway for a non-destructive spin-state readout.</description>

      <title>Comparing the Extrinsic Orbital Hall Effect in Centrosymmetric and Noncentrosymmetric Systems: Insights from Bilayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both intrinsic and extrinsic orbital Hall effects (OHE) in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are investigated in the presence of short-range disorder using quantum kinetic theory. Bilayer TMDs provide an ideal platform to study the effects of inversion symmetry breaking on transport properties due to their unique structural and electronic characteristics. While bilayer TMDs are naturally inversion symmetric, applying a finite gate voltage to create a bias between the layers effectively breaks this symmetry. Our findings reveal that slightly away from the band edges, the extrinsic OHE becomes the dominant contribution in both inversion-symmetric and asymmetric cases, with its prominence increasing significantly as the Fermi energy rises. Furthermore, we demonstrate that breaking inversion symmetry greatly enhances the extrinsic OHE. This enhancement arises from the fundamentally distinct behavior of orbital angular momentum (OAM) in centrosymmetric systems, where intraband components vanish due to symmetry constraints. As a result, in centrosymmetric systems, only the off-diagonal components of the density matrix contribute to the extrinsic OHE. In contrast, in noncentrosymmetric systems, both diagonal and off-diagonal components play a role. Our study suggests that in experimentally relevant, highly doped systems, the OHE is predominantly extrinsic in nature, regardless of whether the system is centrosymmetric or noncentrosymmetric. Importantly, we infer that even a weakly breaking of inversion symmetry can lead to a dramatic enhancement of the OHE, a finding with significant implications for experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Operating semiconductor qubits without individual barrier gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor spin qubits have emerged as a promising platform for quantum computing, following a significant improvement in their control fidelities over recent years. Increasing the qubit count remains challenging, beginning with the fabrication of small features and complex fanouts. A particular challenge has been formed by the need for individual barrier gates to control the exchange interaction between adjacent spin qubits. Here, we propose a method to vary two-qubit interactions without applying pulses on individual barrier gates while also remaining insensitive to detuning noise in first order. By changing plunger gate voltages over 300 mV we tune the exchange energy $J$ from 100 kHz to 60 MHz. This allows us to perform two-qubit operations without changing the barrier gate voltage. Based on these findings we conceptualize a spin qubit architecture without individual barrier gates, simplifying the fabrication while maintaining the control necessary for universal quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Probing Magnetism in Self-Assembled Organometallic Complexes using Kondo Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of individual spins at the atomic level holds great promise for miniaturized spintronics, quantum sensing, and quantum information processing. Both single atomic and molecular spin centers are prime candidates for these applications and are often individually addressed and manipulated using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). In this work, we present a hybrid approach and demonstrate a robust method for self-assembly of magnetic organometallic complexes consisting of individual iron (Fe) atoms and molecules on a silver substrate using STM. We employ two types of molecules, bis(dibenzoylmethane) copper(II) [Cu(dbm)2] and iron phthalocyanine (FePc). We show that in both cases the Fe atoms preferentially attach underneath the benzene ring ligand of the molecules, effectively forming an organometallic half-sandwich arene complex, Fe(C6H6), that is akin to the properties of metallocenes. In both situations, a molecule can be combined with up to two Fe atoms. In addition, we observe a change in the magnetic properties of the attached Fe atoms in scanning tunneling spectroscopy, revealing a distinct Kondo signature at the Fe sites. We explain the latter using density functional theory calculations, and find that the bond formation between the Fe 3d-orbitals and the benzene {\pi}-molecular orbitals creates a favorable situation for Kondo screening of the d_xz- and d_yz-like orbitals. Thus, this work establishes a reliable design principle for forming hybrid organometallic complexes and simultaneous tuning of their atomic spin states.</description>

      <title>Probing Electrocatalytic Gas Evolution Reaction at Pt by Force Noise Measurements. Part 1-Hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocatalytic processes occurring at the heterogeneous interface are complex and their understanding at the molecular level remains challenging. Atomic force microscope (AFM) can detect force interactions down to the atomic level, but so far it has been mainly used to obtain in-situ images of electrocatalysts. Here for the first time, we employ AFM to investigate gas evolution at a platinum ultramicroelectrode (Pt UME) under electrochemical conditions using the force noise method. We detect excess force noise when the individual H2 gas bubble nucleation, growth, and detachment events occur at the Pt UME. The excess noise varies linearly with the applied potential on a semi-log plot. Chronoamperometry current fluctuations indicate that the H2 gas bubble radius increases from 1 to 10 micrometers and the AFM deflection signal measurements indicate that the mean H2 bubble radius is 321 micrometers. These two values point to the coalescence of small bubbles generated at the Pt UME interface. The contribution reports an innovative method to probe the gas bubble dynamics at the heterogenous interface under electrochemical conditions with high sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: Close to the Dirac point, graphene is expected to exist in quantum critical Dirac fluid state, where the flow of both charge and heat can be described with a dc electrical conductivity $\sigma_\mathrm{Q}$, and thermodynamic variables such as the entropy and enthalpy densities. Although the fluid-like viscous flow of charge is frequently reported in state-of-the-art graphene devices, the value of $\sigma_\mathrm{Q}$, predicted to be quantized and determined only by the universality class of the critical point, has not been established experimentally so far. Here we have discerned the quantum critical universality in graphene transport by combining the electrical ($\sigma$) and thermal ($\kappa_\mathrm{e}$) conductivities in very high-quality devices close to the Dirac point. We find that $\sigma$ and $\kappa_\mathrm{e}$ are inversely related, as expected from relativistic hydrodynamics, and $\sigma_\mathrm{Q}$ converges to $\approx (4\pm 1)\times e^2/h$ for multiple devices, where $e$ and $h$ are the electronic charge and the Planck's constant, respectively. We also observe, (1) a giant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law where the effective Lorentz number exceeds the semiclassical value by more than 200 times close to the Dirac point at low temperatures, and (2) the effective dynamic viscosity ($\eta_\mathrm{th}$) in the thermal regime approaches the holographic limit $\eta_\mathrm{th}/s_\mathrm{th} \rightarrow \hbar/4\pi k_\mathrm{B}$ within a factor of four in the cleanest devices close to the room temperature, where $s_\mathrm{th}$ and $k_\mathrm{B}$ are the thermal entropy density and the Boltzmann constant, respectively. Our experiment addresses the missing piece in the potential of high-quality graphene as a testing bed for some of the unifying concepts in physics.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic Mechanisms of Phonon Magnetic Moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general formalism of phonon magnetic moment by including the relaxation process. We then identify the skew-scattering and side-jump contributions to the phonon magnetic moment originating from the non-adiabaticity, both of which are related to the nonlocal phonon Berry curvature and are in close analogy to those in the electronic Hall effect. All contributions of the phonon magnetic moment are exemplified in a honeycomb lattice, showing that the extrinsic contribution can be as important as the intrinsic one and that the resulting phonon angular momentum varies significantly across the Brillouin zone. Our work offers a systematic framework of the phonon chirality and paves the way of tuning the phonon magnetic moment through the non-adiabaticity.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity Magnetism Driven by Antiferromagnetic Exchange</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing odd-parity, time-reversal-preserving, non-relativistic spin splitting is a central goal for spintronics applications. We propose a group-theory-based microscopic framework to induce odd-parity spin splitting from coplanar antiferromagnetic (AFM) states without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We develop phenomenological models for 421 conventional period-doubling AFM systems in non-symmorphic space groups and construct minimal microscopic models for 119 of these. We find that these AFM states can attain three possible competing ground states. These ground states all break symmetries in addition to those broken by the usual AFM order. Specifically, they give rise to either odd-parity spin-splitting, nematic order, or scalar odd-parity order related to multiferroicity. Our microscopic theories reveal that the odd-parity spin-splitting energy scale is generically large and further reveal that the scalar odd-parity order gives a non-zero Berry curvature dipole without SOC. We identify 67 materials in the Magndata database for which our theory applies. We provide DFT calculations on FeSe that reveal an $h$-wave spin splitting consistent with our symmetry arguments and apply our microscopic model to determine the non-relativistic Edelstein response for CeNiAsO.</description>

      <title>High-throughput calculations of spin Hall conductivity in non-magnetic 2D materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin Hall effect (SHE) in two-dimensional (2D) materials is promising to effectively manipulate spin angular momentum and identify topological properties. In this work, we implemented an automated Wannierization with spin-orbit coupling on 426 non-magnetic monolayers including 210 metal and 216 insulators. Intrinsic spin Hall conductivity (SHC) has been calculated to find candidates exhibiting novel properties. We discover that Y$_2$C$_2$I$_2$ has an unconventional SHE with canted spin due to low crystal symmetry, Ta$_4$Se$_2$ is a metallic monolayer with exceptionally high SHC, and the semi-metal Y$_2$Br$_2$ possesses efficient charge-to-spin conversion induced by anti-crossing in bands. Moreover, quantum spin Hall insulators are investigated for quantized SHC. The present work provides a high-quality Wannier Hamiltonian database of 2D materials, and paves the way for the integration of 2D materials into high-performance and low-power-consumption spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional Supersolids in Luther-Emery Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The supersolid is a long-sought phase in condensed matter physics, characterized by the coexistence of density wave and superfluid orders. This phase is counterintuitive, as different symmetry-breaking orders typically compete with one another. A deeper understanding of how such a state forms in condensed matter systems remains an open question, especially in quasi-one-dimensional correlated systems. In this work, we investigate the emergence of supersolids in Luttinger-Emery liquids using a variational method. As the system consists of coupled Luttinger-Emery liquid chains, we refer to this phase as a quasi-one-dimensional supersolid. Notably, we demonstrate that the quasi-one-dimensional supersolid phase is energetically favorable in chains with finite size or short-range order. Furthermore, we investigate the collective dynamics of these coexisting charge density waves and superconducting states, identifying a quasi-Goldstone mode. Our theory provides valuable insights into both the ground state and the dynamic properties of supersolids in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Monolayer control of spin-charge conversion in van der Waals heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diversity of 2D materials and their van der Waals (vdW) stacking presents a fertile ground for engineering novel multifunctional materials and quantum states of matter. This permits unique opportunities to tailor the electronic properties of vdW heterostructures by the insertion of only a single 2D material layer. However, such vdW materials engineering at the atomic scale has yet to be investigated for spin-charge interconversion phenomena. Here, we report on the control of these effects at the monolayer level, where drastic increase in intensity and change in sign of THz spintronic emission are demonstrated by inserting a single layer of MoSe$_2$ between PtSe$_2$ and graphene in a fully epitaxial, large area stacked structure. By using a combination of spin and angle resolved photoemission and density functional theory to reveal the electronic and spin structures, we illustrate two different mechanisms relying on charge transfer and electronic hybridization for the formation of Rashba states, which are responsible for spin-charge conversion and hence the THz spintronic emission. These findings open new pathways to design, at the atomic scale, efficient THz spintronic emitters made of 2D materials and other spintronic devices based on spin-charge interconversion phenomena.</description>

      <title>Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention for Adaptive Dynamics in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to modifying Transformer architectures by integrating graph-aware relational reasoning into the attention mechanism, merging concepts from graph neural networks and language modeling. Building on the inherent connection between attention and graph theory, we reformulate the Transformer's attention mechanism as a graph operation and propose Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention. This method leverages advanced graph modeling strategies, including Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) and Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA), to enrich the representation of relational structures. Our approach captures complex dependencies and generalizes across tasks, as evidenced by a reduced generalization gap and improved learning performance. Additionally, we expand the concept of graph-aware attention to introduce Sparse GIN-Attention, a fine-tuning approach that employs sparse GINs. By interpreting attention matrices as sparse adjacency graphs, this technique enhances the adaptability of pre-trained foundational models with minimal computational overhead, endowing them with graph-aware capabilities. Sparse GIN-Attention fine-tuning achieves improved training dynamics and better generalization compared to alternative methods like low-rank adaption (LoRA). We discuss latent graph-like structures within traditional attention mechanisms, offering a new lens through which Transformers can be understood. By evolving Transformers as hierarchical GIN models for relational reasoning. This perspective suggests profound implications for foundational model development, enabling the design of architectures that dynamically adapt to both local and global dependencies. Applications in bioinformatics, materials science, language modeling, and beyond could benefit from this synthesis of relational and sequential data modeling, setting the stage for interpretable and generalizable modeling strategies.</description>

Abstract: It has been indicated that the path forward for the widespread usage of ferroelectric (FE) materials may be considerably facilitated through the reduction of programming voltages to on-chip logic compatible values of &lt; 1 V. Obstacles involve issues related to the scaling of the FEs to lower thickness as well as the presence of an interfacial layer (IL) between the high permittivity FE and the substrate -- resulting in wasted voltage across the IL. Here, we show how lower operating voltages along with a higher tunneling electroresistance (TER) could be achieved through IL engineering. We use piezoresponse force microscopy and fabricated ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) to show that ultra-thin FE films deposited on single layer graphene can exhibit polarization switching at ~ 0.8 V with significant TER.</description>

      <title>High-temperature field-free superconducting diode effect in high-Tc cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is defined by the difference in the magnitude of critical currents applied in opposite directions. It has been observed in various superconducting systems and attracted high research interests. However, the operating temperature of the SDE is typically low and/or the sample structure is rather complex. For the potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, efficient superconducting diodes working in zero magnetic field with high operating temperatures and a simple configuration are highly desired. Here, we report the observation of a SDE under zero magnetic field with operating temperatures up to 72 K and efficiency as high as 22% at 53 K in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) flake devices. The rectification effect persists beyond two hundred sweeping cycles, confirming the stability of the superconducting diode. Our results offer promising developments for potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, and provide insights into the mechanism of field-free SDE and symmetry breakings in high-Tc superconductors.</description>

      <title>Foam stabilization in salt solutions : the role of capillary drainage and Marangoni stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-standing question of why foaming is easier in seawater than in freshwater remains unresolved. In this study, we address this issue through precise interferometry single bubble experiments, demonstrating that the theory proposed by G. Marrucci (1969) provides a compelling explanation. Electrolyte solutions with varying concentrations of phosphate salts were used to study film formation and drainage, with thickness tracked by interferometry. In deionized water, bubbles rupture within seconds due to repaid dimple collapse. However, in phosphate salt solutions, bubbles persisted for several minutes. While surface tension gradients from evaporation-driven salt concentration gradients have been thought to create Marangoni stresses, our results show that despite film thinning being capillary-dominated, Marangoni-driven influx can be observed. Marrucci's theory explains this by showing that an increased interfacial area as the film thins, leads to higher salt concentration in the film due to Gibbs surface excess. This concentration gradient induces Marangoni stresses, causing flow reversal, increased film thickness, and enhanced foam stability. We show that Marrucci's theory has been incorrectly dismissed, and the predicted critical heights where fluid influx occurs closely match our findings and other studies using sodium chloride. Additionally, we extend the theory's applicability to foam films in non-aqueous film mixtures, highlighting its broader relevance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the Heisenberg-Kitaev honeycomb ferromagnets has recently drawn attention because of their rich topological properties. Topological phase transitions may arise when there exist two or more distinct topological phases, and they are often revealed by a gap-closing phenomenon. In this work, we investigate the magnonic properties of honeycomb ferromagnets exhibiting Kitaev and DMI interactions in the presence of a Heisenberg exchange and magnetocrystalline anisotropy exposed to a magnetic field. We employ the Self-Consistent Renormalization (SCR) spin wave theory to investigate the effects of magnon-magnon interactions (MMIs) and thermal fluctuations on the properties of magnons. Our findings demonstrate that the magnon system undergoes topological phase transitions driven by temperature and magnetic fields, which are attributed to MMIs. Specifically, as the temperature rises, the magnon band gap at the Dirac points closes and reopens at the critical temperature Tc , which is below the Curie temperature. By showing that the Chern numbers of the magnonic bands are distinct above and below Tc , we confirm that the gap-closing phenomenon is indeed a signature for the topological phase transitions. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the thermal Hall conductivity in the magnonic system exhibits a sign reversal at Tc , which can serve as an experimental probe of its topological nature.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we predict the emergence of a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) in conventional semiconductors, specifically InAs quantum wells, driven by a built-in polarization field. We propose QSHI InAs quantum wells as a platform to engineer topological field effect devices. More precisely, we first present a novel topological logic device that operates without a topological phase transition. Subsequently, we design a high-performance topological transistor due to the presence of edge states. Our approach provides a potential framework for harnessing the unique features of QSHI in device design, paving the way for future topological devices.</description>

We simulate exciton-polariton condensation using the finite-difference and 4th order Runge-Kutta methods with the strongly correlated polariton condition incorporated in the mean-field equations and analyze the polariton dynamics. This is done for coherent, near-resonant pumping as well as homogeneous, incoherent, non-resonant pumping. We find conditions akin to the polariton blockade in the dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Intrinsic magnetic topological insulators offers an ideal platform to explore exotic topological phenomena, such as axion electrodynamics, quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect and Majorana edge modes. However, these emerging new physical effects have rarely been experimentally observed due to the limited choice of suitable materials. Here, we predict the van der Waals layered V$_2$WS$_4$ and its related materials show intralayer ferromagnetic and interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange interactions. We find extremely rich magnetic topological states in V$_2$WS$_4$, including an antiferromagnetic topological insulator, the axion state with the long-sought quantized topological magnetoelectric effect, three-dimensional QAH state, as well as a collection of QAH insulators and intrinsic axion insulators in odd- and even-layer films, respectively. Remarkably, the N\'eel temperature of V$_2$WS$_4$ is predicted to be much higher than that of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. These interesting predictions, if realized experimentally, could greatly promote the topological quantum physics research and application.</description>

Abstract: Measurements of the Fermi surface are a fundamental technique for determining the electrical and magnetic properties of solids. In 2D systems, the area and diameter of the Fermi surface is typically measured using Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and commensurability oscillations respectively. However, these techniques are unable to detect changes in the parity of the Fermi surface (i.e. when +k $\neq$ -k). Here, we show that transverse magnetic focussing can be used to detect such changes, because focussing only measures a well defined section of the Fermi surface and does not average over +k and -k. Furthermore, our results show that focussing is an order of magnitude more sensitive to changes in the Fermi surface than other 2D techniques, and could be used to investigate similar Fermi surface changes in other 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Electrical Control of Exciton-Polariton Condensate Josephson Junctions via Exciton Stark Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose harnessing the tools of modern nano-fabrication to provide electrical control of exciton-polariton (EP) condensates. We develop the theory of a device based on the Josephson effect in which electric fields can be used to both switch between and monitor various dynamical modes. In particular, both the bias potential and the Josephson energy can be tuned electrically via the exciton component. We model the device by a Gross-Pitaevskii equation assuming that ideal EP condensates are established with well-balanced pumping and dissipation. We find that the EP condensates can be manipulated through degrees of freedom not easily accessible in other coherent quantum systems, and the dynamics of EP Josephson junctions are richer than that of the conventional superconducting junctions. The ability to control and monitor the condensate by both optical and electrical means allows new ways to study its physics not possible by either, alone.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Nonlinear Responses in Moving Charge Density Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The incommensurate charge density wave states (CDWs) can exhibit steady motion in the flow limit after depinning, behaving as a nonequilibrium system with time-dependent states. Since the moving CDW, like an electric current, breaks both time-reversal and inversion symmetries, one may speculate the emergence of nonreciprocal nonlinear responses from such motion. However, the moving CDW order parameter is intrinsically time-dependent in the lab frame, and it is known to be challenging to evaluate the responses of such a time-varying system. In this work, following the principle of Galilean relativity, we resolve this time-dependent hard problem in the lab frame by mapping the system to the comoving frame with static CDW states through the Galilean transformation. We explicitly show that the nonreciprocal nonlinear responses would be generated by the movement of CDW states through violating Galilean relativity.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Topology in Hermitian Topological Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity gives rise to distinctive topological phenomena absent in Hermitian systems. However, connection between such intrinsic non-Hermitian topology and Hermitian topology has remained largely elusive. Here, considering the bulk and boundary as an environment and system, respectively, we demonstrate that anomalous boundary states in Hermitian topological insulators exhibit non-Hermitian topology. We study the self-energy capturing the particle exchange between the bulk and boundary, and show that it detects Hermitian topology in the bulk and induces non-Hermitian topology at the boundary. As an illustrative example, we reveal non-Hermitian topology and concomitant skin effect inherently embedded within chiral edge states of Chern insulators. We also identify the emergence of hinge states within effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians at surfaces of three-dimensional topological insulators. Furthermore, we comprehensively classify our correspondence across all the tenfold symmetry classes of topological insulators and superconductors. Our work uncovers hidden connection between Hermitian and non-Hermitian topology, and provides an approach to identifying non-Hermitian topology in quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Domain-Wall Ferroelectric Polarons in a two-dimensional Rotor Lattice Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of ferroelectric domain-wall polarons in a minimal two-dimensional lattice model of electrons interacting with rotating dipoles. Along the domain-wall, the rotors polarize in opposite directions, causing the electron to localize along a particular lattice direction. The rotor-electron coupling is identified as the origin of a structural instability in the crystal that leads to the domain-wall formation via a symmetry-breaking process. Our results provide the first theoretical description of ferroelectric polarons, as discussed in the context of soft semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Transverse Spin current at the normal/p-wave magnet junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the transmission properties of a junction between a normal metal and a p-wave magnet in the ballistic regime. We introduce a two-dimensional square lattice that confirms the p-wave magnet criteria. The $\alpha$-vector of the magnet breaks the inversion symmetry of the parabolic dispersion, shifting them in $k$-space. These shifts alter the propagation direction of fermions passing through the junction interface. Depending on spin orientation, the transmission process exhibits anisotropic, angle-dependent behavior. We also demonstrate a mirror symmetry between fermions with opposite spin directions, leading to the emergence of a transverse spin current that flows parallel to the interface. Additionally, we show that the $\alpha$-vector acts as a source for the dynamics of the spin-density wave and observe the formation of an indirect gap in the conductance of the junction. Our findings highlight the unique transmission characteristics and spin transport phenomena in normal metal/p-wave magnet junctions, paving the way for potential applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Electronic interferometry with ultrashort plasmonic pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic flying qubits offer an interesting alternative to photonic qubits: electrons propagate slower, hence easier to control in real time, and Coulomb interaction enables direct entanglement between different qubits. Although their coherence time is limited, flying electrons in the form of picosecond plasmonic pulses could be competitive in terms of the number of achievable coherent operations. The key challenge in achieving this critical milestone is the development of a new technology capable of injecting 'on-demand' single-electron wavepackets into quantum devices, with temporal durations comparable to or shorter than the device dimensions. Here, we take a significant step towards achieving this regime in a quantum nanoelectronic system by injecting ultrashort single-electron plasmonic pulses into a 14-micrometer-long Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Our results establish that quantum coherence is robust under the on-demand injection of ultrashort plasmonic pulses, as evidenced by the observation of coherent oscillations in the single-electron regime. Building on this, our results demonstrate for the first time the existence of a new "non-adiabatic" regime that is prominent at high frequencies. This breakthrough highlights the potential of flying qubits as a promising alternative to localised qubit architectures, offering advantages such as a reduced hardware footprint, enhanced connectivity, and scalability for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced modification of polaritonic Rabi oscillations in the presence of the dark excitonic condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13882v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optically inactive (dark) intervalley momentum-forbidden excitons are characterized by relatively long life time, and therefore are desirable candidates for realizing collective excitonic phases. However, testing their coherence by light directly is impossible. Here we propose a method for detecting a dark excitonic condensate. It relies on the interaction between excitons and phonons responsible for the interconversion between bright and dark excitons. As long as the dark condensate forms, the Rabi oscillations between photons and bright excitons can become strongly modified, and can be viewed as the photon-exciton-phonon polaritonic effect. The multi-component nature of the dark condensate consistent with the point-group symmetry is taken into account in the limit of weak phonon-exciton interaction. A perspective for the case of the strong interaction leading to the polaronic effect is discussed.</description>

      <title>Unusually high-density 2D electron gases in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures with GaN/AlN superlattice back barriers grown on sapphire substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reported on the observation of extremely high-density ($&gt;10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$) 2D electron gas in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on sapphire substrates. Due to introducing the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier between the GaN buffer layer and AlGaN barrier layer, we observed a giant enhancement of the 2D electron gas density at the GaN/AlGaN interface from $3\times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ (without SL) to $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ (with SL back barrier) that is only one order of magnitude below the intrinsic crystal limit of $\approx10^{15}$cm$^{-2}$. We found that the changes of 2D electron gas density with SL correlated well with the changes of the wafer warp parameter which suggests that the strains are responsible for the 2D electron gas density enhancement (reduction of the piezoelectric polarization in the GaN channel). Nevertheless, this finding is probably insufficient to fully explain the observed high 2D electron gas density. Simultaneously, the room temperature electron mobility was 169 cm$^2$/Vs, which with the electron density of $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ gives a low sheet resistance of 264 $\Omega$/sq (one of the lowest reported so far for the N-polar 2D electron gas channel). Finally, the possibility of application of such high-density 2D electron gas with low sheet resistance to transistors, emitters and detectors was discussed.</description>

Abstract: A quantum kinetic theory of the linear response to an electric field is provided from a controlled expansion of the Keldysh theory at leading order, for a multiband electron system with weak scalar disorder. The response is uniquely partitioned into intraband distribution functions and interband quantum coherences. A new explicit formula is provided for the latter, outlining their true nature as local dependent quantities, for which the mesoscopic gradients of the former is uncovered as a source term, opening a new research area. The precise connection with the Kubo formula in the ladder approximation is established. A pedagogical application to spin-orbit torque theory in the two dimensional electron gas demonstrates the striking efficiency of the quantum kinetic approach. Some important implications for the theory of orbital transport are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Spin orbit torque-driven motion of quasi-Bloch domain wall in perpendicularly magnetized W/CoFeB/MgO structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of chiral magnetic domain walls (DWs) driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT) has been extensively studied in heavy metal/ferromagnet heterostructures with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. This study specifically focuses on SOT-driven DWs in near Bloch-states, which we refer to as ``quasi-Bloch DWs". These quasi-Bloch DWs exhibit slower motion compared to Neel-type DWs, offering potential for achieving highly controllable DW positions. Here, we investigate the characteristics of SOT-driven motion of quasi-Bloch DWs in perpendicularly magnetized ultra-thin films consisting of W/CoFeB/MgO. For analyzing the DW motion, we employ a one-dimensional model incorporating parameters derived from experimental data obtained from our samples. Our model successfully reproduces the experimental results, which reveal variations in the direction and threshold current density of DW motion among different samples. Through theoretical analysis, we unveil that the DW remains in quasi-Bloch states during motion, with SOT serving as the primary driving force rather than spin transfer torque (STT). The direction of motion is determined not only by the sign combination of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and spin Hall angle but also by the strength of DMI, STT, and extrinsic DW pinning. Furthermore, we provide analytical expressions for the threshold current density required for SOT-driven quasi-Bloch DW motion. These findings provide valuable insights for the design of future DW devices with specific film structures.</description>

      <title>Hyperballistic transport in dense systems of charged particles under ac electric fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Langevin equation is ubiquitously employed to numerically simulate plasmas, colloids and electrolytes. However, the usual assumption of white noise becomes untenable when the system is subject to an external AC electric field. This is because the charged particles in the system, which provide the thermal bath for the particle transport, become themselves responsive to the AC field and the thermal noise is field-dependent and non-Markovian. We theoretically study the particle diffusivity in a Langevin transport model for a tagged charged particle immersed in a dense system of charged particles (plus also, possibly, other neutral particles) that act as the thermal bath, under an external AC electric field. This is done by properly accounting for the effects of the AC field on the thermal bath statistics. We analytically derive the time-dependent generalized diffusivity $D(t)$ for different initial conditions. The generalized diffusivity exhibits damped oscillatory-like behaviour with initial very large peaks, where the generalized diffusion coefficient is enhanced by orders of magnitude with respect to the infinite-time steady-state value. The latter coincides with the Stokes-Einstein diffusivity in the absence of external field. For initial conditions where the external field is already on at $t=0$ and the system is thermalized under DC conditions for $t \leq 0$, the short-time behaviour is hyperballistic, $MSD \sim t^4$ (where MSD is the mean-squared displacement), leading to giant enhancement of the particle transport. Finally, the theory elucidates the role of medium polarization on the local Lorentz field, and allows for estimates of the effective electric charge due to polarization by the surrounding charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral edges of 2+1D systems can have very robust emergent conformal symmetry. When the edge is purely chiral, the Hilbert space of low-energy edge excitations can form a representation of a single Virasoro algebra. We propose a method to systematically extract the generators of the Virasoro algebra from a single ground state wavefunction, using entanglement bootstrap and an input from the edge conformal field theory. We corroborate our construction by numerically verifying the commutation relations of the generators. We also study the unitary flows generated by these operators, whose properties (such as energy and state overlap) are shown numerically to agree with our analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Massive Higher-Spin Fields in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incompressibility plays a key role in the geometric description of fractional quantum Hall fluids. It is naturally related to quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms and the underlying Girvin-MacDonald-Plazman algebra, which gives rise to an emergent non-relativistic massive spin-2 mode propagating in the bulk. The corresponding metric tensor can be identified with a nematic order parameter for the bulk states. In the linearised regime with a flat background, it has been shown that this mode can be described by a spin-2 Schroedinger action. However, quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms also suggest the existence of higher-spin modes that cannot be described through nematic fractional quantum Hall states. Here, we consider p-atic Hall phases, in which the corresponding p-atic order parameters are related to higher-rank symmetric tensors. We then show that in this framework, non-relativistic massive chiral higher-spin fields naturally emerge and that their dynamics is described by higher-spin Schroedinger actions. We finally show that these effective actions can be derived from relativistic massive higher-spin theories in 2+1 dimensions after taking a non-relativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Enhancing nanoscale charged colloid crystallization near a metastable liquid binodal</title>

Abstract: Bottom-up assembly of nanocrystals (NCs) into ordered arrays, or superlattices (SLs), is a promising route to design materials with new functionalities, but the degree of control over assembly into functional structures remains challenging. Using electrostatics, rather than density, to tune the interactions between semiconductor NCs, we watch self-assembly proceeding through a metastable liquid phase. We systematically investigate the phase behavior as a function of quench conditions in situ and in real time using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Through quantitative fitting to colloid, liquid, and SL models, we extract the time evolution of each phase and the system phase diagram, which we find to be consistent with short-range attractive interactions. Using the phase diagram's predictive power, we establish control of the self-assembly rate over three orders of magnitude, and identify one- and two-step self-assembly regimes, with only the latter implicating the metastable liquid as an intermediate. Importantly, the presence of the metastable liquid increases SL formation rates relative to the equivalent one-step pathway, and SL order counterintuitively increases with the rate, revealing a highly desirable and generalizable kinetic strategy to promote and enhance ordered assembly.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise induced nonreciprocity for single photon transport in parity-time symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show nonreciprocal light propagation for single-photon inputs due to quantum noise in coupled optical systems with gain and loss. We consider two parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric linear optical systems consisting of either two directly coupled resonators or two finite-length waveguides evanescently coupled in parallel. One resonator or waveguide is filled with an active gain medium and the other with a passive loss medium. The light propagation is reciprocal in such $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric linear systems without quantum noise. We show here that light transmission becomes nonreciprocal when we include quantum noises in our modeling, which is essential for a proper physical description. The quantum nonreciprocity is especially pronounced in the $\mathcal{PT}$ broken phase. Transmitted light intensity in the waveguide of incidence is asymmetric for two waveguides even without noise. Quantum noise significantly enhances such asymmetry in the broken phase.</description>

      <title>Exact projected entangled pair ground states with topological Euler invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a class of gapped projected entangled pair states (PEPS) with non-trivial Euler topology motivated by recent progress in band geometry. In the non-interacting limit, these systems have optimal conditions relating to saturation of quantum geometrical bounds, allowing for parent Hamiltonians whose lowest bands are completely flat and which have the PEPS as unique ground states. Protected by crystalline symmetries, these states evade restrictions on capturing tenfold-way topological features with gapped PEPS. These PEPS thus form the first tensor network representative of a non-interacting, gapped two-dimensional topological phase, similar to the Kitaev chain in one dimension. Using unitary circuits, we then formulate interacting variants of these PEPS and corresponding gapped parent Hamiltonians. We reveal characteristic entanglement features shared between the free-fermionic and interacting states with Euler topology. Our results hence provide a rich platform of PEPS models that have, unexpectedly, a finite topological invariant, forming the basis for new spin liquids, quantum Hall physics, and quantum information pursuits.</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithms for surface density of states in topological photonic and acoustic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological photonics and acoustics have recently garnered wide research interests for their topological ability to manipulate the light and sound at surfaces. Conventionally, the supercell technique is the standard approach to calculating these boundary effects, whereas it consumes increasingly large computational resources as the supercell size grows. Additionally, it falls short in differentiating the surface states at opposite boundaries and from bulk states due to the finite size of systems. To overcome the limitations, here we provide two complementary efficient methods for obtaining the ideal topological surface states of a semi-infinite system. The first one is the cyclic reduction method, which is based on iteratively inverting the Hamiltonian for a single unit cell, and the other is the transfer matrix method, which relies on the eigenanalysis of a transfer matrix for a pair of unit cells. Benchmarks show that, compared to the traditional supercell method, the cyclic reduction method can reduce both memory and time consumption by two orders of magnitude; the transfer matrix method can reduce memory by an order of magnitude, take less than half the time, and achieve high accuracy. Our methods are applicable to more complex scenarios, such as coated structures, heterostructures, and sandwiched structures. As examples, the surface-density-of-states spectra of photonic Chern insulators, valley photonic crystals, and acoustic topological insulators are demonstrated. Our computational schemes enable direct comparisons with near-field scanning measurements and expedite the exploration of topological artificial materials and the design of topological devices.</description>

      <title>Fractional Quantum Hall Effect Based on Weyl Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect is a well-known demonstration of strongly correlated topological phases in two dimensions. However, the extension of this phenomenon into a three-dimensional context has yet to be achieved. Recently, the three-dimensional integer quantum Hall effect based on Weyl orbits has been experimentally observed in a topological semimetallic material under a magnetic field. This motivates us to ask whether the Weyl orbits can give rise to the fractional quantum Hall effect when their Landau level is partially filled in the presence of interactions. Here we theoretically demonstrate that the fractional quantum Hall states based on Weyl orbits can emerge in a Weyl semimetal when a Landau level is one-third filled. Using concrete models for Weyl semimetals in magnetic fields, we project the Coulomb interaction onto a single Landau level from the Weyl orbit and find that the ground state of the many-body Hamiltoian is triply degenerate. We further show that the ground states exhibit the many-body Chern number of $1/3$ and the uniform occupation of electrons in both momentum and real space, implying that they are the fractional quantum Hall states. In contrast to the two-dimensional case, the states are spatially localized on two surfaces hosting Fermi arcs. Additionally, our findings suggest that the excitation properties of these states resemble those of the Laughlin state in two dimensions, as inferred from the particle entanglement spectrum of the ground states.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity in a spin-orbit coupled Kondo lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the effect of spin-orbit coupling on a two-dimensional Kondo Lattice model, in which conduction electrons are antiferromagnetically coupled to a Yao-Lee spin liquid. When a Rashba spin-orbit interaction and a nearest-neighbor Kondo interaction is introduced, the low-energy Majorana bands become gapped and develop Chern numbers, protecting unidirectionally propagating Majorana edge modes. Our model describes a chiral topological superconductor with fractionalized charge-$e$ order parameter and spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry, which may be of interest for certain heavy fermion superconductors, such as UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Designing Majorana Quasiparticles in InAsP Quantum Dots in InP Nanowires with Variational Quantum Eigenvalue Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents steps toward the design of Majorana zero modes (MZM) in InAsP quantum dots (QD) embedded in an InP semiconducting nanowire in contact with a p-type superconductor described by the Kitaev Hamiltonian. The single particle spectrum is obtained from million atom atomistic calculations with QNANO and many-electron spectra using exact diagonalization (ED) and the hybrid Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) method. A variational ansatz is constructed to capture the ground state of the system by utilizing a generalized form of the analytical solution for a particular set of parameters. By systematically deviating from the analytically solvable regime while maintaining the system in the topological phase (TP), the effectiveness of the variational function in reproducing the correct ground state and topological properties of the system is evaluated. This is done through a quantum algorithm for a many-body state containing MZM. The results are compared with exact solution in topological phase and demonstrate the capability of VQE, along with classical simulations, to accurately model the many-body spectra in topologically nontrivial state.</description>

      <title>Large tunable Josephson diode effect in a side-contacted topological-insulator-nanowire junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Josephson diode passes current with zero resistance in one direction but is resistive in the other direction. While such an effect has been observed in several platforms, a large and tunable Josephson diode effect has been rare. Here we report that a simple device consisting of a topological-insulator (TI) nanowire side-contacted by superconductors to form a lateral Josephson junction presents a large diode effect with the efficiency $\eta$ reaching 0.3 when a parallel magnetic field $B_{||}$ is applied. Interestingly, the sign and the magnitude of $\eta$ is found to be tunable not only by $B_{||}$ but also by the back-gate voltage. This novel diode effect can be understood by modeling the system as a nano-SQUID, in which the top and bottom surfaces of the TI nanowire each form a line junction and $B_{||}$ creates a magnetic flux to thread the SQUID loop. This model further shows that the observed diode effect is accompanied by the emergence of topological superconductivity in TI-nanowire-based Josephson junction.</description>
