      <title>Geometric families of degenerations from mutations of polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a polyptych lattice, which encodes a collection of lattices related by piecewise linear bijections. We initiate a study of the new theory of convex geometry and polytopes associated to polyptych lattices. In certain situations, such a polytope associated to a polyptych lattice encodes a compactification of an affine variety whose coordinate ring can be equipped with a valuation into a certain semialgebra associated to the polyptych lattice. We show that aspects of the geometry of the compactification can be understood combinatorially; for instance, under some hypotheses, the resulting compactifications are arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay, and have finitely generated class group and finitely generated Cox rings.</description>

      <title>Gorenstein-Fano polytopes and compactifications of rank 2 polyptych lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of polyptych lattices, introduced by Escobar, Harada, and Manon, wraps the data of a collection of lattices related by piecewise-linear bijections together into a single semi-algebraic object, equipped with its own notions of convexity and polyhedra. The main purpose of this manuscript is to construct an explicit family of polyptych lattices, and to illustrate via explicit computations the abstract theory introduced by Escobar-Harada-Manon. Specifically, we first construct a family of rank-$2$ polyptych lattices $\mathcal{M}_s$ with $2$ charts, compute their space of points, and prove that they are full and self-dual. We then give a concrete sample computation of a point-convex hull in $\mathcal{M}_s \otimes \mathbb{R}$ to illustrate that convex geometry in the polyptych lattice setting can exhibit phenomena not seen in the classical situation. We also give multiple examples of $2$-dimensional ``chart-Gorenstein-Fano'' polytopes, which give rise to pairs of mutation-related $2$-dimensional (classical) Gorenstein-Fano polytopes. Finally, we produce detropicalizations $(\mathcal{A}_s, \mathfrak{v}_s)$ of $\mathcal{M}_s$, and in the case $s=1$ where the detropicalization is a UFD, and with respect to a certain choice of PL polytope $\mathcal{P}$, we give an explicit generators-and-relations presentation of the (finitely generated) Cox ring of the compactification $X_{\mathcal{A}_s}(\mathcal{P})$ of $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathcal{A}_s)$ with respect to $\mathcal{P}$.</description>

      <title>Limiting mixed Hodge structures associated to I-surfaces with simple elliptic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An I-surface $X$ is a surface of general type with $K_X^2 =1$ and $p_g(X) =2$. This paper studies the asymptotic behavior of the period map for I-surfaces acquiring simple elliptic singularities. First we describe the relationship between the deformation theory of such surfaces and their $d$-semistable models. Next we analyze the mixed Hodge structures on the $d$-semistable models, the corresponding limiting mixed Hodge structures, and the monodromy. There are $6$ possible boundary strata for which the relevant limiting mixed Hodge structures satisfy: $\dim W_1 = 4$, and hence $W_2/W_1$ is of pure type $(1,1)$. We show that, in each case, the nilpotent orbit of limiting mixed Hodge structures determines the boundary stratum and prove a global Torelli theorem for one such stratum.</description>

      <title>Birational geometry of critical loci in Algebraic Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Algebraic Vision, the projective reconstruction of the position of each camera and scene point from the knowledge of many enough corresponding points in the views is called the structure from motion problem. It is known that the reconstruction is ambiguous if the scene points are contained in particular algebraic varieties, called critical loci. To be more precise, from the definition of criticality, for the same reconstruction problem, two critical loci arise in a natural way. In the present paper, we investigate the relations between these two critical loci, and we prove that, under some mild smoothness hypotheses, (some of) their irreducible components are birational. To this end, we introduce a unified critical locus that restores the symmetry between the two critical loci, and a natural commutative diagram relating the unified critical locus and the two single critical loci. For technical reasons, but of interest in its own, we also consider how a critical locus change when one increases the number of views.</description>

      <title>Quasi-BPS categories for Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce quasi-BPS categories for twisted Higgs bundles, which are building blocks of the derived category of coherent sheaves on the moduli stack of semistable twisted Higgs bundles over a smooth projective curve. Under some condition (called BPS condition), the quasi-BPS categories are non-commutative analogues of Hitchin integrable systems.
  We begin the study of these quasi-BPS categories by focusing on a conjectural symmetry which swaps the Euler characteristic and the weight. Our conjecture is inspired by the Dolbeault Geometric Langlands equivalence of Donagi--Pantev, by the Hausel--Thaddeus mirror symmetry, and by the $\chi$-independence phenomenon for BPS invariants of curves on Calabi-Yau threefolds.
  We prove our conjecture in the case of rank two and genus zero. In higher genus, we prove a derived equivalence of rank two stable twisted Higgs moduli spaces as a special case of our conjecture.
  In a separate paper, we prove a version of our conjecture for the topological K-theory of quasi-BPS categories and we discuss the relation between quasi-BPS categories and BPS invariants of the corresponding local Calabi-Yau threefold.</description>

      <title>The Automorphism groups of zero-dimensional monomial algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A monomial algebra B is defined as a quotient of a polynomial ring by a monomial ideal, which is an ideal generated by a finite set of monomials. In this paper, we determine the automorphism group of a monomial algebra B, under the assumption that B is a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic zero. We achieve this by providing an explicit classification of the homogeneous locally nilpotent derivations of B. The main body of the paper addresses the more general case of semigroup algebras, with the polynomial ring being a particular case.</description>

      <title>On exponentiality of automorphisms of ${\bf A}^n$ of order $p$ in characteristic $p&gt;0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an integral affine scheme of characteristic $p&gt;0$, and $\sigma $ a non-identity automorphism of $X$. If $\sigma $ is $\textit{exponential}$, i.e., induced from a ${\bf G}_a$-action on $X$, then $\sigma $ is obviously of order $p$. It is easy to see that the converse is not true in general. In fact, there exists $X$ which admits an automorphism of order $p$, but admits no non-trivial ${\bf G}_a$-actions. However, the situation is not clear in the case where $X$ is the affine space ${\bf A}_R^n$, because ${\bf A}_R^n$ admits various ${\bf G}_a$-actions as well as automorphisms of order $p$.
  In this paper, we study exponentiality of automorphisms of ${\bf A}_R^n$ of order $p$, where the difficulty stems from the non-uniqueness of ${\bf G}_a$-actions inducing an exponential automorphism. Our main results are as follows.
  (1) We show that the triangular automorphisms of ${\bf A}_R^n$ of order $p$ are exponential in some low-dimensional cases.
  (2) We construct a non-exponential automorphism of ${\bf A}_R^n$ of order $p$ for each $n\ge 2$. Here, $R$ is any UFD which is not a field.
  (3) We investigate the ${\bf G}_a$-actions inducing an elementary automorphism of ${\bf A}_R^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Krull dimensions of semirings and semifields dealt in tropical geometry. We prove that for a congruence $C$ on a tropical Laurent polynomial semiring $\boldsymbol{T}[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_n^{\pm}]$ including a finite subset whose congruence variety is equal to the congruence variety $\boldsymbol{V}(C)$ associated with $C$, the Krull dimension of the quotient semiring $\boldsymbol{T}[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_n^{\pm}] / C$ coincides with the dimension of $\boldsymbol{V}(C)$ as a polyhedral complex plus one when $\boldsymbol{V}(C)$ is nonempty. With this fact, we also show that rational function semifields of tropical curves which do not consist of only one point have Krull dimension two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each punctured curve over a finite field, we construct local systems which do not come from a family of abelian varieties. We do so by proving a criterion which must be satisfied by local systems which do come from abelian varieties, inspired by an analogous Hodge theoretic criterion in characteristic zero. Our tools include $F$-isocrystals and some $p$-adic Hodge theory.</description>

      <title>Abelian surfaces over finite fields containing no curves of genus $3$ or less</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise abelian surfaces defined over finite fields containing no curves of genus less than or equal to $3$. Firstly, we complete and expand the characterisation of isogeny classes of abelian surfaces with no curves of genus up to $2$ initiated by the first author et al. in previous work. Secondly, we show that, for simple abelian surfaces, containing a curve of genus $3$ is equivalent to admitting a polarisation of degree $4$. Thanks to this result, we can use existing algorithms to check which isomorphism classes in the isogeny classes containing no genus $2$ curves have a polarisation of degree $4$. Thirdly, we characterise isogeny classes of abelian surfaces with no curves of genus $\leq 2$, containing no abelian surface with a polarisation of degree $4$. Finally, we describe absolutely irreducible genus $3$ curves lying on abelian surfaces containing no curves of genus less than or equal to $2$, and show that their number of rational points is far from the Serre--Weil bound.</description>

      <title>Tame motivic cohomology and a conjecture of H\"ubner--Schmidt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a comparison functor between ($\mathbf{A}^1$-local) tame motives and ($\overline{\square}$-local) log-\'etale motives over a field $k$ of positive characteristic. This generalizes Binda--Park--{\O}stv{\ae}r's comparison for the Nisnevich topology. As a consequence, we construct an $E_\infty$-ring spectrum $H\mathbb{Z}/p^m$ representing mod $p^m$ tame motivic cohomology: the existence of this ring spectrum and the usual properties of motives imply some results on tame motivic cohomology, which were conjectured by H\"ubner--Schmidt.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a one-to-one correspondence between the singularity categories of rational double points and the simply-laced Dynkin graphs in arbitrary characteristic. This correspondence is well-known in characteristic zero since the rational double points are quotient singularities in characteristic zero whereas not necessarily in positive characteristic. Considering some rational double points are not taut in characteristic less than seven, we can see there exist two rational double points which are not analytically isomorphic but whose singularity categories are triangulated equivalent. As an application, we construct a counter-example in positive characteristic of a theorem of Hua and Keller: the dg singularity category of a hypersurface singularity determines its Tyurina algebra.</description>

      <title>The Cartier operator on differentials of discretely ringed adic spaces and Purity in the tame cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a regular scheme over $\textrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z}[1/p])$ where $p$ is prime. Let $i:Y\to X$ be a closed subscheme of pure codimension $r$. Let $n$ be a natural number prime to $p$. Let $\Lambda$ be a finite $\mathbb{Z}/n$-module over $X$. In this case, the absolute purity conjectured by Grothendieck and proved by Gabber states that \[
  Ri^! \Lambda\cong \Lambda_Y(-r)[-2r]\in D_{\textrm{\'et}}(Y,\Lambda) \] For the $n=p^m$-case, a dualizing sheaf was proposed by Milne \cite{MilneValuesOfZeta}, namely the logarithmic de Rham-Witt sheaves $\nu_m(r)$. But this doesn't work for all degrees for the \'etale cohomology. It is however conjectured that this works for the tame cohomology. In this paper we make this work following the proof of Milne in loc. cit. by replacing \'etale by tame cohomology and assuming resolution of singularities in positive characteristic. We obtain the following isomorphism \[ Ri^! \nu_m(n)\cong \nu_m(n-r)[-r]. \]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the canonical Hodge filtration on the sheaf $\mathscr{O}_X(*D)$ of meromorphic functions along a divisor. For a germ of an analytic function $f$ whose Bernstein-Sato's polynomial's roots are contained in $(-2,0)$, we: give a simple algebraic formula for the zeroeth piece of the Hodge filtration; bound the first step of the Hodge filtration containing $f^{-1}$. If we additionally require $f$ to be Euler homogeneous and parametrically prime, then we extend our algebraic formula to compute every piece of the canonical Hodge filtration, proving in turn that the Hodge filtration is contained in the induced order filtration. Finally, we compute the Hodge filtration in many examples and identify several large classes of divisors realizing our theorems.</description>

Abstract: We study the motivic Pandharipande-Thomas invariants of the Enriques Calabi-Yau threefolds in fiber curve classes by basic computations and analysis of a wallcrossing formula of Toda. Motivated by our results we conjecture a formula for the perverse Hodge numbers of the compactified Jacobian fibration of linar systems on Enriques surfaces in terms of its Betti numbers. This leads to an asymptotic for said Hodge numbers and raises questions about the behaviour of the extremal Hodge numbers.</description>

This talk will display some selected works of the art of Ian Macdonald, representative of different periods of his oeuvre, and analyze how they resonate, both for the past development of our subject and for its future.
  This paper was prepared for the occasion of a lecture in tribute to Ian G. Macdonald, delivered at FPSAC 2024 in Bochum, Germany on 22 July 2024. I want to express thanks to the Executive Committee of FPSAC, the Organizing Committee of FPSAC 2024, and to the whole of our FPSAC 2024 community for making this lecture a possibility and for considering me for its delivery. Macdonald is my hero, and to be asked to play such a role in his legacy touches me deeply.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of integral points, equivariant compactifications and equidistributions for homogeneous spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let U be a homogeneous variety over rational numbers of some linear algebraic group. Fix an integral model and assume the existence of infinitely many integral points. Then one would like to give an asymptotic count with the help of some height function. In many cases, with the help of measure rigidity of unipotent flows, we reduce this problem to one on equivariant birational geometry. For instance, we show that if G and H are both connected, semisimple, simply connected and without compact factors, then U=G/H is strongly Hardy-Littlewood with respect to certain height function. We also show that when H is "large" in H and both G and H are connected, reductive and without non-trivial Q-characters, then for every equivariant height, the asymptotic of integral points is the same as the volume asymptotic up to a constant. Three concrete examples with explicit heights are also provided to illustrate our approach.</description>

Abstract: We study the theta nonnegative part of Lagrangian Grassmannian. We show that it admits an orbital decomposition and is homeomorphic to a closed ball. We compare it with other positive structures. We show that it contains several totally nonnegative parts of Lagrangian Grassmannian subject to certain choices of pinnings and agrees with the nonnegativity of the generalized Pl\"ucker coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the theory of $x-y$ duality to propose a new definition / construction for the correlation differentials of topological recursion; we call it "generalized topological recursion". This new definition coincides with the original topological recursion of Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin in the regular case and allows, in particular, to get meaningful answers in a variety of irregular and degenerate situations.</description>

      <title>CoHA of Cyclic Quivers and an Integral Form of Affine Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the deformed and non-deformed cohomological Hall algebra (CoHA) of the preprojective algebra for the case of cyclic quivers by studying the Kontsevich-Soibelman CoHA and using tools from cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory. We show that for the cyclic quiver of length $K$, this algebra is the universal enveloping algebra of the positive half of a certain extension of matrix differential operators on $\mathbb{C}^{*}$, while its deformation gives a positive half of an explicit integral form of Guay's Affine Yangian $\ddot{\mathcal{Y}}_{\hbar_1,\hbar_2}(\mathfrak{gl}(K))$. By the main theorem of Botta-Davison (2023) and Schiffmann-Vasserot (2023), this also determines the positive half of the Maulik-Okounkov Yangian for the case of cyclic quivers. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the strong rationality conjecture, calculate the spherical subalgebra of the non-deformed CoHA for any quiver without loops, recover results about the CoHA of compactly supported semistable sheaves on the minimal resolution of the Kleinian singularity $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{K}$ and identify a commutative algebra inside the additive shuffle algebra associated to the cyclic quiver. We end by conjecturally relating the obtained integral form with the algebra defined by Gaiotto-Rap\v{c}\'ak-Zhou, in the context of twisted M-theory.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Stability for Skew Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we study algebraic stability for rational skew products in two dimensions $\phi : X \dashrightarrow X$, i.e. maps of the form $\phi(x, y) = (\phi_1(x), \phi_2(x, y))$. We prove that when $X$ is a birationally ruled surface and $\phi_1$ has no superattracting cycles, then we can always find a smooth surface $\hat X$ and an algebraic stabilisation $\pi : (\hat \phi, \hat X) \to (\phi, X)$ which is a birational morphism. We provide an example of a skew product $\phi$ where $\phi_1$ has a superattracting fixed point and $\phi$ is not algebraically stable on any model.
  Our techniques involve transforming the stabilisation issue into a combinatorial dynamical problem for a 'non-Archimedean skew product' $\phi_*: \mathbb P^1_{\text{an}}(\mathbb K) \to \mathbb P^1_{\text{an}}(\mathbb K)$ on the Berkovich projective line over the Puiseux series, $\mathbb K$. The Fatou-Julia theory for $\phi_*$ is instrumental to our approach.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a reductive complex algebraic group. We fix a pair of opposite Borel subgroups and consider the corresponding semiinfinite orbits in the affine Grassmannian $Gr_G$. We prove Simon Schieder's conjecture identifying his bialgebra formed by the top compactly supported cohomology of the intersections of opposite semiinfinite orbits with $U(\check{\mathfrak n})$ (the universal enveloping algebra of the positive nilpotent subalgebra of the Langlands dual Lie algebra $\check{\mathfrak g}$). To this end we construct an action of Schieder bialgebra on the geometric Satake fiber functor. We propose a conjectural construction of Schieder bialgebra for an arbitrary symmetric Kac-Moody Lie algebra in terms of Coulomb branch of the corresponding quiver gauge theory.</description>

Abstract: Let $\frakX$ be a smooth $p$-adic formal scheme over $\calO_K$ with adic generic fiber $X$. We obtain a global equivalence between the category $\Vect((\frakX)_{\Prism},\overline\calO_{\Prism}[\frac{1}{p}])$ of rational Hodge--Tate crystals on the absolute prismatic site $(\frakX)_{\Prism}$ and the category $\HIG^{\nil}_*(X)$ of enhanced Higgs bundles on $X$. Along the way, we construct an inverse Simpson functor from $\HIG^{\nil}_*(X)$ to the category $\Vect(X_{\proet},\widehat\calO_X)$ of generalised representations on $X$, which turns out to be fully faithful.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our study of degenerations of Grassmannians in our last paper, called linked Grassmannians, constructed using convex lattice configurations in Bruhat-Tits buildings. We describe the geometry and topology of linked Grassmannians associated to a larger class of lattice configurations, generalizing the results in the last paper. In doing so, we utilize results on the geometry of quiver Grassmannians and affine Schubert varieties, and make comparison to the study of certain local models of Shimura varieties.</description>

Abstract: The cross-ratio degree problem counts configurations of n points on P^1 with n-3 prescribed cross-ratios. Cross-ratio degrees arise in many corners of combinatorics and geometry, but their structure is not well-understood in general. Interestingly, examining various special cases of the problem can yield combinatorial structures that are both diverse and rich. In this paper we prove a simple closed formula for a class of cross-ratio degrees indexed by triangulations of an n-gon; these degrees are connected to the geometry of the real locus of M_{0,n}, and to positive geometry.</description>

      <title>On the classification of fine compactified Jacobians of nodal curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20317v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of fine compactified Jacobians for nodal curves, that we call fine compactified Jacobians of vine type, or simply fine V-compactified Jacobians. This class is strictly larger than the class of fine classical compactified Jacobians, as constructed by Oda-Seshadri, Simpson, Caporaso and Esteves. Inspired by a recent preprint of Pagani-Tommasi, we characterize fine V-compactified Jacobians as the fine compactified Jacobians that can arise as limits of Jacobians of smooth curves under a one-parameter smoothing of the nodal curve or in its semiuniversal deformation space. Furthermore, fine V-compactified Jacobians are exactly the ones that gives a compactification of the N\'eron model of the Jacobian of the generic fiber of a one-parameter regular smoothing of the nodal curve. Finally, we give a combinatorial characterization of fine V-compactified Jacobians in terms of their poset of orbits for the action of the generalized Jacobian.</description>

Abstract: In recent decades, linear affine threefolds have enabled researchers to solve some of the challenging problems on affine spaces. Koras-Russell threefolds, especially the Russell Cubic over $\mathbb{C}$ and Asanuma threefolds over a field of positive characteristic, are striking examples of such linear threefolds.In this paper, we apply tools from $K$-theory and theory of $\mathbb{G}_a$-actions to linear threefolds of the form $G:=a(X)Y-F(X,Z,T)\in k[X,Y,Z,T]$, over an arbitrary field $k$. We give some equivalent conditions for $G$ to be a hyperplane (i.e., $k[X,Y,Z,T]/(G)=k^{[3]}$) in the following cases: (i) $k$ is a field of characteristic zero (ii) $k$ is an arbitrary field and $a(X)$ has only multiple roots. We also establish the Abhyankar-Sathaye Conjecture affirmatively in these cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and enumerate all crepant resolutions of hyperpolygon spaces, a family of conical symplectic singularities arising as Nakajima quiver varieties associated to a star-shaped quiver. We provide an explicit presentation of the Cox ring of any such crepant resolution. Using techniques developed by Arzhantsev-Derenthal-Hausen-Laface we construct all crepant resolutions of the hyperpolygon spaces, including those which are not projective over the singularity. We find that the number of crepant resolutions equals the Ho\c{s}ten-Morris numbers. In proving these results, we obtain a description of all complete geometric quotients associated to the classical GIT problem constructing moduli spaces of ordered points on the projective line. These moduli spaces appear as the Lagrangian subvarieties of crepant resolutions of hyperpolygon spaces fixed under the conical action.</description>

      <title>Explicit formulas for the Grothendieck class of $\overline{\mathcal M}_{0,n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain explicit expressions for the class in the Grothendieck group of varieties of the moduli space of genus 0 stable curves with n marked points. This information is equivalent to the Poincar\'e polynomial; it implies explicit expressions for the Betti numbers of the moduli space in terms of Stirling numbers or, alternatively, Bernoulli numbers.
  The expressions are obtained by solving a differential equation characterizing the generating function for the Grothendieck class as shown in work of Yuri Manin from the 1990s. This differential equation is equivalent to S. Keel's recursion for the Betti numbers of these moduli spaces. Our proof reduces the solution to two combinatorial identities which follow from applications of Lagrange series.
  We also study generating functions for the individual Betti numbers. In previous work it had been shown that these functions are determined by a set of polynomials with positive rational coefficients, which are conjecturally log-concave. We verify this conjecture for many infinite families of these polynomials, corresponding to the generating functions for the $2k$-Betti numbers of the moduli spaces for all $k\le 100$. Further, studying these polynomials allows us to prove that the generating function for the Grothendieck class of the moduli spaces may be written as a series of rational functions in the Lefschetz motive and the principal branch of the Lambert W-function.
  We include an interpretation of the main result in terms of Stirling matrices and a discussion of the Euler characteristic of the moduli space.</description>

Abstract: We show that Hermitian metrics with vanishing holomorphic curvature on compact complex manifolds with pseudoeffective canonical bundle are conformally balanced. Pluriclosed metrics with vanishing holomorphic curvature on compact K\"ahler manifolds are shown to be K\"ahler and hence, are completely classified. We prove that Hermitian metrics with vanishing real bisectional curvature on complex manifolds in the Fujiki class C are K\"ahler and thus fall under the same classification. Finally, we formalize the notion of `altered' curvatures, which force distinguished metric structures when mandated to coincide with their `standard' counterparts.</description>

Abstract: We describe the Witt invariants of a Weyl group over a field $k_0$ by giving generators for the $W(k_0)$-module of Witt invariants, under the assumption that the characteristic of $k_0$ does not divide the order of the group. For the Weyl groups of types $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$, and $G_2$, we show that the Witt invariants are generated as a $W(k_0)$-algebra by trace forms and their exterior powers, extending a result due to Serre in type $A_n$. Many of our computational methods are applicable to computing Witt invariants of any smooth linear algebraic group over $k_0$, including a technique for lifting module generators from cohomological invariants to Witt invariants.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new class of matroids, called graph curve matroids. A graph curve matroid is associated to a graph and defined on the vertices of the graph as a ground set. We prove that these matroids provide a combinatorial description of hyperplane sections of degenerate canonical curves in algebraic geometry. Our focus lies on graphs that are 2-connected and trivalent, which define identically self-dual graph curve matroids, but we also develop generalizations. Finally, we provide an algorithm to compute the graph curve matroid associated to a given graph, as well as an implementation and data of examples that can be used in Macaulay2.</description>

      <title>Odd and Even Elliptic Curves with Complex Multiplication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07240v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We call an order $O$ in a quadratic field $K$ odd (resp. even) if its discriminant is an odd (resp. even) integer. We call an elliptic curve $E$ over the field $C$ of complex numbers with CM odd (resp. even) if its endomorphism ring $End(E)$ is an odd (resp. even) order in the corresponding imaginary quadratic field.
  Suppose that $j(E)$ is a real number and let us consider the set $J(R,E)$ of all $j(E')$ where $E'$ is any elliptic curve that enjoys the following properties.
  1) $E'$ is isogenous to $E$;
  2) $j(E')$ is a real number;
  3) $E'$ has the same parity as $E$.
  We prove that the closure of $J(R,E)$ in the set $R$ of real numbers is the closed semi-infinite interval $(-\infty,1728]$ (resp. the whole $R$) if $E$ is odd (resp. even).
  This paper was inspired by a question of Jean-Louis Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Alena Pirutka about the distribution of $j$-invariants of certain elliptic curves of CM type.</description>

      <title>A generalized Saito freeness criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish generalizations of Saito's criterion for the freeness of divisors in projective spaces that apply both to sequences of several homogeneous polynomials and to divisors on other complete varieties. As an application, the new criterion is applied to several examples, including sequences whose polynomials depend on disjoint sets of variables, some sequences that are equivariant for the action of a linear group, blow-ups of divisors, and certain sequences of polynomials in positive characteristics.</description>

      <title>Higher order obstructions to Riccati-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop new techniques in order to deal with Riccati-type equations, subject to a further algebraic constraint, on Riemannian manifolds $(M^3,g)$. We find that the obstruction to solve the aforementioned equation has order $4$ in the metric coefficients and is fully described by an homogeneous polynomial in $\mathrm{Sym}^{16}TM$. Techniques from real algebraic geometry, reminiscent of those used for the "PositiveStellen-Satz " problem, allow determining the geometry in terms of explicit exterior differential systems. Analysis of the latter shows flatness for the metric $g$; in particular we complete the classification of asymptotically harmonic manifolds of dimension $3$, establishing those are either flat or real hyperbolic spaces.</description>
