      <title>Exhibition of piecewise syndetic and broken IP sets near idempotent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of ultrafilters belong to the smallest ideal of Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of a discrete semigroup are exhibited using syndetic sets, strongly central sets and very strongly central sets respectively. These lead to represent piecewise syndetics sets of a semigroup in terms of the sets that contain a broken $\mathcal{A}$ set, where $\mathcal{A}\in\{$ syndetic, quasi-central, central, strongly central, very strongly central$\}$. Also, a characterization of broken IP$^{n}$ sets using ultrafilters, and the equivalence between the sets that contain a broken IP set and sets that contain a broken IP$^{n}$ are established, $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Without assuming the countability of a semigroup, it is shown that piecewise syndetic sets i.e., sets that contain a broken syndetic set (broken IP set) force uniform recurrence (recurrence respectively) and vice versa. In addition, all the said results are established near idempotent of a semitopological semigroup.</description>

      <title>Topologies of open complemented subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce cs-topologies, or topologies of open complemented subsets, as a new approach to constructive topology that preserves the duality between open and closed subsets of classical topology. Complemented subsets were used successfully by Bishop in his constructive formulation of the Daniell approach to measure and integration. Here we use complemented subsets in topology, in order to describe simultaneously an open set, the first-component of an open complemented subset, together with its given complement as a closed set, the second component of an open complemented subset. We analyse the canonical cs-topology induced by a metric, and we introduce the notion of a modulus of openness for a cs-open subset of a metric space. Pointwise and uniform continuity of functions between metric spaces are formulated with respect to the way these functions inverse open complemented subsets together with their moduli of openness. The addition of moduli of openness in the concept of a complemented open subset, given a base for the cs-topology, makes possible to define the notions of pointwise-like and uniform-like continuity of functions between csb-spaces, that is cs-spaces with a given base.</description>

      <title>New algebras of functions on topological groups arising from G-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0608575</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/0608575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a topological group G we introduce the algebra SUC(G) of strongly uniformly continuous functions. It contains the algebra WAP(G) of weakly almost periodic functions as well as the algebras LE(G) and Asp(G) of locally equicontinuous and Asplund functions respectively. For the Polish groups of order preserving homeomorphisms of the unit interval and of isometries of the Urysohn space of diameter 1, SUC(G) is trivial. We study the Roelcke algebra (= UC(G) = right and left uniformly continuous functions) and SUC compactifications of the groups S(N), of permutations of a countable set, and H(C), the group of homeomorphisms of the Cantor set. For the first group we show that WAP(G)=SUC(G)=UC(G) and also provide a concrete description of the corresponding metrizable (in fact Cantor) semitopological semigroup compactification. For the second group, in contrast, we show that SUC(G) is properly contained in UC(G) and for this group UC(G) does not yield a right topological semigroup compactification. We introduce the notion of fixed point on a class P of flows (P-fpp) and study in particular groups which are SUC-amenable and groups with the SUC-fpp (SUC-extreme amenability). We show that every Polish group G with metrizable M(G) is SUC-amenable and if, in addition, M(G) is proximal, then G is SUC-extremely amenable.</description>
