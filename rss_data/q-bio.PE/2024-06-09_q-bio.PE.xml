      <title>Hybrid metapopulation agent-based epidemiological models for efficient insight on the individual scale: a contribution to green computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging infectious diseases and climate change are two of the major challenges in 21st century. Although over the past decades, highly-resolved mathematical models have contributed in understanding dynamics of infectious diseases and are of great aid when it comes to finding suitable intervention measures, they may need substantial computational effort and produce significant $CO_2$ emissions. Two popular modeling approaches for mitigating infectious disease dynamics are agent-based and differential equation-based models. Agent-based models (ABMs) offer an arbitrary level of detail and are thus able to capture heterogeneous human contact behavior and mobility patterns. However, insights on individual-level dynamics come with high computational effort that scales with the number of agents. On the other hand, (differential) equation-based models (EBMs) are computationally efficient even for large populations due to their complexity being independent of the population size. Yet, equation-based models are restricted in their granularity as they assume a well-mixed population. To manage the trade-off between complexity and detail, we propose spatial- and temporal-hybrid models that use agent-based models only in an area or time frame of interest. To account for relevant influences to disease dynamics, we use EBMs, only adding moderate computational costs. Our hybridization approach demonstrates significant reduction in computational effort by up to 98 % -- without losing the required depth in information in the focus frame. The hybrid models used in our numerical simulations are based on two recently proposed models, however, any suitable combination of ABM-EBM could be used, too. Concluding, hybrid epidemiological models can provide insights on the individual scale where necessary, using aggregated models where possible, thereby making an important contribution to green computing.</description>

      <title>Accurate stochastic simulation algorithm for multiscale models of infectious diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the infectious disease literature, significant effort has been devoted to studying dynamics at a single scale. For example, compartmental models describing population-level dynamics are often formulated using differential equations. In cases where small numbers or noise play a crucial role, these differential equations are replaced with memoryless Markovian models, where discrete individuals can be members of a compartment and transition stochastically. Classic stochastic simulation algorithms, such as Gillespie's algorithm and the next reaction method, can be employed to solve these Markovian models exactly. The intricate coupling between models at different scales underscores the importance of multiscale modelling in infectious diseases. However, several computational challenges arise when the multiscale model becomes non-Markovian. In this paper, we address these challenges by developing a novel exact stochastic simulation algorithm. We apply it to a showcase multiscale system where all individuals share the same deterministic within-host model while the population-level dynamics are governed by a stochastic formulation. We demonstrate that as long as the within-host information is harvested at a reasonable resolution, the novel algorithm we develop will always be accurate. Moreover, the novel algorithm we develop is general and can be easily applied to other multiscale models in (or outside) the realm of infectious diseases.</description>

      <title>Adapting Physics-Informed Neural Networks To Optimize ODEs in Mosquito Population Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics informed neural networks have been gaining popularity due to their unique ability to incorporate physics laws into data-driven models, ensuring that the predictions are not only consistent with empirical data but also align with domain-specific knowledge in the form of physics equations. The integration of physics principles enables the method to require less data while maintaining the robustness of deep learning in modeling complex dynamical systems. However, current PINN frameworks are not sufficiently mature for real-world ODE systems, especially those with extreme multi-scale behavior such as mosquito population dynamical modelling. In this research, we propose a PINN framework with several improvements for forward and inverse problems for ODE systems with a case study application in modelling the dynamics of mosquito populations. The framework tackles the gradient imbalance and stiff problems posed by mosquito ordinary differential equations. The method offers a simple but effective way to resolve the time causality issue in PINNs by gradually expanding the training time domain until it covers entire domain of interest. As part of a robust evaluation, we conduct experiments using simulated data to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. Preliminary results indicate that physics-informed machine learning holds significant potential for advancing the study of ecological systems.</description>

      <title>grenedalf: population genetic statistics for the next generation of pool sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pool sequencing is an efficient method for capturing genome-wide allele frequencies from multiple individuals, with broad applications such as studying adaptation in Evolve-and-Resequence experiments, monitoring of genetic diversity in wild populations, and genotype-to-phenotype mapping. Here, we present grenedalf, a command line tool written in C++ that implements common population genetic statistics such as $\theta$, Tajima's D, and FST for Pool sequencing. It is orders of magnitude faster than current tools, and is focused on providing usability and scalability, while also offering a plethora of input file formats and convenience options.</description>

      <title>Single-cell mutational burden distributions in birth-death processes</title>

Abstract: Genetic mutations are footprints of tumour growth. While mutation data in bulk samples has been used to infer evolutionary parameters hard to measure in vivo, the advent of single-cell data has led to strong interest in the mutational burden distribution (MBD) among tumour cells. We introduce dynamical matrices and recurrence relations to integrate this single-cell MBD with known statistics, and derive new analytical expressions. Surprisingly, we find that the shape of the MBD is driven by cell lineage-level stochasticity rather than by the distribution of mutations in each cell division.</description>

      <title>A picture guide to cancer progression and monotonic accumulation models: evolutionary assumptions, plausible interpretations, and alternative uses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cancer progression and monotonic accumulation models were developed to discover dependencies in the irreversible acquisition of binary traits from cross-sectional data. They have been used in computational oncology and virology to understand dependencies in the accumulation of mutations but also in widely different problems such as malaria progression.
  These tools have been used to make predictions about future and unobserved states of the system, identify different routes of feature acquisition in subsets of the data, and improve patient stratification based on the evolutionary trajectories.
  But these methods have shortcomings, in particular with respect to key evolutionary assumptions and interpretations. After an overview of the available methods, we focus on how and why the methods can fail and why their inferences might not be about the process we intend. The discussion embraces fitness landscapes and highlights the difficulties that arise from bulk sequencing and reciprocal sign epistasis, from the conflation of lines of descent, path of the maximum, and mutational profiles, and from the ambiguous use of the concepts of exclusivity and alternative evolutionary paths. Next, we suggest that users recognize the limitations that arise from their sampling designs, and we examine how the previous concerns are modified when bulk sequencing is accounted for. We also highlight how bulk sequencing can create an opportunity for addressing dependencies that arise from frequency-dependent selection. This review should help identify major standing issues and research opportunities, and encourage the use of these methods in other areas with a possibly better fit between entities and model assumptions.</description>

      <title>Tropical Logistic Regression Model on Space of Phylogenetic Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classification of gene trees is an important task both in the analysis of multi-locus phylogenetic data, and assessment of the convergence of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses used in Bayesian phylogenetic tree reconstruction. The logistic regression model is one of the most popular classification models in statistical learning, thanks to its computational speed and interpretability. However, it is not appropriate to directly apply the standard logistic regression model to a set of phylogenetic trees, as the space of phylogenetic trees is non-Euclidean and thus contradicts the standard assumptions on covariates. It is well-known in tropical geometry and phylogenetics that the space of phylogenetic trees is a tropical linear space in terms of the max-plus algebra. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an analogue approach of the logistic regression model in the setting of tropical geometry. Our proposed method outperforms classical logistic regression in terms of Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) in numerical examples, including with data generated by the multi-species coalescent model. Theoretical properties such as statistical consistency have been proved and generalization error rates have been derived. Finally, our classification algorithm is proposed as an MCMC convergence criterion for Mr Bayes. Unlike the convergence metric used by MrBayes which is only dependent on tree topologies, our method is sensitive to branch lengths and therefore provides a more robust metric for convergence. In a test case, it is illustrated that the tropical logistic regression can differentiate between two independently run MCMC chains, even when the standard metric cannot.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary game dynamics with environmental feedback in a network with two communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments of eco-evolutionary models have shown that evolving feedbacks between behavioral strategies and the environment of game interactions, leading to changes in the underlying payoff matrix, can impact the underlying population dynamics in various manners. We propose and analyze an eco-evolutionary game dynamics model on a network with two communities such that players interact with other players in the same community and those in the opposite community at different rates. In our model, we consider two-person matrix games with pairwise interactions occurring on individual edges and assume that the environmental state depends on edges rather than on nodes or being globally shared in the population. We analytically determine the equilibria and their stability under a symmetric population structure assumption, and we also numerically study the replicator dynamics of the general model. The model shows rich dynamical behavior, such as multiple transcritical bifurcations, multistability, and anti-synchronous oscillations. Our work offers insights into understanding how the presence of community structure impacts the eco-evolutionary dynamics within and between niches.</description>
