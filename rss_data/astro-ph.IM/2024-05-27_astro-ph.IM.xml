      <title>AstroPT: Scaling Large Observation Models for Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents AstroPT, an autoregressive pretrained transformer developed with astronomical use-cases in mind. The AstroPT models presented here have been pretrained on 8.6 million $512 \times 512$ pixel $grz$-band galaxy postage stamp observations from the DESI Legacy Survey DR8. We train a selection of foundation models of increasing size from 1 million to 2.1 billion parameters, and find that AstroPT follows a similar saturating log-log scaling law to textual models. We also find that the models' performances on downstream tasks as measured by linear probing improves with model size up to the model parameter saturation point. We believe that collaborative community development paves the best route towards realising an open source `Large Observation Model' -- a model trained on data taken from the observational sciences at the scale seen in natural language processing. To this end, we release the source code, weights, and dataset for AstroPT under the MIT license, and invite potential collaborators to join us in collectively building and researching these models.</description>

      <title>Detector requirements: some challenges for the present</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysics demands higher precision in measurements across photometry, spectroscopy, and astrometry. Several science cases necessitate not only precision but also a high level of accuracy. We highlight the challenges involved, particularly in achieving spectral fidelity, which refers to our ability to accurately replicate the input spectrum of an astrophysical source. Beyond wavelength calibration, this encompasses correcting observed spectra for atmospheric, telescope, and instrumental signatures. Elevating spectral fidelity opens avenues for addressing fundamental questions in physics and astrophysics. We delve into specific science cases, critically analyzing the prerequisites for conducting crucial observations. Special attention is given to the requirements for spectrograph detectors, their calibrations and data reduction. Importantly, these considerations align closely with the needs of photometry and astrometry.</description>

      <title>A $Li$ne $Me$asuring library for large and complex spectroscopic data sets: Implementation of a virtual observatory for JWST spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming generation of telescopes, instruments, and surveys is poised to usher in an unprecedented "Big Data" era in the field of astronomy. Within this context, even seemingly modest tasks such as spectral line analyses could become increasingly challenging for astronomers.
  In this paper, we announce the release of ${\rm L{\small I}M{\small E}}$. This package is tailored for multidisciplinary observations with long-slit and integral field spectroscopy (IFS) support. ${\rm L{\small I}M{\small E}}$ functions encompass the reading of observational files, detecting lines, conditioned line fitting, and the plotting and storage of results. Most importantly, these measurements are structured to support the subsequent chemical and kinematic analyses.
  To reduce the coding effort required from users, we introduced a notation system for atomic transitions that is accessible to humans and machine-readable. Along with this system, we present an extensive database of line bands, spanning from the ultraviolet to the infrared wavelength range. Additionally, we propose a model designed to train machine learning algorithms in line detection. ${\rm L{\small I}M{\small E}}$ features a comprehensive online documentation, which details the command attributes and includes several tutorials. These tutorials range from measuring a single line to analyzing an entire IFS data cube.
  This library functions and measurements are showcased in an online virtual observatory. The data in this interactive website come from the JWST NIRSpec observations of the CEERs survey. In this regard, ${\rm L{\small I}M{\small E}}$ offers improvements related to the dissemination and accessibility of astronomical spectra.</description>

      <title>Temporal Stamp Classifier: Classifying Short Sequences of Astronomical Alerts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a deep learning-based classification model of astronomical objects using alerts reported by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey. The model takes as inputs sequences of stamp images and metadata contained in each alert, as well as features from the All-WISE catalog. The proposed model, called temporal stamp classifier, is able to discriminate between three classes of astronomical objects: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), Super-Novae (SNe) and Variable Stars (VS), with an accuracy of approximately 98% in the test set, when using 2 to 5 detections. The results show that the model performance improves with the addition of more detections. Simple recurrence models obtain competitive results with those of more complex models such as LSTM.We also propose changes to the original stamp classifier model, which only uses the first detection. The performance of the latter model improves with changes in the architecture and the addition of random rotations, achieving a 1.46% increase in test accuracy.</description>

      <title>Designing robust trajectories by lobe dynamics in low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00721v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern space missions with uncrewed spacecraft require robust trajectory design to connect multiple chaotic orbits by small controls. To address this issue, we propose a control scheme to design robust trajectories by leveraging a geometrical structure in chaotic zones, known as a {\it lobe}. Our scheme shows that appropriately selected lobes reveal possible paths to traverse chaotic zones in a short time. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through trajectory design in both the standard map and Hill's equation.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Chromatic Gaussian Process Noise Models for Six Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are designed to detect low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). GWs induce achromatic signals in PTA data, meaning that the timing delays do not depend on radio-frequency. However, pulse arrival times are also affected by radio-frequency dependent "chromatic" noise from sources such as dispersion measure (DM) and scattering delay variations. Furthermore, the characterization of GW signals may be influenced by the choice of chromatic noise model for each pulsar. To better understand this effect, we assess if and how different chromatic noise models affect achromatic noise properties in each pulsar. The models we compare include existing DM models used by NANOGrav and noise models used for the European PTA Data Release 2 (EPTA DR2). We perform this comparison using a subsample of six pulsars from the NANOGrav 15 yr data set, selecting the same six pulsars as from the EPTA DR2 six-pulsar dataset. We find that the choice of chromatic noise model noticeably affects the achromatic noise properties of several pulsars. This is most dramatic for PSR J1713+0747, where the amplitude of its achromatic red noise lowers from $\log_{10}A_{\text{RN}} = -14.1^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$ to $-14.7^{+0.3}_{-0.5}$, and the spectral index broadens from $\gamma_{\text{RN}} = 2.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ to $\gamma_{\text{RN}} = 3.5^{+1.2}_{-0.9}$. We also compare each pulsar's noise properties with those inferred from the EPTA DR2, using the same models. From the discrepancies, we identify potential areas where the noise models could be improved. These results highlight the potential for custom chromatic noise models to improve PTA sensitivity to GWs.</description>

      <title>The 18 May 2024 superbolide over the Iberian Peninsula: USG space sensors and ground-based independent observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On 18 May 2024, a superbolide traversed the western part of the Iberian Peninsula, culminating its flight over the Atlantic Ocean and generating significant media attention. This event was caused by a weak carbonaceous meteoroid of 93.0$\pm$0.8 cm, with a density of 1613$\pm$12 kg\,m$^{-3}$, entering the atmosphere at 40.1$\pm$0.4 km\,s$^{-1}$ with an angle of 10.93$\pm$0.02$^\circ$. The luminous phase started at 137.88$\pm$0.05 km and ended at an altitude of 53.78$\pm$0.07 km. The meteoroid's heliocentric orbit was characterized by an inclination of 14.42$\pm$0.23$^\circ$, a high eccentricity of 0.950$\pm$0.004, a semi-major axis of 2.31$\pm$0.13 au, and a notably short perihelion distance of 0.116$\pm$0.003 au. The superbolide was recorded by multiple ground-based stations of the Spanish Meteor Network (SPMN), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the U.S. Government (USG) space sensors. Our analysis shows a good agreement with the radiant and velocity data reported by the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), with a deviation of 1.6$^\circ$ and -0.4 km\,s$^{-1}$, respectively. Due to the absence of observable deceleration, we successfully reconciled satellite radiometric data with a purely dynamic atmospheric flight model, constraining the meteoroid's mass and coherently fitting its velocity profile.</description>

      <title>A Pilot Study from the First Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience for Online Degree-Seeking Astronomy Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research-based active learning approaches are critical for the teaching and learning of undergraduate STEM majors. Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) are becoming more commonplace in traditional, in-person academic environments, but have only just started to be utilized in online education. Online education has been shown to create accessible pathways to knowledge for individuals from nontraditional student backgrounds, and increasing the diversity of STEM fields has been identified as a priority for future generations of scientists and engineers. We developed and instructed a rigorous, six-week curriculum on the topic of observational astronomy, dedicated to educating second year online astronomy students in practices and techniques for astronomical research. Throughout the course, the students learned about telescopes, the atmosphere, filter systems, adaptive optics systems, astronomical catalogs, and image viewing and processing tools. We developed a survey informed by previous research validated assessments aimed to evaluate course feedback, course impact, student self-efficacy, student science identity and community values, and student sense of belonging. The survey was administered at the conclusion of the course to all eleven students yielding eight total responses. Although preliminary, the results of our analysis indicate that student confidence in utilizing the tools and skills taught in the course was significant. Students also felt a great sense of belonging to the astronomy community and increased confidence in conducting astronomical research in the future.</description>

      <title>Mapper of the IGM spin temperature: instrument overview</title>

Abstract: The observation of the global 21 cm signal produced by neutral hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the Dark Ages, Cosmic Dawn, and Epoch of Reionization requires measurements with extremely well-calibrated wideband radiometers. We describe the design and characterization of the Mapper of the IGM Spin Temperature (MIST), which is a new ground-based, single-antenna, global 21 cm experiment. The design of MIST was guided by the objectives of avoiding systematics from an antenna ground plane and cables around the antenna, as well as maximizing the instrument's on-sky efficiency and portability for operations at remote sites. We have built two MIST instruments, which observe in the range 25-105 MHz. For the 21 cm signal, this frequency range approximately corresponds to redshifts 55.5 &gt; z &gt; 12.5, encompassing the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn. The MIST antenna is a horizontal blade dipole of 2.42 m in length, 60 cm in width, and 52 cm in height above the ground. This antenna operates without a metal ground plane. The instruments run on 12 V batteries and have a maximum power consumption of 17 W. The batteries and electronics are contained in a single receiver box located under the antenna. We present the characterization of the instruments using electromagnetic simulations and lab measurements. We also show sample sky measurements from recent observations at remote sites in California, Nevada, and the Canadian High Arctic. These measurements indicate that the instruments perform as expected. Detailed analyses of the sky measurements are left for future work.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Detection of the Global 21 cm Signal with MIST for Different Models of the Soil and Beam Directivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mapper of the IGM Spin Temperature (MIST) is a new ground-based, single-antenna, radio experiment attempting to detect the global 21 cm signal from the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn. A significant challenge in this measurement is the frequency-dependence, or chromaticity, of the antenna beam directivity. MIST observes with the antenna above the soil and without a metal ground plane, and the beam directivity is sensitive to the electrical characteristics of the soil. In this paper, we use simulated observations with MIST to study how the detection of the global 21 cm signal from Cosmic Dawn is affected by the soil and the MIST beam directivity. We simulate observations using electromagnetic models of the directivity computed for single- and two-layer models of the soil. We test the recovery of the Cosmic Dawn signal with and without beam chromaticity correction applied to the simulated data. We find that our single-layer soil models enable a straightforward recovery of the signal even without chromaticity correction. Two-layer models increase the beam chromaticity and make the recovery more challenging. However, for the model in which the bottom soil layer has a lower electrical conductivity than the top layer, the signal can be recovered even without chromaticity correction. For the other two-layer models, chromaticity correction is necessary for the recovery of the signal and the accuracy requirements for the soil parameters vary between models. These results will be used as a guideline to select observation sites that are favorable for the detection of the Cosmic Dawn signal.</description>

      <title>Vibrational modes as the origin of dielectric loss at 0.27$\unicode{x2013}$100 THz in a-SiC:H</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-loss deposited dielectrics are beneficial for the advancement of superconducting integrated circuits for astronomy. In the microwave band ($\mathrm{\sim}$1$\unicode{x2013}$10 GHz) the cryogenic and low-power dielectric loss is dominated by two-level systems. However, the origin of the loss in the millimeter-submillimeter band ($\mathrm{\sim}$0.1$\unicode{x2013}$1 THz) is not understood. We measured the loss of hydrogenated amorphous SiC (a-SiC:H) films in the 0.27$\unicode{x2013}$100 THz range using superconducting microstrip resonators and Fourier-transform spectroscopy. The agreement between the loss data and a Maxwell-Helmholtz-Drude dispersion model suggests that vibrational modes above 10 THz dominate the loss in the a-SiC:H above 200 GHz.</description>

      <title>A novel nuclear recoil calibration for liquid noble gas detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12496v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to many dark matter models, a potential signal registered in a detector would feature a single-scattering nuclear recoil (NR). So, it is crucial to calibrate the detector's response to NR events. The conventional calibrations implement $\sim$ keV to MeV neutrons, which can be produced by an accelerator, a neutron generator, or a radioactive source. Although the calibrating methods have been widely employed, they could be improved in several ways: (a) the incident neutron energy should be more monoenergetic, (b) the calibrating NR energy should line up with the region of interest (ROI) of the experiment, and (c) the intensity of the beam should be appropriate. In the paper, we introduce a novel NR calibration method for liquid helium detectors, in which a helium beam ($\alpha$ particles) will be implemented to calibrate the detectors. The helium beam can (i) be tuned precisely to have a jitter of $\lesssim $ 4\% (the $\alpha$ beam's kinetic energy is equivalent to the recoil energy in the conventional calibrations with fast neutrons); (ii) have an energy between $\sim$ 100 eV and tens of keV; and (iii) provide a tunable flux from nA to 100 $\mu$A, which presents convenience in beam pipe configuration to obtain a $\sim$ 100 Hz events rate so that the events pileup would be ignorable.</description>

Abstract: The Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020 (Astro2020) has recommended that NASA realize a large IR/O/UV space telescope optimized for high-contrast imaging and spectroscopy of ~25 exo-Earths and transformative general astrophysics. The NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) has subsequently released a list of 164 nearby (d&lt;25 pc) targets deemed the most accessible to survey for potentially habitable exoplanets with the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). We present a catalog of system properties for the 164 ExEP targets, including 1744 abundance measurements for 14 elements from the Hypatia Catalog and 924 photometry measurements spanning from 151.6 nm to 22 {\mu}m in the GALEX, Str\"omgren, Tycho, Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE bandpasses. We independently derive stellar properties for these systems by modeling their spectral energy distributions with Bayesian model averaging. Additionally, by consulting the literature, we identify TESS flare rates for 46 stars, optical variability for 78 stars, and X-ray emission for 46 stars in our sample. We discuss our catalog in the context of planet habitability and draw attention to key gaps in our knowledge where precursor science can help to inform HWO mission design trade studies in the near future. Notably, only 33 of the 164 stars in our sample have reliable space-based UV measurements, and only 40 have a mid-IR measurement. We also find that phosphorus, a bio-essential element, has only been measured in 11 of these stars, motivating future abundance surveys. Our catalog is publicly available and we advocate for its use in future studies of promising HWO targets.</description>

Abstract: In astronomy, we frequently face the decision problem: does this data contain a signal? Typically, a statistical approach is used, which requires a threshold. The choice of threshold presents a common challenge in settings where signals and noise must be delineated, but their distributions overlap. Gravitational-wave astronomy, which has gone from the first discovery to catalogues of hundreds of events in less than a decade, presents a fascinating case study. For signals from colliding compact objects, the field has evolved from a frequentist to a Bayesian methodology. However, the issue of choosing a threshold and validating noise contamination in a catalogue persists. Confusion and debate often arise due to the misapplication of statistical concepts, the complicated nature of the detection statistics, and the inclusion of astrophysical background models. We introduce Conformal Prediction (CP), a framework developed in Machine Learning to provide distribution-free uncertainty quantification to point predictors. We show that CP can be viewed as an extension of the traditional statistical frameworks whereby thresholds are calibrated such that the uncertainty intervals are statistically rigorous and the error rate can be validated. Moreover, we discuss how CP offers a framework to optimally build a meta-pipeline combining the outputs from multiple independent searches. We introduce CP with a toy cosmic-ray detector, which captures the salient features of most astrophysical search problems and allows us to demonstrate the features of CP in a simple context. We then apply the approach to a recent gravitational-wave Mock Data Challenge using multiple search algorithms for compact binary coalescence signals in interferometric gravitational-wave data. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on the future potential of the method for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>
