      <title>Wavefront propagation in a bistable dual-delayed-feedback oscillator: analogy to networks with nonlocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present research, a bistable delayed-feedback oscillator with two delayed-feedback loops is shown to replicate a network of bistable nodes with nonlocal coupling. It is demonstrated that all the aspects of the nonlocal interaction impact on wavefront propagation identified in networks of bistable elements are entirely reproduced in the dynamics of a single oscillator with two delays. In particular, adding the second delayed-feedback loop allows speeding up both deterministic and stochastic wavefront propagation, achieving stabilization of propagating fronts at lower noise intensity and preventing fronts from noise-induced destruction occurring in the presence of single delayed-feedback. All the revealed effects are studied in numerical simulations and confirmed in physical experiments, showing an excellent correspondence.</description>

      <title>Detailed balance in large language model-driven agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-driven agents are emerging as a powerful new paradigm for solving complex problems. Despite the empirical success of these practices, a theoretical framework to understand and unify their macroscopic dynamics remains lacking. This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details. This work is an attempt to establish a macroscopic dynamics theory of complex AI systems, aiming to elevate the study of AI agents from a collection of engineering practices to a science built on effective measurements that are predictable and quantifiable.</description>

      <title>Generalising thermodynamic efficiency of interactions: inferential, information-geometric and computational perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-organizing systems consume energy to generate internal order. The concept of thermodynamic efficiency, drawing from statistical physics and information theory, has previously been proposed to characterise a change in control parameter by relating the resulting predictability gain to the required amount of work. However, previous studies have taken a system-centric perspective and considered only single control parameters. Here, we generalise thermodynamic efficiency to multiple control parameters and extend the definition of thermodynamic efficiency to protocols in arbitrary directions, by introducing directional efficiency. Taking an observer-centric perspective, we derive two novel formulations. The first, an inferential form, relates efficiency to fluctuations of macroscopic observables, interpreting thermodynamic efficiency in terms of how well the system parameters can be inferred from observable macroscopic behaviour. The second, an information-geometric form, expresses efficiency in terms of the Fisher information matrix, interpreting it with respect to how difficult it is to navigate the statistical manifold defined by the control protocol. This observer-centric perspective is contrasted with the existing system-centric view, where efficiency is considered an intrinsic property of the system.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of Dirac-Bianconi driven oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dynamical systems on networks, one assigns the dynamics to nodes, which are then coupled via links. This approach does not account for group interactions and dynamics on links and other higher dimensional structures. Higher-order network theory addresses this by considering variables defined on nodes, links, triangles, and higher-order simplices, called topological signals (or cochains). Moreover, topological signals of different dimensions can interact through the Dirac-Bianconi operator, which allows coupling between topological signals defined, for example, on nodes and links. Such interactions can induce various dynamical behaviors, for example, periodic oscillations. The oscillating system consists of topological signals on nodes and links whose dynamics are driven by the Dirac-Bianconi coupling, hence, which we call it Dirac-Bianconi driven oscillator. Using the phase reduction method, we obtain a phase description of this system and apply it to the study of synchronization between two such oscillators. This approach offers a way to analyze oscillatory behaviors in higher-order networks beyond the node-based paradigm, while providing a ductile modeling tool for node- and edge-signals.</description>
