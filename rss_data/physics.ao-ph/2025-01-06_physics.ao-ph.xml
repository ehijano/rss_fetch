      <title>Removing Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Using Large Land Or Ocean Areas Will Change Earth Albedo And Force Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When large surface areas of the Earth are altered, radiative forcing due to changes in surface reflectance can drive climate change. Yet to achieve the necessary scale to remove the substantial amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere relevant for ameliorating climate change, enhanced rock weathering (ERW) will need to be applied to very large land areas. Likewise, marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) must alter a large fraction of the ocean surface waters to have a significant impact upon climate. We show that surface albedo modification (SAM) can easily overwhelm the reduction in radiative forcing from the decrease of atmospheric CO2 due to ERW or mCDR over timescales of decades. SAM via ERW can be either cooling or warming. We identify some of the many questions raised by radiative forcing due to these forms of CDR.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Anthropogenic Air and Light Pollution on Astrophysics and Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light and air pollution are the two main forms of pollution, containing the highest concentration in urban areas. I set out to investigate the effects of anthropogenic air and light pollution on the night sky, how this affects the astronomical data-collecting process, and how the general public perceives both forms of pollution. This paper utilizes primary and secondary research, referring to different sources: data collected through my telescope, astrophotography, other scientists' research, and survey responses from over 40 people across 2 areas: Southern California and Guadalajara, Mexico. Through this, I have found strong correlations between increased aerosol particles from air pollutants and increased night sky brightness, increased aerosol particles amplifying cloud formation, which in turn increases light reflection, and a correlation between different areas and what they believe about pollution, with many being misinformed on air and light pollution themselves.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh's Amplified Coastal Storm Tide Hazard from Tropical Cyclones and Rising Sea Levels in a Warming Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The risk of extreme storm tides to Bangladesh's low-lying and densely populated coastal regions, already vulnerable to tropical cyclones, remains poorly quantified under a warming climate. Here, using a statistical-physical downscaling approach, our multimodel large-ensemble projections under the IPCC6 SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios show that Bangladesh's 100-year storm tide will likely intensify from 3.5 m to between 4.9 m and 5.4 m by the end of the 21st century. The Meghna-North Chattogram region is the most vulnerable, and the storm tide season will broaden significantly, amplifying the strongest during the late monsoon and late post-monsoon seasons. We project substantial increases in seasonal storm tide frequencies, with a four-fold increase in back-to-back extremes in the post-monsoon season. Across the SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios assessed using multiple climate models, the frequency of storm tide from destructive cyclones like Bhola and Gorky will significantly increase by 7-18 times and 6-23 times, respectively. Our study indicates a need to re-examine the ongoing coastal improvement and heighten the urgency to enhance coastal resilience in Bangladesh.</description>
