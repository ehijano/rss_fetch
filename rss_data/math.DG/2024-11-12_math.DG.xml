      <title>Special Finsler spaces admitting a semi-concurrent vector field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to study semi-concurrent vector fields on a Finsler manifold. We show that the quasi-$C$-reducible Finsler space, $C3$-like Finsler space, $C^{h}$-recurrent Finsler space, and $P2$-like Finsler space are equivalent to Riemannian if they admit a semi-concurrent vector field. Further, we prove the necessary and sufficient condition for a Finsler space satisfying $C$-conformal condition to become Riemannian.</description>

      <title>Boundary Value Problem and Discrete Schwarz-Pick Lemma for Generalized Hyperbolic Circle Packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1991, Beardon and Stephenson [2] generalized the classical Schwarz-Pick lemma in hyperbolic geometry to the discrete Schwarz-Pick lemma for Andreev circle packings. This paper continues to investigate the discrete Schwarz-Pick lemma for generalized circle packings (including circle, horocycle or hypercycle) in hyperbolic background geometry. Since the discrete Schwarz-Pick lemma is to compare some geometric quantities of two generalized circle packings with different boundary values, we first show the existence and rigidity of generalized circle packings with boundary values, and then we introduce the method of combinatorial Calabi flows to find the generalized circle packings with boundary values. Moreover, motivated by the method of He [21], we propose the maximum principle for generalized circle packings. Finally, we use the maximum principle to prove the discrete Schwarz-Pick lemma for generalized circle packings.</description>

      <title>Some rigidity results on shrinking gradient Ricci soliton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $(M^n, g, f)$ is a complete shrinking gradient Ricci soliton. We give several rigidity results under some natural conditions, generalizing the results in \cite{Petersen-Wylie,Guan-Lu-Xu}. Using maximum principle, we prove that shrinking gradient Ricci soliton with constant scalar curvature $R=1$ is isometric to a finite quotient of $\mathbb{R}^2\times \mathbb{S}^2$, giving a new proof of the main results of Cheng-Zhou \cite{Cheng-Zhou}.</description>

      <title>On orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems in constant curvature spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a method for constructing $n$-orthogonal coordinate systems in constant curvature spaces. The construction proposed is a modification of Krichever's method for producing orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems in the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. To demonstrate how this method works, we construct examples of orthogonal coordinate systems on the two-dimensional sphere and the hyperbolic plane, in the case when the spectral curve is reducible and all irreducible components are isomorphic to a complex projective line.</description>

      <title>Manifolds with a commutative and associative product structure that encodes superintegrable Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that two natural and a priori unrelated structures encapsulate the same data, namely certain commutative and associative product structures and a class of superintegrable Hamiltonian systems. More precisely, consider a Euclidean space of dimension at least three, equipped with a commutative and associative product structure that satisfies certain compatibility conditions. We prove that such a product structure encapsulates precisely the conditions of a so-called abundant structure. Such a structure provides the data needed to construct a family of second-order (maximally) superintegrable Hamiltonian systems of second order. We prove that all abundant superintegrable Hamiltonian systems on Euclidean space of dimension at least three arise in this way. As an example, we present the Smorodinski-Winternitz I Hamiltonian system.</description>

      <title>3-circle Theorem for Willmore surfaces II--degeneration of the complex structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the compactness of Willmore surfaces without assuming the convergence of the induced complex structures. In particular, we compute the energy loss in the neck in terms of the residue and we prove that the limit of the image of the Gauss map is a geodesic in the Grassmannian $G(2,n)$ whose length can also be computed in terms of the residue. Moreover, we provide a family of explicit Willmore surfaces in $\R^3$ that illustrate the denegeration phenomenon involved in the above results.</description>

      <title>Fine properties of nonlinear potentials and a unified perspective on monotonicity formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a large family of monotone quantities along the weak inverse mean curvature flow is the limit case of the corresponding ones along the level sets of $p$-capacitary potentials. Such monotone quantities include Willmore and Minkowski-type functionals on Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. In $3$-dimensional manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature, we also recover the monotonicity of the Hawking mass and its nonlinear potential theoretic counterparts. This unified view is built on a refined analysis of $p$-capacitary potentials. We prove that they strongly converge in $W^{1,q}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ as $p\to 1^+$ to the inverse mean curvature flow and their level sets are curvature varifolds. Finally, we also deduce a Gauss-Bonnet-type theorem for level sets of $p$-capacitary potentials.</description>

      <title>Geodesics on metrics of self-dual Taub-Nut type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geodesic equations are solved when at least two of $\tau$, $\theta$, $\varphi$ are constant on metrics of self-dual Taub-NUT type. They can also be solved also on self-dual Taub-NUT metrics if only $r$, $\theta$ or $\varphi$ is constant. However, the explicit solution of the geodesic equations is not available yet if only $\tau$ is constant.</description>

      <title>Gromov hyperbolicity of intrinsic metrics from isoperimetric inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the Gromov hyperbolicity of the classical Kobayashi and Hilbert metrics, and the recently introduced minimal metric. Using the linear isoperimetric inequality characterization of Gromov hyperbolicity, we show if these metrics have an "expanding property" near the boundary, then they are Gromov hyperbolic. This provides a new characterization of the convex domains whose Hilbert metric is Gromov hyperbolic, a new proof of Balogh-Bonk's result that the Kobayashi metric is Gromov hyperbolic on a strongly pseudoconvex domain, a new proof of the second author's result that the Kobayashi metric is Gromov hyperbolic on a convex domain with finite type, and a new proof of Fiacchi's result that the minimal metric is Gromov hyperbolic on a strongly minimally convex domain. We also characterize the smoothly bounded convex domains where the minimal metric is Gromov hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>On natural symmetries on slit tangent bundles of Finsler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a broad class of metrics on the slit tangent bundle of Finsler manifolds, termed \emph{$F$-natural metrics}. These metrics parallel the well-established $g$-natural metrics on the tangent bundles of Riemannian manifolds and are constructed using six real functions defined over the domain of positive real numbers. We provide an in-depth characterization of conformal, homothetic, and Killing vector fields derived from specific lifts of vector fields and tensor sections on the slit tangent bundle, which is equipped with a general pseudo-Riemannian $F$-natural metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any compact Lie group $G$, we introduce a novel notion of average signature $\mathbb A(G)$ valued in its tensor Lie algebra, by taking the average value of the signature of the unique length-minimizing geodesics between all pairs of generic points in $G$. We prove that the trace spectrum of $\mathbb A(G)$ recovers certain geometric quantities of $G$, including the dimension, the diameter, the volume and the scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>Spectrally distinguishing symmetric spaces II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The action of the subgroup $\operatorname{G}_2$ of $\operatorname{SO}(7)$ (resp.\ $\operatorname{Spin}(7)$ of $\operatorname{SO}(8)$) on the Grassmannian space $M=\frac{\operatorname{SO}(7)}{\operatorname{SO}(5)\times\operatorname{SO}(2)}$ (resp.\ $M=\frac{\operatorname{SO}(8)}{\operatorname{SO}(5)\times\operatorname{SO}(3)}$) is still transitive. We prove that the spectrum (i.e.\ the collection of eigenvalues of its Laplace-Beltrami operator) of a symmetric metric $g_0$ on $M$ coincides with the spectrum of a $\operatorname{G}_2$-invariant (resp.\ $\operatorname{Spin}(7)$-invariant) metric $g$ on $M$ only if $g_0$ and $g$ are isometric.
  As a consequence, each non-flat compact irreducible symmetric space of non-group type is spectrally unique among the family of all currently known homogeneous metrics on its underlying differentiable manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the natural analogues of the Brylinksi condition, Strong Lefschetz condition, and $d\delta$-lemma in Symplectic Geometry originally explored by Brylinksi, Mathieu, Yan, and Guillemin in the Symplectic Lie Algebroid case. The equivalence of the three conditions is re-established as a purely algebraic statement along with a primitive notion of the $d\delta$-lemma established by Tseng, Yau, and Ho. We then apply this algebraic theory to the desired geometric setting to show that these analogues hold, and finally provide a few classes of examples.</description>

      <title>Complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation for positive $(p,p)$ forms on compact K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation for differential $(p,p)$ forms is introduced on compact K\"ahler manifolds. For any $1 \leq p &lt; n$, we show the existence of smooth solutions unique up to adding constants. For $p=1$, this corresponds to the Calabi-Yau theorem proved by S. T. Yau, and for $p=n-1$, this gives the Monge-Amp\`ere equation for $(n-1)$ plurisubharmonic functions solved by Tosatti-Weinkove. For other $p$ values, this defines a non-linear PDE that falls outside of the general framework of Caffarelli-Nirenberg-Spruck. Further, we define a geometric flow for higher-order forms that preserves their cohomology classes, and extends the K\"ahler-Ricci flow naturally to $(p,p)$ forms. As a consequence of our main theorem, we show that this flow exists in a maximal time interval and can be shown to converge under some assumptions. A modified flow is introduced in order to study the evolution of Hodge classes of $M$ with respect to the rational span of Chern classes of holomoprhic vector bundles. The convergence of the associated normalized flow is shown and some potential applications are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the previous work, we study the closure of a complex subtorus in a toric manifold given by the data of an affine subspace. We call it torus-equivariantly embedded toric manifold when the closure of a complex subtorus is a smooth complex submanifold. In this paper, we clearify the condition for nonsingularity of the closure of a complex subtorus in terms of polytopes. The main result is a generalization of Delzant theorem to the case of torus-equivariantly embedded toric hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Existence of Solutions to a super-Liouville equation with Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of solutions to a type of super-Liouville equation on the compact Riemannian surface $M$ with boundary and with its Euler characteristic $\chi(M)&lt;0$. The boundary condition couples a Neumann condition for functions and a chirality boundary condition for spinors. Due to the generality of the equation, we introduce a weighted Dirac operator based on the solution to a related Liouville equation. Then we construct a Nehari manifold according to the spectral decomposition of the weighted Dirac operator, and use minimax theory on this Nehari manifold to show the existence of the non-trivial solutions.</description>

      <title>Two-dimension vanishing, splitting and positive scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove several analogs of Gromov's macroscopic dimension conjecture with extra curvature assumptions. More explicitly, we show that for an open Riemannian $n$-manifold $(M,g)$ of nonnegative Ricci (resp. sectional) curvature, if it has uniformly positive scalar curvature and it is uniformly volume noncollapsed, then the essential (resp. Hausdorff) dimension of an asymptotic cone, as a notion of largeness, has a sharp upper bound $n-2$, which is $2$ less than the upper bound for an open Riemannian manifold with only nonnegative Ricci curvature. As a consequence, the dimension of space of linear growth harmonic functions of $M$ has upper bound $n-1$ which is also $2$ less than the sharp bound $n+1$ when $M$ only has nonnegative Ricci curvature. We also prove the first Betti number upper bound is $n-2$ if $M$ is compact, and $n-3$ if $M$ is non-compact. When $M$ is compact we show a fibration theorem over torus, and a rigidity theorem for the fiber when the first Betti number upper bound is achieved.</description>

      <title>On the local Kan structure and differentiation of simplicial manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that arbitrary simplicial manifolds satisfy Kan conditions in a suitable local sense. This allows us to expand a technique for differentiating higher Lie groupoids worked out in current research to the setting of general simplicial manifolds. Consequently, we derive a method to differentiate simplicial manifolds into higher Lie algebroids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify totally geodesic submanifolds of the real Stiefel manifolds of orthogonal two-frames. We also classify polar actions on these Stiefel manifolds, specifically, we prove that the orbits of polar actions are lifts of polar actions on the corresponding Grassmannian. In the case of cohomogeneity-one actions we are able to obtain a classification for all real, complex and quaternionic Stiefel manifolds of $k$-frames.</description>

      <title>Invariant Jet differentials and Asymptotic Serre duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.09024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the main result of Demailly \cite{D2} for the bundles $E_{k,m}^{GG}(V^*)$ of jet differentials of order $k$ and weighted degree $m$ to the bundles $E_{k,m}(V^*)$ of the invariant jet differentials of order $k$ and weighted degree $m$. Namely, Theorem 0.5 from \cite{D2} and Theorem 9.3 from \cite{D1} provide a lower bound $\frac{c^k}{k}m^{n+kr-1}$ on the number of the linearly independent holomorphic global sections of $E_{k,m}^{GG} V^* \bigotimes \mathcal{O}(-m \delta A)$ for some ample divisor $A$. The group $G_k$ of local reparametrizations of $(\mathbb{C},0)$ acts on the $k$-jets by orbits of dimension $k$, so that there is an automatic lower bound $\frac{c^k}{k} m^{n+kr-1}$ on the number of the linearly independent holomorphic global sections of $E_{k,m}V^* \bigotimes \mathcal{O}(-m \delta A)$. We formulate and prove the existence of an asymptotic duality along the fibers of the Green-Griffiths jet bundles over projective manifolds. We also prove a Serre duality for asymptotic sections of jet bundles. An application is also given for partial application to the Green-Griffiths conjecture.</description>

      <title>Complete intersection hyperk\"{a}hler fourfolds with respect to equivariant vector bundles over rational homogeneous varieties of Picard number one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13314v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify fourfolds with trivial canonical bundle which are zero loci of general global sections of completely reducible equivariant vector bundles over exceptional homogeneous varieties of Picard number one. By computing their Hodge numbers, we see that there exist no hyperk\"{a}hler fourfolds among them. This implies that a hyperk\"{a}hler fourfold represented as the zero locus of a general global section of a completely reducible equivariant vector bundle over a rational homogeneous variety of Picard number one is one of the two cases described by Beauville--Donagi and Debarre--Voisin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For conformally K\"ahler Riemannian four-manifolds with a Killing field, we present a framework to solve the field equations for generalised gravitational instantons corresponding to conformal self-duality and to cosmological Einstein-Maxwell. After deriving generic identities for the curvature of such manifolds without assuming field equations, we obtain $SU(\infty)$ Toda formulations for the Page-Pope, Plebanski-Demianski, and Chen-Teo classes, we show how to solve the (modified) Toda equation, and we use this to find conformally self-dual and Einstein-Maxwell generalisations of these geometries.</description>

      <title>Index theory for Heisenberg elliptic and transversally Heisenberg elliptic operators from $KK$-theoretic viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06970v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research comprehensively describes the basic theory of transversally Heisenberg elliptic operators, and investigates the index theory of Heisenberg elliptic and transversally Heisenberg elliptic operators from the perspective of $KK$-theory, applying Kasparov's methodology. Moreover, the analysis methodically examines specific conditions, with a focus on the Fourier transform of the nilpotent group $C^{\ast}$-algebra. We demonstrate enhanced methods for analyzing the hypoellipticity of operators, presenting a robust framework for defining and understanding transversal Heisenberg ellipticity in a $KK$-theoretic context. This work provides a solid foundation for future research into the properties of hypoelliptic differential operators in complicated manifolds.</description>

      <title>Submanifolds with corners in Delzant polytopes associated to affine subspaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied the closure of a complex subtorus given from an affine subspace in $\mathfrak{t}^{n} \cong \mathbb{R}^{n}$ in a toric manifold. If the closure of the complex subtorus is a smooth complex submanifold in the toric manifold, then we call such submanifold a torus-equivariantly embedded toric manifold with respect to the subtorus action determined by the data of the affine subspace. In this paper, we construct certain submanifolds with corners in a Delzant polytope of the toric manifold from the affine subspaces and show that the conditions for such submanifolds with corners are equivalent to those for torus-equivariantly embedded toric manifolds.</description>

      <title>Marginally outer trapped tubes in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove two results which are relevant for constructing marginally outer trapped tubes (MOTTs) in de Sitter spacetime. The first one holds more generally, namely for spacetimes satisfying the null convergence condition and containing a timelike conformal Killing vector with a "temporal function". We show that all marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTSs) in such a spacetime are unstable. This prevents application of standard results on the propagation of stable MOTSs to MOTTs. On the other hand, it was shown recently that, for every sufficiently high genus, there exists a smooth, complete family of CMC surfaces embedded in the round 3-sphere S3. This family connects a Lawson minimal surface with a doubly covered geodesic 2-sphere. We show by a simple scaling argument that this result translates to an existence proof for complete MOTTs with CMC sections in de Sitter spacetime. Moreover, the area of these sections increases strictly monotonically. We compare this result with an area law obtained before for holographic screens.</description>

      <title>A mathematical framework of intelligence and consciousness based on Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11024v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding intelligence is a central pursuit in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. Intelligence encompasses learning, problem-solving, creativity, and even consciousness. Recent advancements in geometric analysis have revealed new insights into high-dimensional information representation and organisation, exposing intrinsic data structures and dynamic processes within neural and artificial systems. However, a comprehensive framework that unifies the static and dynamic aspects of intelligence is still lacking. This manuscript proposes a mathematical framework based on Riemannian geometry to describe the structure and dynamics of intelligence and consciousness. Intelligence elements are conceptualised as tokens embedded in a high-dimensional space. The learned token embeddings capture the interconnections of tokens across various scenarios and tasks, forming manifolds in the intelligence space. Thought flow is depicted as the sequential activation of tokens along geodesics within these manifolds. During the navigation of geodesics, consciousness, as a self-referential process, perceives the thought flow, evaluates it against predictions, and provides feedback through prediction errors, adjusting the geodesic: non-zero prediction errors, such as learning, lead to the restructuring of the curved manifolds, thus changing the geodesic of thought flow. This dynamic interaction integrates new information, evolves the geometry and facilitates learning. The geometry of intelligence guides consciousness, and consciousness structures the geometry of intelligence. By integrating geometric concepts, this proposed theory offers a unified, mathematically framework for describing the structure and dynamics of intelligence and consciousness. Applicable to biological and artificial intelligence, this framework may pave the way for future research and empirical validation.</description>

Abstract: We provide an observability inequality in terms of a measurable set for general Gevrey regular functions. As an application, we establish an observability estimate from a measurable set for sums of Laplace eigenfunctions in a compact and connected boundaryless Riemannian manifold that belongs to the Gevrey class. The estimate has an explicit dependence on the maximal eigenvalue.</description>
