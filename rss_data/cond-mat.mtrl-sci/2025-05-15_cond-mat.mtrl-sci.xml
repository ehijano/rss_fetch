      <title>Towards Atomic-Scale Control over Structural Modulations in Quasi-1D Chalcogenides for Colossal Optical Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically anisotropic materials are sought after for tailoring the polarization of light. Recently, colossal optical anisotropy was reported in a quasi-one-dimensional chalcogenide, Sr1.125TiS3. Compared to SrTiS3, the excess Sr in Sr1.125TiS3 leads to periodic structural modulations and introduces additional electrons that undergo charge ordering on select Ti atoms to form a highly polarizable cloud oriented along the c-axis, hence, resulting in the colossolal optical anisotropy. Here, further enhancement of the colossal optical anisotropy to 2.5 in Sr1.143TiS3 is reported through control over the periodicity of the atomic-scale modulations. The role of structural modulations in tuning the optical properties in a series of SrxTiS3 compounds has been investigated using DFT calculations. The structural modulations arise from various stacking sequences of face-sharing TiS6 octahedra and twist-distorted trigonal prisms, and are found to be thermodynamically stable for x larger than 1 but smaller than 1.5. As x increases, an indirect-to-direct band gap transition is predicted for x equal to and larger than 1.143 along with an increased occupancy of Ti-dz2 states. Together, these two factors result in a theoretically predicted maximum birefriengence of 2.5 for Sr1.143TiS3. Single crystals of Sr1.143TiS3 were grown using a molten-salt flux method. Atomic-scale observations using scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm the feasibility of synthesizing SrxTiS3 with varied modulation periodicities. Overall, these findings demonstrate compositonal tunability of optical properties in SrxTiS3 compounds, and potentially in other hexagonal perovskites having structural modulations.</description>

      <title>Geometric Origin of Phonon Magnetic Moment in Dirac Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory for the phonon magnetic moment in doped Dirac materials, treating phonons as emergent gauge and gravitational fields coupled to Dirac fermions in curved space. By classifying electron-phonon coupling into angular momentum channels of Fermi surface deformation, we show that the phonon moment arises from two mechanisms: proportional to the electron Hall conductivity through the emergent gauge field coupling, and to the Hall viscosity through the frame field coupling. Applying our theory to Cd$_3$As$_2$ with first-principles calculations, we find quantitative agreement with experiment. Our results reveal a general mechanism for dynamically generating large phonon magnetism in metals and suggest a new route for probing Hall viscosity via phonon dynamics.</description>

      <title>Tunable and Persistent Polarization in Centrosymmetric Oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introducing symmetry breaking in materials enables the emergence of functionalities. This can be microscopically and macroscopically driven by applying external stimuli such as mechanical stress, electric field, temperature, and chemical modification. For instance, non-zero net dipole moments are formed in a material with the presence of local charged defects or their clusters, which can alter the crystal structure, charge states, and electrostatic potential across the material. Here, we demonstrate a conceptual approach to defects-mediated symmetry breaking that allows for built-in polarization in a centrosymmetric oxide, $\mathrm{Gd}_x\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x}\mathrm{O}_{2-\delta}$ (CGO) films, via creating a macroscopic charge asymmetry. Our results show that switchable and enduring polarization in CGO films is governed by the redistribution of oxygen vacancies. This leads to notable and persistent pyroelectric effects with coefficient of approximately 180 $\mu\mathrm{C}\cdot\mathrm{m}^{-2}\cdot\mathrm{K}^{-1}$. Our findings highlight the potential to develop high-performance, sustainable, environmentally friendly polar film materials by manipulating ionic defects from their centrosymmetric ground states. This approach provides new opportunities to expand polar materials in current and future energy and electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Emergent chirality and enantiomeric selectivity in layered NbOX$_2$ crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous emergence of chirality in crystalline solids has profound implications for electronic, optical, and topological properties, making the control of chiral phases a central challenge in materials design. Here, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of a new family of layered compounds, $\mathrm{NbOX_2}$, and explore the connection between their achiral $I m m m$ phase and chiral $C 2$ phase. Through first-principles calculations, we identify an intermediate achiral $C 2/m$ phase that bridges the high- and low-symmetry phases within a three-dimensional order parameter space. The insulating $C 2$ phase exhibits unique electronic properties, including flat Niobium $d$-orbital bands near the Fermi level associated with an obstructed atomic limit (OAL), hosting topologically non-trivial surface states under specific cleavage conditions. By analyzing the Born-Oppenheimer energy surfaces (BOES), we find that the shallow energy minima of the $C 2$ phase suggest that the intermediate $C 2/m$ phase may be stabilized either by ionic quantum or thermal fluctuations, and the consequent lattice anharmonicity, or by external factors such as pressure. Additionally, we show how an external electric field, by breaking the necessary symmetries, biases the system toward a preferred chirality by lifting the energy degeneracy between the two enantiomers. This, combined with the small energy barrier between the enantiomers in the $C 2$ phase, enables handedness control and allows us to propose a mechanism for selective handedness stabilization by leveraging electric fields and temperature-dependent anharmonic effects. Our findings establish a framework for understanding chirality emergence in layered materials and offer a pathway for designing systems with tunable enantiomeric populations.</description>

      <title>Lean CNNs for mapping electron charge density fields to material properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a lean CNN (convolutional neural network) framework, with a drastically reduced number of fittable parameters (&lt;81K) compared to the benchmarks in current literature, to capture the underlying low-computational cost (i.e., surrogate) relationships between the electron charge density (ECD) fields and their associated effective properties. These lean CNNs are made possible by adding a pre-processing step (i.e., a feature engineering step) that involves the computation of the ECD fields' spatial correlations (specifically, 2-point spatial correlations). The viability and benefits of the proposed lean CNN framework are demonstrated by establishing robust structure-property relationships involving the prediction of effective material properties using the feature-engineered ECD fields as the only input. The framework is evaluated on a dataset of crystalline cubic systems consisting of 1410 molecular structures spanning 62 different elemental species and 3 space groups.</description>

      <title>Strain-Gradient and Curvature-Induced Changes in Domain Morphology of BaTiO3 Nanorods: Experimental and Theoretical Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of OH- ions incorporation on the lattice strain and spontaneous polarization of BaTiO3 nanorods synthesized under different conditions. It was confirmed that the lattice strain depends directly on Ba supersaturation, with higher supersaturation leading to an increase in the lattice strain. However, it was shown that crystal growth and observed lattice distortion are not primarily influenced by external strain; rather, OH- ions incorporation plays a key role in generating internal chemical strains and driving these processes. By using the less reactive TiO2 precursor instead of TiOCl2 and controlling Ba supersaturation, the slower nucleation rate enables more effective regulation of OH- ions incorporation and crystal growth. This in turn effects both particle size and lattice distortion, leading to c/a ratio of 1.013 - 1.014. The incorporation of OH- ions induces lattice elongation along the c-axis, contributing to anisotropic growth, increasing of the rod diameter and their growth-induced bending. However, the possibility of the curvature-induced changes in domain morphology of BaTiO3 nanorods remains almost unexplored. To study the possibility, we perform analytical calculations and finite element modeling, which provide insights into the curvature-induced changes in the strain-gradient, polarization distribution, and domain morphology in BaTiO3 nanorods. Theoretical results reveal the appearance of the domain stripes in BaTiO3 nanorod when the curvature exceeds a critical angle. The physical origin of the domain stripes emergence is the tendency to minimize its elastic energy of the nanorod by the domain splitting. These findings suggest that BaTiO3 nanorods, with curvature-controllable amount of domain stripes, could serve as flexible race-track memory elements for flexo-tronics and domain-wall electronics.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning Atomistic Pseudopotential Model for Nanomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semi-empirical pseudopotential method (SEPM) has been widely applied to provide computational insights into the electronic structure, photophysics, and charge carrier dynamics of nanoscale materials. We present "DeepPseudopot", a machine-learned atomistic pseudopotential model that extends the SEPM framework by combining a flexible neural network representation of the local pseudopotential with parameterized non-local and spin-orbit coupling terms. Trained on bulk quasiparticle band structures and deformation potentials from GW calculations, the model captures many-body and relativistic effects with very high accuracy across diverse semiconducting materials, as illustrated for silicon and group III-V semiconductors. DeepPseudopot's accuracy, efficiency, and transferability make it well-suited for data-driven in silico design and discovery of novel optoelectronic nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Identifying Non-van der Waals 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are categorized into van der Waals (vdW) and non-vdW types. However, no relevant descriptors have been proposed for identifying the latter. Here, we identify the non-vdW 2D materials by calculating the thickness-dependence of total energy of thin films truncated from surfaces. The non-vdW 2D materials exhibit a deviation from the law of exfoliation energy inverse to the number of layers in the monolayer limit. This framework is applied to explore single- and multi-component systems, which predicts the synthesizability of several non-vdW 2D materials including silicene and goldene that are overlooked in the dimensional analysis of the parent crystals and also predicts that a Janus structure exists in nature but is hidden in 3D crystals.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced gyrotropic effects in ferroelectric BaTiS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gyrotropic effects, including natural optical activity (NOA) and the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect (NAHE), are crucial for advancing optical and transport devices. We explore these effects in the BaTiS3 system, a quasi-one-dimensional crystal that exhibits giant optical anisotropy. (Niu et al. Nat. Photonics 12, 392 (2018); Zhao et al. Chem. Mater. 34, 5680 (2022)). In the P63cm phase which is stable under room temperature, we predict two distinct strain-induced phase transitions: a symmetry-lowering transition from the P63cm to P63 phase under tensile strain, which enhances NOA and enables optical rotation; and an isostructural insulator-to-polar Weyl semimetal (WSM) transition under compressive strain, which activates the NAHE and exhibits a strain-induced sign reversal. The low-temperature P21 phase also transforms into a P212121 phase under enough compressive strains with such phase transition exhibiting a large NOA. All these results highlight BaTiS3 as a viable candidate for novel ferroelectrics, optical and transport devices with strain enhanced or activated gyrotropic properties.</description>

      <title>Complex electronic topography and magnetotransport in an in-plane ferromagnetic kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intricate interplay between flat bands, Dirac cones, and magnetism in kagome materials has recently attracted significant attention from materials scientists, particularly in compounds belonging to the RMn6Sn6 family (R = Sc, Y, rare earths), due to their inherent magnetic frustration. Here, we present a detailed investigation of the ferromagnetic (FM) kagome magnet ScMn6(Sn0.78Ga0.22)6 using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), magnetotransport measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our findings reveal a paramagnetic-to-FM transition at 375 K, with the in-plane direction serving as the easy magnetization axis. Notably, ARPES measurements reveal a Dirac cone near the Fermi energy, while the Hall resistivity exhibits a substantial contribution from the anomalous Hall effect. Additionally, we observe a flat band spanning a substantial portion of the Brillouin zone, arising from the destructive interference of wave functions in the Mn kagome lattice. Theoretical calculations reveal that the gap in the Dirac cone can be modulated by altering the orientation of the magnetic moment. An out-of-plane orientation produces a gap of approximately 15 meV, while an in-plane alignment leads to a gapless state, as corroborated by ARPES measurements. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the electronic structure of magnetic kagome materials and paves the way for exploring novel topological phases in this material class.</description>

      <title>Coupling between magnetism and band structure in a 2D semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals semiconducting magnets exhibit a cornucopia of physical phenomena originating from the interplay of their semiconducting and magnetic properties. However, a comprehensive understanding of how semiconducting processes and magnetism are coupled is lacking. We address this question by performing scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements on the magnetic semiconductor CrPS$_4$, and by comparing the results to photoluminescence experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Below the magnetic transition, STS exhibit multiple features absent in the paramagnetic state, caused by the proliferation of electronic bands due to spin splitting with a large ($\simeq 0.5$ eV) exchange energy. The energetic differences between the band edges determined by STS match all observed photoluminescence transitions, which also proliferate in the magnetic state. DFT calculations quantitatively predict the relative positions of all detected bands, explain which pairs of bands lead to radiative transitions, and also reproduce the measured spatial dependence of electronic wavefunctions. Our results reveal how all basic optoelectronic processes observed in CrPS$_4$ can be understood in terms of the evolution of the electronic band structure when entering the magnetic state, and allow us to conclude that individual bands are fully spin-polarized over a broad energy interval.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast excitation of polar skyrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unraveling collective modes arising from coupled degrees of freedom is crucial for understanding complex interactions in solids and developing new functionalities. Unique collective behaviors emerge when two degrees of freedom, ordered on distinct length scales, interact. Polar skyrmions, three-dimensional electric polarization textures in ferroelectric superlattices, disrupt the lattice continuity at the nanometer scale with nontrivial topology, leading to previously unexplored collective modes. Here, using terahertz-field excitation and femtosecond x-ray diffraction, we discovered subterahertz collective modes, dubbed 'skyrons', which appear as swirling patterns of atomic displacements functioning as atomic-scale gearsets. Momentum-resolved time-domain measurements of diffuse scattering revealed an avoided crossing in the dispersion relation of skyrons. We further demonstrated that the amplitude and dispersion of skyrons can be controlled by sample temperature and electric-field bias. Atomistic simulations and dynamical phase-field modeling provided microscopic insights into the three-dimensional crystallographic and polarization dynamics. The discovery of skyrons and their coupling with terahertz fields opens avenues for ultrafast control of topological polar structures.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigations of electronic and optical properties of double perovskite Cs$_2$Tl$BX_6$ ($B=$ Bi, In; $X=$ Cl, Br, I) for photovoltaic application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-free double perovskites are gaining attention for photovoltaic (PV) applications due to their long carrier lifetimes, tunable bandgaps, and low toxicity. Using first-principles calculations, we studied the structural, electronic and optical properties of Cs$_2$Tl$BX_6$ ($B=$ Bi, In; $X=$ Cl, Br, I). The cubic phase (space group Fm3m) was analyzed within the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method. Our calculations predict direct bandgaps of 1.9-1.2 eV for Cs$_2$TlBi$X_6$ and indirect bandgaps of 2.4--0.8 eV for Cs$_2$TlIn$X_6$. Notably, the bandgap energy decreases with anion substitution from Cl to I, making these materials highly active in the near-infrared to visible light range. We reveal that Cs$_2$TlBi$X_6$ exhibits the highest optical absorption, with a peak value of $5\times10^5$ cm$^{-1}$ at an incident photon energy of 3 eV. Additionally, we evaluated the transport properties using the Boltzmann transport equations. The results indicate that Cs$_2$TlBi$X_6$ exhibit high electrical conductivity, reaching $8\times10^6$ S/m, and high electron mobility of 120 cm$^2/$V.s. PV performance analysis further reveals promising power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of up to 42\%, with Cs$_2$TlBi$X_6$ showing significantly higher PCE than Cs$_2$TlIn$X_6$. These reports highlight the potential of Cs$_2$TlBi$X_6$ for advanced photovoltaic devices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced coercive force of nanoparticles of special morphology in the Stoner-Wohlfarth model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have found an unusual effect of increasing the coercive force in the Stoner-Wohlfarth model applied to magnetic nanoparticles of a special morphology. The particles consist of a ferromagnetic single-domain core surrounding by a magnetically soft shell. We have studied thoroughly individual and collective properties of these particles both through numerical calculations and analytical analysis. Fairly accurate approximate analytical formulas have been obtained for determining magnetization, hysteresis loop, coercive force, and other magnetic properties of the particles. The physical reason of the coercivity enhancement effect is the magnetic screening of a particle core by its shell. We have found the unambiguous conditions necessary for the existence of this effect. The large magnetization and moderate magnetic anisotropy of the core favor the effect of the coercivity enhancement.</description>

      <title>QR$^2$-code: An open-source program for double resonance Raman spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-source program, QR$^2$-code, that computes double-resonance Raman (DRR) spectra using first-principles calculations. QR$^2$-code can calculate not only two-phonon DRR spectra but also single-resonance Raman spectra and defect-induced DRR spectra. For defect-induced DDR spectra, we simply assume that the electron-defect matrix element of elastic scattering is a constant. Hands-on tutorials for graphene are given to show how to run QR$^2$-code for single-resonance, double-resonance, and defect-induced Raman spectra. We also compare the single-resonance Raman spectra by QR$^2$-code with that by QERaman code. In QR$^2$-code, the energy dispersions of electron and phonon are taken from Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) code, and the electron-phonon matrix element is obtained from the electron-phonon Wannier (EPW) code. All codes, examples, and scripts are available on the GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Mediated Electron-Electron Interactions: Renormalizing Dirac States in Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding materials in optical cavities has emerged as a strategy for tuning material properties. Accurate simulations of electrons in materials interacting with quantum photon fluctuations of a cavity are crucial for understanding and predicting cavity-induced phenomena. In this article, we develop a non-perturbative quantum electrodynamical approach based on a photon-free self-consistent Hartree-Fock framework to model the coupling between electrons and cavity photons in crystalline materials. We apply this theoretical approach to investigate graphene coupled to the vacuum field fluctuations of cavity photon modes with different types of polarizations. The cavity photons introduce nonlocal electron-electron interactions, originating from the quantum nature of light, that lead to significant renormalization of the Dirac bands. In contrast to the case of graphene coupled to a classical circularly polarized light field, where a topological Dirac gap emerges, the nonlocal interactions induced by a quantum linearly polarized photon mode give rise to the formation of flat bands and the opening of a topologically trivial Dirac gap. When two symmetric cavity photon modes are introduced, Dirac cones remain gapless, but a Fermi velocity renormalization yet indicates the relevant role of nonlocal interactions. These effects disappear in the classical limit for coherent photon modes. This new self-consistent theoretical framework paves the way for the simulation of non-perturbative quantum effects in strongly coupled light-matter systems, and allows for a more comprehensive discovery of novel cavity-induced quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Alkali Intercalation of Moire Heterostructures for Low-Loss Plasmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional metals generically support gapless plasmons with wavelengths well below the wavelength of free-space radiation at the same frequency. Typically, however, this substantial confinement of electromagnetic energy is associated with commensurately high losses, and mitigating such losses may only be achieved through judicious band structure engineering near the Fermi level. In a clean system, an isolated, moderately flat, band at the Fermi level with sufficiently high carrier density can support a plasmon that is immune to propagation losses up to some order in the electron-phonon interaction. However, proposed materials that satisfy these criteria have been ferromagnetic, structurally unstable, or otherwise difficult to fabricate. Here, we propose a class of band structure engineered materials that evade these typical pitfalls -- Moire heterostructures of hexagonal boron nitride intercalated with alkali atoms. We find that only sodium atoms engender a sufficiently isolated band with plasmons lossless at first order in the electron-phonon interaction. We calculate higher order electron-phonon losses and find that at frequencies of about $1$eV the electron-phonon decay mechanism is negligible -- leading to a contribution to the decay rate of about 10^7 Hz in a small frequency range. We next calculate losses from the electron-electron interaction and find that this is the dominant process -- leading plasmons to decay to lower frequency plasmons at a rate of around 10^14 Hz.</description>

      <title>Giant spin-to-charge conversion in germanium tin epilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a study of the spin-to-charge current conversion in compressively strained Ge1-xSnx alloy epilayers as a function of the Sn concentration by means of the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). The spin current is generated by spin-pumping effect (SPE) from a thin NiFe layer driven into ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). By simultaneously measuring the magnetic damping of the NiFe layer and the ISHE-induced charge current we extract two key spintronics parameters: the spin Hall angle and the effective spin mixing conductance. Our results reveal a giant spin-to-charge conversion and a non-monotonic dependence of the charge current signal on the Sn concentration, consistent with the variation in the magnetic damping observed in FMR. The values of spin Hall angle are comparable to those reported for heavy metals such as Pt and Ta. Furthermore, we show that the spin conductivity at the Au/GeSn interface can be enhanced by tuning the Sn concentration.</description>

      <title>Sensing a magnetic rare-earth surface alloy by proximity effect with an open-shell nanographene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-shell nanographenes have attracted significant attention due to their structurally tunable spin ground state. While most characterization has been conducted on weakly-interacting substrates such as noble metals, the influence of magnetic surfaces remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate how TbAu2, a rare-earth-element-based surface alloy, affects the magnetic properties of phenalenyl (or [2]triangulene (2T)), the smallest spin-1/2 nanographene. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements reveal a striking contrast: while 2T on Au(111) exhibits a zero-bias Kondo resonance - a hallmark of a spin-1/2 impurity screened by the conduction electrons of the underlying metal - deposition on TbAu2 induces a symmetric splitting of this feature by approximately 20 mV. We attribute this splitting to a strong proximity-induced interaction with the ferromagnetic out-of-plane magnetization of TbAu2. Moreover, our combined experimental and first-principles analysis demonstrates that this interaction is spatially modulated, following the periodicity of the TbAu2 surface superstructure. These findings highlight that TbAu2 serves as a viable platform for stabilizing and probing the magnetic properties of spin-1/2 nanographenes, opening new avenues for the integration of {\pi}-magnetic materials with magnetic substrates.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Calculation of Spin-Relaxation Due to Alloy and Electron-Phonon Scattering in Strained GeSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GeSn has emerged as a promising material for spintronics due to its long spin-lifetime, compatibility with silicon technology, high mobility and tunable electronic properties. Of particular interest is the transition from an indirect to a direct band gap with increasing Sn content, which enhances optical properties, electron transport and we find also affects spin transport behaviour, which is critical for spintronics applications. We use first-principles electronic-structure theory to determine the spin-flip electron-alloy scattering parameters in n-type GeSn alloys. We also calculate the previously undetermined intervalley electron spin-phonon scattering parameters between the $L$ and $\Gamma$ valleys. These parameters are used to determine the electron-alloy and electron-phonon scattering contributions to the n-type spin-relaxation of GeSn, as a function of alloy content and temperature. As in the case of phonon scattering, alloy scattering reduces the spin-relaxation time. However, switching the spin transport from the typical $L$ valley of Ge to the $\Gamma$ valley by sufficient addition of Sn, the relaxation time can be substantially increased. For unstrained, room temperature GeSn, we find a Sn concentration of at least $10\%$ is required to achieve a spin-relaxation time greater than Ge, with $17\%$ Sn needed to increase the spin-relaxation time from the nanosecond range to the microsecond range. At low temperatures (30K), adding $10\%$ Sn can increase the spin-relaxation time from $10^{-7}$s to 0.1s. Applying biaxial tensile strain to GeSn further increases the spin-relaxation time and at a lower Sn content than in unstrained GeSn.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the role of LiBr as redox mediator in Li-O2 Aprotic Batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-oxygen batteries are among the most promising energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density, but their practical implementation is hindered by poor reversibility and parasitic reactions. Redox mediators such as LiBr have emerged as a strategy to enhance reaction kinetics and reduce overpotentials. In this study, we explore the impact of three different solvents, dimethoxyethane (DME), tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), on the electrochemical performance and reaction pathways of LiBr-mediated Li-O2 cells. Our results reveal that a 1O2 evolution channel that leads to singlet oxygen-induced cell degradation is active only in the TEGDME-based electrolyte. Both DME and DMSO allow singlet oxygen-free Oxygen Evolution Reaction, but only DME is found chemically stable in the LiBr-mediated Li-O2 cell working conditions. These findings highlight the critical role of solvent-mediator interactions in determining the performance of Li-O2 cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover a new class of dynamical quantum instability in driven magnets leading to emergent enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations even for purely ferromagnetic microscopic couplings. A primary parametric amplification creates a frequency-tuned nested magnon distribution in momentum space, which seeds a secondary instability marked by the emergence of enhanced antiferromagnetic correlations, mirroring Fermi surface nesting instabilities in electronic systems. In sharp contrast to the fermionic case, however, the magnon-driven instability is intrinsically non-equilibrium and fundamentally inaccessible in thermal physics. Its quantum mechanical origin sets it apart from classical instabilities such as Faraday and modulation instabilities, which underlie several instances of dynamical behavior observed in magnetic and cold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Computational screening and experimental validation of promising Wadsley-Roth Niobates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for efficient, high-capacity energy storage systems has driven extensive research into advanced materials for lithium-ion batteries. Among the various candidates, Wadsley-Roth (WR) niobates have emerged as a promising class of materials for fast Li+ storage due to rapid ion diffusion within their ReO3-like blocks in combination with good electronic conductivity along the shear planes. Despite the remarkable features of WR phases, there are presently less than 30 known structures which limits identification of structure-property relationships for improved performance as well as the identification of phases with more earth-abundant elements. In this work, we have dramatically expanded the set of potentially (meta)stable compositions (with $\Delta$ Hd &lt; 22 meV/atom) to 1301 (out of 3283) through high-throughput screening with density functional theory (DFT). This large space of compound was generated through single- and double-site substitution into 10 known WR-niobate prototypes using 48 elements across the periodic table. To confirm the structure predictions, we successfully synthesized and validated with X-ray diffraction a new material, MoWNb24O66. The measured lithium diffusivity in MoWNb24O66 has a peak value of 1.0x10-16 m2/s at 1.45 V vs. Li/Li+ and achieved 225 mAh/g at 5C. Thus a computationally predicted phase was realized experimentally with performance exceeding Nb16W5O55, a recent WR benchmark. Overall, the computational dataset of potentially stable novel compounds and with one realized that has competitive performance provide a valuable guide for experimentalists in discovering new durable battery materials.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature structural instabilities of the halide double perovskite Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ investigated via x-ray diffraction and infrared phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The halide double perovskite Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ has been proposed as a potential replacement for organic halide perovskites for photovoltaic applications. Further investigation of its dielectric response, optical properties and structural stability is thus warranted. Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$ exhibits a well-documented structural phase transition at 120 K but indications for an additional lower temperature ($\sim$40 K) phase transition have also been reported. On the basis of measurements of the specific heat capacity, temperature dependent powder X-ray diffraction, low frequency capacitance, and infrared reflectivity we clarify the previously reported splitting of phonon modes in the Raman spectrum at $\sim$40 K as due to a subtle structural phase transition from the tetragonal I4/m structure to a monoclinic $P12_1$/$n1$ crystal structure. The infrared active vibrational modes are experimentally investigated in the three structural regimes. In the cubic structure at room temperature the four IR active modes are observed at 135,$\sim$95, 55, and $\sim$25 cm$^{-1}$, as the symmetry reduces to tetragonal a minute splitting of these modes is expected, however below 40 K an additional mode is observed indicating a further reduction in symmetry.</description>

      <title>Stable Real-Space Invariants and Topology Beyond Symmetry Indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that certain band gaps, which appear topologically trivial from the perspective of symmetry indicators (SIs), must instead be topological, as guaranteed by real-space information that follows from Topological Quantum Chemistry (TQC). To address this, we introduce stable real-space invariants (SRSIs) that generalize the previously discovered local and composite real-space invariants to global topological invariants of a given set of bands. These are linear combinations of Wannier state multiplicities at Wyckoff positions and take the form of $\mathbb{Z}$- and $\mathbb{Z}_n$-valued quantities ($n=2,4$). We enumerate all $\mathbb{Z}$SRSIs and $\mathbb{Z}_n$SRSIs in all non-magnetic space groups (SGs) with and without spin-orbit coupling. SRSIs fully diagnose the stable equivalence of atomic insulators, ensuring that two atomic insulators with matching SRSIs are adiabatically deformable to one another in the presence of auxiliary trivial bands. For both atomic and topological bands, $\mathbb{Z}$SRSIs are determined by the momentum-space symmetry data and thus determine the SIs. $\mathbb{Z}_n$SRSIs provide additional information about trivial band structures not captured by momentum-space data. While split elementary band representations (EBRs), where the bands forming an EBR split into disconnected parts, must induce band topology, there are 211 cases across 51 SGs where the momentum-space data of an EBR decomposes linearly with positive integer coefficients into those of other EBRs. We demonstrate that $\mathbb{Z}_n$SRSIs successfully identify the band topology in the majority of these split EBR cases, diagnosing all but 8 cases in 5 SGs. Our results solidify the conceptual framework of TQC as containing, but going beyond, SIs and momentum-space symmetry data.</description>

      <title>Gapless spinon excitations emerging from a multipolar transverse field in the triangular-lattice Ising antiferromagnet NaTmSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The triangular-lattice quantum Ising antiferromagnet is a promising platform for realizing Anderson's quantum spin liquid, though finding suitable materials to realize it remains a challenge. Here, we present a comprehensive study of NaTmSe2 using magnetization, specific heat, neutron scattering, and muon spin relaxation, combined with theoretical calculations. We demonstrate that NaTmSe2 realizes the transverse field Ising model and quantitatively determine its exchange parameters. Our results reveal a multipolar spin-polarized state coexisting with a dipolar spin-disordered state. These states feature gapless spinon excitations mediated by the multipolar moments. The study shows how multiple types of magnetism can emerge in distinct magnetic channels (dipolar and multipolar) within a single magnet, advancing our understanding of spin-frustrated Ising physics and opening pathways for different quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of reactive oxygen species produced by the COST microplasma jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study is focused on measuring the densities of the excited molecular oxygen species, O$_{2}(\text{a}^{1}\Delta_{\text{g}})$ and O$_{2}(\text{b}^{1}\Sigma_{\text{g}}^{+})$, produced in a COST atmospheric pressure plasma jet using a helium-oxygen mixture. Knowledge of the ozone density is critical for measurements because of its high quenching rate of these species. Additionally O$_{2}(\text{a}^{1}\Delta_{\text{g}})$ is difficult to measure, due to its low emission intensity and sensitivity to background interference in the plasma region. Therefore a flow cell was used to enhance signal detection in the effluent region. To validate the measurements and improve understanding of reaction mechanisms, results were compared with two simulation models: a pseudo-1D plug flow simulation and a 2D fluid simulation. The plug flow simulation provided an effective means for estimating species densities, with a fast computation time. The 2D simulation offered a more realistic description of the flow dynamics, which proved critical to correctly describe the experimental trends. However, it requires long computation times to reach an equilibrium state in the flow cell. Otherwise, it leads to discrepancies to the experimental data. Further discrepancies arose, from an overestimation of the ozone density from the models, as validated from the O$_{2}(\text{b}^{1}\Sigma_{\text{g}}^{+})$ density measurements. Optimizing the reaction rate coefficients for the effluent region might improve the agreement with the experimental results. Despite these limitations both simulations aligned reasonably well with experimental data, showcasing the well validated plasma chemistry of the models, even for complicated effluent geometries.</description>

      <title>Metal oxide decoration on Si-FETs for selective gas sensing at room temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal oxide semiconductors have been thoroughly studied for gas sensing applications due to the electrical transduction phenomenon in the presence of gaseous analytes. The chemiresistive sensors prevalent in the applications have several challenges associated with them inclusive of instability, longevity, temperature/humidity sensitivity, and power consumption due to the need of heaters. Herein, we present a silicon field effect transistor-based gas sensor functionalized with CuO. The oxidized Cu thin film acts as a selective room temperature H2S sensor with impressive response and recovery. Using this methodology, we propose a standalone compact enose based on our results for a wide spectrum of gas detection.</description>

Abstract: Quasicrystals have been observed in a variety of materials ranging from metal alloys to block copolymers. However, their structural and dynamical properties cannot be readily described in terms of conventional solid-state models of liquids and solids. We may expect the dynamics of this specific class of quasicrystalline materials to be more like glass-forming liquids in the sense of exhibiting large fluctuations in the local mobility ("dynamic heterogeneity") and non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of relaxation and diffusion. In this work, we investigate a model dodecagonal quasicrystal material in two dimensions (2D) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with a focus on heterogeneous dynamics and non-Arrhenius relaxation and diffusion. As observed in glass-forming liquids and heated crystals, we observe a two-stage relaxation dynamics in the self-intermediate scattering function $F_s(k,t)$ of our quasicrystal material. It involves a fast $\beta$-relaxation and $\alpha$ relaxation process having a highly temperature dependent relaxation time whose activation energy varies in concert with the extent of string-like collective motion, a phenomenon recognized to occur in glass-forming liquids at low temperatures and crystalline materials at elevated temperatures. After examining the dynamics of our dodecagonal quasicrystalline material in great detail, we conclude that the dynamics of these materials more closely resembles observations on metallic glass-forming liquids than crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Unconventional domain tessellations in moir\'e-of-moir\'e lattices</title>

Abstract: Imposing incommensurable periodicity on the periodic atomic lattice can lead to complex structural phases consisting of locally periodic structure bounded by topological defects. Twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) is an ideal material platform to study the interplay between different atomic periodicities, which can be tuned by twist angles between the layers, leading to moir\'e-of-moir\'e lattices. Interlayer and intralayer interactions between two interfaces in TTG transform this moir\'e-of-moir\'e lattice into an intricate network of domain structures at small twist angles, which can harbor exotic electronic behaviors. Here we report a complete structural phase diagram of TTG with atomic scale lattice reconstruction. Using transmission electron microscopy combined with a new interatomic potential simulation, we show several large-scale moir\'e lattices, including triangular, kagome, and a corner-shared hexagram-shaped domain pattern. Each domain is bounded by a two-dimensional network of domain wall lattices. In the limit of small twist angles, two competing structural orders-rhombohedral and Bernal stackings-with a slight energy difference, cause unconventional lattice reconstruction with spontaneous symmetry breaking and nematic instability, highlighting the importance of long-range interlayer interactions across entire van der Waals layers. The diverse tessellation of distinct domains, whose topological network can be tuned by the adjustment of the twist angles, establishes TTG as a platform for exploring the interplay between emerging quantum properties and controllable nontrivial lattices.</description>

      <title>Generation of Weyl points and a nodal line by magnetization reorientation in Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological magnets exhibit fascinating properties like topologically protected surface states or anomalous transport phenomena. While these properties can be significantly altered by manipulating the magnetic state, the experimental verification of such predictions remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the efficient magnetic field control of the Weyl semimetallic state of the collinear ferromagnet Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ by magneto-optical spectroscopy. We resolve a redshift of the nodal loop resonance as the magnetization is rotated into the kagome plane by the magnetic field. Our material-specific theory, capturing the observed field-induced spectral reconstruction, shows the creation of 26 Weyl points for one in-plane magnetization direction and predicts the emergence of a gapless nodal loop for the orthogonal in-plane magnetization orientation. These findings demonstrate that while topological band structures are generally considered robust, breaking underlying crystal symmetries with external fields provides an efficient way to manipulate them, even in collinear magnets. This approach opens exciting avenues to control band topology also in materials with more complex magnetic structures and even to study the interplay of real- and momentum-space topological states, e.g. in skyrmion-lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced magnetic dichroism in darkfield UV photoemission electron microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) has evolved into an indispensable tool for structural and magnetic characterization of surfaces at the nanometer scale. In strong contrast to synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray PEEM as a leading method for element-specific magnetic properties via magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), laboratory ultraviolet (UV) PEEM has seen limited application with much smaller dichroism effects for in-plane magnetization. Here we introduce darkfield PEEM as a novel approach to enhance MCD contrast in threshold photoemission, enabling efficient MCD imaging with significantly enhanced contrast by an order-of-magnitude for Fe(001). This advancement paves the way for MCD imaging on femtosecond timescales using modern lasers. The experimental results will be quantitatively benchmarked against advanced relativistic photoemission calculations.</description>

      <title>Inversion of Dislocation-Impurity Interactions in $\alpha$-Fe under Magnetic State Changes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dislocation-impurity interaction energies and their profiles for various \textit{3d} elements \textemdash V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Ni, and Co \textemdash in and around $1/2\langle111\rangle$ screw dislocations in $\alpha$-Fe using \textit{ab initio} methods. We consider the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states, with the latter being modeled through both the disordered local moment model and a spin-wave approach. Our findings reveal that (1) magnetic effects are large compared to size misfit effects of substitutional impurities, and (2) dislocation-impurity interactions are dependent on the magnetic state of the matrix and thermal lattice expansion. In particular, Cu changes from core-attractive in the ferromagnetic state to repulsive in the paramagnetic state.</description>

      <title>Stress-induced phase transformations in Ti-15Mo alloy at elevated temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlled mechanical loading was applied to Ti-15Mo alloy during annealing at 550 $^\circ$C. Massive formation of the $\omega_{\textrm{iso}}$ phase from the parent $\beta$-phase occurred during annealing at 550 $^\circ$C without external stress or with stress well below the yield stress. Moreover, a massive $\alpha$ phase precipitation takes place under simultaneous annealing and plastic deformation. Plastic deformation plays a key role in $\beta\rightarrow\alpha$ transformation and achieving refined $\alpha+\beta$ type microstructure resulted in improved mechanical properties. Studying phase transformations during plastic deformation is critical for understanding and optimizing thermomechanical processing of metastable $\beta$-Ti alloys.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties from an efficient analytical representation of the $GW$ self-energy within a multipole approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an efficient analytical representation of the frequency-dependent $GW$ self-energy $\Sigma$ via a multipole approximation (MPA-$\Sigma$). The multipole-Pad\'e model for the self-energy is interpolated from a small set of numerical evaluations of $\Sigma$ in the complex frequency plane, similarly to the previously multipole representation developed for the screened Coulomb interaction (MPA-$W$) [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, 115157 (2021)]. We show that, likewise MPA-$W$, an appropriate choice of frequency sampling in MPA-$\Sigma$ is critical to guarantee computational efficiency and high accuracy. The combined MPA-$W$ and MPA-$\Sigma$ scheme considerably reduces the cost of full-frequency self-energy calculations, especially for spectral band structures over a wide energy range. Crucially, MPA-$\Sigma$ enables a multipole representation for the interacting Green's function $G$ (MPA-$G$), providing a straightforward evaluation of all the spectral properties, and a more general way to define the renormalization factor $Z$. We validate the MPA-$\Sigma$ and MPA-$G$ approaches for diverse systems: bulk Si, Na and Cu, monolayer MoS$_2$, the NaCl ion-pair and the F$_2$ molecule. Moreover, we introduce toy MPA-$\Sigma$/$G$ models to examine the quasiparticle picture in different regimens of weak and strong correlation. With these models, we expose limitations in defining $Z$ from the local derivative of $\Sigma$.</description>

Abstract: This report presents a new technique to probe the quantitative dynamical response of the magnetic field induced heating/cooling process in rare-earth vanadium materials. The approach combines AC susceptibility and AC caloric measurements to reveal the intrinsic timescale associated with the magnetic relaxation process of rare-earth ions at low temperatures. Utilizing the well-known crystal field effect in YbVO4, we prove and demonstrate a discretized thermal analysis through a common spin-lattice relaxation phenomenon. The demonstration experiment presented in this study provides a general approach to quantitatively address multiple measured quantities in one unified discretized thermal circuit analysis. It can be extended to study other magnetic, dielectric, and elastic materials exhibiting a complex response to an external driving field in the presence of intrinsic interactions and fluctuations, particularly when an energy dissipation process is within an accessible frequency regime.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic type-II Multiferroics with N\'{e}el-order-locked Electric Polarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, an emergent magnetic phase featuring compensated collinear magnetic moments and momentum-dependent spin splittings, has recently garnered widespread interest. A critical issue concerns whether the unconventional spin structures can generate spontaneous electric polarization in altermagnets, thereby achieving type-II multiferroicity. Here, with the combination of symmetry analysis and microscopic theory, we explicitly demonstrate the generation of electric polarization by altermagnetic N\'eel order, and establish a microscopic mechanism of N\'eel-order-locked electric polarization in altermagnetic multiferroics.~We further reveal these pronounced magnetoelectric coupling behaviors and classify them into eight distinct categories for two-dimensional altermagnets governed by layer group symmetries. Then we take monolayer MgFe$_2$N$_2$ as a prototypical example of altermagnetic type-II multiferroics by first-principles calculations. We also propose to identify the N\'eel order and accompanying electric polarization in altermagnetic multiferroics by magneto-optical microscopy. Bridging type-II multiferroics and altermagnets, our work could pave the way for altermagnetic multifunctional spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuum models of plasticity fail to capture the richness of microstructural evolution because the continuum is a homogeneous construction. The present study shows that an alternative way is available at the mesoscale in the form of truly discrete constructions and in the discrete exterior calculus. A pre-existing continuum mean-field model with two parameters is rewritten in the language of the latter to model the properties of a network of plastic slip events in a perfect copper single crystal under uniaxial tension. The behaviour of the system is simulated in a triangular 2D mesh in 3D space employing a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Phases of distinct character emerge and both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed. The phases can be interpreted as representing crystallographic phenomena like cross-slip, strain localisation and partial dislocations. The first-order transitions mostly occur as functions of the applied stress, while the second-order transitions occur exclusively as functions of the mean-field coupling parameter. The former are reminiscent of transitions in other statistical-mechanical models, while the latter find parallels in experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Understanding Decoherence of the Boron Vacancy Center in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a significant material for quantum sensing, particularly due to its ability to host spin active defects, such as the negatively charged boron vacancy (V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center). The optical addressability of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center and hBN's 2D structure enable high spatial resolution and integration into various platforms. However, decoherence due to the strong magnetic noise in hBN imposes fundamental limitations on the sensitivity of V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center-based applications. Understanding the phenomena behind decoherence and identifying parameter settings that provide the highest performance are essential for advancing V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ sensors. This study employs state-of-the-art computational methods to investigate the decoherence of the V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ center in hexagonal boron nitride across a wide range of magnetic field values from 0 T up to 3 T. The provided in-depth numerical and analytical analysis reveals an intricate interplay of various decoherence mechanisms. This study identifies five distinct magnetic field regions governed by different types of magnetic interactions with and within the abundant nuclear spin bath. In addition to magnetic field, the effects of zero-field splitting, nuclear polarization, and different hyperfine coupling terms are studied, representing an important step forward in utilizing V$_\mathrm{B}^-$ ensembles in sensing. In particular, this study proposes operation in the moderate $180-350$ mT magnetic field range in chemically pure h$^{11}$B$^{15}$N samples, where the coherence time can reach $1-20$ $\mu$s, significantly exceeding the $\mathcal{O}( 100~\text{ns})$ low-field $T_2$ values.</description>
