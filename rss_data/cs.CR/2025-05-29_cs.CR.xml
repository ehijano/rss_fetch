      <title>Preventing Adversarial AI Attacks Against Autonomous Situational Awareness: A Maritime Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial artificial intelligence (AI) attacks pose a significant threat to autonomous transportation, such as maritime vessels, that rely on AI components. Malicious actors can exploit these systems to deceive and manipulate AI-driven operations. This paper addresses three critical research challenges associated with adversarial AI: the limited scope of traditional defences, inadequate security metrics, and the need to build resilience beyond model-level defences. To address these challenges, we propose building defences utilising multiple inputs and data fusion to create defensive components and an AI security metric as a novel approach toward developing more secure AI systems. We name this approach the Data Fusion Cyber Resilience (DFCR) method, and we evaluate it through real-world demonstrations and comprehensive quantitative analyses, comparing a system built with the DFCR method against single-input models and models utilising existing state-of-the-art defences. The findings show that the DFCR approach significantly enhances resilience against adversarial machine learning attacks in maritime autonomous system operations, achieving up to a 35\% reduction in loss for successful multi-pronged perturbation attacks, up to a 100\% reduction in loss for successful adversarial patch attacks and up to 100\% reduction in loss for successful spoofing attacks when using these more resilient systems. We demonstrate how DFCR and DFCR confidence scores can reduce adversarial AI contact confidence and improve decision-making by the system, even when typical adversarial defences have been compromised. Ultimately, this work contributes to the development of more secure and resilient AI-driven systems against adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>VideoMarkBench: Benchmarking Robustness of Video Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of video generative models has led to a surge in highly realistic synthetic videos, raising ethical concerns related to disinformation and copyright infringement. Recently, video watermarking has been proposed as a mitigation strategy by embedding invisible marks into AI-generated videos to enable subsequent detection. However, the robustness of existing video watermarking methods against both common and adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoMarkBench, the first systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of video watermarks under watermark removal and watermark forgery attacks. Our study encompasses a unified dataset generated by three state-of-the-art video generative models, across three video styles, incorporating four watermarking methods and seven aggregation strategies used during detection. We comprehensively evaluate 12 types of perturbations under white-box, black-box, and no-box threat models. Our findings reveal significant vulnerabilities in current watermarking approaches and highlight the urgent need for more robust solutions. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhengyuan-jiang/VideoMarkBench.</description>

      <title>The Feasibility of Topic-Based Watermarking on Academic Peer Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into academic workflows, with many conferences and journals permitting their use for tasks such as language refinement and literature summarization. However, their use in peer review remains prohibited due to concerns around confidentiality breaches, hallucinated content, and inconsistent evaluations. As LLM-generated text becomes more indistinguishable from human writing, there is a growing need for reliable attribution mechanisms to preserve the integrity of the review process. In this work, we evaluate topic-based watermarking (TBW), a lightweight, semantic-aware technique designed to embed detectable signals into LLM-generated text. We conduct a comprehensive assessment across multiple LLM configurations, including base, few-shot, and fine-tuned variants, using authentic peer review data from academic conferences. Our results show that TBW maintains review quality relative to non-watermarked outputs, while demonstrating strong robustness to paraphrasing-based evasion. These findings highlight the viability of TBW as a minimally intrusive and practical solution for enforcing LLM usage in peer review.</description>

      <title>Reproducible Builds and Insights from an Independent Verifier for Arch Linux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supply chain attacks have emerged as a prominent cybersecurity threat in recent years. Reproducible and bootstrappable builds have the potential to reduce such attacks significantly. In combination with independent, exhaustive and periodic source code audits, these measures can effectively eradicate compromises in the building process. In this paper we introduce both concepts, we analyze the achievements over the last ten years and explain the remaining challenges. We contribute to the reproducible builds effort by setting up a rebuilder and verifier instance to test the reproducibility of Arch Linux packages. Using the results from this instance, we uncover an unnoticed and security-relevant packaging issue affecting 16 packages related to Certbot, the recommended software to install TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt, making them unreproducible. Additionally, we find the root cause of unreproduciblity in the source code of fwupd, a critical software used to update device firmware on Linux devices, and submit an upstream patch to fix it.</description>

      <title>A Joint Reconstruction-Triplet Loss Autoencoder Approach Towards Unseen Attack Detection in IoV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems, while offering significant advancements in transportation efficiency and safety, introduce substantial security vulnerabilities due to their highly interconnected nature. These dynamic systems produce massive amounts of data between vehicles, infrastructure, and cloud services and present a highly distributed framework with a wide attack surface. In considering network-centered attacks on IoV systems, attacks such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) can prohibit the communication of essential physical traffic safety information between system elements, illustrating that the security concerns for these systems go beyond the traditional confidentiality, integrity, and availability concerns of enterprise systems. Given the complexity and volume of data generated by IoV systems, traditional security mechanisms are often inadequate for accurately detecting sophisticated and evolving cyberattacks. Here, we present an unsupervised autoencoder method trained entirely on benign network data for the purpose of unseen attack detection in IoV networks. We leverage a weighted combination of reconstruction and triplet margin loss to guide the autoencoder training and develop a diverse representation of the benign training set. We conduct extensive experiments on recent network intrusion datasets from two different application domains, industrial IoT and home IoT, that represent the modern IoV task. We show that our method performs robustly for all unseen attack types, with roughly 99% accuracy on benign data and between 97% and 100% performance on anomaly data. We extend these results to show that our model is adaptable through the use of transfer learning, achieving similarly high results while leveraging domain features from one domain to another.</description>

      <title>Lazarus Group Targets Crypto-Wallets and Financial Data while employing new Tradecrafts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report presents a comprehensive analysis of a malicious software sample, detailing its architecture, behavioral characteristics, and underlying intent. Through static and dynamic examination, the malware core functionalities, including persistence mechanisms, command-and-control communication, and data exfiltration routines, are identified and its supporting infrastructure is mapped. By correlating observed indicators of compromise with known techniques, tactics, and procedures, this analysis situates the sample within the broader context of contemporary threat campaigns and infers the capabilities and motivations of its likely threat actor.
  Building on these findings, actionable threat intelligence is provided to support proactive defenses. Threat hunting teams receive precise detection hypotheses for uncovering latent adversarial presence, while monitoring systems can refine alert logic to detect anomalous activity in real time. Finally, the report discusses how this structured intelligence enhances predictive risk assessments, informs vulnerability prioritization, and strengthens organizational resilience against advanced persistent threats. By integrating detailed technical insights with strategic threat landscape mapping, this malware analysis report not only reconstructs past adversary actions but also establishes a robust foundation for anticipating and mitigating future attacks.</description>

      <title>VulBinLLM: LLM-powered Vulnerability Detection for Stripped Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing vulnerabilities in stripped binary files presents a significant challenge in software security. Although some progress has been made in generating human-readable information from decompiled binary files with Large Language Models (LLMs), effectively and scalably detecting vulnerabilities within these binary files is still an open problem. This paper explores the novel application of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities within these binary files. We demonstrate the feasibility of identifying vulnerable programs through a combined approach of decompilation optimization to make the vulnerabilities more prominent and long-term memory for a larger context window, achieving state-of-the-art performance in binary vulnerability analysis. Our findings highlight the potential for LLMs to overcome the limitations of traditional analysis methods and advance the field of binary vulnerability detection, paving the way for more secure software systems. In this paper, we present Vul-BinLLM , an LLM-based framework for binary vulnerability detection that mirrors traditional binary analysis workflows with fine-grained optimizations in decompilation and vulnerability reasoning with an extended context. In the decompilation phase, Vul-BinLLM adds vulnerability and weakness comments without altering the code structure or functionality, providing more contextual information for vulnerability reasoning later. Then for vulnerability reasoning, Vul-BinLLM combines in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting along with a memory management agent to enhance accuracy. Our evaluations encompass the commonly used synthetic dataset Juliet to evaluate the potential feasibility for analysis and vulnerability detection in C/C++ binaries. Our evaluations show that Vul-BinLLM is highly effective in detecting vulnerabilities on the compiled Juliet dataset.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Fuzzers and Static Analysis Tools for Finding Memory Unsafety in C and C++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even today, over 70% of security vulnerabilities in critical software systems result from memory safety violations. To address this challenge, fuzzing and static analysis are widely used automated methods to discover such vulnerabilities. Fuzzing generates random program inputs to identify faults, while static analysis examines source code to detect potential vulnerabilities. Although these techniques share a common goal, they take fundamentally different approaches and have evolved largely independently.
  In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of five static analyzers and 13 fuzzers, applied to over 100 known security vulnerabilities in C/C++ programs. We measure the number of bug reports generated for each vulnerability to evaluate how the approaches differ and complement each other. Moreover, we randomly sample eight bug-containing functions, manually analyze all bug reports therein, and quantify false-positive rates. We also assess limits to bug discovery, ease of use, resource requirements, and integration into the development process. We find that both techniques discover different types of bugs, but there are clear winners for each. Developers should consider these tools depending on their specific workflow and usability requirements. Based on our findings, we propose future directions to foster collaboration between these research domains.</description>

      <title>Accountable, Scalable and DoS-resilient Secure Vehicular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paramount to vehicle safety, broadcasted Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) and Decentralized Environmental Notification Messages (DENMs) are pseudonymously authenticated for security and privacy protection, with each node needing to have all incoming messages validated within an expiration deadline. This creates an asymmetry that can be easily exploited by external adversaries to launch a clogging Denial of Service (DoS) attack: each forged VC message forces all neighboring nodes to cryptographically validate it; at increasing rates, easy to generate forged messages gradually exhaust processing resources and severely degrade or deny timely validation of benign CAMs/DENMs. The result can be catastrophic when awareness of neighbor vehicle positions or critical reports are missed. We address this problem making the standardized VC pseudonymous authentication DoS-resilient. We propose efficient cryptographic constructs, which we term message verification facilitators, to prioritize processing resources for verification of potentially valid messages among bogus messages and verify multiple messages based on one signature verification. Any message acceptance is strictly based on public-key based message authentication/verification for accountability, i.e., non-repudiation is not sacrificed, unlike symmetric key based approaches. This further enables drastic misbehavior detection, also exploiting the newly introduced facilitators, based on probabilistic signature verification and cross-checking over multiple facilitators verifying the same message; while maintaining verification latency low even when under attack, trading off modest communication overhead. Our facilitators can also be used for efficient discovery and verification of DENM or any event-driven message, including misbehavior evidence used for our scheme.</description>

      <title>Domainator: Detecting and Identifying DNS-Tunneling Malware Using Metadata Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, malware with tunneling (or: covert channel) capabilities is on the rise. While malware research led to several methods and innovations, the detection and differentiation of malware solely based on its DNS tunneling features is still in its infancy. Moreover, no work so far has used the DNS tunneling traffic to gain knowledge over the current actions taken by the malware. In this paper, we present Domainator, an approach to detect and differentiate state-of-the-art malware and DNS tunneling tools without relying on trivial (but quickly altered) features such as "magic bytes" that are embedded into subdomains. Instead, we apply an analysis of sequential patterns to identify specific types of malware. We evaluate our approach with 7 different malware samples and tunneling tools and can identify the particular malware based on its DNS traffic. We further infer the rough behavior of the particular malware through its DNS tunneling artifacts. Finally, we compare our Domainator with related methods.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Immunization: A Universal Defense Framework Against Jailbreaks for (Multimodal) Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While (multimodal) large language models (LLMs) have attracted widespread attention due to their exceptional capabilities, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Various defense methods are proposed to defend against jailbreak attacks, however, they are often tailored to specific types of jailbreak attacks, limiting their effectiveness against diverse adversarial strategies. For instance, rephrasing-based defenses are effective against text adversarial jailbreaks but fail to counteract image-based attacks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a universal defense framework, termed Test-time IMmunization (TIM), which can adaptively defend against various jailbreak attacks in a self-evolving way. Specifically, TIM initially trains a gist token for efficient detection, which it subsequently applies to detect jailbreak activities during inference. When jailbreak attempts are identified, TIM implements safety fine-tuning using the detected jailbreak instructions paired with refusal answers. Furthermore, to mitigate potential performance degradation in the detector caused by parameter updates during safety fine-tuning, we decouple the fine-tuning process from the detection module. Extensive experiments on both LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrate the efficacy of TIM.</description>

      <title>Does Johnny Get the Message? Evaluating Cybersecurity Notifications for Everyday Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the increasing presence of networked devices in everyday life, not only cybersecurity specialists but also end users benefit from security applications such as firewalls, vulnerability scanners, and intrusion detection systems. Recent approaches use large language models (LLMs) to rewrite brief, technical security alerts into intuitive language and suggest actionable measures, helping everyday users understand and respond appropriately to security risks. However, it remains an open question how well such alerts are explained to users. LLM outputs can also be hallucinated, inconsistent, or misleading. In this work, we introduce the Human-Centered Security Alert Evaluation Framework (HCSAEF). HCSAEF assesses LLM-generated cybersecurity notifications to support researchers who want to compare notifications generated for everyday users, improve them, or analyze the capabilities of different LLMs in explaining cybersecurity issues. We demonstrate HCSAEF through three use cases, which allow us to quantify the impact of prompt design, model selection, and output consistency. Our findings indicate that HCSAEF effectively differentiates generated notifications along dimensions such as intuitiveness, urgency, and correctness.</description>

      <title>Privacy-preserving Prompt Personalization in Federated Learning for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt learning is a crucial technique for adapting pre-trained multimodal language models (MLLMs) to user tasks. Federated prompt personalization (FPP) is further developed to address data heterogeneity and local overfitting, however, it exposes personalized prompts - valuable intellectual assets - to privacy risks like prompt stealing or membership inference attacks. Widely-adopted techniques like differential privacy add noise to prompts, whereas degrading personalization performance. We propose SecFPP, a secure FPP protocol harmonizing generalization, personalization, and privacy guarantees. SecFPP employs hierarchical prompt adaptation with domain-level and class-level components to handle multi-granular data imbalance. For privacy, it uses a novel secret-sharing-based adaptive clustering algorithm for domain-level adaptation while keeping class-level components private. While theoretically and empirically secure, SecFPP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy under severe heterogeneity in data distribution. Extensive experiments show it significantly outperforms both non-private and privacy-preserving baselines, offering a superior privacy-performance trade-off.</description>

      <title>Private Lossless Multiple Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koufogiannis et al. (2016) showed a $\textit{gradual release}$ result for Laplace noise-based differentially private mechanisms: given an $\varepsilon$-DP release, a new release with privacy parameter $\varepsilon' &gt; \varepsilon$ can be computed such that the combined privacy loss of both releases is at most $\varepsilon'$ and the distribution of the latter is the same as a single release with parameter $\varepsilon'$. They also showed gradual release techniques for Gaussian noise, later also explored by Whitehouse et al. (2022).
  In this paper, we consider a more general $\textit{multiple release}$ setting in which analysts hold private releases with different privacy parameters corresponding to different access/trust levels. These releases are determined one by one, with privacy parameters in arbitrary order. A multiple release is $\textit{lossless}$ if having access to a subset $S$ of the releases has the same privacy guarantee as the least private release in $S$, and each release has the same distribution as a single release with the same privacy parameter. Our main result is that lossless multiple release is possible for a large class of additive noise mechanisms. For the Gaussian mechanism we give a simple method for lossless multiple release with a short, self-contained analysis that does not require knowledge of the mathematics of Brownian motion. We also present lossless multiple release for the Laplace and Poisson mechanisms. Finally, we consider how to efficiently do gradual release of sparse histograms, and present a mechanism with running time independent of the number of dimensions.</description>

      <title>Transformers for Secure Hardware Systems: Applications, Challenges, and Outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of hardware-level security threats, such as side-channel attacks, hardware Trojans, and firmware vulnerabilities, demands advanced detection mechanisms that are more intelligent and adaptive. Traditional methods often fall short in addressing the complexity and evasiveness of modern attacks, driving increased interest in machine learning-based solutions. Among these, Transformer models, widely recognized for their success in natural language processing and computer vision, have gained traction in the security domain due to their ability to model complex dependencies, offering enhanced capabilities in identifying vulnerabilities, detecting anomalies, and reinforcing system integrity. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements on the use of Transformers in hardware security, examining their application across key areas such as side-channel analysis, hardware Trojan detection, vulnerability classification, device fingerprinting, and firmware security. Furthermore, we discuss the practical challenges of applying Transformers to secure hardware systems, and highlight opportunities and future research directions that position them as a foundation for next-generation hardware-assisted security. These insights pave the way for deeper integration of AI-driven techniques into hardware security frameworks, enabling more resilient and intelligent defenses.</description>

      <title>SimProcess: High Fidelity Simulation of Noisy ICS Physical Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial Control Systems (ICS) manage critical infrastructures like power grids and water treatment plants. Cyberattacks on ICSs can disrupt operations, causing severe economic, environmental, and safety issues. For example, undetected pollution in a water plant can put the lives of thousands at stake. ICS researchers have increasingly turned to honeypots -- decoy systems designed to attract attackers, study their behaviors, and eventually improve defensive mechanisms. However, existing ICS honeypots struggle to replicate the ICS physical process, making them susceptible to detection. Accurately simulating the noise in ICS physical processes is challenging because different factors produce it, including sensor imperfections and external interferences.
  In this paper, we propose SimProcess, a novel framework to rank the fidelity of ICS simulations by evaluating how closely they resemble real-world and noisy physical processes. It measures the simulation distance from a target system by estimating the noise distribution with machine learning models like Random Forest. Unlike existing solutions that require detailed mathematical models or are limited to simple systems, SimProcess operates with only a timeseries of measurements from the real system, making it applicable to a broader range of complex dynamic systems. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a case study using real-world power grid data from the EPIC testbed. We compare the performance of various simulation methods, including static and generative noise techniques. Our model correctly classifies real samples with a recall of up to 1.0. It also identifies Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture as the best distribution to simulate our power systems, together with a generative solution provided by an autoencoder, thereby helping developers to improve honeypot fidelity. Additionally, we make our code publicly available.</description>

      <title>On the Intractability of Chaotic Symbolic Walks: Toward a Non-Algebraic Post-Quantum Hardness Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most classical and post-quantum cryptographic assumptions, including integer factorization, discrete logarithms, and Learning with Errors (LWE), rely on algebraic structures such as rings or vector spaces. While mathematically powerful, these structures can be exploited by quantum algorithms or advanced algebraic attacks, raising a pressing need for structure-free alternatives. To address this gap, we introduce the Symbolic Path Inversion Problem (SPIP), a new computational hardness assumption based on symbolic trajectories generated by contractive affine maps with bounded noise over Z2. Unlike traditional systems, SPIP is inherently non-algebraic and relies on chaotic symbolic evolution and rounding-induced non-injectivity to render inversion computationally infeasible. We prove that SPIP is PSPACE-hard and #P-hard, and demonstrate through empirical simulation that even short symbolic sequences (e.g., n = 3, m = 2) can produce over 500 valid trajectories for a single endpoint, with exponential growth reaching 2256 paths for moderate parameters. A quantum security analysis further shows that Grover-style search offers no practical advantage due to oracle ambiguity and verification instability. These results position SPIP as a viable foundation for post-quantum cryptography that avoids the vulnerabilities of algebraic symmetry while offering scalability, unpredictability, and resistance to both classical and quantum inversion.</description>

      <title>Capability-Based Scaling Laws for LLM Red-Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models grow in capability and agency, identifying vulnerabilities through red-teaming becomes vital for safe deployment. However, traditional prompt-engineering approaches may prove ineffective once red-teaming turns into a weak-to-strong problem, where target models surpass red-teamers in capabilities. To study this shift, we frame red-teaming through the lens of the capability gap between attacker and target. We evaluate more than 500 attacker-target pairs using LLM-based jailbreak attacks that mimic human red-teamers across diverse families, sizes, and capability levels. Three strong trends emerge: (i) more capable models are better attackers, (ii) attack success drops sharply once the target's capability exceeds the attacker's, and (iii) attack success rates correlate with high performance on social science splits of the MMLU-Pro benchmark. From these trends, we derive a jailbreaking scaling law that predicts attack success for a fixed target based on attacker-target capability gap. These findings suggest that fixed-capability attackers (e.g., humans) may become ineffective against future models, increasingly capable open-source models amplify risks for existing systems, and model providers must accurately measure and control models' persuasive and manipulative abilities to limit their effectiveness as attackers.</description>

      <title>VoiceMark: Zero-Shot Voice Cloning-Resistant Watermarking Approach Leveraging Speaker-Specific Latents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice cloning (VC)-resistant watermarking is an emerging technique for tracing and preventing unauthorized cloning. Existing methods effectively trace traditional VC models by training them on watermarked audio but fail in zero-shot VC scenarios, where models synthesize audio from an audio prompt without training. To address this, we propose VoiceMark, the first zero-shot VC-resistant watermarking method that leverages speaker-specific latents as the watermark carrier, allowing the watermark to transfer through the zero-shot VC process into the synthesized audio. Additionally, we introduce VC-simulated augmentations and VAD-based loss to enhance robustness against distortions. Experiments on multiple zero-shot VC models demonstrate that VoiceMark achieves over 95% accuracy in watermark detection after zero-shot VC synthesis, significantly outperforming existing methods, which only reach around 50%.

      <title>SOSBENCH: Benchmarking Safety Alignment on Scientific Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit advancing capabilities in complex tasks, such as reasoning and graduate-level question answering, yet their resilience against misuse, particularly involving scientifically sophisticated risks, remains underexplored. Existing safety benchmarks typically focus either on instructions requiring minimal knowledge comprehension (e.g., ``tell me how to build a bomb") or utilize prompts that are relatively low-risk (e.g., multiple-choice or classification tasks about hazardous content). Consequently, they fail to adequately assess model safety when handling knowledge-intensive, hazardous scenarios.
  To address this critical gap, we introduce SOSBench, a regulation-grounded, hazard-focused benchmark encompassing six high-risk scientific domains: chemistry, biology, medicine, pharmacology, physics, and psychology. The benchmark comprises 3,000 prompts derived from real-world regulations and laws, systematically expanded via an LLM-assisted evolutionary pipeline that introduces diverse, realistic misuse scenarios (e.g., detailed explosive synthesis instructions involving advanced chemical formulas). We evaluate frontier models within a unified evaluation framework using our SOSBench. Despite their alignment claims, advanced models consistently disclose policy-violating content across all domains, demonstrating alarmingly high rates of harmful responses (e.g., 79.1% for Deepseek-R1 and 47.3% for GPT-4.1). These results highlight significant safety alignment deficiencies and underscore urgent concerns regarding the responsible deployment of powerful LLMs.</description>

      <title>PrivATE: Differentially Private Confidence Intervals for Average Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The average treatment effect (ATE) is widely used to evaluate the effectiveness of drugs and other medical interventions. In safety-critical applications like medicine, reliable inferences about the ATE typically require valid uncertainty quantification, such as through confidence intervals (CIs). However, estimating treatment effects in these settings often involves sensitive data that must be kept private. In this work, we present PrivATE, a novel machine learning framework for computing CIs for the ATE under differential privacy. Specifically, we focus on deriving valid privacy-preserving CIs for the ATE from observational data. Our PrivATE framework consists of three steps: (i) estimating a differentially private ATE through output perturbation; (ii) estimating the differentially private variance through a truncated output perturbation mechanism; and (iii) constructing the CIs while accounting for the uncertainty from both the estimation and privatization steps. Our PrivATE framework is model agnostic, doubly robust, and ensures valid CIs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework using synthetic and real-world medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to derive a general, doubly robust framework for valid CIs of the ATE under ($\varepsilon$, $\delta$)-differential privacy.</description>

      <title>Multi-photon QKD for Practical Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) will most likely be an integral part of any practical quantum network in the future. However, not all QKD protocols can be used in today's networks because of the lack of single-photon emitters and noisy intermediate quantum hardware. Attenuated-photon transmission, typically used to simulate single-photon emitters, severely limits the achievable transmission distances and makes the integration of the QKD into existing classical networks, that use tens of thousands of photons per bit of transmission, difficult. Furthermore, it has been found that protocol performance varies with topology. In order to remove the reliance of QKD on single-photon emitters and increase transmission distances, it is worthwhile to explore QKD protocols that do not rely on single-photon transmissions for security, such as the 3-stage QKD protocol, which can tolerate multiple photons in each burst without information leakage. This paper compares and contrasts the 3-stage QKD protocol with conventional QKD protocols and its efficiency in different network topologies and conditions. Furthermore, we establish a mathematical relationship between achievable key rates to increase transmission distances in various topologies.</description>

      <title>Scrapers selectively respect robots.txt directives: evidence from a large-scale empirical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online data scraping has taken on new dimensions in recent years, as traditional scrapers have been joined by new AI-specific bots. To counteract unwanted scraping, many sites use tools like the Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP), which places a robots.txt file at the site root to dictate scraper behavior. Yet, the efficacy of the REP is not well-understood. Anecdotal evidence suggests some bots comply poorly with it, but no rigorous study exists to support (or refute) this claim. To understand the merits and limits of the REP, we conduct the first large-scale study of web scraper compliance with robots.txt directives using anonymized web logs from our institution. We analyze the behavior of 130 self-declared bots (and many anonymous ones) over 40 days, using a series of controlled robots.txt experiments. We find that bots are less likely to comply with stricter robots.txt directives, and that certain categories of bots, including AI search crawlers, rarely check robots.txt at all. These findings suggest that relying on robots.txt files to prevent unwanted scraping is risky and highlight the need for alternative approaches.</description>

      <title>Practical Adversarial Attacks on Stochastic Bandits via Fake Data Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks on stochastic bandits have traditionally relied on some unrealistic assumptions, such as per-round reward manipulation and unbounded perturbations, limiting their relevance to real-world systems. We propose a more practical threat model, Fake Data Injection, which reflects realistic adversarial constraints: the attacker can inject only a limited number of bounded fake feedback samples into the learner's history, simulating legitimate interactions. We design efficient attack strategies under this model, explicitly addressing both magnitude constraints (on reward values) and temporal constraints (on when and how often data can be injected). Our theoretical analysis shows that these attacks can mislead both Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling algorithms into selecting a target arm in nearly all rounds while incurring only sublinear attack cost. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our strategies, revealing significant vulnerabilities in widely used stochastic bandit algorithms under practical adversarial scenarios.</description>

      <title>Securing the Software Package Supply Chain for Critical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software systems have grown as an indispensable commodity used across various industries, and almost all essential services depend on them for effective operation. The software is no longer an independent or stand-alone piece of code written by a developer but rather a collection of packages designed by multiple developers across the globe. Ensuring the reliability and resilience of these systems is crucial since emerging threats target software supply chains, as demonstrated by the widespread SolarWinds hack in late 2020. These supply chains extend beyond patches and updates, involving distribution networks throughout the software lifecycle. Industries like smart grids, manufacturing, healthcare, and finance rely on interconnected software systems and their dependencies for effective functioning. To secure software modules and add-ons, robust distribution architectures are essential. The proposed chapter enhances the existing delivery frameworks by including a permissioned ledger with Proof of Authority consensus and multi-party signatures. The proposed system aims to prevent attacks while permitting every stakeholder to verify the same. Critical systems can interface with the secure pipeline without disrupting existing functionalities, thus preventing the cascading effect of an attack at any point in the supply chain.</description>

      <title>Jailbreak Distillation: Renewable Safety Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly deployed in critical applications, raising urgent needs for robust safety benchmarking. We propose Jailbreak Distillation (JBDistill), a novel benchmark construction framework that "distills" jailbreak attacks into high-quality and easily-updatable safety benchmarks. JBDistill utilizes a small set of development models and existing jailbreak attack algorithms to create a candidate prompt pool, then employs prompt selection algorithms to identify an effective subset of prompts as safety benchmarks. JBDistill addresses challenges in existing safety evaluation: the use of consistent evaluation prompts across models ensures fair comparisons and reproducibility. It requires minimal human effort to rerun the JBDistill pipeline and produce updated benchmarks, alleviating concerns on saturation and contamination. Extensive experiments demonstrate our benchmarks generalize robustly to 13 diverse evaluation models held out from benchmark construction, including proprietary, specialized, and newer-generation LLMs, significantly outperforming existing safety benchmarks in effectiveness while maintaining high separability and diversity. Our framework thus provides an effective, sustainable, and adaptable solution for streamlining safety evaluation.</description>

      <title>Inclusive, Differentially Private Federated Learning for Clinical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach for training clinical AI models without centralizing sensitive patient data. However, its real-world adoption is hindered by challenges related to privacy, resource constraints, and compliance. Existing Differential Privacy (DP) approaches often apply uniform noise, which disproportionately degrades model performance, even among well-compliant institutions. In this work, we propose a novel compliance-aware FL framework that enhances DP by adaptively adjusting noise based on quantifiable client compliance scores. Additionally, we introduce a compliance scoring tool based on key healthcare and security standards to promote secure, inclusive, and equitable participation across diverse clinical settings. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that integrating under-resourced, less compliant clinics with highly regulated institutions yields accuracy improvements of up to 15% over traditional FL. This work advances FL by balancing privacy, compliance, and performance, making it a viable solution for real-world clinical workflows in global healthcare.</description>

      <title>Training RL Agents for Multi-Objective Network Defense Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-ended learning (OEL) -- which emphasizes training agents that achieve broad capability over narrow competency -- is emerging as a paradigm to develop artificial intelligence (AI) agents to achieve robustness and generalization. However, despite promising results that demonstrate the benefits of OEL, applying OEL to develop autonomous agents for real-world cybersecurity applications remains a challenge.
  We propose a training approach, inspired by OEL, to develop autonomous network defenders. Our results demonstrate that like in other domains, OEL principles can translate into more robust and generalizable agents for cyber defense. To apply OEL to network defense, it is necessary to address several technical challenges. Most importantly, it is critical to provide a task representation approach over a broad universe of tasks that maintains a consistent interface over goals, rewards and action spaces. This way, the learning agent can train with varying network conditions, attacker behaviors, and defender goals while being able to build on previously gained knowledge.
  With our tools and results, we aim to fundamentally impact research that applies AI to solve cybersecurity problems. Specifically, as researchers develop gyms and benchmarks for cyber defense, it is paramount that they consider diverse tasks with consistent representations, such as those we propose in our work.</description>

      <title>BPMN to Smart Contract by Business Analyst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of creating smart contracts for applications represented using Business Process Management and Notation (BPMN) models. In our prior work we presented a methodology that automates the generation of smart contracts from BPMN models. This approach abstracts the BPMN flow control, making it independent of the underlying blockchain infrastructure, with only the BPMN task elements requiring coding. In subsequent research, we enhanced our approach by adding support for nested transactions and enabling a smart contract repair and/or upgrade. To empower Business Analysts (BAs) to generate smart contracts without relying on software developers, we tackled the challenge of generating smart contracts from BPMN models without assistance of a software developer. We exploit the Decision Model and Notation (DMN) standard to represent the decisions and the business logic of the BPMN task elements and amended our methodology for transformation of BPMN models into smart contracts to support also the generation script to represent the business logic represented by the DMN models. To support such transformation, we describe how the BA documents, using the BPMN elements, the flow of information along with the flow of execution. Thus, if the BA is successful in representing the blockchain application requirements using BPMN and DMN models, our methodology and the tool, called TABS, that we developed as a proof of concept, is used to generate the smart contracts directly from those models without developer assistance.</description>

      <title>Smart Contracts for SMEs and Large Companies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on blockchains addresses multiple issues, with one being writing smart contracts. In our previous research we described methodology and a tool to generate, in automated fashion, smart contracts from BPMN models. The generated smart contracts provide support for multi-step transactions that facilitate repair/upgrade of smart contracts. In this paper we show how the approach is used to support collaborations via smart contracts for companies ranging from SMEs with little IT capabilities to companies with IT using blockchain smart contracts. Furthermore, we also show how the approach is used for certain applications to generate smart contracts by a BPMN modeler who does not need any knowledge of blockchain technology or smart contract development - thus we are hoping to facilitate democratization of smart contracts and blockchain technology.</description>

      <title>PrivacyRestore: Privacy-Preserving Inference in Large Language Models via Privacy Removal and Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01394v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread usage of online Large Language Models (LLMs) inference services has raised significant privacy concerns about the potential exposure of private information in user inputs to malicious eavesdroppers. Existing privacy protection methods for LLMs suffer from either insufficient privacy protection, performance degradation, or large inference time overhead. To address these limitations, we propose PrivacyRestore, a plug-and-play method to protect the privacy of user inputs during LLM inference. The server first trains restoration vectors for each privacy span and then release to clients. Privacy span is defined as a contiguous sequence of tokens within a text that contain private information. The client then aggregate restoration vectors of all privacy spans in the input into a single meta restoration vector which is later sent to the server side along with the input without privacy spans.The private information is restored via activation steering during inference. Furthermore, we prove that PrivacyRestore inherently prevents the linear growth of the privacy budget.We create three datasets, covering medical and legal domains, to evaluate the effectiveness of privacy preserving methods. The experimental results show that PrivacyRestore effectively protects private information and maintain acceptable levels of performance and inference overhead.</description>

      <title>Edit Distance Robust Watermarks via Indexing Pseudorandom Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the problem of detecting AI-generated text, we consider the problem of watermarking the output of language models with provable guarantees. We aim for watermarks which satisfy: (a) undetectability, a cryptographic notion introduced by Christ, Gunn &amp; Zamir (2024) which stipulates that it is computationally hard to distinguish watermarked language model outputs from the model's actual output distribution; and (b) robustness to channels which introduce a constant fraction of adversarial insertions, substitutions, and deletions to the watermarked text. Earlier schemes could only handle stochastic substitutions and deletions, and thus we are aiming for a more natural and appealing robustness guarantee that holds with respect to edit distance.
  Our main result is a watermarking scheme which achieves both undetectability and robustness to edits when the alphabet size for the language model is allowed to grow as a polynomial in the security parameter. To derive such a scheme, we follow an approach introduced by Christ &amp; Gunn (2024), which proceeds via first constructing pseudorandom codes satisfying undetectability and robustness properties analogous to those above; our key idea is to handle adversarial insertions and deletions by interpreting the symbols as indices into the codeword, which we call indexing pseudorandom codes. Additionally, our codes rely on weaker computational assumptions than used in previous work. Then we show that there is a generic transformation from such codes over large alphabets to watermarking schemes for arbitrary language models.</description>

      <title>A Note on Vectorial Boolean Functions as Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a vectorial Boolean function from $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ to $\mathbb{F}_2^m$, with $m \geq n$. We define $F$ as an embedding if $F$ is injective. In this paper, we examine the component functions of $F$, focusing on constant and balanced components. Our findings reveal that at most $2^m - 2^{m-n}$ components of $F$ can be balanced, and this maximum is achieved precisely when $F$ is an embedding, with the remaining $2^{m-n}$ components being constants. Additionally, for partially-bent embeddings, we demonstrate that there are always at least $2^n - 1$ balanced components when $n$ is even, and $2^{m-1} + 2^{n-1} - 1$ balanced components when $n$ is odd. A relation with APN functions is shown.</description>

      <title>PriRoAgg: Achieving Robust Model Aggregation with Minimum Privacy Leakage for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has recently gained significant momentum due to its potential to leverage large-scale distributed user data while preserving user privacy. However, the typical paradigm of FL faces challenges of both privacy and robustness: the transmitted model updates can potentially leak sensitive user information, and the lack of central control of the local training process leaves the global model susceptible to malicious manipulations on model updates. Current solutions attempting to address both problems under the one-server FL setting fall short in the following aspects: 1) designed for simple validity checks that are insufficient against advanced attacks (e.g., checking norm of individual update); and 2) partial privacy leakage for more complicated robust aggregation algorithms (e.g., distances between model updates are leaked for multi-Krum). In this work, we formalize a novel security notion of aggregated privacy that characterizes the minimum amount of user information, in the form of some aggregated statistics of users' updates, that is necessary to be revealed to accomplish more advanced robust aggregation. We develop a general framework PriRoAgg, utilizing Lagrange coded computing and distributed zero-knowledge proof, to execute a wide range of robust aggregation algorithms while satisfying aggregated privacy. As concrete instantiations of PriRoAgg, we construct two secure and robust protocols based on state-of-the-art robust algorithms, for which we provide full theoretical analyses on security and complexity. Extensive experiments are conducted for these protocols, demonstrating their robustness against various model integrity attacks, and their efficiency advantages over baselines.</description>

      <title>AdvAgent: Controllable Blackbox Red-teaming on Web Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation model-based agents are increasingly used to automate complex tasks, enhancing efficiency and productivity. However, their access to sensitive resources and autonomous decision-making also introduce significant security risks, where successful attacks could lead to severe consequences. To systematically uncover these vulnerabilities, we propose AdvAgent, a black-box red-teaming framework for attacking web agents. Unlike existing approaches, AdvAgent employs a reinforcement learning-based pipeline to train an adversarial prompter model that optimizes adversarial prompts using feedback from the black-box agent. With careful attack design, these prompts effectively exploit agent weaknesses while maintaining stealthiness and controllability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AdvAgent achieves high success rates against state-of-the-art GPT-4-based web agents across diverse web tasks. Furthermore, we find that existing prompt-based defenses provide only limited protection, leaving agents vulnerable to our framework. These findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in current web agents and emphasize the urgent need for stronger defense mechanisms. We release code at https://ai-secure.github.io/AdvAgent/.</description>

      <title>How Breakable Is Privacy: Probing and Resisting Model Inversion Attacks in Collaborative Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00824v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative inference (CI) improves computational efficiency for edge devices by transmitting intermediate features to cloud models. However, this process inevitably exposes feature representations to model inversion attacks (MIAs), enabling unauthorized data reconstruction. Despite extensive research, there is no established criterion for assessing the difficulty of MIA implementation, leaving a fundamental question unanswered: \textit{What factors truly and verifiably determine the attack's success in CI?} Moreover, existing defenses lack the theoretical foundation described above, making it challenging to regulate feature information effectively while ensuring privacy and minimizing computational overhead. These shortcomings introduce three key challenges: theoretical gap, methodological limitation, and practical constraint.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose the first theoretical criterion to assess MIA difficulty in CI, identifying mutual information, entropy, and effective information volume as key influencing factors. The validity of this criterion is demonstrated by using the mutual information neural estimator. Building on this insight, we propose SiftFunnel, a privacy-preserving framework to resist MIA while maintaining usability. Specifically, we incorporate linear and non-linear correlation constraints alongside label smoothing to suppress redundant information transmission, effectively balancing privacy and usability. To enhance deployability, the edge model adopts a funnel-shaped structure with attention mechanisms, strengthening privacy while reducing computational and storage burdens. Experiments show that, compared to state-of-the-art defense, SiftFunnel increases reconstruction error by $\sim$30\%, lowers mutual and effective information metrics by $\geq$50\%, and reduces edge burdens by almost $20\times$, while maintaining comparable usability.</description>

      <title>Beyond Surface-Level Patterns: An Essence-Driven Defense Framework Against Jailbreak Attacks in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although Aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to refuse harmful requests, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Unfortunately, existing methods often focus on surface-level patterns, overlooking the deeper attack essences. As a result, defenses fail when attack prompts change, even though the underlying "attack essence" remains the same. To address this issue, we introduce EDDF, an \textbf{E}ssence-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{D}efense \textbf{F}ramework Against Jailbreak Attacks in LLMs. EDDF is a plug-and-play input-filtering method and operates in two stages: 1) offline essence database construction, and 2) online adversarial query detection. The key idea behind EDDF is to extract the "attack essence" from a diverse set of known attack instances and store it in an offline vector database. Experimental results demonstrate that EDDF significantly outperforms existing methods by reducing the Attack Success Rate by at least 20\%, underscoring its superior robustness against jailbreak attacks.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Survey in LLM(-Agent) Full Stack Safety: Data, Training and Deployment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has illuminated a promising pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence for both academic and industrial communities, owing to their unprecedented performance across various applications. As LLMs continue to gain prominence in both research and commercial domains, their security and safety implications have become a growing concern, not only for researchers and corporations but also for every nation. Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on specific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning phase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire "lifechain" of LLMs. To address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of "full-stack" safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization. Compared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several distinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective. We define the complete LLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training, deployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the first safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive Literature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over 800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of security issues within a more holistic understanding. (III) Unique Insights. Through systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and perspectives for each chapter. Our work identifies promising research directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems. These insights provide valuable guidance for researchers pursuing future work in this field.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Ceiling: Exploring the Potential of Jailbreak Attacks through Expanding Strategy Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite advanced general capabilities, still suffer from numerous safety risks, especially jailbreak attacks that bypass safety protocols. Understanding these vulnerabilities through black-box jailbreak attacks, which better reflect real-world scenarios, offers critical insights into model robustness. While existing methods have shown improvements through various prompt engineering techniques, their success remains limited against safety-aligned models, overlooking a more fundamental problem: the effectiveness is inherently bounded by the predefined strategy spaces. However, expanding this space presents significant challenges in both systematically capturing essential attack patterns and efficiently navigating the increased complexity. To better explore the potential of expanding the strategy space, we address these challenges through a novel framework that decomposes jailbreak strategies into essential components based on the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) theory and develops genetic-based optimization with intention evaluation mechanisms. To be striking, our experiments reveal unprecedented jailbreak capabilities by expanding the strategy space: we achieve over 90% success rate on Claude-3.5 where prior methods completely fail, while demonstrating strong cross-model transferability and surpassing specialized safeguard models in evaluation accuracy.

      <title>Pseudorandom unitaries are neither real nor sparse nor noise-robust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11677v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pseudorandom quantum states (PRSs) and pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) possess the dual nature of being efficiently constructible while appearing completely random to any efficient quantum algorithm. In this study, we establish fundamental bounds on pseudorandomness. We show that PRSs and PRUs exist only when the probability that an error occurs is negligible, ruling out their generation on noisy intermediate-scale and early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Further, we show that PRUs need imaginarity while PRS do not have this restriction. This implies that quantum randomness requires in general a complex-valued formalism of quantum mechanics, while for random quantum states real numbers suffice. Additionally, we derive lower bounds on the coherence of PRSs and PRUs, ruling out the existence of sparse PRUs and PRSs. We also show that the notions of PRS, PRUs and pseudorandom scramblers (PRSSs) are distinct in terms of resource requirements. We introduce the concept of pseudoresources, where states which contain a low amount of a given resource masquerade as high-resource states. We define pseudocoherence, pseudopurity and pseudoimaginarity, and identify three distinct types of pseudoresources in terms of their masquerading capabilities. Our work also establishes rigorous bounds on the efficiency of property testing, demonstrating the exponential complexity in distinguishing real quantum states from imaginary ones, in contrast to the efficient measurability of unitary imaginarity. Further, we show an exponential advantage in imaginarity testing when having access to the complex conjugate of the state. Lastly, we show that the transformation from a complex to a real model of quantum computation is inefficient, in contrast to the reverse process, which is efficient. Our results establish fundamental limits on property testing and provide valuable insights into quantum pseudorandomness.</description>

      <title>Improving the Variance of Differentially Private Randomized Experiments through Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects from randomized experiments is only possible if participants are willing to disclose their potentially sensitive responses. Differential privacy, a widely used framework for ensuring an algorithms privacy guarantees, can encourage participants to share their responses without the risk of de-anonymization. However, many mechanisms achieve differential privacy by adding noise to the original dataset, which reduces the precision of causal effect estimation. This introduces a fundamental trade-off between privacy and variance when performing causal analyses on differentially private data. In this work, we propose a new differentially private mechanism, "Cluster-DP", which leverages a given cluster structure in the data to improve the privacy-variance trade-off. While our results apply to any clustering, we demonstrate that selecting higher-quality clusters, according to a quality metric we introduce, can decrease the variance penalty without compromising privacy guarantees. Finally, we evaluate the theoretical and empirical performance of our Cluster-DP algorithm on both real and simulated data, comparing it to common baselines, including two special cases of our algorithm: its unclustered version and a uniform-prior version.</description>

      <title>Watermarks in the Sand: Impossibility of Strong Watermarking for Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04378v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Watermarking generative models consists of planting a statistical signal (watermark) in a model's output so that it can be later verified that the output was generated by the given model. A strong watermarking scheme satisfies the property that a computationally bounded attacker cannot erase the watermark without causing significant quality degradation. In this paper, we study the (im)possibility of strong watermarking schemes. We prove that, under well-specified and natural assumptions, strong watermarking is impossible to achieve. This holds even in the private detection algorithm setting, where the watermark insertion and detection algorithms share a secret key, unknown to the attacker. To prove this result, we introduce a generic efficient watermark attack; the attacker is not required to know the private key of the scheme or even which scheme is used. Our attack is based on two assumptions: (1) The attacker has access to a "quality oracle" that can evaluate whether a candidate output is a high-quality response to a prompt, and (2) The attacker has access to a "perturbation oracle" which can modify an output with a nontrivial probability of maintaining quality, and which induces an efficiently mixing random walk on high-quality outputs. We argue that both assumptions can be satisfied in practice by an attacker with weaker computational capabilities than the watermarked model itself, to which the attacker has only black-box access. Furthermore, our assumptions will likely only be easier to satisfy over time as models grow in capabilities and modalities. We demonstrate the feasibility of our attack by instantiating it to attack three existing watermarking schemes for large language models: Kirchenbauer et al. (2023), Kuditipudi et al. (2023), and Zhao et al. (2023). The same attack successfully removes the watermarks planted by all three schemes, with only minor quality degradation.</description>

      <title>Privacy for Free in the Overparameterized Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private gradient descent (DP-GD) is a popular algorithm to train deep learning models with provable guarantees on the privacy of the training data. In the last decade, the problem of understanding its performance cost with respect to standard GD has received remarkable attention from the research community, which formally derived upper bounds on the excess population risk $R_{P}$ in different learning settings. However, existing bounds typically degrade with over-parameterization, i.e., as the number of parameters $p$ gets larger than the number of training samples $n$ -- a regime which is ubiquitous in current deep-learning practice. As a result, the lack of theoretical insights leaves practitioners without clear guidance, leading some to reduce the effective number of trainable parameters to improve performance, while others use larger models to achieve better results through scale. In this work, we show that in the popular random features model with quadratic loss, for any sufficiently large $p$, privacy can be obtained for free, i.e., $\left|R_{P} \right| = o(1)$, not only when the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$ has constant order, but also in the strongly private setting $\varepsilon = o(1)$. This challenges the common wisdom that over-parameterization inherently hinders performance in private learning.</description>

      <title>ExpProof : Operationalizing Explanations for Confidential Models with ZKPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In principle, explanations are intended as a way to increase trust in machine learning models and are often obligated by regulations. However, many circumstances where these are demanded are adversarial in nature, meaning the involved parties have misaligned interests and are incentivized to manipulate explanations for their purpose. As a result, explainability methods fail to be operational in such settings despite the demand \cite{bordt2022post}. In this paper, we take a step towards operationalizing explanations in adversarial scenarios with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), a cryptographic primitive. Specifically we explore ZKP-amenable versions of the popular explainability algorithm LIME and evaluate their performance on Neural Networks and Random Forests. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/emlaufer/ExpProof.</description>

      <title>ThinkGuard: Deliberative Slow Thinking Leads to Cautious Guardrails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of large language models (LLMs) is critical as they are deployed in real-world applications. Existing guardrails rely on rule-based filtering or single-pass classification, limiting their ability to handle nuanced safety violations. To address this, we propose ThinkGuard, a critique-augmented guardrail model that distills knowledge from high-capacity LLMs by generating structured critiques alongside safety labels. Fine-tuned on critique-augmented data, the captured deliberative thinking ability drastically enhances the guardrail's cautiousness and interpretability. Evaluated on multiple safety benchmarks, ThinkGuard achieves the highest average F1 and AUPRC, outperforming all baselines. Compared to LLaMA Guard 3, ThinkGuard improves accuracy by 16.1% and macro F1 by 27.0%. Moreover, it surpasses label-only fine-tuned models, confirming that structured critiques enhance both classification precision and nuanced safety reasoning while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Robustness and Cybersecurity in the EU Artificial Intelligence Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) establishes different legal principles for different types of AI systems. While prior work has sought to clarify some of these principles, little attention has been paid to robustness and cybersecurity. This paper aims to fill this gap. We identify legal challenges and shortcomings in provisions related to robustness and cybersecurity for high-risk AI systems(Art. 15 AIA) and general-purpose AI models (Art. 55 AIA). We show that robustness and cybersecurity demand resilience against performance disruptions. Furthermore, we assess potential challenges in implementing these provisions in light of recent advancements in the machine learning (ML) literature. Our analysis informs efforts to develop harmonized standards, guidelines by the European Commission, as well as benchmarks and measurement methodologies under Art. 15(2) AIA. With this, we seek to bridge the gap between legal terminology and ML research, fostering a better alignment between research and implementation efforts.</description>

      <title>Tempest: Autonomous Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Large Language Models with Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10619v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Tempest, a multi-turn adversarial framework that models the gradual erosion of Large Language Model (LLM) safety through a tree search perspective. Unlike single-turn jailbreaks that rely on one meticulously engineered prompt, Tempest expands the conversation at each turn in a breadth-first fashion, branching out multiple adversarial prompts that exploit partial compliance from previous responses. By tracking these incremental policy leaks and re-injecting them into subsequent queries, Tempest reveals how minor concessions can accumulate into fully disallowed outputs. Evaluations on the JailbreakBench dataset show that Tempest achieves a 100% success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo and 97% on GPT-4 in a single multi-turn run, using fewer queries than baselines such as Crescendo or GOAT. This tree search methodology offers an in-depth view of how model safeguards degrade over successive dialogue turns, underscoring the urgency of robust multi-turn testing procedures for language models.</description>

      <title>Backdoors in DRL: Four Environments Focusing on In-distribution Triggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks, or trojans, pose a security risk by concealing undesirable behavior in deep neural network models. Open-source neural networks are downloaded from the internet daily, possibly containing backdoors, and third-party model developers are common. To advance research on backdoor attack mitigation, we develop several trojans for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents. We focus on in-distribution triggers, which occur within the agent's natural data distribution, since they pose a more significant security threat than out-of-distribution triggers due to their ease of activation by the attacker during model deployment. We implement backdoor attacks in four reinforcement learning (RL) environments: LavaWorld, Randomized LavaWorld, Colorful Memory, and Modified Safety Gymnasium. We train various models, both clean and backdoored, to characterize these attacks. We find that in-distribution triggers can require additional effort to implement and be more challenging for models to learn, but are nevertheless viable threats in DRL even using basic data poisoning attacks.</description>

      <title>Effect of noise and topologies on multi-photon quantum protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum-augmented networks aim to use quantum phenomena to improve detection and protection against malicious actors in a classical communication network. This may include multiplexing quantum signals into classical fiber optical channels and incorporating purely quantum links alongside classical links in the network. In such hybrid networks, quantum protocols based on single photons become a bottleneck for transmission distances and data speeds, thereby reducing entire network performance. Furthermore, many of the security assumptions of the single-photon protocols do not hold up in practice because of the impossibility of manufacturing single-photon emitters. Multi-photon quantum protocols, on the other hand, are designed to operate under practical assumptions and do not require single photon emitters. As a result, they provide higher levels of security guarantees and longer transmission distances. However, the effect of channel and device noise on multiphoton protocols in terms of security, transmission distances, and bit rates has not been investigated. In this paper, we focus on channel noise and present our observations on the effect of various types of noise on multi-photon protocols. We also investigate the effect of topologies such as ring, star, and torus on the noise characteristics of the multi-photon protocols. Our results show the possible advantages of switching to multi-photon protocols and give insights into the repeater placement and topology choice for quantum-augmented networks.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Real-World Assessment of Audio Watermarking Algorithms: Will They Survive Neural Codecs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Robust Audio Watermarking Benchmark (RAW-Bench), a benchmark for evaluating deep learning-based audio watermarking methods with standardized and systematic comparisons. To simulate real-world usage, we introduce a comprehensive audio attack pipeline with various distortions such as compression, background noise, and reverberation, along with a diverse test dataset including speech, environmental sounds, and music recordings. Evaluating four existing watermarking methods on RAW-bench reveals two main insights: (i) neural compression techniques pose the most significant challenge, even when algorithms are trained with such compressions; and (ii) training with audio attacks generally improves robustness, although it is insufficient in some cases. Furthermore, we find that specific distortions, such as polarity inversion, time stretching, or reverb, seriously affect certain methods. The evaluation framework is accessible at github.com/SonyResearch/raw_bench.</description>
