      <title>Curvature-Enhanced Dynamics and Exponential Decay of the Non-Cutoff Boltzmann Equation on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the long-time behavior of solutions to the non-cutoff Boltzmann equation on compact Riemannian manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature. The paper introduces new results on the exponential decay of hydrodynamic quantities, such as density, momentum, and energy fields, influenced by both the curvature of the manifold and singularities in the collision kernel. We demonstrate that for initial data in $H^s_x \times L^p_v$, the solutions exhibit sharp exponential decay rates in Sobolev norms, with the decay rate determined by the manifold's geometry and the regularity of the kernel. Specifically, we prove that the density $\rho(t, x)$, momentum $\mathbf{m}(t, x)$, and energy field $E(t, x)$ all decay exponentially in time, with decay rates that depend on the manifold's curvature and the nature of the collision kernel's singularity. Additionally, we address the case of angular singularities in the collision kernel, providing conditions under which the exponential decay persists. The analysis combines energy methods, Fourier analysis, and coercivity estimates for the collision operator, extended to curved geometries. These results extend the understanding of dissipation mechanisms in kinetic theory, especially in curved settings, and offer valuable insights into the behavior of rarefied gases and plasma flows in non-Euclidean environments. The findings have applications in plasma physics, astrophysics, and the study of rarefied gases, opening new directions for future research in kinetic theory and geometric analysis.</description>

      <title>Invariance Analysis, Symmetry Reduction and Conservation Laws for Biological Population in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research paper talks about using complex mathematical tools to study and figure out the behavior of biological populations in porous media. Porous media offer a unique environment where various factors, including fluid flow and nutrient diffusion, significantly influence population dynamics. The theory of Lie symmetries is used to find inherent symmetries in the governing equation of the population model, helping to find conservation laws and invariant solutions. The derivation and analysis of the optimal system provide insights into the most influential parameters affecting population growth and distribution. Furthermore, the study explores the construction of invariant solutions, which aid in characterizing long-term population behavior. The article concludes with the non-linear self-adjointness property and conservation laws for the model.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the relaxation of a degenerate functional with linear growth, depending on a weight $w$ that does not exhibit doubling or Muckenhoupt-type conditions. In order to obtain an explicit representation of the relaxed functional and its domain, our main tools for are Sobolev inequalities with double weight.</description>

      <title>Gibbs measures as local equilibrium KMS states for focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the study of statistical equilibria for focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger and Hartree equations on the d-dimensional torus when d=1,2,3. Due to the focusing nature of the nonlinearity in these PDEs, Gibbs measures have to be appropriately localized. First, we show that these local Gibbs measures are stationary solutions for the Liouville probability density equation and that they satisfy a local equilibrium Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition. Secondly, under some natural assumptions, we characterize all possible local KMS equilibrium states for these PDEs as local Gibbs measures.
  Our methods are based on Malliavin calculus in Gross-Stroock Sobolev spaces and on a suitable Gaussian integration by parts formula. To handle the technical problems due to localization, we rely on the works of Aida and Kusuoka on irreducibility of Dirichlet forms over infinite-dimensional domains. This leads us to the study of sublevel sets of the renormalized mass and their connectedness properties. In this paper, we also revisit Bourgain's proof of the normalizability of the local Gibbs measure for the focusing Hartree equation on the d-dimensional torus with d=2,3 by using concentration inequalities.</description>

      <title>Identification of the initial value for a space-time fractional diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an inverse problem for identifying the initial value in a space-time fractional diffusion equation from the final time data. We show the identifiability of this inverse problem by proving the existence of its unique solution with respect to the final observed data. It is proved that the inverse problem is an ill-posed problem. Namely, we prove that the solution to the inverse problem does not depend continuously on the measured data. The inverse problem is formulated as a regularized optimization one minimizing a least-squares type cost functional. Then the conjugate gradient method combined with Morozov's discrepancy is proposed for finding a stable approximate solution to the regularized variational problem. Numerical examples with noise-free and noisy data illustrate the applicability and high accuracy of the proposed method to some extent.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and exponential stability of dispersive nonlinear Maxwell equations with PML: An evolutionary approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical foundation for physical models in nonlinear optics through the lens of evolutionary equations. It focuses on two key concepts: well-posedness and exponential stability of Maxwell equations, with models that include materials with complex dielectric properties, dispersion, and discontinuities. We use a Hilbert space framework to address these complex physical models in nonlinear optics. While our focus is on the first-order formulation in space and time, higher solution regularity recovers and equates to the second-order formulation. We incorporate perfectly matched layers (PMLs), which model absorbing boundary conditions, to facilitate the development of numerical methods. We demonstrate that the combined system remains well-posed and exponentially stable. Our approach applies to a broad class of partial differential equations (PDEs) and accommodates materials with nonlocal behavior in space and time. The contribution of this work is a unified framework for analyzing wave interactions in advanced optical materials.</description>

      <title>Criteria of the existence of global solutions to semilinear wave equations with first-order derivatives on exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of global solutions to semilinear wave equations on exterior domains $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\mathcal{K}$, $n\geq2$, with small initial data and nonlinear terms $F(\partial u)$ where $F\in C^\kappa$ and $\partial^{\leq\kappa}F(0)=0$. If $n\geq2$ and $\kappa&gt;n/2$, criteria of the existence of a global solution for general initial data are provided, except for non-empty obstacles $\mathcal{K}$ when $n=2$. For $n\geq3$ and $1\leq\kappa\leq n/2$, we verify the criteria for radial solutions provided obstacles $\mathcal{K}$ are closed balls centered at origin. These criteria are established by local energy estimates and the weighted Sobolev embedding including trace estimates. Meanwhile, for the sample choice of the nonlinear term and initial data, sharp estimates of lifespan are obtained.</description>

      <title>Existence results for Toda systems with sign-changing prescribed functions: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a compact Riemann surface with area $1$, we shall study the Toda system $$
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u_1 = 2\rho_1(h_1e^{u_1}-1) - \rho_2(h_2e^{u_2}-1),\\
  -\Delta u_2 = 2\rho_2(h_2e^{u_2}-1) - \rho_1(h_1e^{u_1}-1),
  \end{cases} $$ on $(M,g)$ with $\rho_1=4\pi$, $\rho_2\in(0,4\pi)$, $h_1$ and $h_2$ are two smooth functions on $M$. In Jost-Lin-Wang's celebrated article (Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 59 (2006), no. 4, 526--558), they obtained a sufficient condition for the existence of this Toda system when $h_1$ and $h_2$ are both positive. In this paper, we shall improve this result to the case $h_1$ and $h_2$ can change signs. We shall pursue a variational method and use the standard blowup analysis. Among other things, the main contribution in our proof is to show the blowup can only happen at one point where $h_1$ is positive.</description>

      <title>The viscosity limit of fluid flows with growth/decay conditions at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Navier-Stokes equation is well-posed in function spaces on $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\ge 2$, that contain vector fields of order $O(|x|^\kappa)$ as $|x|\to\infty$ with $\kappa&lt;1/2$. The corresponding solutions depend continuously on the viscosity parameter $\nu\ge 0$ and converge to the solutions of the Euler equation as $\nu\to 0+$. Our proof is based on the properties of the conjugated heat flow on weighted Sobolev spaces and on a new variant of the Lie-Trotter product formula for nonlinear semigroups.</description>

      <title>Global Weak Solutions to a Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard System with Chemotaxis and Mass Transport: Cross Diffusion versus Logistic Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a diffuse interface model that describes the dynamics of incompressible two-phase flows influenced by interactions with a soluble chemical substance, encompassing the chemotaxis effect, mass transport, and reactions. In the resulting coupled evolutionary system, the macroscopic fluid velocity field $\boldsymbol{v}$ satisfies a Navier--Stokes system driven by a capillary force, the phase field variable $\varphi$ is governed by a convective Cahn--Hilliard equation incorporating a mass source and a singular potential (e.g., the Flory--Huggins type), and the chemical concentration $\sigma$ obeys an advection-reaction-diffusion equation with logistic degradation, exhibiting a cross-diffusion structure akin to the Keller--Segel model for chemotaxis. Under general structural assumptions, we establish the existence of global weak solutions to the initial boundary value problem within a bounded smooth domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $d=2,3$. The proof hinges on a novel semi-Galerkin scheme for a suitably regularized system, featuring a non-standard approximation of the singular potential. Moreover, with more restrictive assumptions on coefficients and data, we establish regularity properties and uniqueness of global weak solutions in the two-dimensional case. Our analysis contributes to a further understanding of phase separation processes under the interplay of fluid dynamics and chemotaxis, in particular, the influence of cross diffusion and logistic degradation.</description>

      <title>Global existence of weak solutions to incompressible anisotropic Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05757v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the anisotropic, incompressible Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes system with variable density in a bounded smooth domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. This work extends previous studies on the isotropic case by incorporating anisotropic surface energy, represented by $\mathfrak{F}= \int_{\Omega} \frac{\epsilon}{2}\, \Gamma^2(\nabla \phi) $. The thermodynamic consistency of this system, as well as its modeling background and physical motivation, has been established in [3,5,7]. Using a Galerkin approximation scheme, we prove the existence of global weak solutions in both two and three dimensions $(d=2,3)$. A crucial element in extending the existence of approximate solutions from local to global lies in the application of Bihari's inequality and a fixed-point argument.</description>

      <title>Weak Serrin-type blowup criterion for the 3D full compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate weak Serrin-type blowup criterion of the three-dimensional full compressible Navier-Stokes equations for the Cauchy problem, Dirichlet problem and Navier-slip boundary condition. It is shown that the strong or smooth solution exists globally if the density is bounded from above, and either the absolute temperature or velocity satisfies the weak Serrin's condition. Therefore, if the weak Serrin norm of the absolute temperature or the velocity remains bounded, it is not possible for other kinds of singularities (such as vacuum states vanish or vacuum appears in the non-vacuum region or even milder singularities) to form before the density becomes unbounded. In particular, this criterion extends those Serrin-type blowup criterion results in (Math. Ann. 390 (2024): 1201-1248; Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 207(2013): 303-316). Furthermore, as a by-product, for the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations, we succeed in removing the technical assumption $\rho_0\in L^1$ in (J. Lond. Math. Soc. (2) 102(2020): 125--142). The initial data can be arbitrarily large and allow to contain vacuum states here.</description>

Abstract: This note is a companion paper to arXiv:1608.01630 [math.CA]. Here we generalize some of the geometric results of arXiv:1608.01630 [math.CA] to the case of a $3\times 3$ matrix function $A(x)\approx \mathrm{diag}\{1,f(x_1), g(x_1)\}$. More precisely, we make explicit calculations of the geodesics in the Carnot-Carath\'{e}odory space associated to $A$, and provide estimates on the Lebesgue measures of metric balls centered at the origin in that space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a priori estimates of possibly sign-changing solutions to superlinear parabolic problems and their applications (blow-up rates, energy blow-up, continuity of blow-up time, existence of nontrivial steady states etc). Our estimates are based mainly on energy, interpolation and bootstrap arguments, but we also use the Pohozaev identity, for example. We first discuss some known results on local problems and then consider problems with nonlocal nonlinearities or nonlocal differential operators. In particular, we deal with the fractional Laplacian and nonlinearities of Choquard type.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Keller-Segel system with a volume-filling effect and study its incompressible limit. Due to the presence of logistic-type sensitivity, $K=1$ is the critical threshold. When $K&gt;1$, as the diffusion exponent tends to infinity, by supposing the weak limit of $u^2_m$, we prove that the limiting system becomes a Hele-Shaw type free boundary problem. For $K\le 1$, we justify that the stiff pressure effect ($\Delta P_\infty$) vanishes, resulting in the limiting system being a hyperbolic Keller-Segel system. Compared to previous studies, the new challenge arises from the stronger nonlinearity induced by the logistic chemotactic sensitivity. To address this, our first novel finding is the proof of strong convergence of the density on the support of the limiting pressure, thus confirming the validity of the \emph{complementarity relation} for all $K&gt;0$. Furthermore, specifically for the case $K\le1$, by introducing the \emph{kinetic formulation}, we verify the strong limit of the density required to reach the incompressible limit.</description>

      <title>Long-Time behavior of the tangential surface Navier-Stokes equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the initial-value problem for the incompressible tangential Navier-Stokes equation with variable viscosity on a given two-dimensional surface without boundary. Existence of global weak and strong solutions under inhomogeneous forcing is proved by a fixed-point and continuation argument. Continuous dependence on data, backward uniqueness, and instantaneous regularization are also discussed. Depending on the effect of the inhomogeneous forcing on the dissipative and the nondissipative components of the system, we investigate the long-time behavior of solutions. We prove the existence and properties of the $\sigma$-global attractor, in the case of bounded trajectories, and of the so-called unbounded attractor, for unbounded trajectories.</description>

      <title>A critical nonlinearity for blow-up in a higher-dimensional chemotaxis system with indirect signal production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Neumann problem in balls $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\in\{3,4\}$, for the chemotaxis system \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} u_t = \Delta u - \nabla \cdot (u\nabla v), \\[1mm] 0 = \Delta v - \mu^{(w)}(t) + w, \quad \mu^{(w)}(t) = \frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_\Omega w \\[1mm] w_t = \Delta w - w + f(u), \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} is considered. Under the assumption that $f\in C^1([0,\infty))$ is such that $f(\xi) \ge k\xi^\sigma$ for all $\xi\ge 0$ and some $k&gt;0$ and $\sigma&gt;\frac{4}{n}$, it is shown that finite-time blow-up occurs for some radially symmetric solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent results regarding the problem of the stability of Sobolev inequalities on Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature lower bounds. We shall describe techniques and methods from smooth and non-smooth geometry, the fruitful combination of which revealed particularly effective. Furthermore, we present a self-contained overview of the proof of the stability of the Sobolev inequality on manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and Euclidean volume growth, adopting a direct strategy tailored to this setting. Finally, we discuss related stability results and present some open problems.</description>

      <title>Radial symmetry of rotating vortex patches to the 2D Euler equation in a disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the radial symmetry properties of stationary and uniformly rotating vortex patches of the 2D Euler equation in the unit disc. We prove that every uniformly rotating patch with angular velocity $\Omega\le 0$ or $\Omega \ge 1/2$ must be radial, where both bounds are sharp. The conclusion holds under the assumption that the rotating patch considered is disconnected, with its boundaries consisting of several Jordan curves. The proof is based on the symmetry properties of non-negative solutions to elliptic problems. A newly tailored approach was developed to address the symmetries of non-negative solutions to piecewise coupled semi-linear elliptic equations.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, we show that the global solution to (partially) damped Klein-Gordon equation on the three dimensional Euclidean space with small data decays exponentially. The key ingredients in the proof are: Morawetz-type estimates for solutions with small data and Ruiz's unique continuation principle for wave equations.</description>

      <title>Boundary value problems for 0-elliptic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a manifold with boundary, and let $L$ be a 0-elliptic operator on X which is semi-Fredholm essentially surjective with infinite-dimensional kernel. Examples include Hodge Laplacians and Dirac operators on conformally compact manifolds. We construct left and right parametrices for L when supplemented with appropriate elliptic boundary conditions. The construction relies on a new calculus of pseudodifferential operators on functions over both $X$ and $\partial X$, which we call the "symbolic 0-calculus". This new calculus supplements the ordinary 0-calculus of Mazzeo--Melrose, enabling it to handle boundary value problems. In the original 0-calculus, operators are characterized as polyhomogeneous right densities on a blow-up of $X^2$. By contrast, operators in the symbolic 0-calculus are characterized (locally near each point of the boundary of the diagonal) as quantizations of polyhomogeneous symbols on appropriate blown-up model spaces.</description>

      <title>Analysis of an Inelastic Contact Problem for the Damped Wave Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the dynamic behavior of a viscoelastic string oscillating above a rigid obstacle in a one-dimensional setting, accounting for inelastic contact between the string and the obstacle. We construct a global-in-time weak solution to this problem by using an approximation method that incorporates a penalizing repulsive force of the form $\frac1\varepsilon\chi_{\{\eta&lt;0\}} (\partial_t\eta)^-$. The weak solution exhibits well-controlled energy dissipation, occurring only during contact on a set of zero measure and exclusively when the string moves downward. Furthermore, the velocity is shown to vanish after contact in a specific weak sense. This model serves as a simplified framework for studying contact problems in fluid-structure interaction contexts.</description>

Abstract: The hot spots conjecture asserts that for any convex bounded domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb R^d$, the first non-trivial Neumann eigenfunction of the Laplace operator in $\Omega$ attains its maximum at the boundary. We construct counterexamples to the conjecture for all sufficiently large values of $d$. The construction is based on an extension of the conjecture from convex sets to log-concave measures.</description>

      <title>On generalized Sobolev-Orlicz spaces associated to the Riesz fractional gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of function spaces, the fractional generalized Sobolev-Orlicz spaces $\Lambda^{s,A}_0(\Omega)$, where $A$ is a generalized $\Phi$-function satisfying the $(\mathrm{Inc})_{p}$ and $(\mathrm{Dec})_{q}$ conditions for $1&lt;p\leq q&lt;\infty$, as an extension of the Lions-Calder\'on spaces (also known as Bessel potential spaces) $\Lambda^{s,p}_0(\Omega)$ when $0&lt;s&lt;1$ to the generalized Orlicz framework. We obtain some continuous and compact embeddings for these spaces and study the continuous dependence of the Riesz fractional gradient $D^s$ with respect to $s\in[0,1]$ as $s\to \sigma\in[0,1]$. Finally, we apply these results to study the existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence of a family of partial differential equations depending on the Riesz fractional gradient as $s\to\sigma\in(0,1]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the inverse problem of simultaneously recovering two classes of quasilinear terms appearing in a parabolic equation from boundary measurements. It is motivated by several industrial and scientific applications, including the problems of heat conduction and population dynamics, and we study the issue of stability. More precisely, we derive simultaneous Lipschitz and H\"older stability estimates for two separate classes of quasilinear terms. The analysis combines different arguments including the linearization technique with a novel construction of singular solutions and properties of solutions of parabolic equations with nonsmooth boundary conditions. These stability results may be useful for deriving the convergence rate of numerical reconstruction schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we address the problem of determining a domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$ that minimizes the first eigenvalue of the Lam\'e system under a volume constraint. We begin by establishing the existence of such an optimal domain within the class of quasi-open sets, showing that in the physically relevant dimensions $N = 2$ and $3$, the optimal domain is indeed an open set. Additionally, we derive both first and second-order optimality conditions. Leveraging these conditions, we demonstrate that in two dimensions, the disk cannot be the optimal shape when the Poisson ratio is below a specific threshold, whereas above this value, it serves as a local minimizer. We also extend our analysis to show that the disk is nonoptimal for Poisson ratios $\nu$ satisfying $\nu \leq 0.4$.</description>

      <title>Acceleration or finite speed propagation in integro-differential equations with logarithmic Allee effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying propagation phenomena in integro-differential equations with a weakly degenerate non-linearity. The reaction term can be seen as an intermediate between the classical logistic (or Fisher-KPP) non-linearity and the standard weak Allee effect one. We study the effect of the tails of the dispersal kernel on the rate of expansion. When the tail of the kernel is sub-exponential, the exact separation between existence and non-existence of travelling waves is exhibited. This, in turn, provides the exact separation between finite speed propagation and acceleration in the Cauchy problem. Moreover, the exact rates of acceleration for dispersal kernels with sub-exponential and algebraic tails are provided. Our approach is generic and covers a large variety of dispersal kernels including those leading to convolution and fractional Laplace operators. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate our results.</description>

Abstract: Upper bounds are obtained for the $p$-capacity of compact sets in $\R^d$, with $d \ge 2$ and $1&lt;p&lt;d$. Upper and lower bounds are obtained for the product of $p$-capacity and powers of the $q$-torsional rigidity over the collection of all non-empty, open, bounded and convex sets in $\R^d$ with either a perimeter constraint, or a measure constraint, or a combination of perimeter and measure constraints. For some range of parameters we identify the ball as the unique (up to homotheties) maximiser or minimiser respectively.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a discrete selection-mutation model with exponentially decaying mutation kernel to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we derive a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with obstacle from a discrete linear integro-differential model in population dynamics, with exponentially decaying mutation kernel. The fact that the kernel has exponential decay leads to a modification of the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation obtained previously from continuous models in \cite{BMP}. We consider a population parameterized by a scaling parameter $K$ and composed of individuals characterized by a quantitative trait, subject to selection and mutation. In the regime of large population $K\rightarrow +\infty,$ small mutations and large time we prove that the WKB transformation of the density converges to the unique viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with obstacle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the following nonlocal equation: \begin{equation*} -\left(a+b\|\nabla u\|_{2}^{2(\theta-1)}\right) \Delta u =\lambda u+\alpha (I_{\mu}\ast|u|^{q})|u|^{q-2}u+(I_{\mu}\ast|u|^{p})|u|^{p-2}u \ \hbox{in} \ \mathbb{R}^{N}, \end{equation*} with the prescribed norm $ \int_{\mathbb{R}^{N}} |u|^{2}= c^2,$ where $N\geq 3$, $0&lt;\mu&lt;N$, $a,b,c&gt;0$, $1&lt;\theta&lt;\frac{2N-\mu}{N-2}$, $\frac{2N-\mu}{N}&lt;q&lt;p\leq \frac{2N-\mu}{N-2}$, $\alpha&gt;0$ is a suitably small real parameter, $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ is the unknown parameter which appears as the Lagrange's multiplier and $I_{\mu}$ is the Riesz potential. We establish existence and multiplicity results and further demonstrate the existence of ground state solutions under the suitable range of $\alpha$. We demonstrate the existence of solution in the case of $q$ is $L^2-$supercritical and $p= \frac{2N-\mu}{N-2}$, which is not investigated in the literature till now. In addition, we present certain asymptotic properties of the solutions. To establish the existence results, we rely on variational methods, with a particular focus on the mountain pass theorem, the min-max principle, and Ekeland's variational principle.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of positive supersolutions for semilinear fractional elliptic equations in exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is concerned regarding the nonexistence of positive solutions for nonlinear fractional elliptic inequalities in exterior domains of $\mathbb R^n$, $n\geq1$.
  We would like to highlight the fact that our results are new with very weak assumption on the nonlinear term appearing in the inequalities.
  The results are also novel in this generality
  even if the whole space is considered.</description>

      <title>Interface dynamics in a degenerate Cahn-Hilliard model for viscoelastic phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formal sharp-interface asymptotics in a degenerate Cahn-Hilliard model for viscoelastic phase separation with cross-diffusive coupling to a bulk stress variable are shown to lead to non-local lower-order counterparts of the classical surface diffusion flow. The diffuse-interface model is a variant of the Zhou-Zhang-E model and has an Onsager gradient-flow structure with a rank-deficient mobility matrix reflecting the ODE character of stress relaxation. In the case of constant coupling, we find that the evolution of the zero level set of the order parameter approximates the so-called intermediate surface diffusion flow. For non-constant coupling functions monotonically connecting the two phases, our asymptotic analysis leads to a family of third order whose propagation operator behaves like the square root of the minus Laplace-Beltrami operator at leading order. In this case, the normal velocity of the moving sharp interface arises as the Lagrange multiplier in a constrained elliptic equation, which is at the core of our derivation. The constrained elliptic problem can be solved rigorously by a variational argument, and is shown to encode the gradient structure of the effective geometric evolution law. The asymptotics are presented for deep quench, an intermediate free boundary problem based on the double-obstacle potential.</description>

      <title>Approximating Continuous Spectra of Hyperbolic Systems with Summation-by-Parts Finite Difference Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore the fidelity of numerical approximations to continuous spectra of hyperbolic partial differential equation systems. We are particularly interested in the ability of discrete methods to accurately discover sources of physical instabilities. By focusing on the perturbed equations that arise in linearized problems, we apply high-order accurate summation-by-parts finite difference operators, with weak enforcement of boundary conditions through the simulataneous-approximation-term technique, which leads to a provably stable numerical discretization with formal order of accuracy given by $p = 2, 3, 4$ and $5$. We derive analytic solutions using Laplace transform methods, which provide important ground truth for ensuring numerical convergence at the correct theoretical rate. We find that the continuous spectrum is better captured with mesh refinement, although dissipative strict stability (where the growth rate of the discrete problem is bounded above by the continuous) is not obtained. However, we also find that sole reliance on mesh refinement can be a problematic means for determining physical growth rates as some eigenvalues emerge (and persist with mesh refinement) based on spatial order of accuracy but are non-physical. We suggest that numerical methods be used to approximate discrete spectra when numerical stability is guaranteed and convergence of the discrete spectra is evident with both mesh refinement and increasing order of accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the buckling and clamped-plate problems to the context of differential forms on compact Riemannian manifolds with smooth boundary. We characterize their smallest eigenvalues and prove that, in the case of Euclidean domains, their spectra on forms coincide with the spectra of the corresponding problems. We obtain various estimates involving the first eigenvalues of the mentioned problems and the ones of the Hodge Laplacian with respect to Dirichlet and absolute boundary conditions on forms. These estimates generalize previous ones in the case of functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive quantitative estimates for large stochastic systems of interacting particles perturbed by both idiosyncratic and environmental noises, as well as singular kernels. We prove that the (mollified) empirical process converges to the solution of the nonlinear stochastic Fokker-Planck equation. The proof is based on It\^o's formula for $H_{q}^{1}$-valued process, commutator estimates, and some estimations for the regularization of the empirical measure. Moreover, we show that the aforementioned equation admits a unique strong solution in the probabilistic sense. The approach applies to repulsive and attractive kernels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present numerical minimizers for the first seven eigenvalues of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field in a wide range of field strengths. Adapting an approach by Antunes and Freitas, we use gradient descent for the minimization procedure together with the Method of Fundamental solutions for eigenvalue computation. Remarkably, we observe that when the magnetic flux exceeds the index of the target eigenvalue, the minimizer is always a disk.</description>

      <title>Speckle imaging with blind source separation and total variation deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with optical imaging in strongly diffusive environments. We consider a typical setting in optical coherence tomography where a sample is probed by a collection of wavefields produced by a laser and propagating through a microscope. We operate in a scenario where the illuminations are in a speckle regime, namely fully randomized. This occurs when the light propagates deep in highly heterogeneous media. State-of-the-art coherent techniques are based on the ballistic part of the wavefield, that is the fraction of the wave that propagates freely and decays exponentially fast. In a speckle regime, the ballistic field is negligible compared to the scattered field, which precludes the use of coherent methods and different approaches are needed. We propose a strategy based on blind source separation and total variation deconvolution to obtain images with diffraction-limited resolution. The source separation allows us to isolate the fields diffused by the different scatterers to be imaged, while the deconvolution exploits the speckle memory effect to estimate the distance between these scatterers. Our method is validated with numerical simulations and is shown to be effective not only for imaging discrete scatterers, but also continuous objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1810.11554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of two contiguous incompressible and viscous fluids is described within the diffuse interface theory by the so-called Model H. The system consists of the Navier-Stokes equations, which are coupled with the Cahn-Hilliard equation associated to the Ginzburg-Landau free energy with physically relevant logarithmic potential. This model is studied in bounded smooth domain in R^d, d=2 and d=3, and is supplemented with a no-slip condition for the velocity, homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions for the order parameter and the chemical potential, and suitable initial conditions. We study uniqueness and regularity of weak and strong solutions. In a two-dimensional domain, we show the uniqueness of weak solutions and the existence and uniqueness of global strong solutions originating from an initial velocity u_0 in V, namely u_0 in H_0^1 such that div u_0=0. In addition, we prove further regularity properties and the validity of the instantaneous separation property. In a three-dimensional domain, we show the existence and uniqueness of local strong solutions with initial velocity u_0 in V.</description>

      <title>Dispersion for the wave and Schr\"odinger equations outside a ball and counterexamples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.08366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the wave equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions in the exterior of the unit ball $B_{d}(0,1)$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$. For $d=3$, we obtain a global in time parametrix and derive sharp dispersive estimates, matching the $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ case, for all frequencies (low and high). For $d\geq 4$, we provide an explicit solution at large frequency $1/h$, $h\in (0,1)$, with a smoothed Dirac data at a point at distance $h^{-1/3}$ from the origin in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose decay rate exhibits $h^{-(d-3)/3}$ loss with respect to the boundary less case, that occurs at observation points around the mirror image of the source with respect to the center of the ball (at the Poisson-Arago spot). Similar counterexample are obtained for the Schr{\"o}dinger flow. Moreover, we generalize these counterexamples, first announced in \cite{ildispext}, to the case of the wave and Schr{\"o}dinger equations outside cylindrical domains of the form $B\_{d\_1}(0,1)\times \mathbb{R}^{d\_2}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d=d\_1+d\_2$ and $d\_1\geq 4$, for which we construct solutions, as done \cite{IaIv23} for $d\_1=2$, $d\_2=1$, whose decay rates exhibit a $h^{-(d\_1-3)/3}$ loss with respect to the boundary less case (at observation points around the mirror image of the source with respect to the origin).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rotation modified Kadomtsev Petviashvili equation which is also known as the Kadomtsev Petviashvili Ostrovsky equation, describes the gradual wave field diffusion in the transverse direction to the direction of the propagation of the wave in a rotating frame of reference. This equation is a generalization of the Ostrovsky equation additionally having weak transverse effects. We investigate transverse instability and stability of small periodic traveling waves of the Ostrovsky equation with respect to either periodic or square integrable perturbations in the direction of wave propagation and periodic perturbations in the transverse direction of motion in the rotation modified Kadomtsev Petviashvili equation. We also study transverse stability or instability in generalized rotation modified KP equation by taking dispersion term as general and quadratic and cubic nonlinearity. As a consequence, we obtain transverse stability or instability in two-dimensional generalization of RMBO equation, Ostrovsky-Gardner equation, Ostrovsky-fKdV equation, Ostrovsky-mKdV equation, Ostrovsky-ILW equation, Ostrovsky-Whitham etc.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove a global well-posedness and scattering result for the defocusing conformal nonlinear wave equation in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^d, d \geq 3$. We take advantage of the hyperbolic geometry which yields stronger Morawetz and Strichartz estimates. We show that the solution is globally wellposed and scatters if the initial data is radially symmetric and lies in $H^{\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}(\mathbb{H}^d)\times H^{-\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon}(\mathbb{H}^d)$, $\epsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>The Non-cutoff Boltzmann Equation in Bounded Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00494v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial-boundary value problem for the inhomogeneous non-cutoff Boltzmann equation is a challenging open problem. In this paper, we study the stability and long-time dynamics of the Boltzmann equation near a global Maxwellian without angular cutoff assumption in a general $C^3$ bounded domain $\Omega$ (including convex and non-convex cases) with physical boundary conditions: inflow and Maxwell-reflection (with accommodation coefficient $\alpha&gt;0$) boundary conditions. We obtain the global-in-time existence, which has an exponential decay rate towards the global Maxwellian for both hard and soft potentials. The crucial methods are the forward-backward extension of the boundary problem to the whole space by Vlasov-type equations, an $L^\infty$ trace lemma with an improved velocity averaging lemma, and an extra damping provided by the advection operator, followed by the De Giorgi iteration and the $L^2$--$L^q$--$L^\infty$ method with large $q$.</description>

      <title>Permutation symmetric solutions of the incompressible Euler equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study permutation symmetric solutions of the incompressible Euler equation. We show that the dynamics of these solutions can be reduced to an evolution equation on a single vorticity component $\omega_1$, and we characterize the relevant constraint space for this vorticity component under permutation symmetry. We also give single vorticity component versions of the energy equality, Beale-Kato-Majda criterion, and local wellposedness theory that are specific to the permutation symmetric case. This paper is significantly motivated by a recent work of the author [13], which proved finite-time blowup for smooth solutions of a Fourier-restricted Euler model equation, where the Helmholtz projection is replaced by a projection onto a more restrictive constraint space. The blowup solutions for this model equation are odd, permutation symmetric, and mirror symmetric about the plane $x_1+x_2+x_3=0.$ Using the blowup solution introduced by Elgindi in [5], we are able to prove there are $C^{1,\alpha}$ solutions of the full Euler equation that blowup in finite-time, which are odd, permutation symmetric, and mirror symmetric about the plane $x_1+x_2+x_3=0$.
  We will also prove that divergence-free vector fields that are odd, permutation symmetric, and mirror symmetric about the plane $x_1+x_2+x_3=0$ ($\mathcal{G}_\sigma$ symmetric) are equivalent up to a change of coordinates given by a rotation to divergence-free vector fields that are mirror symmetric about each of the three coordinate axes and symmetric with respect to rotations by $\frac{\pi}{3}$ in the horizontal plane ($\mathcal{G}$-symmetric). The latter discrete symmetry group allows for a Fourier series expansion in cylindrical coordinates that shines a further light on the structure of these symmetry groups, in particular their relation to axisymmetric, swirl-free vector fields.</description>

Abstract: In this work we establish a dispersive blow-up result for the initial value problem (IVP) for the fifth order Korteweg-de Vries equation \begin{align*} \left. \begin{array}{rlr} u_t+\partial_x^5 u+u\partial_x u&amp;\hspace{-2mm}=0,&amp;\quad x\in\mathbb R,\; t&gt;0,\\ u(x,0)&amp;\hspace{-2mm}=u_0(x),&amp; \end{array} \right\} \end{align*} To achieve this, we prove a local well-posedness result in Bourgain spaces of the type $X^{s,b}$ for appropriate values of $s$ and $b$, along with a regularity property for the nonlinear part of that solution. This property enables the construction of initial data that leads to the dispersive blow-up phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Local multiplicity for fractional linear equations with Hardy potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04414v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhibit existence of non-trivial solutions of some fractional linear Schr\"odinger equations which are radial and vanish at the origin. This is in stark contrast to what happens in the local case. We also prove analogous results in the presence of a Hardy potential.</description>

      <title>Longtime and chaotic dynamics in microscopic systems with singular interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the long time dynamics of interacting particle systems subject to singular interactions. We consider a microscopic system of $N$ interacting point particles, where the time evolution of the joint distribution $f_N(t)$ is governed by the Liouville equation. Our primary objective is to analyze the system's behavior over extended time intervals, focusing on stability, potential chaotic dynamics and the impact of singularities. In particular, we aim to derive reduced models in the regime where $N \gg 1$, exploring both the mean-field approximation and configurations far from chaos, where the mean-field approximation no longer holds. These reduced models do not always emerge but in these cases it is possible to derive uniform bounds in $ L^2 $, both over time and with respect to the number of particles, on the marginals $ \left(f_{k,N}\right)_{1\leq k \leq N}$, irrespective of the initial state's chaotic nature. Furthermore, we extend previous results by considering a wide range of singular interaction kernels surpassing the traditional $L^d$ regularity barriers, $K \in W^{\frac{-2}{d+2},d+2}(\mathbb{T}^d)$, where $\mathbb{T}$ denotes the $1$-torus and $d\geq2$ is the dimension. Finally, we address the highly singular case of $K \in H^{-1}(\mathbb{T}^d)$ within high-temperature regimes, offering new insights into the behavior of such systems.</description>

      <title>Elliptic regularity estimates with optimized constants and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the classical theory of linear second-order uniformly elliptic equations in divergence form whose solutions have H\"older continuous gradients, and prove versions of the generalized maximum principle, the $C^{1,\alpha}$-estimate, the Hopf-Oleinik lemma, the boundary weak Harnack inequality and the differential Harnack inequality, in which the constant is optimized with respect to the norms of the coefficients of the operator and the size of the domain. Our estimates are complemented by counterexamples which show their optimality. We also give applications to the Landis conjecture and spectral estimates.</description>

      <title>Existence of Mild Solutions for a Class of Non-Autonomous Conformable Fractional Semilinear Systems and Their Exact Null Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the controllability of systems characterized by conformable fractional-order derivatives. We begin by establishing the existence and uniqueness of the evolution operator for a class of non-autonomous fractional-order homogeneous systems. Using Schauder's fixed-point theorem and the theory of linear evolution systems, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of a mild solution for a class of non-autonomous conformable fractional semilinear systems. This solution does not require the Lipschitz condition on the semilinear parts. Additionally, the paper addresses the exact null controllability of abstract systems. An example is presented to demonstrate the practical applications of the results.</description>

      <title>Sobolev and H\"older estimates for the $\overline \partial$ equation on pseudoconvex domains of finite type in $\mathbb C^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a homotopy formula which yields almost sharp estimates in all (positive-indexed) Sobolev and H\"older-Zygmund spaces for the $\overline \partial$ equation on finite type domains in $\mathbb C^2$, extending the earlier results of Fefferman-Kohn (1988), Range (1990), and Chang-Nagel-Stein (1992). The main novelty of our proof is the construction of holomorphic support functions that admit precise estimates when the parameter variable lies in a thin shell outside the domain, which generalizes Range's method.</description>

      <title>Hanke-Raus heuristic rule for iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel variant of the stochastic gradient descent method termed as iteratively regularized stochastic gradient descent (IRSGD) method to solve nonlinear ill-posed problems in Hilbert spaces. Under standard assumptions, we demonstrate that the mean square iteration error of the method converges to zero for exact data. In the presence of noisy data, we first propose a heuristic parameter choice rule (HPCR) based on the method suggested by Hanke and Raus, and then apply the IRSGD method in combination with HPCR. Precisely, HPCR selects the regularization parameter without requiring any a-priori knowledge of the noise level. We show that the method terminates in finitely many steps in case of noisy data and has regularizing features. Further, we discuss the convergence rates of the method using well-known source and other related conditions under HPCR as well as discrepancy principle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that establishes both the regularization properties and convergence rates of a stochastic gradient method using a heuristic type rule in the setting of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Finally, we provide the numerical experiments to showcase the practical efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the range of the complex Monge-Amp\`ere operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we solve the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation for measures with a pluripolar part in compact K\"ahler manifolds. This result generalizes the classical results obtained by Cegrell in bounded hyperconvex domains. We also discuss the properties of the complex Monge--Amp\`ere operator in some special cases.</description>
