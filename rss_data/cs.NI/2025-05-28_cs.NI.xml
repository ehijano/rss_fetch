      <title>Wideband RF Radiance Field Modeling Using Frequency-embedded 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative frequency-embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) algorithm for wideband radio-frequency (RF) radiance field modeling, offering an advancement over the existing works limited to single-frequency modeling. Grounded in fundamental physics, we uncover the complex relationship between EM wave propagation behaviors and RF frequencies. Inspired by this, we design an EM feature network with attenuation and radiance modules to learn the complex relationships between RF frequencies and the key properties of each 3D Gaussian, specifically the attenuation factor and RF signal intensity. By training the frequency-embedded 3DGS model, we can efficiently reconstruct RF radiance fields at arbitrary unknown frequencies within a given 3D environment. Finally, we propose a large-scale power angular spectrum (PAS) dataset containing 50000 samples ranging from 1 to 100 GHz in 6 indoor environments, and conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method. Our approach achieves an average Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) up to 0.72, and a significant improvement up to 17.8% compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods trained on individual test frequencies. Additionally, our method achieves an SSIM of 0.70 without prior training on these frequencies, which represents only a 2.8% performance drop compared to models trained with full PAS data. This demonstrates our model's capability to estimate PAS at unknown frequencies. For related code and datasets, please refer to https://github.com/sim-2-real/Wideband3DGS.</description>

      <title>Dynamical ON-OFF Control with Trajectory Prediction for Multi-RIS Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to reconfigure wireless environments by dynamically controlling the phase, amplitude, and polarization of impinging waves. However, as nearly passive reflective metasurfaces, RISs may not distinguish between desired and interference signals, which can lead to severe spectrum pollution and even affect performance negatively. In particular, in large-scale networks, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiving node can be degraded due to excessive interference reflected from the RIS. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose in this paper a trajectory prediction-based dynamical control algorithm (TPC) for anticipating RIS ON-OFF states sequence, integrating a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) scheme to predict user trajectories. In particular, through a codebook-based algorithm, the RIS controller adaptively coordinates the configuration of the RIS elements to maximize the received SINR. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TPC method over various system settings.</description>

      <title>Interference Detection in Spectrum-Blind Multi-User Optical Spectrum as a Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing demand for high-bandwidth, low-latency applications, Optical Spectrum as a Service (OSaaS) is of interest for flexible bandwidth allocation within Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) and Open Line Systems (OLS). While OSaaS facilitates transparent connectivity and resource sharing among users, it raises concerns over potential network vulnerabilities due to shared fiber access and inter-channel interference, such as fiber non-linearity and amplifier based crosstalk. These challenges are exacerbated in multi-user environments, complicating the identification and localization of service interferences. To reduce system disruptions and system repair costs, it is beneficial to detect and identify such interferences timely. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a Machine Learning (ML) based architecture for network operators to detect and attribute interferences to specific OSaaS users while blind to the users' internal spectrum details. Our methodology leverages available coarse power measurements and operator channel performance data, bypassing the need for internal user information of wide-band shared spectra. Experimental studies conducted on a 190 km optical line system in the Open Ireland testbed, with three OSaaS users demonstrate the model's capability to accurately classify the source of interferences, achieving a classification accuracy of 90.3%.</description>

      <title>Respond to Change with Constancy: Instruction-tuning with LLM for Non-I.I.D. Network Traffic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification is highly challenging in network security due to the need for extracting robust features from content-agnostic traffic data. Existing approaches face critical issues: (i) Distribution drift, caused by reliance on the closedworld assumption, limits adaptability to realworld, shifting patterns; (ii) Dependence on labeled data restricts applicability where such data is scarce or unavailable. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in offering generalizable solutions across a wide range of tasks, achieving notable success in various specialized fields. However, their effectiveness in traffic analysis remains constrained by challenges in adapting to the unique requirements of the traffic domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel traffic representation model named Encrypted Traffic Out-of-Distribution Instruction Tuning with LLM (ETooL), which integrates LLMs with knowledge of traffic structures through a self-supervised instruction tuning paradigm. This framework establishes connections between textual information and traffic interactions. ETooL demonstrates more robust classification performance and superior generalization in both supervised and zero-shot traffic classification tasks. Notably, it achieves significant improvements in F1 scores: APP53 (I.I.D.) to 93.19%(6.62%) and 92.11%(4.19%), APP53 (O.O.D.) to 74.88%(18.17%) and 72.13%(15.15%), and ISCX-Botnet (O.O.D.) to 95.03%(9.16%) and 81.95%(12.08%). Additionally, we construct NETD, a traffic dataset designed to support dynamic distributional shifts, and use it to validate ETooL's effectiveness under varying distributional conditions. Furthermore, we evaluate the efficiency gains achieved through ETooL's instruction tuning approach.</description>

      <title>Compact routing schemes in undirected and directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of compact routing schemes in weighted undirected and directed graphs.
  \textit{For weighted undirected graphs}, more than a decade ago, Chechik [PODC'13] presented a $\approx3.68k$-stretch compact routing scheme that uses $\tilde{O}(n^{1/k}\log{D})$ local storage, where $D$ is the normalized diameter, for every $k&gt;1$. We present a $\approx 2.64k$-stretch compact routing scheme that uses $\tilde{O}(n^{1/k})$ local storage \textit{on average} in each vertex. This is the first compact routing scheme that uses total local storage of $\tilde{O}(n^{1+1/k})$ while achieving a $c \cdot k$ stretch, for a constant $c &lt; 3$.
  In real-world network protocols, messages are usually transformed as part of a communication session between two parties. Therefore, more than two decades ago, Thorup and Zwick [SPAA'01] considered compact routing schemes that establish a communication session using a handshake. In their handshake-based compact routing scheme, the handshake is routed along a $(4k-5)$-stretch path, and the rest of the communication session is routed along an optimal $(2k-1)$-stretch path. It is straightforward to improve the $(4k-5)$-stretch of the handshake to $\approx3.68k$-stretch using the compact routing scheme of Chechik [PODC'13]. We improve the handshake stretch to the optimal $(2k-1)$, by borrowing the concept of roundtrip routing from directed graphs to \textit{undirected} graphs.
  \textit{For weighted directed graphs}, more than two decades ago, Roditty, Thorup, and Zwick [SODA'02 and TALG'08] presented a $(4k+\eps)$-stretch compact roundtrip routing scheme that uses $\tilde{O}(n^{1/k})$ local storage for every $k\ge 3$. For $k=3$, this gives a $(12+\eps)$-roundtrip stretch using $\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ local storage. We improve the stretch by developing a $7$-roundtrip stretch routing scheme with $\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ local storage.</description>

      <title>Forewarned is Forearmed: A Survey on Large Language Model-based Agents in Autonomous Cyberattacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the continuous evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have advanced beyond passive chatbots to become autonomous cyber entities capable of performing complex tasks, including web browsing, malicious code and deceptive content generation, and decision-making. By significantly reducing the time, expertise, and resources, AI-assisted cyberattacks orchestrated by LLM-based agents have led to a phenomenon termed Cyber Threat Inflation, characterized by a significant reduction in attack costs and a tremendous increase in attack scale. To provide actionable defensive insights, in this survey, we focus on the potential cyber threats posed by LLM-based agents across diverse network systems. Firstly, we present the capabilities of LLM-based cyberattack agents, which include executing autonomous attack strategies, comprising scouting, memory, reasoning, and action, and facilitating collaborative operations with other agents or human operators. Building on these capabilities, we examine common cyberattacks initiated by LLM-based agents and compare their effectiveness across different types of networks, including static, mobile, and infrastructure-free paradigms. Moreover, we analyze threat bottlenecks of LLM-based agents across different network infrastructures and review their defense methods. Due to operational imbalances, existing defense methods are inadequate against autonomous cyberattacks. Finally, we outline future research directions and potential defensive strategies for legacy network systems.</description>

      <title>ALLSTaR: Automated LLM-Driven Scheduler Generation and Testing for Intent-Based RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution toward open, programmable O-RAN and AI-RAN 6G networks creates unprecedented opportunities for Intent-Based Networking (IBN) to dynamically optimize RAN[...]. However, applying IBN effectively to the RAN scheduler [...] remains a significant challenge. Current approaches predominantly rely on coarse-grained network slicing, lacking the granularity for dynamic adaptation to individual user conditions and traffic patterns. Despite the existence of a vast body of scheduling algorithms [...], their practical utilization is hindered by implementation heterogeneity, insufficient systematic evaluation in production environments, and the complexity of developing high-performance scheduler implementations.[...] To address these limitations, we propose ALLSTaR (Automated LLm-driven Scheduler generation and Testing for intent-based RAN), a novel framework leveraging LLMs for automated, intent-driven scheduler design, implementation, and evaluation. ALLSTaR interprets NL intents, automatically generates functional scheduler code from the research literature using OCR and LLMs, and intelligently matches operator intents to the most suitable scheduler(s). Our implementation deploys these schedulers as O-RAN dApps, enabling on-the-fly deployment and testing on a production-grade, 5G-compliant testbed. This approach has enabled the largest-scale OTA experimental comparison of 18 scheduling algorithms automatically synthesized from the academic literature. The resulting performance profiles serve as the input for our Intent-Based Scheduling (IBS) framework, which dynamically selects and deploys appropriate schedulers that optimally satisfy operator intents. We validate our approach through multiple use cases unattainable with current slicing-based optimization techniques, demonstrating fine-grained control based on buffer status, physical layer conditions, and heterogeneous traffic types</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Intelligent Reffecting Surface Aided Near-Field THz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) operating in the terahertz (THz) band has recently gained considerable interest due to its high spectrum bandwidth. Due to the exploitation of large scale of IRS, there is a high probability that the transceivers will be situated within the near-field region of the IRS. Thus, the near-field beam split effect poses a major challenge for the design of wideband IRS beamforming, which causes the radiation beam to deviate from its intended location, leading to significant gain losses and limiting the efficient use of available bandwidths. While delay-based IRS has emerged as a potential solution, current beamforming schemes generally assume unbounded range time delays (TDs). In this letter, we first investigate the near-field beam split issue at the IRS. Then, we extend the piece-wise far-field model to the IRS, based on which, a double-layer delta-delay (DLDD) IRS beamforming scheme is proposed. Specifically, we employ an element-grouping strategy and the TD imposed on each sub-surface of IRS is achieved by a series of TD modules. This method significantly reduces the required range of TDs. Numerical results show that the proposed DLDD IRS beamforming scheme can effectively mitigate the near-field beam split and achieve near-optimal performance.</description>

      <title>Grassroots Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grassroots platforms aim to offer an egalitarian alternative to global platforms -- centralized/autocratic and decentralized/plutocratic alike. Within the grassroots architecture, consensus is needed to realize platforms that employ digital social contracts, which are like smart contracts except that they are among people not accounts and are executed by these people's smartphones not by high-performance servers controlled by parties outside to the contract. Key envisioned grassroots platforms include sovereign democratic digital communities and federations, community banks and their grassroots cryptocurrencies, and digital cooperatives.
  The grassroots architecture can benefit from a consensus protocol that is (i) quiescent, (ii) efficient during low- and high-throughput, (iii) responsive, (iv) blocklace-based, (v) UDP-ready, and (vi) grassroots. The Grassroots Consensus protocol addresses all these requirements while having competitive performance in both low- and high-throughput scenarios and being one of the most concise and elegant consensus protocols for partial synchrony. It achieves that by building on two cutting-edge consensus protocols -- the quiescent high-performance Morpheus and the blocklace-based Cordial Miners, improving the latter's dissemination protocol and making it UDP-ready, and extending the protocol with a constitution and a constitutional amendment component, making it grassroots.</description>
