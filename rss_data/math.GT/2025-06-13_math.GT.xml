      <title>Visual metrics on boundaries of hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an expository article on visual metrics on boundaries of hyperbolic metric spaces. We discuss the construction of visual metrics, quasisymmetries and their invariants, Hausdorff and conformal dimension, and constructions and applications of Gromov's round trees. There is a focus on providing examples throughout. These notes are based on the material of a minicourse given by the author at the 2024 Riverside Workshop in Geometric Group Theory.</description>

      <title>Tetraplectic structures compatible with local quaternionic toric actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a quaternionic analogue of toric geometry by developing the theory of local $Q^n := Sp(1)^n$-actions on 4n-dimensional manifolds, modeled on the regular representation. We identify obstructions that measure the failure of local properties to globalize and define two invariants: a combinatorial invariant called the characteristic pair and a cohomological invariant called the Euler class, which together classify local quaternionic torus actions up to homeomorphism. We also study tetraplectic structures in quaternionic toric geometry by introducing locally generalized Lagrangian-type toric fibrations and show that such fibrations are locally modeled on $\mathbb{R}^n\times Q^n$ using a quaternionic version of the Arnold-Liouville theorem. In the last part, we show that orbit spaces of these actions acquire the structure of quaternionic integral affine manifolds with corners and Lagrangian overlaps, and we classify such spaces by establishing a quaternionic Delzant-type theorem.</description>

      <title>A note on the boundary Dehn twist of $K3$ surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the work of Baraglia-Konno and Kronheimer-Mrowka, the boundary Dehn twist on punctured $K3$ surfaces is nontrivial in the smooth mapping class group relative to boundary. In this short note, we prove that it becomes trivial after abelianization. The proof is based on an obstruction for $\mathrm{Spin}^\mathbb{C}$ families due to Baraglia-Konno and the global Torelli theorem of $K3$ surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any smooth sphere eversion, the number of quadruple point jumps is always odd. In this paper, we introduce a function that detects the first quadruple point jump as the eversion starts. The invariant is a higher-dimensional analogue of Arnold strangeness invariant for plane curves.</description>

      <title>On Singer's conjecture for the fourth algebraic transfer in certain generic degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the finite field $k := \mathbb Z_2$ and $G(q)$ be the general linear group of rank $q$ over $k.$ A well-known open problem in algebraic topology is the explicit determination of the cohomology groups of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}^{q, *}_A(k, k),$ for all homological degrees $q \geq 0.$ The Singer algebraic transfer of rank $q,$ formulated by William Singer in 1989, serves as a valuable method for the description of such Ext groups. This transfer maps from the coinvariants of a certain representation of $G(q)$ to ${\rm Ext}^{q, *}_A(k, k).$ Singer predicted that the algebraic transfer is always injective, but this has gone unanswered for all $q\geq 4.$ This paper establishes Singer's conjecture for rank four in the generic degrees $n = 2^{s+t+1} +2^{s+1} - 3$ whenever $t\neq 3$ and $s\geq 1,$ and $n = 2^{s+t} + 2^{s} - 2$ whenever $t\neq 2,\, 3,\, 4$ and $s\geq 1.$ In conjunction with our previous results, this completes the proof of the Singer conjecture for rank four.</description>

      <title>Cocompact Fuchsian groups with a modular embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Fuchsian group $\Gamma$ has a modular embedding if its adjoint trace field is a totally real number field and every unbounded Galois conjugate $\Gamma^\sigma$ comes equipped with a holomorphic (or conjugate holomorphic) map ${\phi^\sigma : \mathbb{B}^1 \to \mathbb{B}^1}$ intertwining the actions of $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^\sigma$ on the Poincar\'e disk $\mathbb{B}^1$. This paper provides the first cocompact nonarithmetic Fuchsian groups with a modular embedding that are not commensurable with a triangle group. The main result, proved using period domains, is that any immersed totally geodesic complex curve on a complex hyperbolic $2$-orbifold has a modular embedding. Another consequence is that there are infinitely many signatures for which no finite-volume quotient of $\mathbb{B}^1$ with that signature can be an immersed totally geodesic curve on a complex hyperbolic $2$-orbifold.</description>

      <title>A survey of knots and quivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This survey explores knot polynomials and their categorification, culminating in the homological invariants of knots. We begin with an overview of classical knot polynomials, progressing towards the superpolynomial and its role in unifying various knot homologies. Along the way, we provide physical and geometric insights into the unification of the $sl(N)$ Khovanov-Rozansky and the knot Floer homology. We then turn our attention to the intriguing correspondence between knots and quivers, examining how this perspective sheds light on the integrality of BPS states encoded in the Labastida-Mari\~no-Ooguri-Vafa (LMOV) invariants. We will further investigate the knot-quiver correspondence from a physics and geometric side and study the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory $T[Q_K]$ for the quivers.</description>

      <title>A cut-and-paste mechanism to introduce fundamental group and construct new four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simple cut-and-paste mechanism to construct both orientable and nonorientable four-manifolds from a given initial one. This mechanism alters the fundamental group while preserving other essential topological invariants. It avoids codimension two cut-and-paste fundamental group computations and fast tracks the search for fixed-point free involutions. The mechanism proves useful to unveil novel exotic irreducible smooth structures on closed four-manifolds with finite cyclic fundamental group, which include $\Q$-homology real projective four-spaces.</description>

      <title>Yang-Baxter Hochschild Cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04173v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Braided algebras are associative algebras endowed with a Yang-Baxter operator that satisfies certain compatibility conditions involving the multiplication. Along with Hochschild cohomology of algebras, there is also a notion of Yang-Baxter cohomology, which is associated to any Yang-Baxter operator. In this article, we introduce and study a cohomology theory for braided algebras in dimensions 2 and 3, that unifies Hochschild and Yang-Baxter cohomology theories, and generalizes to all dimensions in characteristic $2$. We show that its second cohomology group classifies infinitesimal deformations of braided algebras. We provide infinite families of examples of braided algebras, including Hopf algebras, tensorized multiple conjugation quandles, and braided Frobenius algebras. Moreover, we derive the obstructions to higher deformations, which lie in the third cohomology group. Relations to Hopf algebra cohomology are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Orientation Reversal and the Chern-Simons Natural Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the fundamental property of preservation of relations, underlying resurgent analysis, provides a new perspective on crossing a natural boundary, an important general problem in theoretical and mathematical physics. This reveals a deeper rigidity of resurgence in a quantum field theory. We study the non-perturbative completion of complex Chern-Simons theory that associates to a 3-manifold a collection of $q$-series invariants labeled by Spin$^c$ structures, for which crossing the natural boundary corresponds to orientation reversal of the 3-manifold. Our new resurgent perspective leads to a practical numerical algorithm that generates $q$-series which are dual to unary $q$-series composed of false theta functions. Until recently, these duals were only known in a limited number of cases, essentially based on Ramanujan's mock theta functions, and the common belief was that the more general duals might not even exist. Resurgence analysis identifies as primary objects Mordell integrals: transforms of resurgent functions. Their unique Borel summed transseries decomposition on either side of the Stokes line is the unique decomposition into real and imaginary parts. The latter are combinations of unary $q$-series in terms of $q$ and its modular counterpart $\tilde{q}$, and are resurgent by construction. The Mordell integral is analytic across the natural boundary of the $q$ and $\tilde{q}$ series, and uniqueness of a similar decomposition which preserves algebraic relations on the other side of the boundary defines the unique boundary crossing of the $q$ series. This continuation can be efficiently implemented numerically. This identifies known unique mock modular identities, and extends well beyond. The resurgent approach reveals new aspects, and is very different from other approaches based on indefinite theta series, Appell-Lerch sums, and logarithmic vertex operator algebras.</description>
