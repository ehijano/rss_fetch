      <title>Learning of Statistical Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering microscopic couplings directly from data provides a route to solving the inverse problem in statistical field theories, one that complements the traditional-often computationally intractable-forward approach of predicting observables from an action or Hamiltonian. Here, we propose an approach for the inverse problem that uniformly accommodates systems with discrete, continuous, and hybrid variables. We demonstrate accurate parameter recovery in several benchmark systems-including Wegner's Ising gauge theory, $\phi^4$ theory, Schwinger and Sine-Gordon models, and mixed spin-gauge systems, and show how iterating the procedure under coarse-graining reconstructs full non-perturbative renormalization-group flows. This gives direct access to phase boundaries, fixed points, and emergent interactions without relying on perturbation theory. We also address a realistic setting where full gauge configurations may be unavailable, and reformulate learning algorithms for multiple field theories so that they are recovered directly using observables such as correlations from scattering data or quantum simulators. We anticipate that our methodology will find widespread use in practical learning of field theories in strongly coupled regimes where analytical tools might fail.</description>

      <title>Regularized Unfolding of gamma-ray Spectra for Nuclear Physics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing gamma-ray spectra from detector measurements is an ill-posed inverse problem. Standard methods, such as Folding Iteration with Compton Subtraction (FICS), provide point estimates but lack calibrated uncertainties and may bias the spectrum. We introduce an unfolding framework based on regularized maximum-likelihood estimation (RMLE) that enforces non-negativity and detector-response constraints while explicitly modeling background and contaminant contributions. Simulations and analytical results show that RMLE yields smoother reconstructions with well-calibrated confidence intervals and outperforms existing techniques for low-complexity spectra. Although high-complexity data remain challenging, the intervals produced by RMLE maintain correct coverage.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Cosmological Model Degeneracy with a new evaluate factor G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of fitting cosmological models, parameter degeneracy remains a central issue. This paper critically examines traditional methods for constraining parameters and focuses on the G factor as a tool for evaluating the quality of observational data. To ensure analytical independence, two datasets--Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)--were utilized as samples for parameter fitting, supplemented by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. The Figure of Merit (FoM) matrix served as the final criterion for assessing fitting performance. The results show that the G factor of the CC dataset increases linearly with redshift z, whereas the G factor of the BAO dataset follows a cubic relationship. Further analysis indicates that the FoM value for datasets with high G factors is significantly higher than that for datasets with low G factors, thereby validating the G factor's effectiveness as a tool for assessing observational data quality and reducing parameter degeneracy. This suggests that the G factor may serve as a diagnostic tool and selection criterion for optimizing observational datasets in future research.</description>

      <title>A First Full Physics Benchmark for Highly Granular Calorimeter Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics programs of current and future collider experiments necessitate the development of surrogate simulators for calorimeter showers. While much progress has been made in the development of generative models for this task, they have typically been evaluated in simplified scenarios and for single particles. This is particularly true for the challenging task of highly granular calorimeter simulation. For the first time, this work studies the use of highly granular generative calorimeter surrogates in a realistic simulation application. We introduce DDML, a generic library which enables the combination of generative calorimeter surrogates with realistic detectors implemented using the DD4hep toolkit. We compare two different generative models - one operating on a regular grid representation, and the other using a less common point cloud approach. In order to disentangle methodological details from model performance, we provide comparisons to idealized simulators which directly sample representations of different resolutions from the full simulation ground-truth. We then systematically evaluate model performance on post-reconstruction benchmarks for electromagnetic shower simulation. Beginning with a typical single particle study, we introduce a first multi-particle benchmark based on di-photon separations, before studying a first full-physics benchmark based on hadronic decays of the tau lepton. Our results indicate that models operating on a point cloud can achieve a favorable balance between speed and accuracy for highly granular calorimeter simulation compared to those which operate on a regular grid representation.</description>
