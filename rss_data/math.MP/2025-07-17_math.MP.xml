      <title>Levy Laplacian on manifold and heat flows of differential forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Levy Laplacian is an infinite-dimensional differential operator, which is interesting for its connection with the Yang-Mills gauge fields. The article proves the equivalence of various definitions of the Levy Laplacian on the manifold of $H^1$-paths on a Riemannian manifold. The heat equation with the Levy Laplacian is considered. The tendency of some solutions of this heat equation to the locally constant functionals as time tends to infinity is studied. These solutions are constructed using heat flows of differential forms on the compact Riemannian manifold.</description>

      <title>Modular families of elliptic long-range spin chains from freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the construction of quantum-integrable spin chains with q-deformed long-range interactions by `freezing' integrable quantum many-body systems with spins. The input is a spin-Ruijsenaars system along with an equilibrium configuration of the underlying spinless classical Ruijsenaars-Schneider system. For a distinguished choice of equilibrium, the resulting long-range spin chain has a real spectrum and admits a short-range limit, providing an integrable interpolation from nearest-neighbour to long-range interacting spins. We focus on the elliptic case. We first define an action of the modular group on the spinless elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider system to show that, for a fixed elliptic parameter, it has a whole modular family of classical equilibrium configurations. These typically have constant but nonzero momenta. Then we use the setting of deformation quantisation to provide a uniform framework for freezing elliptic spin-Ruijsenaars systems at any classical equilibrium whilst preserving quantum integrability. As we showed in previous work, the results include the Heisenberg, Inozemtsev and Haldane-Shastry chains along with their xxz-like q-deformations (face-type), or the antiperiodic Haldane-Shastry chain of Fukui-Kawakami, its elliptic generalisation of Sechin-Zotov, and their completely anisotropic q-deformations due to Matushko-Zotov (vertex type).</description>

      <title>The Hudson theorem in LCA groups and infinite quantum spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Hudson theorem states that the Gaussian functions in $\mathbb{R}^d$ are the only functions whose Wigner distribution is everywhere positive. Motivated by quantum information theory, D. Gross proved an analogous result on the Abelian group $\mathbb{Z}_d^n$, for $d$ odd - corresponding to a system of $n$ qudits - showing that the Wigner distribution is nonnegative only for the so-called stabilizer states. Extending this result to the thermodynamic limit of finite-dimensional systems naturally leads us to consider general $2$-regular LCA groups that possess a compact open subgroup, where the issue of the positivity of the Wigner distribution is currently an open problem. We provide a complete solution to this question by showing that if the map $x\mapsto 2x$ is measure-preserving, the functions whose Wigner distribution is nonnegative are exactly the subcharacters of second degree, up to translation and multiplication by a constant. Instead, if the above map is not measure-preserving, the Wigner distribution always takes negative values. We discuss in detail the particular case of infinite sums of discrete groups and infinite products of compact groups, which correspond precisely to infinite quantum spin systems. Further examples include $n$-adic systems, where $n\geq 2$ is an arbitrary integer (not necessarily a prime), as well as solenoid groups.</description>

      <title>Automorphic equivalence within gapped phases of infinitely extended fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove automorphic equivalence within gapped phases of infinitely extended lattice fermion systems (as well as spin systems) with super-polynomially decaying interactions. As a simple application, we prove a version of Goldstone's theorem for such systems: if an infinite volume interaction is invariant under a continuous symmetry, then any gapped ground state is also invariant under that symmetry.</description>

      <title>Higher Structures on Boundary Conformal Manifolds: Higher Berry Phase and Boundary Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of higher Berry connection and curvature in the space of conformal boundary conditions in (1+1)d conformal field theories (CFT), related to each other by exactly marginal boundary deformations, forming a "boundary conformal manifold." Our definition builds upon previous works on tensor networks, such as matrix product states (MPS), where the triple inner product or multi-wavefunction overlap plays the key geometric role. On the one hand, our boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) formulation of higher Berry phase provides a new analytic tool to study families of invertible phases in condensed matter systems. On the other hand, it uncovers a new geometric structure on the moduli space of conformal boundary conditions, beyond the usual Riemannian structure defined through the Zamolodchikov metric. When the boundary conformal manifold has an interpretation as the position moduli space of a D-brane, our higher Berry connection coincides with the NS-NS $B$-field in string theory. The general definition does not require such an interpretation and is formulated purely field-theoretically, in terms of correlation functions of boundary-condition-changing (bcc) operators. We also explore a connection between higher Berry connections and functional Berry connections in the loop spaces of boundary conformal manifolds.</description>

      <title>Space of conformal boundary conditions from the view of higher Berry phase: Flow of Berry curvature in parametrized BCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the connection between two subjects: the space of conformal boundary conditions in boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) and the space of gapped systems characterized by higher Berry phases. We explore this connection by analyzing multi-parameter spectral flow in Dirac fermion BCFTs with continuously parametrized conformal boundary conditions, which are introduced by coupling a CFT to a family of gapped systems. When the gapped systems belong to a nontrivial higher Berry class, the associated conformal boundary conditions induce a flow of the ordinary Berry curvature, resulting in a Chern number pump in the Fock space of the BCFT. This phenomenon is the BCFT analog of Berry curvature flow in one-dimensional parametrized gapped systems, where the flow occurs in real space. Building on this correspondence, we introduce the notions of higher Berry curvature and higher Berry invariants within the BCFT framework. Our results provide a new perspective for studying the topological properties of families of conformal boundary states and gapped ground states: if a family of gapped states belongs to a nontrivial higher Berry class, then the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonians exhibit a multi-parameter spectral flow that carries Berry curvature in the Fock space.</description>

      <title>Semi-classical limit of quantum scattering states for the nonlinear Hartree equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article concerns the long-time dynamics of quantum particles in the semi-classical regime. First, we show that for the nonlinear Hartree equation with short-range interaction potential, small-data solutions obey dispersion bounds and they scatter, where the smallness conditions and the bounds are independent of the small parameter $\hbar\in(0,1]$ representing the reduced Planck constant. Then, taking the semi-classical limit $\hbar\to0$, we prove that the Wigner transforms of such quantum scattering states converge weakly-* to the corresponding classical scattering states for the Vlasov equation. As a direct consequence, we establish small-data scattering for the Vlasov equation without assuming regularity on initial data. Our analysis is based on a new uniform dispersion estimate for the free Schr\"odinger flow, which is simple but crucial to include singular interaction potentials such as inverse power-law potential $\frac{1}{|x|^a}$ with $1&lt;a&lt;\frac{5}{3}$.</description>

      <title>Walking on Archimedean Lattices: Insights from Bloch Band Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Returning walks on a lattice are sequences of moves that start at a given lattice site and return to the same site after $n$ steps. Determining the total number of returning walks of a given length $n$ is a typical graph-theoretical problem with connections to lattice models in statistical and condensed matter physics. We derive analytical expressions for the returning walk numbers on the eleven two-dimensional Archimedean lattices by developing a connection to the theory of Bloch energy bands. We benchmark our results through an alternative method that relies on computing the moments of adjacency matrices of large graphs, whose construction we explain explicitly. As a condensed matter physics application, we use our formulas to compute the density of states of tight-binding models on the Archimedean lattices. While the Archimedean lattices provide a sufficiently rich structure and are chosen here for concreteness, our techniques can be generalized straightforwardly to other two- or higher-dimensional Euclidean lattices.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spin-spin correlators weighted by fermion number measurements with low rapidity threshold in the 2D Ising free-fermion QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the work, we study the averaged number of massive fermions above a low rapidity threshold $Y$, underlying the form-factor expansions of the spin-spin two-point correlators at an Euclidean distance $r$, in the 2D Ising QFT at the free massive fermion point. Despite the on-shell freeness, the spin operators are still far away from being Gaussian, and create particles in the asymptotic states with complicated correlations. We show how the number observables can still be incorporated into the integrable Sinh-Gordon/Painleve-III framework and controlled by linear differential equations with two variables $(r,Y)$. We show how the differential equations and the information of two crucial scaling functions arising in the $r\rightarrow 0$, $e^{Y}r={\cal O}(1)$ scaling limit, can be combined to fully determine the small-$r$ asymptotics of the observables, in the $\lambda$-extended form. The scaling functions, on the other hand, are analyzed by summing the exponential form-factor expansions directly, generalizing the traditional Ising connecting computations. We show carefully, how the singularities cancel in the physical value limit $\lambda \pi \rightarrow 1$ and how the power-corrections that collapse at this value can be resummed. In particular, we show for the physical $\lambda$-value, the scaling functions are related to an integrated four-point function in the Ising CFT and continue to control the asymptotics of the number-observables in the scaling limit up to ${\cal O}(r^3)$.</description>

      <title>Vertex functions for bow varieties and their Mirror Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the vertex functions of finite type $A$ bow varieties. Vertex functions are $K$-theoretic analogs of $I$-functions, and 3d mirror symmetry predicts that the $q$-difference equations satisfied by the vertex functions of a variety and its 3d mirror dual are the same after a change of variable swapping the roles of the various parameters. Thus the vertex functions are related by a matrix of elliptic functions, which is expected to be the elliptic stable envelope of M. Aganagic and A. Okounkov. We prove all of these statements.
  The strategy of our proof is to reduce to the case of cotangent bundles of complete flag varieties, for which the $q$-difference equations can be explicitly identified with Macdonald difference equations. A key ingredient in this reduction, of independent interest, involves relating vertex functions of the cotangent bundle of a partial flag variety with those of a ``finer" flag variety. Our formula involves specializing certain K\"ahler parameters (also called Novikov parameters) to singularities of the vertex functions. In the $\hbar \to \infty$ limit, this statement is expected to degenerate to an analogous result about $I$-functions of flag varieties.</description>

      <title>Expansion creates spin-glass order in finite-connectivity models: a rigorous and intuitive approach from the theory of LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex free-energy landscapes with many local minima separated by large barriers are believed to underlie glassy behavior across diverse physical systems. This is the heuristic picture associated with replica symmetry breaking (RSB) in spin glasses, but RSB has only been rigorously verified for certain mean-field models with all-to-all connectivity. In this work, we give a rigorous proof of finite temperature spin glass order for a family of models with local interactions on finite-connectivity, non-Euclidean expander graphs. To this end, we bypass the RSB formalism entirely, and instead exploit the mathematical equivalence of such models to certain low-density parity check (LDPC) codes. We use code expansion, a property of LDPC codes which guarantees extensive energy barriers around ground states. Together with mild additional assumptions, this allows us to construct an explicit decomposition of the low-temperature Gibbs state into disjoint components, each hosting an asymptotically long-lived state associated with a local minimum of the landscape. Each component carries at most an exponentially small fraction of the total weight, and almost all components do not contain ground states -- which we take together to define spin-glass order. The proof is elementary, and treats various expanding graph topologies on the same footing, including those with short loops where existing approaches such as the cavity method fail. Our results apply rigorously to diluted p-spin glasses for sufficiently large p, and while unproven, we also expect our assumptions to hold in a broader family of codes. Motivated by this, we numerically study two simple models, on random regular graphs and a regular tesselation of hyperbolic space. We show that both models undergo two transitions as a function of temperature, corresponding to the onset of weak ergodicity breaking and spin glass order, respectively.</description>

      <title>Vector tomography for reconstructing electric fields with non-zero divergence in bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In vector tomography (VT), the aim is to reconstruct an unknown multi-dimensional vector field using line integral data. In the case of a 2-dimensional VT, two types of line integral data are usually required. These data correspond to integration of the parallel and perpendicular projection of the vector field along integration lines. VT methods are non-invasive, non-intrusive and offer more information on the field than classical point measurements; they are typically used to reconstruct divergence-free (or source-free) velocity and flow fields. In this paper, we show that VT can also be used for the reconstruction of fields with non-zero divergence. In particular, we study electric fields generated by dipole sources in bounded domains which arise, for example, in electroencephalography (EEG) source imaging. To the best of our knowledge, VT has not previously been used to reconstruct such fields. We explain in detail the theoretical background, the derivation of the electric field inverse problem and the numerical approximation of the line integrals. We show that fields with non-zero divergence can be reconstructed from the longitudinal measurements with the help of two sparsity constraints that are constructed from the transverse measurements and the vector Laplace operator. As a comparison to EEG source imaging, we note that VT does not require mathematical modelling of the sources. By numerical simulations, we show that the pattern of the electric field can be correctly estimated using VT and the location of the source activity can be determined accurately from the reconstructed magnitudes of the field.</description>

      <title>The exact Schur index in closed form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.09705v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schur limit of the superconformal index of a four-dimensional N = 2 superconformal field theory encodes rich physical information about the protected spectrum of the theory. For a Lagrangian model, this limit of the index can be computed by a contour integral of a multivariate elliptic function. However, surprisingly, so far it has eluded exact evaluation in closed, analytical form. In this paper we propose an elementary approach to bring to heel a large class of these integrals by exploiting the ellipticity of their integrand. Our results take the form of a finite sum of (products of) the well-studied flavored Eisenstein series. In particular, we derive a compact formula for the fully flavored Schur index of all theories of class S of type a1, we put forward a conjecture for the unflavored Schur indices of all N=4 super Yang-Mills theories with gauge group SU(N), and we present closed-form expressions for the index of various other gauge theories of low ranks. We also discuss applications to non-Lagrangian theories, modular properties, and defect indices.</description>

      <title>On gauge transformations in twistless torsional Newton--Cartan geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twistless torsional Newton--Cartan (TTNC) geometry exists in two variants, type I and type II, which differ by their gauge transformations. In TTNC geometry there exists a specific locally Galilei-invariant function, called by different names in existing literature, that we dub the `locally Galilei-invariant potential'. We show that in both types of TTNC geometry, there always exists a local gauge transformation that transforms the locally Galilei-invariant potential to zero. For type I TTNC geometry, we achieve this due to the corresponding equation for the gauge parameter taking the form of a Hamilton--Jacobi equation. In the case of type II TTNC geometry, we perform subleading spatial diffeomorphisms. In both cases, our arguments rigorously establish the existence of the respective gauge transformation also in case of only finite-degree differentiability of the geometric fields. This improves upon typical arguments for `gauge fixing' in the literature, which need analyticity.
  We consider two applications of our result. First, it generalises a classical result in standard Newton--Cartan geometry. Second, it allows to (locally) parametrise TTNC geometry in two new ways: either in terms of just the space metric and a unit timelike vector field, or in terms of the distribution of spacelike vectors and a positive-definite cometric.</description>

      <title>Inversion of the Abel--Prym map in presence of an additional involution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike Abel map of the symmetric power of a Riemann surface onto its Jacobian, the Abel--Prym map generically can not be reversed by means of conventional technique related to the Jacobi inversion problem, and of its main ingredient, namely the Riemann vanishing theorem. It happens because the corresponding analog of the Riemann vanishing theorem gives twice as many points as the dimension of the Prym variety. However, if the Riemann surface has a second involution commuting with the one defining the Prym variety and satisfying a certain additional condition, an analog of the Jacobi inversion can be defined, and expressed in terms of the Prym theta function. We formulate these conditions and refer to the pairs of involutions satisfying them as to pairs of the first type. We formulate necessary conditions for the pair of involutions to be a pair of the first type, and give a series of examples of curves with such pairs of involutions, mainly spectral curves of Hitchin systems, and also a spectral curve of the Kovalewski system.</description>

      <title>On entropy and complexity of coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consanguinity of entropy and complexity is pointed out through the example of coherent states of the group $SL(d+1,\C)$. Both are obtained from the K\"ahler potential of the underlying geometry of the sphere corresponding to the Fubini-Study metric. Entropy is shown to be equal to the K\"ahler potential written in terms of dual symplectic variables as the Guillemin potential for toric manifolds. The logarithm of complexity relating two states is shown to be equal to Calabi's diastasis function. Optimality of the Fubini-Study metric is indicated by considering its deformation.</description>

      <title>Numerical Optimization of Eigenvalues of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present numerical minimizers for the first seven eigenvalues of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field in a wide range of field strengths. Adapting an approach by Antunes and Freitas, we use gradient descent for the minimization procedure together with the Method of Fundamental solutions for eigenvalue computation. Remarkably, we observe that when the magnetic flux exceeds the index of the target eigenvalue, the minimizer is always a disk.</description>

Abstract: We show that a sufficient density condition for Gabor systems with Hermite functions over lattices is not sufficient in general. This follows from a result on how zeros of the Zak transform determine the frame property of integer over-sampled Gabor systems.</description>

      <title>$\eta$ regularisation and the functional measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit Fujikawa's path integral formulation of the chiral anomaly and develop a generalised framework for systematically defining a regularised functional measure. This construction extends the $\eta$ regularisation scheme to operator language, making the connection between spectral asymmetry and measure transformation fully explicit. Before recovering Fujikawa's expression for the chiral anomaly from the regularised measure, we explore the deeper number-theoretic structure underlying the ill-defined spectral sum associated with the anomaly, interpreting it through the lens of smoothed asymptotics. Our approach unifies two complementary perspectives: the analytic regularisation of Fujikawa and the topological characterisation given by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. We further investigate how the measure transforms under changes to the regularisation scale and derive a function $\iota_E(\Lambda)$ that encodes this dependence, showing how its Mellin moments govern the appearance of divergences. Finally, we comment on the conceptual relationship between the regularised measure, $\eta$ regularisation, and the generalised Schwinger proper-time formalism, with a particular focus on the two-dimensional Schwinger model.</description>

      <title>The Carrollian Kaleidoscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Carroll group arises in the vanishing speed of light limit of the Poincar\'{e} group and was initially discarded as just a mathematical curiosity. However, recent developments have proved otherwise. Carroll and conformal Carroll symmetries are now ubiquitous, appearing in diverse physical phenomena starting from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity. This review aims to provide the reader a gateway into this fast-developing field. After an introduction and setting the stage with basics of the symmetry in question, we detail the construction of Carrollian and Carrollian Conformal field theories (CCFT).
  We then focus on applications. By far the most popular of these applications is in the context of the construction of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes (AFS) in terms of a co-dimension one dual CCFT. We review the early work on AFS$_3$ /CCFT$_2$ before delving into an in-depth analysis for the construction of the dual to 4D AFS.
  Two other important sets of applications are in hydrodynamics and in condensed matter physics, which we discuss in detail. Carroll hydrodynamics is introduced as the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics first and then reconstructed from a symmetry based approach. Relations to ultrarelativistic flows and connections to the quark-gluon plasma are discussed with concrete examples of the Bjorken and Gubser flow models. In condensed matter applications, we cover connections to fractons, flat bands, and phase separation in Luttinger liquid models. To conclude, we give very brief outlines of other topics of interest including string theory and black hole horizons.</description>
