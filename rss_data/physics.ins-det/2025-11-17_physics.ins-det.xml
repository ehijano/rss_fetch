      <title>In-situ environmental radiation background measurement in the second phase of CJPL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL), the deepest and largest underground laboratory worldwide, provides a low radiation background environment, which is necessary to frontier scientific research, such as the experimental studies of rare-event physics. Due to the almost filled space of CJPL-I and the requirement of future physics experiments, the construction of the second phase of CJPL (CJPL-II) was started in 2020 and all finished in 2024. In this work, we report the measured results of major environmental radiation in CJPL-II, including cosmic-ray muons, radon, gamma rays, and neutrons. Results indicate that the rock overburden and the radioactive background control effectively minimize the environmental radiation background. The scientific data presented also serve as an important basis to detector background modeling for the physics experiments in CJPL-II.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Wave Transmission-Line Reflectionless Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the development of transmission-line reflectionless filters operating with passbands at 100 GHz and 230 GHz, and stopband absorption up to 500 GHz, the highest operating frequencies yet recorded for such filters. The designs are based on a previously reported mathematical solution to the reflectionless condition, now successfully implemented for the first time, using an advanced thin-film fabrication process on Alumina substrates. Sub-millimeter wave wafer probe measurements show good agreement with theory.</description>

      <title>GRANITE: Mechanical Characterization and Optical Inspection of Large-Area TPC Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) for rare event searches will require large-scale, high-precision electrodes. To meet the stringent requirements for mechanical stability and high-voltage performance of such an experiment, we have developed a scanning setup for electrode quality assurance called GRANITE: Granular Robotic Assay for Novel Integrated TPC Electrodes. GRANITE is built around a gantry robot on top of a $2.5\,\text{m}\times1.8\,\text{m}$ granite table, equipped with a suite of non-contact metrology devices.
  We demonstrate the setup's capabilities in two key areas: first, using laser scanners, we characterize wire tension, and in an independent measurement wire deflection due to gravity and electrostatic forces is determined. The setup achieves a precision of $20\,\mu\text{m}$ for the relative measurement of only electrostatic displacement. Furthermore, GRANITE can measure gravitational sag down to $200\,\mu\text{m}$ in an absolute measurement; this precision improves to $50\,\mu\text{m}$ when applying model-based corrections for systematic effects. The performance achieved exceeds the needs for the characterisation of the electrode sagging in future experiments, which typically aims to ensure a maximal sag on the order of $500\,\mu\text{m}$.
  Second, we use GRANITE's high resolution camera to image all wires of XENON1T's cathode grid. Subsets of these images are then hand sorted and used to train an autoencoder, to reliably classify wire images as either pristine wires or images containing severe anomalous features. These anomalies appear e.g. as staining and may be potential defects. The interpretation of the classification results is complicated by the fact that most wire segments are not spotless, but show a varying amount of anomalous features. Follow-up studies are needed to identify the exact nature of such features on wires.</description>

      <title>GRANITE: High-Resolution Imaging and Electrical Qualification of Large-Area TPC Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) for rare event searches will require large-scale, high-precision electrodes. To meet the stringent requirements for high-voltage performance of such an experiment, we have developed a scanning setup for comprehensive electrode quality assurance. The system is built around the GRANITE (Granular Robotic Assay for Novel Integrated TPC Electrodes) facility: a gantry robot on top of a $2.5\,\text{m}\times1.8\,\text{m}$ granite table, equipped with a suite of non-contact metrology devices.
  We developed a coaxial wire scanning head to measure and correlate localized high-voltage discharge currents in air with high-resolution surface images. We find that the identified discharge 'hotspots' are transient and show no significant correlation with static visual features. Next, we established a quantitative relationship between artificially induced abrasive surface damage on the wires and a reduction in the discharge inception voltage. This work provides a novel non-invasive tool for qualifying wires dedicated for use in electrodes for future low-background experiments.</description>

      <title>Measurement of cosmic-ray muon flux at CJPL-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL), the deepest and largest underground laboratory globally, the cosmic-ray muon flux is significantly reduced due to the substantial shielding provided by the overlying mountain. From 2016 to 2020, we measured the muon flux in the second phase of CJPL (CJPL-II) with a plastic scintillator muon telescope system, detecting 161 muon events over an effective live time of 1098 days. The detection efficiency was obtained by simulating the underground muon energy and angular distributions and the telescope system's response to underground muons. The cosmic-ray muon flux is determined to be (3.03 $\pm$ 0.24 (stat) $\pm$ 0.18 (sys)) $\times$ 10$^{-10}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, which is the lowest among underground laboratories worldwide.</description>

      <title>Electrical thermography via centimetre-scale fiber-based distributed temperature sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Raman-based Distributed Temperature Sensor (RDTS) with centimetre-scale resolution for thermographic analysis of electronic circuits. Temperature is measured along a single-mode fiber routed across a custom printed circuit board (PCB) with 1 cm$^2$ heating elements, using optical time-domain reflectometry of Raman signals detected by superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). This approach enables two-dimensional thermal mapping of the PCB under heating configurations with multiple hotspots. A spatial resolution of 3 cm and a temperature accuracy of 2 {\deg}C are achieved with an integration time of 5 minutes. Thermography can be performed down to 77 K, revealing that the PCB thermal resistance decreases by nearly an order of magnitude compared to room temperature, due to enhanced convective cooling in liquid nitrogen. These results establish centimetre-scale RDTS as a robust technique for real-time, spatially resolved thermography of electronic circuits, particularly in regimes where infrared imaging is ineffective, such as at low temperatures or within volumetric electronic architectures.</description>

      <title>An ultrafast plenoptic-camera system for high-resolution 3D particle tracking in unsegmented scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detectors deployed in high-resolution neutrino experiments, particle calorimetry, or dark matter candidate searches require dense and massive active materials and, in some cases, extremely fine segmentation. This is essential for achieving precise three-dimensional tracking of the interaction products and enabling accurate particle-flow reconstruction. Organic scintillator detectors, for example, in the form of scintillating fibres, offer sub-millimetre spatial and sub-nanosecond temporal resolution. However, such systems introduce significant challenges in construction and demand a large number of readout electronics channels, leading to extremely high costs that are difficult to mitigate. In this article, we propose a paradigm shift in the detection of elementary particles that leads to ultrafast three-dimensional high-resolution imaging in large volumes of unsegmented scintillator. The key enabling technologies are plenoptic systems and time-resolving single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array imaging sensors. Together, they allow us, for the first time ever with a plenoptic camera, the reconstruction of the origin of single photons in the scintillator, thereby facilitating an event-by-event analysis. A case study focused on neutrino detection demonstrates the unique potential of this approach, achieving full event reconstruction with a spatial resolution on the order of two hundred micrometres. This work paves the way for a new class of particle scintillator-based detectors, whose capabilities should be further enhanced through future developments and expanded to Cherenkov light detection and calorimetry at collider neutrino experiments, searches for neutrinoless double beta decay, as well as applications such as medical imaging and fast neutron detection.</description>

      <title>Demonstration that Differential Length Changes of Optical Cavities are a Sensitive Probe for Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of differential length oscillations of Fabry-Perot cavities provide a sensitive and promising approach to searching for scalar ultralight dark matter (ULDM). The initial demonstration sets direct lower bounds that are one to two orders of magnitude lower for two model ULDM distributions -- a standard galactic halo and a relaxion star bound to Earth -- ranging over a decade of ULDM mass and Compton frequency. The demonstration suggests how a much higher sensitivity to a much larger ULDM mass range can be obtained.</description>
