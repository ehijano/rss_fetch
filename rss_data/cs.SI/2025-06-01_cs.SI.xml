      <title>FinRipple: Aligning Large Language Models with Financial Market for Event Ripple Effect Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial markets exhibit complex dynamics where localized events trigger ripple effects across entities. Previous event studies, constrained by static single-company analyses and simplistic assumptions, fail to capture these ripple effects. While large language models (LLMs) offer emergent reasoning capabilities, their direct application falters due to structural market unawareness and limited capacity to analyze ripple effects. We propose FinRipple, an elegant framework that empowers LLMs with the ability to analyze ripple effects through financial theory-guided large-scale reinforcement learning. We begin by relaxing the assumptions of previous methods, incorporating a time-varying knowledge graph to accurately represent market structure. By seamlessly integrating classical asset pricing theory, we align the LLM with the market, enabling it to predict ripple effects. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide a standardized definition of ripple effect prediction, a task that is extremely important yet unexplored in the financial domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinRipple provides a promising solution to this task.</description>

      <title>Why Academics Are Leaving Twitter for Bluesky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the migration of 300,000 academic users from Twitter/X to Bluesky between 2023 and early 2025, combining rich bibliometric data, longitudinal social-media activity, and a novel cross-platform identity-matching pipeline. We show that 18% of scholars in our sample transitioned, with transition rates varying sharply by discipline, political expression, and Twitter engagement but not by traditional academic metrics. Using time-varying Cox models and a matched-pairs design, we isolate genuine peer influence from homophily. We uncover a striking asymmetry whereby information sources drive migration far more powerfully than audience, with this influence decaying exponentially within a week. We further develop an ego-level contagion classifier, revealing that simple contagion drives two-thirds of all exits, shock-driven bursts account for 16%, and complex contagion plays a marginal role. Finally, we show that scholars who rebuild a higher fraction of their former Twitter networks on Bluesky remain significantly more active and engaged. Our findings provide new insights onto theories of network externalities, directional influence, and platform migration, highlighting information sources' central role in overcoming switching costs.</description>

      <title>Detection of Suicidal Risk on Social Media: A Hybrid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suicidal thoughts and behaviors are increasingly recognized as a critical societal concern, highlighting the urgent need for effective tools to enable early detection of suicidal risk. In this work, we develop robust machine learning models that leverage Reddit posts to automatically classify them into four distinct levels of suicide risk severity. We frame this as a multi-class classification task and propose a RoBERTa-TF-IDF-PCA Hybrid model, integrating the deep contextual embeddings from Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa), a state-of-the-art deep learning transformer model, with the statistical term-weighting of TF-IDF, further compressed with PCA, to boost the accuracy and reliability of suicide risk assessment. To address data imbalance and overfitting, we explore various data resampling techniques and data augmentation strategies to enhance model generalization. Additionally, we compare our model's performance against that of using RoBERTa only, the BERT model and other traditional machine learning classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid model can achieve improved performance, giving a best weighted $F_{1}$ score of 0.7512.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Knowledge Graphs and LLMs for Structured Generation of Misinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation, further amplified by recent advances in generative AI, poses significant threats to society, impacting public opinion, democratic stability, and national security. Understanding and proactively assessing these threats requires exploring methodologies that enable structured and scalable misinformation generation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) as structured semantic resources to systematically generate fake triplets. By analyzing the structural properties of KGs, such as the distance between entities and their predicates, we identify plausibly false relationships. These triplets are then used to guide large language models (LLMs) in generating misinformation statements with varying degrees of credibility. By utilizing structured semantic relationships, our deterministic approach produces misinformation inherently challenging for humans to detect, drawing exclusively upon publicly available KGs (e.g., WikiGraphs).
  Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of LLMs in distinguishing between genuine and artificially generated misinformation. Our analysis highlights significant limitations in current LLM-based detection methods, underscoring the necessity for enhanced detection strategies and a deeper exploration of inherent biases in generative models.</description>

      <title>HLSAD: Hodge Laplacian-based Simplicial Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose HLSAD, a novel method for detecting anomalies in time-evolving simplicial complexes. While traditional graph anomaly detection techniques have been extensively studied, they often fail to capture changes in higher-order interactions that are crucial for identifying complex structural anomalies. These higher-order interactions can arise either directly from the underlying data itself or through graph lifting techniques. Our approach leverages the spectral properties of Hodge Laplacians of simplicial complexes to effectively model multi-way interactions among data points. By incorporating higher-dimensional simplicial structures into our method, our method enhances both detection accuracy and computational efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing graph methods in detecting both events and change points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a version of the Watts cascade model on directed multiplex configuration model networks, and present a detailed analysis of the cascade size, single-seed cascade probability and cascade condition. We then introduce a smaller class of network models that we call constrained multiplex networks, which allows us to induce patterns in the node activity, i.e. in the participation of nodes on different layers. We find that the choice of induced patterns affects the phase transitions of the cascade model in a variety of ways.</description>

      <title>Generative Knowledge Production Pipeline Driven by Academic Influencers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI transforms knowledge production, validation, and dissemination, raising academic integrity and credibility concerns. This study examines 53 academic influencer videos that reached 5.3 million viewers to identify an emerging, structured, implementation-ready pipeline balancing originality, ethical compliance, and human-AI collaboration despite the disruptive impacts. Findings highlight generative AI's potential to automate publication workflows and democratize participation in knowledge production while challenging traditional scientific norms. Academic influencers emerge as key intermediaries in this paradigm shift, connecting bottom-up practices with institutional policies to improve adaptability. Accordingly, the study proposes a generative publication production pipeline and a policy framework for co-intelligence adaptation and reinforcing credibility-centered standards in AI-powered research. These insights support scholars, educators, and policymakers in understanding AI's transformative impact by advocating responsible and innovation-driven knowledge production. Additionally, they reveal pathways for automating best practices, optimizing scholarly workflows, and fostering creativity in academic research and publication.</description>

      <title>Outgroup Animosity Has Risen for Politicians, Journalists, and a Sample of Partisan Users on Twitter and Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15556v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using language models, we analyze a sample of 67 million tweets and 30 million Reddit comments referencing a set of 215 political entities from 2010-2023 from partisan users, journalists, and politicians. Our analysis indicates outgroup animosity has increased consistently in our sample, with newer cohorts of users expressing higher levels of animosity than previous ones. Moreover, a small fraction of users are responsible for a disproportionate share of this negative content. We observe systematic differences in topic-level outgroup affect across political orientations: right-leaning users are twice as likely to exhibit outgroup animosity when discussing immigration, while left-leaning users show heightened outgroup animosity when discussing healthcare. On Twitter, U.S. politicians on the left exhibit more outgroup animosity than partisan users in our sample, but in the past four years, politicians on the right have experienced the sharpest rise in outgroup animosity, surpassing journalists, media, and partisan users. On Reddit, a small number of communities account for a large share of polarizing rhetoric, with the rise and eventual ban of r/TheDonald significantly shaping polarizing discourse on the right.</description>

      <title>Backfire Effect Reveals Early Controversy in Online Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of online media has significantly facilitated the public's information consumption, knowledge acquisition, and opinion exchange. However, it has also led to more violent conflicts in online discussions. Therefore, controversy detection becomes important for computational and social sciences. Previous research on detection methods has primarily focused on larger datasets and more complex computational models but has rarely examined the underlying mechanisms of conflict, particularly the psychological motivations behind them. In this paper, we present evidence that conflicting posts tend to have a high proportion of "ascending gradient of likes", i.e., replies get more likes than comments. Additionally, there is a gradient in the number of replies between the neighboring tiers as well. We develop two new gradient features and demonstrate the common enhancement effect of our features in terms of controversy detection models. Further, multiple evaluation algorithms are used to compare structural, interactive, and textual features with the new features across multiple Chinese and English media. The results show that it is a general case that gradient features are significantly different in terms of controversy and are more important than other features. More thoroughly, we discuss the mechanism by which the ascending gradient emerges, suggesting that the case is related to the "backfire effect" in ideological conflicts that have received recent attention. The features formed by the psychological mechanism also show excellent detection performance in application scenarios where only a few hot information or early information are considered. Our findings can provide a new perspective for online conflict behavior analysis and early detection.</description>

      <title>Random walk based snapshot clustering for detecting community dynamics in temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of many dynamical systems that describe relationships or interactions between objects can be effectively modeled by temporal networks, which are typically represented as a sequence of static network snapshots. In this paper, we introduce a novel random walk-based approach that can identify clusters of time-snapshots in which network community structures are stable. This allows us to detect significant structural shifts over time, such as the splitting or merging of communities or their births and deaths. We also provide a low-dimensional representation of entire snapshots, placing those with similar community structure close to each other in the feature space. To validate our approach, we develop an agent-based algorithm that generates synthetic datasets with the desired characteristic properties, enabling thorough testing and benchmarking. We further demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of our technique by testing it on various social dynamics models and real-world datasets and comparing its performance to several state-of-the-art algorithms. Our findings highlight the strength of our approach to correctly capture and analyze the dynamics of complex systems.</description>

      <title>PureRank: A Parameter-Free Recursive Importance Measure for Network Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00417v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical parameter-free centrality measures based on the recursive definition of importance (RDI), such as eigenvector centrality and Seeley centrality, are limited to strongly connected networks, while widely used methods like Katz centrality and PageRank rely on free parameters, such as the damping factor, to handle general networks. This motivates our central question: can an RDI-based importance (centrality) measure be defined for arbitrary networks without any tunable parameters? We answer this by introducing $PureRank$, a parameter-free recursive importance measure that faithfully reflects intrinsic network structure. PureRank classifies nodes into recurrent, transient, and dangling classes using strongly connected component (SCC) decomposition, computes local importance vectors for these classes, and aggregates them globally via the RDI principle. This modular, RDI-based design enables parallel and incremental computation -- ensuring scalability even for large or dynamic networks -- and, crucially, reduces to Seeley centrality (a classical and $pure$ RDI-based measure) on strongly connected networks. Furthermore, PureRank admits a probabilistic interpretation via a random-surfer model. Our numerical experiments illustrate that, unlike PageRank, PureRank yields unique and consistent importance scores for any input network. We also present theoretical extensions to signed networks. These results indicate that PureRank is a robust and transparent alternative to classical RDI-based centralities including PageRank.</description>

      <title>Multi-Domain Graph Foundation Models: Robust Knowledge Transfer via Topology Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in CV and NLP have inspired researchers to develop general-purpose graph foundation models through pre-training across diverse domains. However, a fundamental challenge arises from the substantial differences in graph topologies across domains. Additionally, real-world graphs are often sparse and prone to noisy connections and adversarial attacks. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-Domain Graph Foundation Model (MDGFM), a unified framework that aligns and leverages cross-domain topological information to facilitate robust knowledge transfer. MDGFM bridges different domains by adaptively balancing features and topology while refining original graphs to eliminate noise and align topological structures. To further enhance knowledge transfer, we introduce an efficient prompt-tuning approach. By aligning topologies, MDGFM not only improves multi-domain pre-training but also enables robust knowledge transfer to unseen domains. Theoretical analyses provide guarantees of MDGFM's effectiveness and domain generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets validate the robustness and efficacy of our method.</description>

      <title>Can Invisible Psychological Traits Organize Visible Network Structure? A Complex Network Analysis of Myers-Briggs Type Indicator-Based Interaction Patterns in Anonymous Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploration of the impact of personality traits on social interactions within anonymous online communities poses a challenge at the interface of networked social sciences and psychology. We analyze whether Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality types impact the dynamics of interactions on an anonymous chat system with over 288,000 messages from 6,076 users. Using a data set including 940 users voluntarily providing MBTI typing and gender, we create a weighted undirected network and apply network-science measures-such as assortativity, centrality measures, and community detection with the Louvain algorithm-to estimate the level of personality-based homophily and heterophily. Contrary to previous observations in structured social settings, our research shows a dominance of heterophilous interactions (89.3%), particularly among cognitively complementary types, i.e., NT (Intuitive-Thinking) and NF (Intuitive-Feeling). However, there is a moderate level of personality-based homophily (10.7%), notably among introverted intuitive personalities (e.g., INTJ, INFP, INFJ), reflecting an underlying cognitive alignment that persists regardless of identity markers. The interaction network exhibits scale-free properties with a power-law exponent of 1.45. In contrast, gender is a stronger homophily attribute, as evidenced by stronger levels of female users' group interactions compared with male users. While MBTI type influences minor interaction preferences, community structure exhibits low modularity (Q = 0.2584). The findings indicate that, in the absence of identity cues, psychological traits subtly shape online behavior, blending exploratory heterophily with subtle homophilic inclinations.</description>

      <title>NAZM: Network Analysis of Zonal Metrics in Persian Poetic Tradition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study formalizes a computational model to simulate classical Persian poets' dynamics of influence through constructing a multi-dimensional similarity network. Using a rigorously curated dataset based on Ganjoor's corpus, we draw upon semantic, lexical, stylistic, thematic, and metrical features to demarcate each poet's corpus. Each is contained within weighted similarity matrices, which are then appended to generate an aggregate graph showing poet-to-poet influence. Further network investigation is carried out to identify key poets, style hubs, and bridging poets by calculating degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector, and Katz centrality measures. Further, for typological insight, we use the Louvain community detection algorithm to demarcate clusters of poets sharing both style and theme coherence, which correspond closely to acknowledged schools of literature like Sabk-e Hindi, Sabk-e Khorasani, and the Bazgasht-e Adabi phenomenon. Our findings provide a new data-driven view of Persian literature distinguished between canonical significance and interextual influence, thus highlighting relatively lesser-known figures who hold great structural significance. Combining computational linguistics with literary study, this paper produces an interpretable and scalable model for poetic tradition, enabling retrospective reflection as well as forward-looking research within digital humanities.</description>

Abstract: Semi-supervised local community detection aims to leverage known communities to detect the community containing a given node. Although existing semi-supervised local community detection studies yield promising results, they suffer from time-consuming issues, highlighting the need for more efficient algorithms. Therefore, we apply the "pre-train, prompt" paradigm to semi-supervised local community detection and propose the Pre-trained Prompt-driven Semi-supervised Local community detection method (PPSL). PPSL consists of three main components: node encoding, sample generation, and prompt-driven fine-tuning. Specifically, the node encoding component employs graph neural networks to learn the representations of nodes and communities. Based on representations of nodes and communities, the sample generation component selects known communities that are structurally similar to the local structure of the given node as training samples. Finally, the prompt-driven fine-tuning component leverages these training samples as prompts to guide the final community prediction. Experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate that PPSL outperforms baselines in both community quality and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Two-step dimensionality reduction of human mobility data: From potential landscapes to spatiotemporal insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of human mobility is crucial for addressing societal challenges, such as epidemic control and urban transportation optimization. Despite advancements in data collection, the complexity and scale of mobility data continue to pose significant analytical challenges. Existing methods often result in losing location-specific details and fail to fully capture the intricacies of human movement. This study proposes a two-step dimensionality reduction framework to overcome existing limitations. First, we construct a potential landscape of human flow from origin-destination (OD) matrices using combinatorial Hodge theory, preserving essential spatial and structural information while enabling an intuitive visualization of flow patterns. Second, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) to the potential landscape, systematically identifying major spatiotemporal patterns. By implementing this two-step reduction method, we reveal significant shifts during a pandemic, characterized by an overall declines in mobility and stark contrasts between weekdays and holidays. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our framework in uncovering complex mobility patterns and provide valuable insights into urban planning and public health interventions.</description>

      <title>Rewriting Structured Cospans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.09029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To support the study of compositional networks, we further develop the formalism of structured cospans. To enable rewriting, we introduce a category whose objects are structured cospans and characterize conditions under which this category is a topos or is adhesive. We then define a structured cospan grammar and language, using a 2-category framework. As an application, we demonstrate that for various sorts of graphs, hypergraphs, and Petri nets, any grammar induces the same language as its corresponding discrete grammar. This result allows us to extend the inductive perspective of rewriting to these structures.</description>
