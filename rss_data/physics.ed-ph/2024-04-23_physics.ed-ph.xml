      <title>Research in teaching and learning sequence design. To what extent do designers theoretical orientations about learning and the nature of science shape design decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last three decades, various didactic proposals have been published in an attempt to connect theory and research findings with the design of Teaching-Learning Sequences (TLS) in various contexts. Many studies have analysed the process of designing teaching-learning sequences as a research activity. This line of research aims to increase the impact and transferability of educational practice.
  However, the information usually provided about the relation between the theory and research findings with the design of the TLS is insufficiently detailed to provide the basis for a critique. Furthermore, not all TLS proposals include evaluation in terms of learning outcomes and very rarely are these learning outcomes specifically related to the design process. This lack of detailed information on the design and evaluation of proposed TLS makes it difficult to properly assess their potential effectiveness or to systematically discuss and improve their design. In this chapter we want to contribute to make the rationale for design decisions explicit. The aim of this paper is to describe in detail how the theoretical orientations of designers of teaching materials towards cognition and learning can shape the structure and pedagogical strategies of the resulting TLS. We will analyse the relationship of two design tools (Epistemological analysis and Learning demands) to theoretical assumptions about learning and the nature of science. We want to highlight the benefits of reflecting on and discussing theoretical elements and their links to design decisions, which makes TLS design more productive on a practical level to broaden the teaching and learning perspectives of TLS. Finally, we will explore the question to what extent the theoretical orientations of curriculum designers towards cognition and learning can influence the structure and pedagogical strategies of the resulting TLS</description>

      <title>Emission atomic spectra. Individualized computer simulations of laboratory work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the experience of developing and utilizing computer simulations for student laboratory assignments in atomic physics, specifically focusing on emission atomic spectra. The fundamental component of each laboratory assignment is a computer simulator of a spectrograph, which displays atomic line spectra on the monitor screen. The simulator operates by converting the wavelength of radiation into an RGB triplet. Calibration of the spectrograph is conducted using the atomic spectrum of mercury. The configuration of setup parameters and experimental conditions is unique to each student conducting the laboratory assignment using the simulator. Individualized parameters, stored in Google Sheets, are transferred to the HTML template of the laboratory assignment via the Google Apps Scripts service. This individualization of simulator parameters serves to encourage students to engage in independent work.</description>

      <title>Modeling when and how physics PhD students search for a research group: the role of interests and prior research experiences in timely group integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the factors that influence the quality of physics PhD students' doctoral experiences, especially those that motivate them to stay or leave their programs, is critical for providing them with more holistic and equitable support. Prior literature on doctoral attrition has found that students with clear research interests who establish an advisor-advisee relationship early in their graduate careers are most likely to persist. However, these trends have not been investigated in the context of physics, and the underlying reasons for why these characteristics are associated with leaving remain unstudied. Using semi-structured interviews with 40 first and second year physics PhD students, we construct a model describing the characteristic pathways that physics PhD students take while evaluating interest congruence of prospective research groups. We show how access to undergraduate research and other formative experiences helped some students narrow their interests and look for research groups before arriving to graduate school. In turn, these students reported fewer difficulties finding a group than students whose search for an advisor took place during the first year of their PhD. Lastly, we identify two characteristic types of students at a higher risk of leaving their programs: students who enter graduate school with broad interests and struggle to find a group, and students who join a research group early based on research interest alone and subsequently encounter issues with a negative mentoring relationship. This work serves as a major step toward creating a comprehensive model of how PhD students find a research group, and opens the door for future work to investigate how factors such as group culture and working environment impact the search process.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the effectiveness of applying ChatGPT in Dialogic Teaching Using Electroencephalography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, especially the emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has presented significant prospects for application in the field of education. LLMs possess the capability to interpret knowledge, answer questions, and consider context, thus providing support for dialogic teaching to students. Therefore, an examination of the capacity of LLMs to effectively fulfill instructional roles, thereby facilitating student learning akin to human educators within dialogic teaching scenarios, is an exceptionally valuable research topic. This research recruited 34 undergraduate students as participants, who were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group engaged in dialogic teaching using ChatGPT, while the control group interacted with human teachers. Both groups learned the histogram equalization unit in the information-related course "Digital Image Processing". The research findings show comparable scores between the two groups on the retention test. However, students who engaged in dialogue with ChatGPT exhibited lower performance on the transfer test. Electroencephalography data revealed that students who interacted with ChatGPT exhibited higher levels of cognitive activity, suggesting that ChatGPT could help students establish a knowledge foundation and stimulate cognitive activity. However, its strengths on promoting students. knowledge application and creativity were insignificant. Based upon the research findings, it is evident that ChatGPT cannot fully excel in fulfilling teaching tasks in the dialogue teaching in information related courses. Combining ChatGPT with traditional human teachers might be a more ideal approach. The synergistic use of both can provide students with more comprehensive learning support, thus contributing to enhancing the quality of teaching.</description>
