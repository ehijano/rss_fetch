      <title>mRNA-protein assembly reduces fluctuations in a system with bursty transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: mRNA-protein assemblies play a fundamental role in forming membraneless compartments within cells, whose functions may include activating, inhibiting, and localizing reactions. Recruitment of proteins into droplets can diminish cell to cell variability in protein abundance. However, the extent to which mRNA-protein assemblies may also buffer noise arising from transcription is not understood. Complicating study of this question is that models of kinetics typically treat this as a phase separation process, when mRNA-protein assemblies can contain as few as 2 mRNA transcripts, far below the thermodynamic thresholds for phase separation. Here, through stochastic simulations and asymptotic analysis, we quantify noise suppression by mRNA-protein assemblies as a function of gene expression kinetic parameters, and show that assemblies formed from just a handful of mRNAs effectively regulate transcript abundances and suppress fluctuations. We place particular emphasis on how this mechanism can facilitate regulated transcription by reducing noise even in the context of infrequent bursts of transcription. We investigate two biologically relevant models in which mRNA assembly acts to either "buffer" noise by storing mRNA in inert droplets, or "filter" assembled mRNAs by accelerating their decay, and quantify expression noise as a function of kinetic parameters. In either case, the most controlled expression occurs when bursts produce mRNAs close to the assembly threshold, which we find to be broadly consistent with observations of an RNP-droplet forming cyclin in multinucleate \textit{Ashbya gossypii} cells.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Resource-Induced Phase Transitions in Estimation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organisms adapt to volatile environments by integrating sensory information with internal memory, yet their information processing is constrained by resource limitations. Such limitations can fundamentally alter optimal estimation strategies in biological systems. For example, recent experiments suggest that organisms exhibit nonmonotonic phase transitions between memoryless and memory-based estimation strategies depending on sensory reliability. However, an analytical understanding of these resource-induced phase transitions is still missing. This Letter presents an analytical characterization of resource-induced phase transitions in optimal estimation strategies. Our result identifies the conditions under which resource limitations alter estimation strategies and analytically reveals the mechanism underlying the emergence of discontinuous, nonmonotonic, and scaling behaviors. These results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding how limited resources shape information processing in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13639v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situation inside cells. This review discusses three distinct aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets possess complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>
