      <title>Choices in the transformative Anthropocene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unprecedented imbalances and growing human impacts characterize the Anthropocene. It highlights the urgency of better choices, and the perspectives outlined here can inform our decision-making process. The Biocentric-Technological way stresses the need to change the human niche to recalibrate human-ecological interactions in order to halt the process of biosphere transformation. The Bio-Anthropogenic way is a middle path between the extremes, based on strategies that could lead to novel ecosystems and a symbiotic relationship between humans and new organisms. This will require ethical, cultural and technological changes towards a less harmful transformation. The final is the Anthropocentric way, which is the outcome of current human behavior and population growth. Failure to develop new environmentally friendly technologies and cultures will lead to the collapse of current life-support systems, leading to hazardous scenarios. These perspectives can help us to choose a safer and more sustainable future.</description>

      <title>Learning strategies for optimised fitness in a model of cyclic dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major problem in evolutionary biology is how species learn and adapt under the constraint of environmental conditions and competition of other species. Models of cyclic dominance provide simplified settings in which such questions can be addressed using methods from theoretical physics. We investigate how a privileged ("smart") species optimises its population by adopting advantageous strategies in one such model. We use a reinforcement learning algorithm, which successfully identifies optimal strategies based on a survival-of-the-weakest effect, including directional incentives to avoid predators. We also characterise the steady-state behaviour of the system in the presence of the smart species and compare with the symmetric case where all species are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Genealogical processes of sequential Monte Carlo methods and other non-neutral population models under rapid mutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that genealogical trees arising from a broad class of non-neutral models of population evolution converge to the Kingman coalescent under a suitable rescaling of time. As well as non-neutral biological evolution, our results apply to genetic algorithms encompassing the prominent class of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. The time rescaling we need differs slightly from that used in classical results for convergence to the Kingman coalescent, which has implications for the performance of different resampling schemes in SMC algorithms. In addition, our work substantially simplifies earlier proofs of convergence to the Kingman coalescent, and corrects an error common to several earlier results.</description>

      <title>The Rhythm of Aging: Stability and Drift in Human Senescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human aging is marked by a steady rise in mortality risk with age - a process demographers describe as senescence. While life expectancy has improved dramatically over the past century, a fundamental question remains: is the rate at which mortality accelerates biologically fixed, or has it shifted across generations? Vaupel's hypothesis suggests that the pace of aging is stable - that humans are not aging more slowly, but simply starting later. To test this, we analyze cohort mortality data from France, Denmark, Italy, and Sweden. We use a two-step framework to first isolate senescent mortality, then decompose the Gompertz slope into three parts: a biological constant, a potential trend, and a cumulative period effect. The results show that most variation in the rate of aging is not biological in origin. Once non-senescent deaths and historical shocks are accounted for, the Gompertz slope is remarkably stable. The fluctuations we see are not signs of changing senescence, but echoes of shared history. Aging itself, it seems, has stayed the same. These findings suggest that while longevity has shifted, the fundamental rhythm of human aging may be biologically fixed - shaped not by evolution, but by history.</description>
