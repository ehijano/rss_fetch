      <title>Unconventional superconductivity mediated by exciton density wave fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic platforms afford an unparalleled degree of controllability in realizing strongly-correlated phases of matter. In this work, we study the possibility of electrically tunable exciton-mediated superconductivity arising in charge-imbalanced bilayer semiconductors. Focusing on the case of a bilayer semiconductor heterostructure, we identify the gating conditions required to achieve exciton density wave order within a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. We analyze the role of the coupling of excitonic fluctuations to the fermionic charge carriers to find that the Goldstone mode of the density wave order can mediate attractive interactions leading to superconductivity. Furthermore, when the system is close to the density wave ordering, the interactions mediated by low-energy exciton modes can support an interlayer pair-density wave superconductor of anisotropic character. We discuss experimental signatures associated with these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Compass-model physics on the hyperhoneycomb lattice in the extreme spin-orbit regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of spin-orbit entangled magnetic moments of $4d$ and $5d$ transition metal ions on a honeycomb lattice has been much explored in search for unconventional magnetic orders or quantum spin liquids expected for compass spin models, where different bonds in the lattice favour different orientations for the magnetic moments. Realizing such physics with rare-earth ions is a promising route to achieve exotic ground states in the extreme spin orbit limit, however this regime has remained experimentally largely unexplored due to major challenges in materials synthesis. Here we report successful synthesis of powders and single crystals of $\beta$-Na$_2$PrO$_3$, with $4f^{1}$ Pr$^{4+}$ $j_\mathrm{eff}\!=\!1/2$ magnetic moments arranged on a hyperhoneycomb lattice with the same threefold coordination as the planar honeycomb. We find a strongly noncollinear magnetic order with highly dispersive gapped excitations that we argue arise from frustration between bond-dependent, anisotropic off-diagonal exchanges, a compass quantum spin model not explored experimentally so far. Our results show that rare-earth ions on threefold coordinated lattices offer a platform for the exploration of quantum compass spin models in the extreme spin orbit regime, with qualitatively distinct physics from that of $4d$ and $5d$ Kitaev materials.</description>

      <title>Selective synthesis and crystal chemistry of candidate rare earth Kitaev materials: honeycomb and hyperhoneycomb Na$_2$PrO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare earth oxides have attracted interest as a platform for studying frustrated magnetism arising from bond dependent anisotropic interactions. Ordered rock salt compounds Na$_2$PrO$_3$ crystallize in two polymorphs ($\alpha$ and $\beta$) comprising honeycomb and hyperhoneycomb lattices of octahedrally coordinated Pr$^{4+}$ (4$f^1$). Although possible realization of antiferromagnetic Kitaev interactions is anticipated for these phases on the basis of ab initio models, the air-sensitivity of the two polymorphs has hampered reliable crystal growth and physical property measurements. Here, we have succeeded in preparing powder and single crystals of both $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Na$_2$PrO$_3$ using modified synthetic procedures. Revised crystal structures for both polymorphs are obtained from refinement of untwinned single-crystal X-ray diffraction data.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent pressure-dependent on-site Coulomb correction for zero-temperature equations of state of $f$-electron metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $f$-electron materials have many unique properties under pressure, thus of great interest in high-pressure physics and related industrial fields. However, the $f$-electrons pose a substantial challenge to simulations since the electron correlation effects. In this work, we present a first-principles calculation scheme for the equations of state (EoS) of $f$-electron materials. The self-consistent pressure-dependent on-site Coulomb correction is performed based on our recently developed doubly screened Coulomb correction approach. We investigate the zero-temperature EoS over a wide range of pressures and the phase stabilities of four prototypical lanthanide and actinide metals, Pr, Eu, Th and U. The simulated compressive properties are in better agreement with the experimental data than those obtained by conventional density functional theory (DFT) and fixed-parameter DFT+$U$ approaches. The pressure-induced phase transitions can also be well described.</description>

      <title>Charge density wave solutions of the Hubbard model in the composite operator formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the charge density wave phase in the strongly correlated Hubbard model without any other broken symmetry phase. Starting from the atomic Hamiltonian with no hopping, we generate quasiparticle operators corresponding to holons and doublons in the strongly correlated limit of the repulsive Hubbard model. We develop a real space composite operator formalism using the equation of motion technique to include the intersite hopping perturbatively. Our fully self-consistent calculation stabilizes multiple unidirectional translation symmetry broken states within the doping range $\delta=0.07$ to $0.2$. The charge-ordered states become increasingly unfavorable with hole-doping. The unidirectional density waves manifest as periodic modulations of half-filled Mott regions separated by hole-rich regions. Notably, density wave solutions with periods of $3$ to $8$ lattice spacing remain energetically higher than those with larger periods. Quenched disorder on the charge-ordered states induces the merging of the Mott regions and, consequently, forms short-ranged charge modulations. The density of states shows signatures of strongly correlated Mott regions, potentially relevant to the physics of underdoped cuprates.</description>

      <title>Towards an ab initio theory of high-temperature superconductors: a study of multilayer cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant progress towards a theory of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates has been achieved via the study of effective one- and three-band Hubbard models. Nevertheless, material-specific predictions, while essential for constructing a comprehensive theory, remain challenging due to the complex relationship between real materials and the parameters of the effective models. By combining cluster dynamical mean-field theory and density functional theory in a charge-self-consistent manner, here we show that the goal of material-specific predictions for high-temperature superconductors from first principles is within reach. We take on the challenge of explaining the remarkable physics of multilayer cuprates by focusing on the two representative Ca$_{(1+n)}$Cu$_{n}$O$_{2n}$Cl$_2$ and HgBa$_2$Ca$_{(n-1)}$Cu$_n$O$_{(2n+2)}$ families. We shed light on the microscopic origin of many salient features of multilayer cuprates, in particular the $n$-dependence of their superconducting properties. The maximum of $T_c$ for the tri-layer compounds is explained by an intertwined analysis of the charge-transfer gap, superexchange $J$, and inhomogeneous doping between the CuO$_{2}$ planes. We highlight the existence of a minimal doping (4\%) required for superconductivity to emerge. We capture material-specific properties such as the larger propensity of HgBa$_2$Ca$_{(n-1)}$Cu$_n$O$_{(2n+2)}$ to superconduct compared with Ca$_{(1+n)}$Cu$_{n}$O$_{2n}$Cl$_2$. We also find the coexistence of arcs and pockets observed with photoemission, the charge redistribution between copper and oxygen, and the link to the pseudogap. Our work establishes a framework for comprehensive studies of cuprates, enables detailed comparisons with experiment, and, through its \emph{ab initio} settings, unlocks opportunities for theoretical material design of high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Sudden change in entanglement Hamiltonian: Phase diagram of an Ising entanglement Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The form of the entanglement Hamiltonian varies with the parameters of the original system. Whether there is a singularity is the key problem for demonstrating/negating the universality of the relation between the entanglement spectrum and edge energy spectrum. We carefully study the phase diagram of a 1D Ising entanglement Hamiltonian as an example to clarify the long-standing controversy of the general relation between the entanglement Hamiltonian and original Hamiltonian. Interestingly, even if the singularities indeed exist, the Li-Haldane-Poilblanc conjecture, i.e., the general relation between the entanglement spectrum and edge energy spectrum, seemingly still holds.</description>

      <title>Experimental progress in Eu(Al,Ga)$_4$ topological antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-trivial magnetic and electronic phases occurring in topological magnets are often entangled, thus leading to a variety of exotic physical properties. Recently, the BaAl$_4$-type compounds have been extensively investigated to elucidate the topological features appearing in their real- and momentum spaces. In particular, the topological Hall effect and the spin textures, typical of the centrosymmetric Eu(Al,Ga)$_4$ family, have stimulated extensive experimental and theoretical research. In this topical review, we discuss the latest findings regarding the Eu(Al,Ga)$_4$ topological antiferromagnets and related materials, arising from a vast array of experimental techniques. We show that Eu(Al,Ga)$_4$ represents a suitable platform to explore the interplay between lattice-, charge-, and spin degrees of freedom, and associated emergent phenomena. Finally, we address some key questions open to future investigation.</description>

      <title>Field-induced spin liquid in the decorated square-kagome antiferromagnet nabokoite KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum antiferromagnets realizing the square-kagome lattice are proving to be a promising platform for nontrivial phenomena in frustrated magnetism. We carry out a theoretical analysis of the recently synthesized compound nabokoite {\nab} based on a density functional theory energy mapping which establishes an unusual Heisenberg Hamiltonian with a hierarchy of couplings which suggests a description in terms of effective spin liquid models. Owing to the decoration of the square-kagome lattice with a seventh Cu site, nabokoite is characterized by highly frustrated square pyramids that are antiferromagnetically coupled in a chiral arrangement. Employing classical Monte Carlo simulations, we are able to explain the two transitions observed in the low-temperature magnetization curve from the experimental measurements. Remarkably, we show that the low-field phase is only realized when the inter-layer coupling is included. On the other hand, the intermediate-field phase is also found in a purely two-dimensional model and is described by a spin liquid featuring a subextensive degeneracy with a ferrimagnetic component. We show that this phase can be approximated by a checkerboard lattice in a magnetic field. We finally assess the effects of quantum fluctuations in zero fields using the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group method and predict the spin structure factor for comparison with future neutron scattering measurements.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate Transverse Peierls Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In one-dimensional quantum materials, conducting electrons and the underlying lattices can undergo a spontaneous translational symmetry breaking, known as Peierls transition. For nearly a century, the Peierls transition has been understood within the paradigm of electron-electron interactions mediated by longitudinal acoustic phonons. This classical picture has recently been revised in topological semimetals, where transverse acoustic phonons can couple with conducting p-orbital electrons and give rise to an unconventional Fermi surface instability, dubbed the transverse Peierls transition (TPT). Most interestingly, the TPT induced lattice distortions can further break rotation or mirror/inversion symmetries, leading to nematic or chiral charge density waves (CDWs). Quantum materials that host the TPT, however, have not been experimentally established. Here, we report the experimental discovery of an incommensurate TPT in the tetragonal Dirac semimetal EuAl$_4$. Using inelastic x-ray scattering with meV resolution, we observe the complete softening of a transverse acoustic phonon at the CDW wavevector upon cooling, whereas the longitudinal acoustic phonon is nearly unchanged. Combining with first principles calculations, we show that the incommensurate CDW wavevector matches the calculated charge susceptibility peak and connects the nested Dirac bands with Al 3$p_{x}$ and 3$p_{y}$ orbitals. Supplemented by second harmonic generation measurements, we show that the CDW induced lattice distortions break all vertical and diagonal mirrors whereas the four-fold rotational symmetry is retained below the CDW transition. Our observations strongly suggest a chiral CDW in EuAl$_4$ and highlight the TPT as a new avenue for chiral quantum states.</description>

      <title>Observing Altermagnetism using Polarized Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are colinear compensated magnets whose magnetic symmetries at zero spin-orbit coupling break spin degeneracy leading to spin-split electronic and magnonic bands that reflect an underlying multipolar order. When there is an approximate $U(1)$ symmetry the magnons in altermagnets are split into equal and opposite chiral pairs. We show that in altermagnets polarized neutrons provide a means to detect the population of time-reversed domains and allow direct measurement of the magnon chirality anisotropy in momentum space -- the central signature of the altermagnetic phase. We demonstrate this response to polarized neutrons in two candidate materials MnF$_2$ and MnTe and show that the presence of these chiralities is stable to small perturbations that break spin-rotation symmetry. This provides a magnonic analogue of spin polarized ARPES that has been used to discern altermagnetism in the electronic band structures of various candidate materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04291v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization problems are the core challenge in many fields of science and engineering, yet general and effective methods are scarce for searching optimal solutions. Quantum computing has been envisioned to help solve such problems, for example, the quantum annealing (QA) method based on adiabatic evolution has been extensively explored and successfully implemented on quantum simulators such as D-wave's annealers and some Rydberg arrays. In this work, we investigate topological sector optimization (TSO) problem, which attracts particular interests in the quantum many-body physics community. We reveal that the topology induced by frustration in the spin model is an intrinsic obstruction for QA and other traditional methods to approach the ground state. We demonstrate that the optimization difficulties of TSO problem are not restricted to the gaplessness, but are also due to the topological nature which are often ignored for the analysis of optimization problems before. To solve TSO problems, we utilize quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) with a possible realization on quantum computers, which exploits the property of quantum superposition to explore the full Hilbert space and can thus address optimization problems of topological nature. We report the performance of different quantum optimization algorithms on TSO problems and demonstrate that their capability to address optimization problems are distinct even when considering the quantum computational resources required for practical QITE implementations.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Strong-to-Weak Symmetry Breaking via Wightman Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a fundamental role in quantum many-body physics, and a central concept is spontaneous symmetry breaking, which imposes crucial constraints on the possible quantum phases and their transitions. Recent developments have extended the discussion of symmetry and its breaking to mixed states, enhancing our understanding of novel quantum phases that have no counterpart in pure states. Specific attention has been paid to scenarios where a strongly symmetric density matrix exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking to weak symmetry, characterized by the fidelity correlator. In this work, we propose the Wightman correlator as an alternative diagnostic tool. This construction relies on the introduction of the thermofield double state for a generic density matrix, which maps the strong symmetry of the density matrix to the doubled symmetry of the pure state, allowing the Wightman correlator to emerge naturally as a standard probe of symmetry breaking. We prove the equivalence between the Wightman function and the fidelity correlator in defining strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, and examine explicit examples involving spin glasses, thermal density matrices, and the decohered Ising model. Additionally, we discuss a susceptibility interpretation of the Wightman correlator.</description>

Abstract: Conductor materials with good mechanical performance as well as high electrical- and thermal-conductivities are particularly important to break through the current bottle-neck limit ($\sim 100$ T) of pulsed magnets. Here we perform systematic studies on the elastic properties of the Cu-6wt%Ag alloy wires, a promising candidate material for the new-generation pulsed magnets, by employing two independent ultrasonic techniques - resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) and ultrasound pulse-echo experiments. Our RUS measurements manifest that the elastic properties of the Cu-6wt%Ag alloy wires can be improved by an electroplastic drawing procedure as compared with the conventional cold drawing. We also take this chance to test the availability of our newly-built ultrasound pulse-echo facility at Wuhan National High Magnetic Field Center (WHMFC, China), and the results suggest that the elastic performance of the electroplastically-drawn Cu-6wt%Ag alloy wire remains excellent without anomalous softening under extreme conditions, e.g., ultra-high magnetic field up to 50 T, nitrogen / helium cryogenic liquids.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Mediated Nonlinear Optical Responses and Quantum Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unraveling the complexities of nonlinear optical (NLO) responses, particularly the intricate many-body interactions among photons, electrons, and phonons, remains a significant challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we present a diagrammatic approach to explore NLO responses with electron-phonon coupling (EPC), focusing on the phonon-mediated nonlinear optical (Ph-NLO) responses up to the second order in photon perturbation. We systematically analyze the shift and ballistic mechanisms responsible for phonon-mediated electron-photon interactions. By incorporating EPC effects, we elucidate phenomena such as phonon-mediated shift current (Ph-SC) and second-harmonic generation (Ph-SHG) in a comprehensive Ph-NLO framework. This approach enables below-gap resonant responses at terahertz photon frequencies, offering a promising mechanism for terahertz optical applications that surpasses the constraints of conventional pure-electronic NLO theories. Additionally, we explore the geometric and topological consequences of Ph-NLO responses by introducing the EPC Berry curvature, EPC quantum metric, and EPC shift vector. These concepts unveil a unique quantum geometric structure within the Hilbert space, parameterized by both the electronic wavevector and phonon-displacement, thereby extending the established pure-electronic quantum geometry. Using a general Rice-Mele model, we demonstrate the connection between Ph-NLO responses and EPC geometry, discussing the implications and predicting observable effects for future experimental validation. This framework also provides a foundation for advancing first-principles calculations aimed at the discovery and engineering of NLO materials. The insights gained from this study contribute to a more profound understanding of NLO responses and EPC quantum geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of a twisted superconducting bilayer with spin-singlet pairings and Rashba spin-orbital coupling. By introducing the chirality basis, we obtain the effective odd-parity superconductors with the help of spin-orbital coupling. For the twisted bilayer with $d$-wave pairings, two non-Abelian topological phases with Chern number $C=-1$ and $C=-5$ are identified, and the analytical expressions for the boundary of non-Abelian phase are derived as well within the circular Fermi surface approximation. We perform numerical calculations at the twisted angle of Moir\'e lattice, which further verify the topological phase diagram from the effective odd-parity Hamiltonian. For the bilayer with $d$-wave and $s_{\pm}$-wave pairings, we reveal the second-order topological superconductor with Majorana zero mode on each corner, by analyzing the relative configuration of the pairing nodes of superconductors and the Fermi surface of normal state. It is found that the regions of second-order topological phase are narrowed when the bilayer is twisted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of weak symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTs) in the presence of short-range interactions, focusing on the tenfold way classification. Using Atiyah's Real $\mathit{KR}$-theory and Anderson-dualized bordism, we classify free and interacting weak phases across all Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes in low dimensions. Extending the free-to-interacting map of Freed-Hopkins, we mathematically compute how the behavior of free weak SPTs changes when interactions are introduced as well as predict intrinsically-interacting weak phases in certain classes. Our mathematical techniques involve T-duality and the James splitting of the torus. Our results provide a mathematical framework for understanding the persistence of weak SPTs under interactions, with potential implications for experimental and theoretical studies of these phases.</description>

      <title>Quantum-criticality and superconductivity in twisted transition metal di-chalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a model for electronic structure and interactions in twisted transition metal chalcogenide WSe$_2$ for superconductivity. In this material, spin-orbit scattering locks the z-components of spins of low-energy fermions near the Dirac ${\bf K}$ and ${\bf K}'$ points of the hexagonal Brillouin zone, reducing the symmetry of spin-spin interactions to that of an xy model. We show that a nominally repulsive 4-fermion interaction gives rise to an attraction for pairing in a two-component $E^{-}$ channel, which is a hexagonal lattice representation of the $\ell =1$ channel. The gap function is inversion-odd and a linear combination of spin singlet and spin triplet. At weak coupling superconductivity emerges via the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism; we compute $T_c$ for the Fermi-level lying close to the van Hove singularity. At strong coupling, the pairing is mediated by XY magnetic fluctuations peaked at momenta ${\bf K}-{\bf K}' = 2 {\bf K}$ and we estimate $T_c$ using the form of the quantum-critical XY fluctuations, displaying $\omega/T$ scaling.</description>

      <title>Statistics of systemwide correlations in the random-field XXZ chain: Importance of rare events in the many-body localized phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent debates around the many-body localization (MBL) problem, and in particular its stability against systemwide resonances, we investigate long-distance spin-spin correlations across the phase diagram of the random-field XXZ model, with a particular focus on the strong disorder regime. Building on state-of-the-art shift-invert diagonalization techniques, we study the high-energy behavior of transverse and longitudinal correlation functions, computed at the largest possible distance, for a broad range of disorder and interaction strengths. Our results show that while transverse correlations display a fairly stable exponential decay over the entire XXZ phase diagram, longitudinal correlations exhibit markedly different behavior, revealing distinct physical regimes. More precisely, we identify an intermediate disorder region where standard observables show well-converged MBL behavior [J. Colbois et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 116502 (2024)] while the distributions of longitudinal correlations reveal unexpected fat-tails towards large values. These rare events strongly influence the average decay of longitudinal correlations, which we find to be algebraic in a broad region inside the supposed MBL phase, whereas the typical decay remains mostly exponential. At stronger disorder and weaker interactions, this intermediate regime is replaced by a more conventional exponential decay with short correlation lengths for both typical and average correlators, as expected for standard localization. Our findings shed light on the systemwide instabilities and raise important questions about the impact of such rare but large long-range correlations on the stability of the MBL phase. Finally, we discuss the possible fate of the intermediate region in the context of recent perspectives in the field.</description>

      <title>Magnon Nonlinear Hall Effect in 2D Antiferromagnetic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulators has long been challenging due to their zero spontaneous magnetization and stable insulating state, with this challenge being even more pronounced in the 2D limit. In this letter, we propose the magnon nonlinear Hall effect, a second-order thermal Hall response of collective spin excitations in ordered magnets, as a novel approach to investigate 2D AFM insulators. We demonstrate that in layered honeycomb antiferromagnets, the nonlinear thermal Hall effect of magnons, intrinsically coupled to the magnetic order, can be induced and manipulated by a slight external-field perturbation, in contrast to the fermions or phonons. This coupling also gives rise to an intriguing magnetic-layer dependence of magnon nonlinear Hall response that is absent in the linear regime. For instance, in G-type AFM multilayers, this effect is allowed in odd layers but forbidden in even layers. Moreover, in odd layers, the magnon nonlinear Hall response is suppressed by the AFM interlayer coupling, with the strength decreasing as the layer numbers increases. The remarkable tunability and magnetic-dependent characteristics address the limitations of weak responses in AFM insulators, shedding light on 2D AFM spintronics</description>

      <title>Theory of the Spin Seebeck effect induced by crystal-field excitations in Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) is a phenomenon of thermoelectric generation that occurs within a device consisting of a bilayer of a metal and a ferromagnet. When Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (TbIG) is substituted for the ferromagnet, the effect goes to zero at low temperatures, yet it increases to positive values with the application of a magnetic field. This is opposite to the expectation that the SSE should be suppressed by a magnetic field due to the increase in the magnon gap. In this paper, the crystal-field excitations (CFE) in TbIG are calculated within a mean field theory exploiting the parameters of Terbium Gallium Garnet Tb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ (TGG) from the neutron-scattering experimental literature. Like TGG, the primitive cell of TbIG hosts twelve Tb sites with six inequivalent magnetic sublattices, but due to the net $[111]$-molecular field from the tetrahedral and octahedral Fe ions, these can be classified into two distinct groups, the $\mathbf{C}$ and the $\mathbf{C'}$ sites, which account for the `double umbrella' magnetic structure. We show that when an external magnetic field is applied along the [111] direction of the crystal, the lowest CFE of the $\mathbf{C}$ sublattices decreases. As a consequence of the magnetic field dependence of the lowest CFE, we find that at low temperatures the SSE in TbIG can result enhanced by an applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Probing topological phases in a perturbed Kane-Mele model via RKKY interaction: Application to monolayer jacutingaite Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) are promising for spintronics, leveraging strong spin-orbit coupling for efficient spin manipulation via electrical and optical methods, with potential applications in memory storage, quantum computing, and spin-based logic. While the Kane-Mele model effectively captures the low-energy physics of these materials, the impact of perturbations driving phase transitions is less well understood. Developing approaches to describe these phases is crucial. Here, we study the noncollinear Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between two magnetic impurities in a \textit{perturbed} Kane-Mele model with strong spin-orbit coupling, relevant to monolayer jacutingaite Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ as a prominent QSHI. By analyzing RKKY interactions, we reveal distinct, relative (rather than absolute) signatures of the different phase transitions induced by static and dynamic perturbations based on their impact on magnetic impurities. We then employ these perturbations to switch between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic or clockwise and counterclockwise magnetic interactions for control processes. Our results offer a practical way to track topological phases via magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Mutual Gauge Field in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecular Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent breakthrough of realizing the Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules and degenerate Fermi molecules in three dimensions relies crucially on the microwave shielding technique, which strongly suppresses the collision loss between molecules. In this letter, we show that the cooperation of microwave shielding and dipolar interaction naturally leads to the emergence of a synthetic gauge field. Unlike that studied in cold atoms before, this gauge field couples to the relative motion of every two molecules instead of single-particle motion, therefore being a mutual gauge field. In this case, every molecule carrying a synthetic charge sees the other molecule as carrying the source of the magnetic field, and the spatial distribution of the magnetic field is reminiscent of a solenoid attached to the molecule. In other words, in addition to microwave-shielded interaction, another part of the interaction between two molecules behaves as a charge interacting with a solenoid, which was missed in the previous discussion. We argue that the physical manifestation of this gauge field is breaking time-reversal symmetry in the collective spatial motion of molecules. Finally, we discuss the challenges in quantitatively studying such a quantum many-body system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13498v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the doped Mott insulator is a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In this work, we first explicitly identify a new sign structure in the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on the square lattice that replaces the conventional Fermi statistics for weakly interacting electrons. Then we show that the singular, i.e., the phase-string part of the sign structure in the partition function can be precisely turned off in a modified model. The density matrix renormalization group method is then employed to study these two models comparatively on finite-size systems, which is designed to unveil the consequences of the phase-string component. We find that the hole pairing is present not only in the quasi-long-range superconducting phase but also in the stripe phase of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model. However, once the phase-string is switched off, both the superconducting and stripe orders together with the underlying hole pairing disappear. The corresponding ground state reduces to a trivial Fermi-liquid-like state with small hole Fermi pockets that is decoupled from the antiferromagnetic spin background. It is in sharp contrast to the original $t$-$t'$-$J$ model where large Fermi surfaces can be restored in the stripe phase found at $t'/t&lt;0$ or the superconducting phase at $t'/t&gt;0$ in the six-leg ladder calculation. Our study clearly demonstrates that the strong correlation effect in doped Mott insulator should be mainly attributed to the long-range quantum entanglement between the spin and charge, which is, non-perturbatively, beyond a simple spin-charge separation under the no double occupancy constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14254v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge stripes have been widely observed in many different types of unconventional superconductors, holding varying periods ($\mathcal{P}$) and intensities. However, a general understanding on the interplay between charge stripes and superconducting properties is still incomplete. Here, using large-scale unbiased numerical simulations on a general inhomogeneous Hubbard model, we discover that the charge-stripe period $\mathcal{P}$, which is variable in different real material systems, could dictate the pairing symmetries -- $d$ wave for $\mathcal{P} \ge 4$, $s$ and $d$ waves for $\mathcal{P} \le 3$. In the latter, tuning hole doping and charge-stripe amplitude can trigger a $d$-$s$ wave transition and magnetic-correlation shift, where the $d$-wave state converts to a pairing-density wave state, competing with the $s$ wave. These interesting phenomena arise from an unusual stripe-induced selection rule of pairing symmetries around on-stripe region and within inter-stripe region, giving rise to a critical point of $\mathcal{P}=3$ for the phase transition. In general, our findings offer new insights into the differences in the superconducting pairing mechanisms across many $\mathcal{P}$-dependent superconducting systems, highlighting the decisive role of charge stripe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most periodic systems are governed by short-range interactions as long-range interactions in these systems diminish uniformly. In this letter, however, we demonstrate that this is not true for a more general class of systems, which possess long-range order without periodicity, known as quasiperiodic systems. Quasiperiodicity alters the well-known characteristics of the long-range couplings, resulting in anomalous enhancement for arbitrarily long distances, even beyond the mesoscopic scale. By exemplifying the indirect spin exchange interaction, we show that the long-range coupling in a quasiperiodic chain does not attenuate over distance but is instead governed by a novel distance metric, we have named the hyperspace geometric distance. This enables us to remotely control the spins over even mesoscopic distances. Our work provides new paradigms of strongly correlated physics applicable to a broader class of systems beyond the conventional ones.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric bound for saturated ferromagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite its abundance in nature, predicting the occurrence of ferromagnetism in the ground state is possible only under very limited conditions such as in a flat band system with repulsive interaction or in a band with a single hole under infinitely large Coulomb repulsion, etc. Here, we propose a general condition to achieve saturated ferromagnetism based on the quantum geometry of electronic wave functions in itinerant electron systems. By analyzing the spin excitations of multi-band repulsive Hubbard models with an integer band filling, relevant to either ferromagnetic insulators or semimetals, we show that quantum geometry stabilizes the Goldstone mode in the strongly correlated limit. Our theory indicates the stability of ferromagnetism in a large class of insulators and semimetals other than the previously studied flat band systems and their variants. Moreover, we rigorously prove that saturated ferromagnetism is forbidden in any system with trivial quantum geometry, which includes every half-filled system. We believe that our findings reveal a profound connection between quantum geometry and ferromagnetism, which can be extended to various symmetry-broken ground states in itinerant electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Kitaev Interactions Through an Extended Superexchange Pathway in the jeff = 1/2 Ru3+ Honeycomb Magnet, RuP3SiO11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic materials are composed of the simple building blocks of magnetic moments on a crystal lattice that interact via magnetic exchange. Yet from this simplicity emerges a remarkable diversity of magnetic states. Some reveal the deep quantum mechanical origins of magnetism, for example, quantum spin liquid (QSL) states in which magnetic moments remain disordered at low temperatures despite being strongly correlated through quantum entanglement. A promising theoretical model of a QSL is the Kitaev model, composed of unusual bond-dependent exchange interactions, but experimentally, this model is challenging to realise. Here we show that the material requirements for the Kitaev QSL survive an extended pseudo-edge-sharing superexchange pathway of Ru3+ octahedra within the honeycomb layers of the inorganic framework solid, RuP3SiO11. We confirm the requisite jeff = 1/2 state of Ru3+ in RuP3SiO11 and resolve the hierarchy of exchange interactions that provide experimental access to an unexplored region of the Kitaev model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry and Stabilization of Fractional Chern Insulators Far from the Ideal Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of strong electronic interactions, a partially filled Chern band may stabilize a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) state, the zero-field analog of the fractional quantum Hall phase. While FCIs have long been hypothesized, feasible solid-state realizations only recently emerged, largely due to the rise of moir\'e materials. In these systems, the quantum geometry of the electronic bands plays a critical role in stabilizing the FCI in the presence of competing correlated phases. In the limit of ``ideal'' quantum geometry, where the quantum geometry is identical to that of Landau levels, this role is well understood. However, in more realistic scenarios only empiric numerical evidence exists, accentuating the need for a clear understanding of the mechanism by which the FCI deteriorates moving further away from these ideal conditions. We introduce and analyze an anisotropic model of a $\left|C \right|=1$ Chern insulator, whereupon partial filling of its bands, an FCI phase is stabilized over a certain parameter regime. We incorporate strong electronic interaction analytically by employing a coupled-wires approach, studying the FCI stability and its relation to the the quantum metric. We identify an unusual anti-FCI phase benefiting from non-ideal geometry, generically subdominant to the FCI. However, its presence hinders the formation of FCI in favor of other competitive phases at fractional fillings, such as the charge density wave. Though quite peculiar, this anti-FCI phase may have already been observed in experiments at high magnetic fields. This establish a direct link between quantum geometry and FCI stability in a tractable model far from any ideal band conditions, and illuminates a unique mechanism of FCI deterioration.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa theory of $\text{SO}(2N)\rightarrow \text{SO}(N) \times \text{SO}(N)$ spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and study the relativistic Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the $\text{SO}(2N)$ real symmetric second-rank tensor order parameter coupled to $N_f$ flavors of $4N$-component Majorana fermions in 2+1 dimensions. Such a tensor order parameter unifies all Lorentz-invariant mass-gap orders for $N$ two-component Dirac fermions in two dimensions except for the $\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet anomalous quantum Hall state. The value $N_f=1$ corresponds to the canonical Gross-Neveu model. Within the leading-order $\epsilon$-expansion around the upper critical dimension of $3+1$ the field theory exhibits a critical fixed point in its renormalization group flow which describes spontaneous symmetry breaking to $\text{SO}(N)\times \text{SO}(N)$ for the number of flavors of Majorana fermions higher than a critical value $N_{f,c2}\approx 2N$. For $N_{f, c1}&lt; N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$ , with $N_{f,c1} \approx N$ the critical fixed point resides in the unstable region of the theory where the effective potential is unbounded from below, whereas for $N_f &lt; N_{f,c1}$ there is no real critical fixed point, and the flow runs away. In either case, for $N_f &lt; N_{f,c2}$ the transition should become fluctuation-induced first-order, and we discuss the dependence of its size on the parameters $N$ and $N_{f}$ in the theory. One-loop critical exponents for the universality class at $N_{f, c2}&lt; N_f $ are computed and the flow diagram in various regimes is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the high-temperature expansion of the free energy and arbitrary imaginary-time-ordered connected correlation functions of quantum spin systems can be recursively obtained from the exact renormalization group flow equation for the generating functional of connected spin correlation functions derived by Krieg and Kopietz [Phys. Rev. B 99, 060403(R) (2019)]. Our recursive algorithm can be explicitly written down in closed form including all combinatorial factors. We use our method to estimate critical temperatures of Heisenberg magnets from low-order truncations of the inverse spin susceptibility in the static limit. We also calculate the connected correlation function involving three different spin components (chiral non-linear susceptibility) of quantum Heisenberg magnets up to second order in the exchange couplings.</description>

      <title>Absence of a bulk charge density wave signature in x-ray measurements of UTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-sought pair density wave (PDW) is an exotic phase of matter in which charge density wave (CDW) order is intertwined with the amplitude or phase of coexisting, superconducting order \cite{Berg2009,Berg2009b}. Originally predicted to exist in copper-oxides, circumstantial evidence for PDW order now exists in a variety of materials. Recently, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies have reported evidence for a three-component charge density wave (CDW) at the surface of the heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe$_2$, persisting below its superconducting transition temperature. Here, we use hard x-ray diffraction measurements on crystals of UTe$_2$ at $T = 1.9$ K and $12$ K to search for a bulk signature of this CDW. Using STM measurements as a constraint, we calculate the expected locations of CDW superlattice peaks, and sweep a large volume of reciprocal space in search of a signature. We failed to find any evidence for a CDW near any of the expected superlattice positions in many Brillouin zones. We estimate an upper bound on the CDW lattice distortion of $u_{max} \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{\AA}$. Our results suggest that the CDW observed in STM is either purely electronic, somehow lacking a signature in the structural lattice, or is restricted to the material surface.</description>

      <title>Insulating and metallic phases in the one-dimensional Hubbard-Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model: Insights from a backflow-inspired variational wave function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions is studied in a one-dimensional lattice model, by means of a variational Monte Carlo method based on generalized Jastrow-Slater wave functions. Here, the fermionic part is constructed by a pair-product state, which explicitly depends on the phonon configuration, thus including the electron-phonon coupling in a backflow-inspired way. We report the results for the Hubbard model in presence of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger coupling to optical phonons, both at half-filling and upon hole doping. At half-filling, the ground state is either a translationally invariant Mott insulator, with gapless spin excitations, or a Peierls insulator, which breaks translations and has fully gapped excitations. Away from half-filling, the charge gap closes in both Mott and Peierls insulators, turning the former into a conventional Luttinger liquid (gapless in all excitation channels). The latter, instead, retains a finite spin gap that closes only above a threshold value of the doping. Even though consistent with the general theory of interacting electrons in one dimension, the existence of such a phase (with gapless charge but gapped spin excitations) has never been demonstrated in a model with repulsive interaction and with only two Fermi points. Since the spin-gapped metal represents the one-dimensional counterpart of a superconductor, our results furnish evidence that a true off-diagonal long-range order may exist in the two-dimensional case.</description>

Abstract: The parafermionic representation of cluster chain with $\mathbb{Z}_p\times \mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetry protected topological order is constructed and studied for open and periodic boundary conditions. The resulting Hamiltonian is bilinear in particle operators and splits up into two separate chains composed, respectively, of the standard and time reversal parafermions. It has been demonstrated that each subsystem inherits its own $\mathbb{Z}_p$ component from the symmetry, which corresponds to the parity of all constituent particles. For the open chain, the four invariant parafermions, generating zero-energy modes, are identified. They are located at the edges of each chain. For the closed system with the translational invariance, the boundaries are twisted by the total parafermion parity operator. The structure of edge modes and the space-time symmetry of the system, which depend on the chain length and boundary conditions, are studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and spin density wave in AA stacked bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work theoretically analyzes electronic ordering in AA-stacked bilayer graphene and the role of the Coulomb interaction in these many-body phenomena. Using the random phase approximation to account for screening, we find intra-layer effective interactions to be much stronger than inter-layer interactions; under certain circumstances, the latter may also become attractive. At zero doping, the Coulomb repulsion stabilizes the spin-density wave state, with a N{\'e}el temperature in the tens of Kelvin. While dominant in the undoped system, the spin-density wave is destroyed by sufficiently strong doping and a superconducting phase emerges. We find that the effective Coulomb inter-layer interaction can give rise to superconductivity. However, the corresponding critical temperature is negligibly small, and phonon-mediated attraction must be introduced to observe it. Strong intra-layer repulsion suppresses order parameters that couple two intra-layer electrons. We point out a possible superconducting state with finite Cooper pair momentum.</description>

Abstract: We discuss rapidly rotating states of a superfluid. We concentrate on the Giant-Vortex (GV) state, which is a coherent rotating solution with a macroscopic hole at the center. We show that, for any trap, the fluctuations obey an approximately chiral dispersion relation, describing arbitrary shape deformations moving with the speed of the ambient superfluid. This dispersion relation is a consequence of a peculiar infinite symmetry group that emerges at large angular velocity and implies an infinite ground-state degeneracy. The degeneracy is lifted by small corrections which we determine both for smooth traps and the hard trap.</description>

      <title>Creating and controlling global Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entanglement on quantum processors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, also known as two-component Schr\"{o}dinger cats, play vital roles in the foundation of quantum physics and, more attractively, in future quantum technologies such as fault-tolerant quantum computation. Enlargement in size and coherent control of GHZ states are both crucial for harnessing entanglement in advanced computational tasks with practical advantages, which unfortunately pose tremendous challenges as GHZ states are vulnerable to noise. Here we propose a general strategy for creating, preserving, and manipulating large-scale GHZ entanglement, and demonstrate a series of experiments underlined by high-fidelity digital quantum circuits. For initialization, we employ a scalable protocol to create genuinely entangled GHZ states with up to 60 qubits, almost doubling the previous size record. For protection, we take a new perspective on discrete time crystals (DTCs), originally for exploring exotic nonequilibrium quantum matters, and embed a GHZ state into the eigenstates of a tailor-made cat scar DTC to extend its lifetime. For manipulation, we switch the DTC eigenstates with in-situ quantum gates to modify the effectiveness of the GHZ protection. Our findings establish a viable path towards coherent operations on large-scale entanglement, and further highlight superconducting processors as a promising platform to explore nonequilibrium quantum matters and emerging applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the extent and role of inhomogeneity is a pivotal challenge in the physics of cuprate superconductors. While it is known that structural and electronic inhomogeneity is prevalent in the cuprates, it has proven difficult to disentangle compound-specific features from universally relevant effects. Here we combine advanced neutron and x-ray diffuse scattering with numerical modeling to obtain insight into bulk structural correlations in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$. This cuprate exhibits a high optimal transition temperature of nearly 100 K, pristine charge-transport behavior, and a simple average crystal structure without long-range structural instabilities, and is therefore uniquely suited for investigations of intrinsic inhomogeneity. We uncover diffuse reciprocal-space patterns that correspond to prominent nanoscale correlations of atomic displacements perpendicular to the CuO$_2$ planes. The real-space nature of the correlations is revealed through three-dimensional pair distribution function analysis and complementary numerical refinement. We find that relative displacements of ionic and CuO$_2$ layers play a crucial role, and that the structural inhomogeneity is not directly caused by the presence of conventional point defects. The observed correlations are therefore intrinsic to HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$, and thus likely important for the physics of cuprates more broadly. It is possible that the structural correlations are closely related to the unusual superconducting correlations and Mott-localization in these complex oxides. As advances in scattering techniques yield increasingly comprehensive data, the experimental and analysis tools developed here for large volumes of diffuse scattering data can be expected to aid future investigations of a wide range of materials.</description>

      <title>Pairing susceptibility in the weakly interacting multilayer Hubbard model evaluated by direct perturbative expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the interaction, doping, and layer dependence of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing susceptibility of the Hubbard model for a stacked 2D square lattice. We perform a multi-index perturbative expansion up to fourth-order to obtain coefficients in powers of the Hubbard $U$, the inter-layer $V$, and the pair-hopping $J$ interactions. We evaluate the vertex diagrams that contribute to the pairing susceptibility for $\ell= 2,3, 4$ layered models in the $U$-$V$-$J$ interaction space. This provides unprecedented access to the pairing amplitudes, allowing us to identify the processes that enhance or reduce pairing. We distinguish pairing within the diagonal channel, $P^{\parallel}_{d}$, and off-diagonal channel, $P^{\perp}_{d}$, and find that, in the absence of $J$, the qualitative behavior of the layered system is equivalent to the single-layer model. In the presence of $J$, we show that pairing is enhanced sublinearly with increasing $\ell$ and is primarily mediated by the $P^{\perp}_{d}$ component and find which coefficients and diagram sets are responsible. Finally, we construct a generalized $\ell$-dependent equation for $ P^{\perp}_{d}$ to speculate pairing beyond $\ell=4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Layered Nickelates have gained intensive attention as potential high-temperature superconductors, showing similarities and subtle differences to well-known Cuprates. This study introduces a modelling framework to analyze the tunability of electronic structures by focusing on effective orbitals and additional Fermi pockets, mimicking doping or external pressure qualitatively. It investigates the role of the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital in interlayer hybridization, which leads to the formation of a second pocket in the Fermi surface. The resulting effective model also predicts specific charge and spin susceptibility in the form of Lindhard susceptibility at wave vector $\mathbf{q_{0}} = (\pi, \pi)$, which can be tuned by doping or pressure. These results provide valuable insights into tunable orbital contributions and their influence on potential ordering and electronic instabilities in Layered Nickelates.</description>

      <title>Petz map recovery for long-range entangled quantum many-body states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a tripartite quantum state on $A,B,C$ and the erasure channel on $C$, the rotated Petz map is a recovery channel that acts on $B$ to recover the erased quantum information. The infidelity of the best recovery is upper-bounded by the conditional mutual information (CMI). In this work, we study the infidelity of the rotated Petz map on several physically-relevant long-range entangled quantum states. Specifically, we study three classes of quantum phases: (i) steady states of measurement-induced phase transitions, (ii) critical ground state under local measurements, and (iii) chiral states under local measurements. We find that the averaged infidelity of the Petz map recovery sharply distinguishes the three classes: (i) and (ii) are distinguished by the scaling of the infidelity with CMI and (iii) is characterized by an asymmetry of the infidelity with the rotation parameter. We also study Petz map recovery for topological order and find an operational interpretation of the topological entanglement entropy. Our result indicates that recovery fidelity of the Petz map is a useful diagnostic of quantum phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Review: Quantum Metrology and Sensing with Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main power of quantum sensors is achieved when the probe is composed of several particles. In this situation, quantum features such as entanglement contribute in enhancing the precision of quantum sensors beyond the capacity of classical sensors. Originally, quantum sensing was formulated for non-interacting particles which are prepared in a special form of maximally entangled states. These probes are extremely sensitive to decoherence and any interaction between particles is detrimental to their performance. An alternative framework for quantum sensing has been developed exploiting quantum many-body systems, where the interaction between particles plays a crucial role. In this review, we investigate different aspects of the latter approach for quantum metrology and sensing. Many-body probes have been used in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving quantum enhanced sensitivity in both scenarios. In equilibrium, various types of criticalities, such as first order, second order, topological, and localization phase transitions have been exploited for sensing purposes. In non-equilibrium scenarios, quantum enhanced sensitivity has been discovered for Floquet, dissipative, and time crystal phase transitions. While each type of these criticalities has its own characteristics, the presence of one feature is crucial for achieving quantum enhanced sensitivity: the energy/quasi-energy gap closing. In non-equilibrium quantum sensing, time is another parameter which can affect the sensitivity of the probe. Typically, the sensitivity enhances as the probe evolves in time. In general, a more complete understanding of resources for non-equilibrium quantum sensors is now rapidly evolving. In this review, we provide an overview of recent progress in quantum metrology and sensing using many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Nevanlinna Analytic Continuation for Migdal-Eliashberg Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a method to reconstruct real-frequency properties from analytically continued causal Green's functions within the framework of Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) theory for superconductivity. ME theory involves solving a set of coupled equations self-consistently in imaginary frequency space, but to obtain experimentally measurable properties like the spectral function and quasiparticle density of states, it is necessary to perform an analytic continuation to real frequency space. Traditionally, the ME Green's function is decomposed into three fundamental complex functions, which are analytically continued independently. However, these functions do not possess the causal properties of Green's functions, complicating or even preventing the application of standard methods such as Maximum Entropy. Our approach overcomes these challenges, enabling the use of various analytic continuation techniques that were previously impractical. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by combining it with Nevanlinna analytic continuation to achieve accurate real-frequency results for ME theory, which are directly comparable to experimental data, with applications highlighted for the superconductors MgB$_2$ and LaBeH$_8$.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Mpemba Meets Quantum Chaos: Anomalous Relaxation and Mpemba Crossings in Dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect (MPE), named after a student who first observed the phenomenon, has intrigued scientists for decades by showing that hot liquid can freeze faster than cold under certain conditions. Recently, analogous effects have been identified in integrable quantum systems. However, a key distinction between the classical MPE and its quantum analog is that the latter relies predominantly on the of the properties of the initial states rather than the cooling rate. In this paper, we explore the quench dynamics of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) systems coupled to thermal baths. We investigate three scenarios--SYK systems coupled to SYK thermal baths, SYK systems coupled to two thermal baths at different temperatures, and dissipative SYKs modeled by the Lindblad equation. In the regimes where the system and the baths are strongly coupled, we observe effective temperature oscillations and Mpemba crossings (MPCs)--the effect of temperature crossings which are absent in quasi-equilibrium thermodynamic analysis--when the system is strongly coupled to SYK thermal baths. These effects are not observed in the Liouvillian formalism. The emergence of MPCs in quantum chaotic systems exhibits strong parallels with the classical MPE.</description>
