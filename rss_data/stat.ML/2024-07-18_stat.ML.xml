      <title>Sharpness-diversity tradeoff: improving flat ensembles with SharpBalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies on deep ensembles have identified the sharpness of the local minima of individual learners and the diversity of the ensemble members as key factors in improving test-time performance. Building on this, our study investigates the interplay between sharpness and diversity within deep ensembles, illustrating their crucial role in robust generalization to both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We discover a trade-off between sharpness and diversity: minimizing the sharpness in the loss landscape tends to diminish the diversity of individual members within the ensemble, adversely affecting the ensemble's improvement. The trade-off is justified through our theoretical analysis and verified empirically through extensive experiments. To address the issue of reduced diversity, we introduce SharpBalance, a novel training approach that balances sharpness and diversity within ensembles. Theoretically, we show that our training strategy achieves a better sharpness-diversity trade-off. Empirically, we conducted comprehensive evaluations in various data sets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet) and showed that SharpBalance not only effectively improves the sharpness-diversity trade-off, but also significantly improves ensemble performance in ID and OOD scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fighting Sampling Bias: A Framework for Training and Evaluating Credit Scoring Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scoring models support decision-making in financial institutions. Their estimation and evaluation are based on the data of previously accepted applicants with known repayment behavior. This creates sampling bias: the available labeled data offers a partial picture of the distribution of candidate borrowers, which the model is supposed to score. The paper addresses the adverse effect of sampling bias on model training and evaluation. To improve scorecard training, we propose bias-aware self-learning - a reject inference framework that augments the biased training data by inferring labels for selected rejected applications. For scorecard evaluation, we propose a Bayesian framework that extends standard accuracy measures to the biased setting and provides a reliable estimate of future scorecard performance. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data confirm the superiority of our propositions over various benchmarks in predictive performance and profitability. By sensitivity analysis, we also identify boundary conditions affecting their performance. Notably, we leverage real-world data from a randomized controlled trial to assess the novel methodologies on holdout data that represent the true borrower population. Our findings confirm that reject inference is a difficult problem with modest potential to improve scorecard performance. Addressing sampling bias during scorecard evaluation is a much more promising route to improve scoring practices. For example, our results suggest a profit improvement of about eight percent, when using Bayesian evaluation to decide on acceptance rates.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Estimation of Conditional Expectations, Application to Optimal Stopping and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the underlying conditional density is known, conditional expectations can be computed analytically or numerically. When, however, such knowledge is not available and instead we are given a collection of training data, the goal of this work is to propose simple and purely data-driven means for estimating directly the desired conditional expectation. Because conditional expectations appear in the description of a number of stochastic optimization problems with the corresponding optimal solution satisfying a system of nonlinear equations, we extend our data-driven method to cover such cases as well. We test our methodology by applying it to Optimal Stopping and Optimal Action Policy in Reinforcement Learning.</description>

      <title>A deep latent variable model for semi-supervised multi-unit soft sensing in industrial processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many industrial processes, an apparent lack of data limits the development of data-driven soft sensors. There are, however, often opportunities to learn stronger models by being more data-efficient. To achieve this, one can leverage knowledge about the data from which the soft sensor is learned. Taking advantage of properties frequently possessed by industrial data, we introduce a deep latent variable model for semi-supervised multi-unit soft sensing. This hierarchical, generative model is able to jointly model different units, as well as learning from both labeled and unlabeled data.
  An empirical study of multi-unit soft sensing is conducted using two datasets: a synthetic dataset of single-phase fluid flow, and a large, real dataset of multi-phase flow in oil and gas wells. We show that by combining semi-supervised and multi-task learning, the proposed model achieves superior results, outperforming current leading methods for this soft sensing problem. We also show that when a model has been trained on a multi-unit dataset, it may be finetuned to previously unseen units using only a handful of data points. In this finetuning procedure, unlabeled data improve soft sensor performance; remarkably, this is true even when no labeled data are available.</description>

      <title>Discovering governing equation in structural dynamics from acceleration-only measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few years, equation discovery has gained popularity in different fields of science and engineering. However, existing equation discovery algorithms rely on the availability of noisy measurements of the state variables (i.e., displacement {and velocity}). This is a major bottleneck in structural dynamics, where we often only have access to acceleration measurements. To that end, this paper introduces a novel equation discovery algorithm for discovering governing equations of dynamical systems from acceleration-only measurements. The proposed algorithm employs a library-based approach for equation discovery. To enable equation discovery from acceleration-only measurements, we propose a novel Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) model that prioritizes parsimonious models. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is illustrated using {four} structural dynamics examples that include both linear and nonlinear dynamical systems. The case studies presented illustrate the possible application of the proposed approach for equation discovery of dynamical systems from acceleration-only measurements.</description>

      <title>Predictive Low Rank Matrix Learning under Partial Observations: Mixed-Projection ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning a partially observed matrix under the low rank assumption in the presence of fully observed side information that depends linearly on the true underlying matrix. This problem consists of an important generalization of the Matrix Completion problem, a central problem in Statistics, Operations Research and Machine Learning, that arises in applications such as recommendation systems, signal processing, system identification and image denoising. We formalize this problem as an optimization problem with an objective that balances the strength of the fit of the reconstruction to the observed entries with the ability of the reconstruction to be predictive of the side information. We derive a mixed-projection reformulation of the resulting optimization problem and present a strong semidefinite cone relaxation. We design an efficient, scalable alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm that produces high quality feasible solutions to the problem of interest. Our numerical results demonstrate that in the small rank regime ($k \leq 15$), our algorithm outputs solutions that achieve on average $79\%$ lower objective value and $90.1\%$ lower $\ell_2$ reconstruction error than the solutions returned by the experiment-wise best performing benchmark method. The runtime of our algorithm is competitive with and often superior to that of the benchmark methods. Our algorithm is able to solve problems with $n = 10000$ rows and $m = 10000$ columns in less than a minute.</description>

      <title>Regurgitative Training: The Value of Real Data in Training Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What happens if we train a new Large Language Model (LLM) using data that are at least partially generated by other LLMs? The explosive success of LLMs means that a substantial amount of content online will be generated by LLMs rather than humans, which will inevitably enter the training datasets of next-generation LLMs. We evaluate the implications of such "regurgitative training" on LLM performance. Through fine-tuning GPT-3.5 with data generated either by itself or by other LLMs in a machine translation task, we find strong evidence that regurgitative training clearly handicaps the performance of LLMs. The same performance loss of regurgitative training is observed on transformer models that we train from scratch. We find suggestive evidence that the performance disadvantage of regurgitative training can be attributed to at least two mechanisms: (1) higher error rates and (2) lower lexical diversity in LLM-generated data as compared to real data. Based on these mechanisms, we propose and evaluate three different strategies to mitigate the performance loss of regurgitative training. First, we devise data-driven metrics to gauge the quality of each LLM-generated data instance, and then carry out an ordered training process where high-quality data are added before low-quality ones. Second, we combine data generated by multiple different LLMs (as an attempt to increase lexical diversity). Third, we train an AI detection classifier to differentiate between LLM- and human-generated data, and include LLM-generated data in the order of resemblance to human-generated data. All three strategies can improve the performance of regurgitative training to some extent but are not always able to fully close the gap from training with real data. Our results highlight the value of real, human-generated data in training LLMs, which cannot be easily substituted by synthetic, LLM-generated data.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{metabench}$ -- A Sparse Benchmark to Measure General Ability in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary in their abilities on a range of tasks. Initiatives such as the $\texttt{Open LLM Leaderboard}$ aim to quantify these differences with several large benchmarks (sets of test items to which an LLM can respond either correctly or incorrectly). However, high correlations within and between benchmark scores suggest that (1) there exists a small set of common underlying abilities that these benchmarks measure, and (2) items tap into redundant information and the benchmarks may thus be considerably compressed. We use data from $n &gt; 5000$ LLMs to identify the most informative items of six benchmarks, ARC, GSM8K, HellaSwag, MMLU, TruthfulQA and WinoGrande (with $d=28,632$ items in total). From them we distill a sparse benchmark, $\texttt{metabench}$, that has less than $3\%$ of the original size of all six benchmarks combined. This new sparse benchmark goes beyond point scores by yielding estimators of the underlying benchmark-specific abilities. We show that these estimators (1) can be used to reconstruct each original $\textit{individual}$ benchmark score with, on average, $1.5\%$ root mean square error (RMSE), (2) reconstruct the original $\textit{total}$ score with $0.8\%$ RMSE, and (3) have a single underlying common factor whose Spearman correlation with the total score is $r = 0.93$.</description>

      <title>Clustering Time-Evolving Networks Using the Dynamic Graph Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-evolving graphs arise frequently when modeling complex dynamical systems such as social networks, traffic flow, and biological processes. Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the dynamic graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the dynamic graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</description>

      <title>NeuroSynth: MRI-Derived Neuroanatomical Generative Models and Associated Dataset of 18,000 Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Availability of large and diverse medical datasets is often challenged by privacy and data sharing restrictions. For successful application of machine learning techniques for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and precision medicine, large amounts of data are necessary for model building and optimization. To help overcome such limitations in the context of brain MRI, we present NeuroSynth: a collection of generative models of normative regional volumetric features derived from structural brain imaging. NeuroSynth models are trained on real brain imaging regional volumetric measures from the iSTAGING consortium, which encompasses over 40,000 MRI scans across 13 studies, incorporating covariates such as age, sex, and race. Leveraging NeuroSynth, we produce and offer 18,000 synthetic samples spanning the adult lifespan (ages 22-90 years), alongside the model's capability to generate unlimited data. Experimental results indicate that samples generated from NeuroSynth agree with the distributions obtained from real data. Most importantly, the generated normative data significantly enhance the accuracy of downstream machine learning models on tasks such as disease classification. Data and models are available at: https://huggingface.co/spaces/rongguangw/neuro-synth.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi-infinity constrained sampling with $d^3$ membership queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uniform sampling over a convex body is a fundamental algorithmic problem, yet the convergence in KL or R\'enyi divergence of most samplers remains poorly understood. In this work, we propose a constrained proximal sampler, a principled and simple algorithm that possesses elegant convergence guarantees. Leveraging the uniform ergodicity of this sampler, we show that it converges in the R\'enyi-infinity divergence ($\mathcal R_\infty$) with no query complexity overhead when starting from a warm start. This is the strongest of commonly considered performance metrics, implying rates in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$ convergence as special cases.
  By applying this sampler within an annealing scheme, we propose an algorithm which can approximately sample $\varepsilon$-close to the uniform distribution on convex bodies in $\mathcal R_\infty$-divergence with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^3\, \text{polylog} \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ query complexity. This improves on all prior results in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$-divergences, without resorting to any algorithmic modifications or post-processing of the sample. It also matches the prior best known complexity in total variation distance.</description>

      <title>Improving SAM Requires Rethinking its Optimization Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper rethinks Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which is originally formulated as a zero-sum game where the weights of a network and a bounded perturbation try to minimize/maximize, respectively, the same differentiable loss. To fundamentally improve this design, we argue that SAM should instead be reformulated using the 0-1 loss. As a continuous relaxation, we follow the simple conventional approach where the minimizing (maximizing) player uses an upper bound (lower bound) surrogate to the 0-1 loss. This leads to a novel formulation of SAM as a bilevel optimization problem, dubbed as BiSAM. BiSAM with newly designed lower-bound surrogate loss indeed constructs stronger perturbation. Through numerical evidence, we show that BiSAM consistently results in improved performance when compared to the original SAM and variants, while enjoying similar computational complexity. Our code is available at https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/BiSAM.</description>

      <title>A Resolution Independent Neural Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Deep operator network (DeepONet) is a powerful yet simple neural operator architecture that utilizes two deep neural networks to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This architecture is highly flexible, allowing the evaluation of the solution field at any location within the desired domain. However, it imposes a strict constraint on the input space, requiring all input functions to be discretized at the same locations; this limits its practical applications. In this work, we introduce a Resolution Independent Neural Operator (RINO) that provides a framework to make DeepONet resolution-independent, enabling it to handle input functions that are arbitrarily, but sufficiently finely, discretized. To this end, we propose a dictionary learning algorithm to adaptively learn a set of appropriate continuous basis functions, parameterized as implicit neural representations (INRs), from the input data. These basis functions are then used to project arbitrary input function data as a point cloud onto an embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions) with dimensionality equal to the dictionary size, which can be directly used by DeepONet without any architectural changes. In particular, we utilize sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs) as our trainable INR basis functions. We demonstrate the robustness and applicability of RINO in handling arbitrarily (but sufficiently richly) sampled input functions during both training and inference through several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Foundation Models for Online Decisions: HyperAgent with Fast Incremental Uncertainty Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models often struggle with uncertainty when faced with new situations in online decision-making, necessitating scalable and efficient exploration to resolve this uncertainty. We introduce GPT-HyperAgent, an augmentation of GPT with HyperAgent for uncertainty-aware, scalable exploration in contextual bandits, a fundamental online decision problem involving natural language input. We prove that HyperAgent achieves fast incremental uncertainty estimation with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$ per-step computational complexity over $T$ periods under the linear realizable assumption. Our analysis demonstrates that HyperAgent's regret order matches that of exact Thompson sampling in linear contextual bandits, closing a significant theoretical gap in scalable exploration. Empirical results in real-world contextual bandit tasks, such as automated content moderation with human feedback, validate the practical effectiveness of GPT-HyperAgent for safety-critical decisions. Our code is open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/szrlee/GPT-HyperAgent/}.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Uncertainty Quantification in High-Dimensional Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a crucial but challenging task in many high-dimensional regression or learning problems to increase the confidence of a given predictor. We develop a new data-driven approach for UQ in regression that applies both to classical regression approaches such as the LASSO as well as to neural networks. One of the most notable UQ techniques is the debiased LASSO, which modifies the LASSO to allow for the construction of asymptotic confidence intervals by decomposing the estimation error into a Gaussian and an asymptotically vanishing bias component. However, in real-world problems with finite-dimensional data, the bias term is often too significant to be neglected, resulting in overly narrow confidence intervals. Our work rigorously addresses this issue and derives a data-driven adjustment that corrects the confidence intervals for a large class of predictors by estimating the means and variances of the bias terms from training data, exploiting high-dimensional concentration phenomena. This gives rise to non-asymptotic confidence intervals, which can help avoid overestimating uncertainty in critical applications such as MRI diagnosis. Importantly, our analysis extends beyond sparse regression to data-driven predictors like neural networks, enhancing the reliability of model-based deep learning. Our findings bridge the gap between established theory and the practical applicability of such debiased methods.</description>

      <title>Enhanced $H$-Consistency Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has introduced a key notion of $H$-consistency bounds for surrogate losses. These bounds offer finite-sample guarantees, quantifying the relationship between the zero-one estimation error (or other target loss) and the surrogate loss estimation error for a specific hypothesis set. However, previous bounds were derived under the condition that a lower bound of the surrogate loss conditional regret is given as a convex function of the target conditional regret, without non-constant factors depending on the predictor or input instance. Can we derive finer and more favorable $H$-consistency bounds? In this work, we relax this condition and present a general framework for establishing enhanced $H$-consistency bounds based on more general inequalities relating conditional regrets. Our theorems not only subsume existing results as special cases but also enable the derivation of more favorable bounds in various scenarios. These include standard multi-class classification, binary and multi-class classification under Tsybakov noise conditions, and bipartite ranking.</description>

      <title>Realizable $H$-Consistent and Bayes-Consistent Loss Functions for Learning to Defer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of surrogate loss functions for learning to defer. We introduce a broad family of surrogate losses, parameterized by a non-increasing function $\Psi$, and establish their realizable $H$-consistency under mild conditions. For cost functions based on classification error, we further show that these losses admit $H$-consistency bounds when the hypothesis set is symmetric and complete, a property satisfied by common neural network and linear function hypothesis sets. Our results also resolve an open question raised in previous work (Mozannar et al., 2023) by proving the realizable $H$-consistency and Bayes-consistency of a specific surrogate loss. Furthermore, we identify choices of $\Psi$ that lead to $H$-consistent surrogate losses for any general cost function, thus achieving Bayes-consistency, realizable $H$-consistency, and $H$-consistency bounds simultaneously. We also investigate the relationship between $H$-consistency bounds and realizable $H$-consistency in learning to defer, highlighting key differences from standard classification. Finally, we empirically evaluate our proposed surrogate losses and compare them with existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Understanding Reinforcement Learning-Based Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models: A Tutorial and Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This tutorial provides a comprehensive survey of methods for fine-tuning diffusion models to optimize downstream reward functions. While diffusion models are widely known to provide excellent generative modeling capability, practical applications in domains such as biology require generating samples that maximize some desired metric (e.g., translation efficiency in RNA, docking score in molecules, stability in protein). In these cases, the diffusion model can be optimized not only to generate realistic samples but also to explicitly maximize the measure of interest. Such methods are based on concepts from reinforcement learning (RL). We explain the application of various RL algorithms, including PPO, differentiable optimization, reward-weighted MLE, value-weighted sampling, and path consistency learning, tailored specifically for fine-tuning diffusion models. We aim to explore fundamental aspects such as the strengths and limitations of different RL-based fine-tuning algorithms across various scenarios, the benefits of RL-based fine-tuning compared to non-RL-based approaches, and the formal objectives of RL-based fine-tuning (target distributions). Additionally, we aim to examine their connections with related topics such as classifier guidance, Gflownets, flow-based diffusion models, path integral control theory, and sampling from unnormalized distributions such as MCMC.

      <title>Optimistic Q-learning for average reward and episodic reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an optimistic Q-learning algorithm for regret minimization in average reward reinforcement learning under an additional assumption on the underlying MDP that for all policies, the expected time to visit some frequent state $s_0$ is finite and upper bounded by $H$. Our setting strictly generalizes the episodic setting and is significantly less restrictive than the assumption of bounded hitting time {\it for all states} made by most previous literature on model-free algorithms in average reward settings. We demonstrate a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(H^5 S\sqrt{AT})$, where $S$ and $A$ are the numbers of states and actions, and $T$ is the horizon. A key technical novelty of our work is to introduce an $\overline{L}$ operator defined as $\overline{L} v = \frac{1}{H} \sum_{h=1}^H L^h v$ where $L$ denotes the Bellman operator. We show that under the given assumption, the $\overline{L}$ operator has a strict contraction (in span) even in the average reward setting. Our algorithm design then uses ideas from episodic Q-learning to estimate and apply this operator iteratively. Therefore, we provide a unified view of regret minimization in episodic and non-episodic settings that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Multi-Label Learning with Stronger Consistency Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of surrogate losses and algorithms for multi-label learning, supported by $H$-consistency bounds. We first show that, for the simplest form of multi-label loss (the popular Hamming loss), the well-known consistent binary relevance surrogate suffers from a sub-optimal dependency on the number of labels in terms of $H$-consistency bounds, when using smooth losses such as logistic losses. Furthermore, this loss function fails to account for label correlations. To address these drawbacks, we introduce a novel surrogate loss, multi-label logistic loss, that accounts for label correlations and benefits from label-independent $H$-consistency bounds. We then broaden our analysis to cover a more extensive family of multi-label losses, including all common ones and a new extension defined based on linear-fractional functions with respect to the confusion matrix. We also extend our multi-label logistic losses to more comprehensive multi-label comp-sum losses, adapting comp-sum losses from standard classification to the multi-label learning. We prove that this family of surrogate losses benefits from $H$-consistency bounds, and thus Bayes-consistency, across any general multi-label loss. Our work thus proposes a unified surrogate loss framework benefiting from strong consistency guarantees for any multi-label loss, significantly expanding upon previous work which only established Bayes-consistency and for specific loss functions. Additionally, we adapt constrained losses from standard classification to multi-label constrained losses in a similar way, which also benefit from $H$-consistency bounds and thus Bayes-consistency for any multi-label loss. We further describe efficient gradient computation algorithms for minimizing the multi-label logistic loss.</description>

      <title>Bayesian sequential design of computer experiments for quantile set inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01008v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an unknown multivariate function representing a system-such as a complex numerical simulator-taking both deterministic and uncertain inputs. Our objective is to estimate the set of deterministic inputs leading to outputs whose probability (with respect to the distribution of the uncertain inputs) of belonging to a given set is less than a given threshold. This problem, which we call Quantile Set Inversion (QSI), occurs for instance in the context of robust (reliability-based) optimization problems, when looking for the set of solutions that satisfy the constraints with sufficiently large probability.   To solve the QSI problem we propose a Bayesian strategy, based on Gaussian process modeling and the Stepwise Uncertainty Reduction (SUR) principle, to sequentially choose the points at which the function should be evaluated to efficiently approximate the set of interest. We illustrate the performance and interest of the proposed SUR strategy through several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Sparse and geometry-aware generalisation of the mutual information for joint discriminative clustering and feature selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature selection in clustering is a hard task which involves simultaneously the discovery of relevant clusters as well as relevant variables with respect to these clusters. While feature selection algorithms are often model-based through optimised model selection or strong assumptions on the data distribution, we introduce a discriminative clustering model trying to maximise a geometry-aware generalisation of the mutual information called GEMINI with a simple l1 penalty: the Sparse GEMINI. This algorithm avoids the burden of combinatorial feature subset exploration and is easily scalable to high-dimensional data and large amounts of samples while only designing a discriminative clustering model. We demonstrate the performances of Sparse GEMINI on synthetic datasets and large-scale datasets. Our results show that Sparse GEMINI is a competitive algorithm and has the ability to select relevant subsets of variables with respect to the clustering without using relevance criteria or prior hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Foundations for Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The staggering progress of machine learning in the past decade has been a sight to behold. In retrospect, it is both remarkable and unsettling that these milestones were achievable with little to no rigorous theory to guide experimentation. Despite this fact, practitioners have been able to guide their future experimentation via observations from previous large-scale empirical investigations. However, alluding to Plato's Allegory of the cave, it is likely that the observations which form the field's notion of reality are but shadows representing fragments of that reality. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework which attempts to answer what exists outside of the cave. To the theorist, we provide a framework which is mathematically rigorous and leaves open many interesting ideas for future exploration. To the practitioner, we provide a framework whose results are very intuitive, general, and which will help form principles to guide future investigations. Concretely, we provide a theoretical framework rooted in Bayesian statistics and Shannon's information theory which is general enough to unify the analysis of many phenomena in machine learning. Our framework characterizes the performance of an optimal Bayesian learner, which considers the fundamental limits of information. Throughout this work, we derive very general theoretical results and apply them to derive insights specific to settings ranging from data which is independently and identically distributed under an unknown distribution, to data which is sequential, to data which exhibits hierarchical structure amenable to meta-learning. We conclude with a section dedicated to characterizing the performance of misspecified algorithms. These results are exciting and particularly relevant as we strive to overcome increasingly difficult machine learning challenges in this endlessly complex world.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.05774v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a procedure which combines hierarchical clustering with a test of overidentifying restrictions for selecting valid instrumental variables (IV) from a large set of IVs. Some of these IVs may be invalid in that they fail the exclusion restriction. We show that if the largest group of IVs is valid, our method achieves oracle properties. Unlike existing techniques, our work deals with multiple endogenous regressors. Simulation results suggest an advantageous performance of the method in various settings. The method is applied to estimating the effect of immigration on wages.</description>

      <title>Bi-stochastically normalized graph Laplacian: convergence to manifold Laplacian and robustness to outlier noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bi-stochastic normalization provides an alternative normalization of graph Laplacians in graph-based data analysis and can be computed efficiently by Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) iterations. This paper proves the convergence of bi-stochastically normalized graph Laplacian to manifold (weighted-)Laplacian with rates, when $n$ data points are i.i.d. sampled from a general $d$-dimensional manifold embedded in a possibly high-dimensional space. Under certain joint limit of $n \to \infty$ and kernel bandwidth $\epsilon \to 0$, the point-wise convergence rate of the graph Laplacian operator (under 2-norm) is proved to be $ O( n^{-1/(d/2+3)})$ at finite large $n$ up to log factors, achieved at the scaling of $\epsilon \sim n^{-1/(d/2+3)} $. When the manifold data are corrupted by outlier noise, we theoretically prove the graph Laplacian point-wise consistency which matches the rate for clean manifold data plus an additional term proportional to the boundedness of the inner-products of the noise vectors among themselves and with data vectors. Motivated by our analysis, which suggests that not exact bi-stochastic normalization but an approximate one will achieve the same consistency rate, we propose an approximate and constrained matrix scaling problem that can be solved by SK iterations with early termination. Numerical experiments support our theoretical results and show the robustness of bi-stochastically normalized graph Laplacian to high-dimensional outlier noise.</description>

      <title>Private Aggregation in Hierarchical Wireless Federated Learning with Partial and Full Collusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In federated learning, a federator coordinates the training of a model, e.g., a neural network, on privately owned data held by several participating clients. The gradient descent algorithm, a well-known and popular iterative optimization procedure, is run to train the model. Every client computes partial gradients based on their local data and sends them to the federator, which aggregates the results and updates the model. Privacy of the clients' data is a major concern. In fact, it is shown that observing the partial gradients can be enough to reveal the clients' data. Existing literature focuses on private aggregation schemes that tackle the privacy problem in federated learning in settings where all users are connected to each other and to the federator. In this paper, we consider a hierarchical wireless system architecture in which the clients are connected to base stations; the base stations are connected to the federator either directly or through relays. We examine settings with and without relays, and derive fundamental limits on the communication cost under information-theoretic privacy with different collusion assumptions. We introduce suitable private aggregation schemes tailored for these settings whose communication costs are multiplicative factors away from the derived bounds.</description>

      <title>The Linear Representation Hypothesis and the Geometry of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Informally, the 'linear representation hypothesis' is the idea that high-level concepts are represented linearly as directions in some representation space. In this paper, we address two closely related questions: What does "linear representation" actually mean? And, how do we make sense of geometric notions (e.g., cosine similarity or projection) in the representation space? To answer these, we use the language of counterfactuals to give two formalizations of "linear representation", one in the output (word) representation space, and one in the input (sentence) space. We then prove these connect to linear probing and model steering, respectively. To make sense of geometric notions, we use the formalization to identify a particular (non-Euclidean) inner product that respects language structure in a sense we make precise. Using this causal inner product, we show how to unify all notions of linear representation. In particular, this allows the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of linear representations of concepts, the connection to interpretation and control, and the fundamental role of the choice of inner product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at modeling complex data distributions, including those of images, proteins, and small molecules. However, in many cases, our goal is to model parts of the distribution that maximize certain properties: for example, we may want to generate images with high aesthetic quality, or molecules with high bioactivity. It is natural to frame this as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, in which the objective is to fine-tune a diffusion model to maximize a reward function that corresponds to some property. Even with access to online queries of the ground-truth reward function, efficiently discovering high-reward samples can be challenging: they might have a low probability in the initial distribution, and there might be many infeasible samples that do not even have a well-defined reward (e.g., unnatural images or physically impossible molecules). In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement learning procedure that efficiently explores on the manifold of feasible samples. We present a theoretical analysis providing a regret guarantee, as well as empirical validation across three domains: images, biological sequences, and molecules.</description>

      <title>PARMESAN: Parameter-Free Memory Search and Transduction for Dense Prediction Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work addresses flexibility in deep learning by means of transductive reasoning. For adaptation to new data and tasks, e.g., in continual learning, existing methods typically involve tuning learnable parameters or complete re-training from scratch, rendering such approaches unflexible in practice. We argue that the notion of separating computation from memory by the means of transduction can act as a stepping stone for solving these issues. We therefore propose PARMESAN (parameter-free memory search and transduction), a scalable method which leverages a memory module for solving dense prediction tasks. At inference, hidden representations in memory are being searched to find corresponding patterns. In contrast to other methods that rely on continuous training of learnable parameters, PARMESAN learns via memory consolidation simply by modifying stored contents. Our method is compatible with commonly used architectures and canonically transfers to 1D, 2D, and 3D grid-based data. The capabilities of our approach are demonstrated at the complex task of continual learning. PARMESAN learns by 3-4 orders of magnitude faster than established baselines while being on par in terms of predictive performance, hardware-efficiency, and knowledge retention.</description>

      <title>GLAD: Improving Latent Graph Generative Modeling with Simple Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16883v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring the graph latent structures has not garnered much attention in the graph generative research field. Yet, exploiting the latent space is as crucial as working on the data space for discrete data such as graphs. However, previous methods either failed to preserve the permutation symmetry of graphs or lacked an effective approaches to model appropriately within the latent space. To mitigate those issues, we propose a simple, yet effective discrete latent graph diffusion generative model. Our model, namely GLAD, not only overcomes the drawbacks of existing latent approaches, but also alleviates inherent issues present in diffusion methods applied on the graph space. We validate our generative model on the molecular benchmark datasets, on which it demonstrates competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Private Mean Estimation with Person-Level Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20405</link>

Abstract: We study person-level differentially private (DP) mean estimation in the case where each person holds multiple samples. DP here requires the usual notion of distributional stability when $\textit{all}$ of a person's datapoints can be modified. Informally, if $n$ people each have $m$ samples from an unknown $d$-dimensional distribution with bounded $k$-th moments, we show that people are necessary and sufficient to estimate the mean up to distance $\alpha$ in $\ell_2$-norm under $\varepsilon$-differential privacy (and its common relaxations). In the multivariate setting, we give computationally efficient algorithms under approximate-DP and computationally inefficient algorithms under pure DP, and our nearly matching lower bounds hold for the most permissive case of approximate DP. Our computationally efficient estimators are based on the standard clip-and-noise framework, but the analysis for our setting requires both new algorithmic techniques and new analyses. In particular, our new bounds on the tails of sums of independent, vector-valued, bounded-moments random variables may be of interest.
  \[n = \tilde \Theta\left(\frac{d}{\alpha^2 m} + \frac{d}{\alpha m^{1/2} \varepsilon} + \frac{d}{\alpha^{k/(k-1)} m \varepsilon} + \frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)\]</description>

      <title>General Distribution Learning: A theoretical framework for Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05666v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces General Distribution Learning (GD learning), a novel theoretical learning framework designed to address a comprehensive range of machine learning and statistical tasks, including classification, regression, and parameter estimation. GD learning focuses on estimating the true underlying probability distribution of dataset and using models to fit the estimated parameters of the distribution. The learning error in GD learning is thus decomposed into two distinct categories: estimation error and fitting error. The estimation error, which stems from the constraints of finite sampling, limited prior knowledge, and the estimation algorithm's inherent limitations, quantifies the discrepancy between the true distribution and its estimate. The fitting error can be attributed to model's capacity limitation and the performance limitation of the optimization algorithm, which evaluates the deviation of the model output from the fitted objective. To address the challenge of non-convexity in the optimization of learning error, we introduce the standard loss function and demonstrate that, when employing this function, global optimal solutions in non-convex optimization can be approached by minimizing the gradient norm and the structural error. Moreover, we demonstrate that the estimation error is determined by the uncertainty of the estimate $q$, and propose the minimum uncertainty principle to obtain an optimal estimate of the true distribution. We further provide upper bounds for the estimation error, fitting error, and learning error within the GD learning framework. Ultimately, our findings are applied to offer theoretical explanations for several unanswered questions on deep learning, including overparameterization, non-convex optimization, flat minima, dynamic isometry condition and other techniques in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Movement and Naive Predictions for Point Forecasting in Univariate Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional methods for point forecasting in univariate random walks often fail to surpass naive benchmarks due to data unpredictability. This study introduces a novel forecasting method that fuses movement prediction (binary classification) with naive forecasts for accurate one-step-ahead point forecasting in univariate random walks. The method's efficacy is demonstrated through theoretical analysis, simulations, and real-world data experiments. It reliably outperforms naive forecasts with moderate movement prediction accuracies, such as 0.55, and is superior to baseline models such as the ARIMA, linear regression, MLP, and LSTM networks in forecasting the S&amp;P 500 index and Bitcoin prices. This method is particularly advantageous when accurate point predictions are challenging but accurate movement predictions are attainable, translating movement predictions into point forecasts in random walk contexts.</description>
