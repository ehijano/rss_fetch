Abstract: Microfluidic technology has emerged as a powerful tool for studying complex biological processes with enhanced precision and control. A microfluidic chip was designed to emulate human-like microvascular networks with precise control over channel geometry and flow conditions. By simulating blood flow dynamics during bleeding events, we successfully observed the real-time interactions of platelets and their aggregation induced by shear rate gradient at the wound site. Platelet dynamics is primarily influenced by physico-mechanical condition of blood vessels with pathophysiological condition of blood at close proximity of vascular injury site. This microfluidic platform facilitated the investigation of platelet adhesion, activation, and clot formation, providing a unique opportunity to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of platelet aggregation and blood clot. Our findings shed light on the intricate mechanisms underlying thrombus formation and platelet-mediated aggregation, offering a more accurate and dynamic representation of human haemostasis compared to traditional animal models. In the conventional approach, the human bleeding model is tried on mouse due to anatomy and pathological similarities between mouse and humans. This study will simplify and standardize the blood and vasculature conditions. The microfluidic-based replication of the bleeding model holds significant promise in advancing our understanding of clotting disorders and wound healing processes. Furthermore, it paves the way for targeted therapeutic interventions in managing bleeding disorders and enhancing clinical strategies for promoting efficient wound closure. Ultimately, this study demonstrates the potential of microfluidics to revolutionize haemostasis research and opens up new avenues for the development of personalized medicine approaches in the field of clotting disorders.</description>
