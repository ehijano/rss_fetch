      <title>Charmed hypernuclei within density-dependent relativistic mean-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charmed $ \Lambda_{c}^{+} $ hypernuclei are investigated within the framework of the density-dependent relativistic mean-field (DDRMF) theory. Starting from the empirical hyperon potential in symmetric nuclear matter, obtained through microscopic first-principle calculations, two sets of $\Lambda_c N$ effective interactions were derived by fitting the potentials with minimal uncertainty (Fermi momentum $k_{F,n} = 1.05~\rm{fm}^{-1}$) and near saturation density ($k_{F,n} = 1.35~\rm{fm}^{-1}$). These DDRMF models were then used to explore the $\Lambda_{c} N$ effective interaction uncertainties on the description of hypernuclear bulk and single-particle properties. A systematic investigation was conducted on the existence of bound $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ hypernuclei. The dominant factors affecting the existence and stability of hypernuclei were analyzed from the perspective of the $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ potential. It is found that the hyperon potential is not only influenced by the Coulomb repulsion, but by an extra contribution from the rearrangement terms due to the density dependence of the meson-baryon coupling strengths. Therefore, the rearrangement term significantly impacts the stability description for light hypernuclei, while for heavier hypernuclei, the contribution from Coulomb repulsion becomes increasingly significant and eventually dominant. The discussion then delves into the bulk and single-particle properties of charmed hypernuclei using these models. It is found that even when different models yield similar hyperon potentials for nuclear matter, different treatments of nuclear medium effects could lead to disparities in the theoretical description of hypernuclear structures. This study indicates that constraints on the $ \Lambda_{c} N $ interaction at finite densities are crucial for the study of $ \Lambda_{c}^{+} $ hypernuclear structures.</description>

      <title>Convergence properties of $T'$-Expansion Scheme: Hadron Resonance Gas and Cluster Expansion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we assess the effectiveness and robustness of the recently proposed $T'$-expansion scheme for expanding the equation of state of strongly interacting matter to finite density, by comparing its performance relative to the conventional Taylor expansion method in various effective QCD models. We use baryon number density and its susceptibilities to calculate the expansion coefficients in the $T'$-expansion scheme with and without the Stefan-Boltzmann limit correction. Our methodology involves comparing truncation orders to exact solutions to assess the scheme's accuracy. We utilize Ideal, Excluded Volume, and van der Waals formulations of the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model at low temperatures, and the Cluster Expansion Model at higher temperatures. Our findings indicate that the $T'$-expansion scheme offers superior convergence properties near and above the chiral crossover temperature, where the chiral-criticality-inspired scaling $(\partial/ \partial T)_{\mu_B} \sim (\partial^2/\partial \mu_B^2)_T$ holds. However, it shows limited improvement in the HRG models, indicating that it may not be the most suitable choice for describing the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Predicting X(2370) glueball-like particle production in pp collisions at the LHC energy with PACIAE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the BESIII newest observation of X(2370) glueball-like particle production in $e^+e^-$ collisions, we search its production in proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV with a parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE. In this model, the final partonic state (FPS) and final hadronic state (FHS) are consecutively simulated and recorded. The X(2370) glueball- or tetraquark-state is then, respectively, recombined by two gluons or four quarks $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ in the FPS using the quantum statistical mechanics inspired dynamically constrained phase-space coalescence (DCPC) model. The X(2370) molecular-state is recombined by the baryon-antibaryon of $\Lambda$-$\bar{\Lambda}$ or $\Sigma$-$\bar{\Sigma}$, or by three mesons of $\pi^+\pi^{-}\eta'$, $K^+K^-\eta'$, or $K_S^0K_S^0\eta'$ in the FHS using DCPC model. Significant discrepancies in the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) and rapidity ($y$) distributions among the X(2370) glueball-, tetraquark-, and molecular-state are observed. Thus both of $p_{\rm T}$ and $y$ distributions could serve as valuable criteria identifying different states of the X(2370). We strongly suggest the experimental measurement of the X(2370) glueball-like particle production in pp collisions at the LHC energies.</description>

      <title>On convergence properties of GPD expansion through Mellin/conformal moments and orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine convergence properties of reconstructing the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) through the universal moment parameterization (GUMP). We provide a heuristic explanation for the connection between the formal summation/expansion and the Mellin-Barnes integral in the literature, and specify the exact convergence condition. We derive an asymptotic condition on the conformal moments of GPDs to satisfy the boundary condition at $x=1$ and subsequently develop an approximate formula for GPDs when $x&gt;\xi$. Since experimental observables constraining GPDs can be expressed in terms of double or even triple summations involving their moments, scale evolution factors, and Wilson coefficients, etc., we propose a method to handle the ordering of the multiple summations and convert them into multiple Mellin-Barnes integrals via analytical continuations of integer summation indices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative yields have been measured in the 40-130 MeV bremsstrahlung induced reactions of 59Co. The experiments have been performed with the beam from the electron linear accelerator LINAC-200 using the activation and off-line {\gamma}-ray spectrometric technique. The bremsstrahlung photon flux has been calculated with the Geant4 program. The cross sections were calculated by using computer code TALYS-1.96 with different models and are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons along beam direction in p+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=8.16$ TeV using hydrodynamic approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have implemented the 3+1 dimensional CLVisc hydrodynamics model with TRENTO-3D initial conditions to investigate the spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons along the beam direction in p+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 8.16$ TeV. Following our previous theoretical framework based on quantum kinetic theory, we consider three different scenarios: $\Lambda$ equilibrium, $s$ quark equilibrium, and iso-thermal equilibrium scenarios. We have computed the second Fourier sine coefficients of spin polarization along the beam direction, denoted as $\left\langle P_{z} \sin 2(\phi_{p} - \Psi_{2}) \right\rangle$, with $\phi_p$ being the azimuthal angle relative to the second-order event plane $\Psi_{2}$, as functions of multiplicity and transverse momentum in the three scenarios. Additionally, we have also computed the spin polarization along the beam direction, $P_{z}$, as a function of the azimuthal angle. We find that the spin polarization induced by thermal vorticity always provides an opposite contribution compared to the shear-induced polarization in p+Pb collisions. The total spin polarization computed by the current hydrodynamic model disagrees with the data measured by LHC-CMS experiments. Our findings imply that other non-flow effects may play a crucial role in p+Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound and isothermal compressibility in a magnetized quark matter with anomalous magnetic moment of quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the characteristics of quark matter under the influence of a background magnetic field with anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) of quarks at finite temperature and quark chemical potential in the framework of Polyakov loop extended Nambu Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. In presence of a magnetic field, the speed of sound and isothermal compressibility become anisotropic with respect to the direction of the background magnetic field, splitting into parallel and perpendicular directions with respect to the magnetic field. Though the qualitative nature of parallel and perpendicular components of squared speed of sound appear similar, they differ in magnitude at lower values of temperature. The parallel and perpendicular components of isothermal compressibility decrease with increasing temperature, indicating a trend towards increased incompressible strongly interacting matter. On inclusion of the AMM of quarks, the perpendicular component of isothermal compressibility becomes greater than the parallel component. Additionally, we investigate the quark number susceptibility normalized by its value at zero magnetic field, which may indicate the presence of magnetic fields in the system.</description>

      <title>Effects of two-body currents in the one-particle one-hole electromagnetic responses within a relativistic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Longitudinal ($R_L$) and transverse ($R_T$) responses from inclusive electron scattering from carbon 12 and calcium 40 nuclei are computed within a fully relativistic and unfactorized model for the initial and final states, and one- and two-body current operators leading to the one-particle one-hole responses. We find that the two-body contributions have no effect on $R_L$ but they increase $R_T$ by up to 30%, depending on the energy and momentum transfer. Inclusive cross sections have also been computed. In this case, the increase of $R_T$ due to two-body currents will translate into an increase in the cross-sections depending on the degree of transversity of each kinematic.
  The comparison with carbon data is good for the responses and the cross sections. In the case of calcium, while the model compares well with the cross section data, the agreement with the responses is generally poor. However, the inconsistencies between different data sets for the separate responses in this nucleus points to uncertainties underlying the procedure to extract the responses that are not considered (or largely underestimated) in the experimental error bars.
  Our calculation is fully relativistic and considers within the full quantum mechanical description both the initial and final nucleon states involved in the process. We also show that it is essential to go beyond the plane-wave approach, since incorporating the distortion of the nucleons while making the initial and final states orthogonal, allows to reproduce both the shape and magnitude of the cross section data and carbon responses. The good agreement with the electron scattering experimental data supports the use of this approach to describe the analogous neutrino-induced scattering reaction.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for $\mu \to e$ conversion in nuclei: charge distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the rate for $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei for a given set of effective operators mediating the violation of lepton flavor symmetry crucially depends on hadronic and nuclear matrix elements. In particular, the uncertainties inherent in this non-perturbative input limit the discriminating power that can be achieved among operators by studying different target isotopes. In order to quantify the associated uncertainties, as a first step, we go back to nuclear charge densities and propagate the uncertainties from electron scattering data for a range of isotopes relevant for $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei, including $^{40,48}$Ca, $^{48,50}$Ti, and $^{27}$Al. We provide as central results Fourier-Bessel expansions of the corresponding charge distributions with complete covariance matrices, accounting for Coulomb-distortion effects in a self-consistent manner throughout the calculation. As an application, we evaluate the overlap integrals for $\mu\to e$ conversion mediated by dipole operators. In combination with modern ab-initio methods, our results will allow for the evaluation of general $\mu\to e$ conversion rates with quantified uncertainties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nuclear reaction network within the interior of the Sun is an efficient MeV physics factory, and can produce long-lived particles generic to dark sector models. In this work we consider the sensitivity of satellite instruments, primarily the RHESSI Spectrometer, that observe the Quiet Sun in the MeV regime where backgrounds are low. We find that Quiet Sun observations offer a powerful and complementary probe in regions of parameter space where the long-lived particle decay length is longer than the radius of the Sun, and shorter than the distance between the Sun and Earth. We comment on connections to recent model-building work on heavy neutral leptons coupled to neutrinos and high-quality axions from mirror symmetries.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of multimessenger astrophysical data: Joint and coherent inference of gravitational waves and kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian framework for joint and coherent analyses of multimessenger binary neutron star signals. The method, implemented in our bajes infrastructure, incorporates a joint likelihood for multiple datasets, support for various semi-analytical kilonova models and numerical-relativity (NR) informed relations for the mass ejecta, as well as a technique to include and marginalize over modeling uncertainties. As a first application, we analyze the gravitational-wave GW170817 and the kilonova AT2017gfo data. These results are then combined with the most recent X-ray pulsars analyses of PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 to obtain EOS constraints.Various constraints on the mass-radius diagram and neutron star properties are then obtained by resampling over a set of ten million parametrized EOS built under minimal assumptions. We find that a joint and coherent approach improves the inference of the extrinsic parameters (distance) and, among the instrinc parameters, the mass ratio. The inclusion of NR informed relations strongly improves over the case of using an agnostic prior on the intrinsic parameters. Comparing Bayes factors, we find that the two observations are better explained by the common source hypothesis only by assuming NR-informed relations. These relations break some of the degeneracies in the employed kN models. The EOS inference folding-in PSR J0952-0607 minimum-maximum mass, PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 data constrains, among other quantities, the neutron star radius to $R_{1.4}={12.30}^{+0.81}_{-0.56}$ km ($R_{1.4}={13.20}^{+0.91}_{-0.90}$ km) and the maximum mass to $M_{max}={2.28}^{+0.25}_{-0.17}~{\rm M_\odot}$ ($M_{max}={2.32}^{+0.30}_{-0.19}~{\rm M_\odot}$) where the ST+PDT (PDT-U) analysis of Vinciguerra et a (2023) for PSR J0030+0451 is employed. Hence, the systematics on PSR J0030+0451 data reduction currently dominate the mass-radius diagram constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neutrino experiments utilize heavy nuclear targets to achieve high statistics neutrino-nucleus interaction event rate, which leads to systematic uncertainties in the oscillation parameters due to the nuclear effects and uncertainties in the cross-section. Understanding the interaction of neutrinos with the nucleus becomes crucial in determining the oscillation parameters with high precision. We investigate the uncertainty in quasi-elastic interaction due to nuclear effects by selecting exactly 1 proton, 0 pions, and any number of neutrons in the final state in DUNE and MicroBooNE detectors, and the effects on the neutrino oscillation in the DUNE detector. The calorimetric method with this selection can be used for accurate neutrino energy reconstruction in the quasi-elastic channel where the nuclear effects are inevitable.</description>

      <title>Selected Configuration Interaction for Resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic resonances are metastable states that can decay by electron loss. They are ubiquitous across various fields of science, such as chemistry, physics, and biology. However, current theoretical and computational models for resonances cannot yet rival the level of accuracy achieved by bound-state methodologies. Here, we generalize selected configuration interaction (SCI) to treat resonances using the complex absorbing potential (CAP) technique. By modifying the selection procedure and the extrapolation protocol of standard SCI, the resulting CAP-SCI method yields resonance positions and widths of full configuration interaction quality. Initial results for the shape resonances of \ce{N2-} and \ce{CO-} reveal the important effect of high-order correlation, which shifts the values obtained with CAP-augmented equation-of-motion coupled-cluster with singles and doubles by more than \SI{0.1}{\eV}. The present CAP-SCI approach represents a cornerstone in the development of highly-accurate methodologies for resonances.</description>
