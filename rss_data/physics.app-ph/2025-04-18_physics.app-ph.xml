      <title>Hardware Implementation of Tunable Fractional-Order Capacitors by Morphogenesis of Conducting Polymer Dendrites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional electronics is founded on a paradigm where shaping perfect electrical elements is done at the fabrication plant, so as to make devices and systems identical, "eternally immutable". In nature, morphogenic evolutions are observed in most living organisms and exploit topological plasticity as a low-resource mechanism for in operando manufacturing and computation. Often fractal, the resulting topologies feature inherent disorder: a property which is never exploited in conventional electronics manufacturing, while necessary for data generation and security in software. In this study, we present how such properties can be exploited to implement long-term and evolvable synaptic plasticity in an electronic hardware. The rich topology of conducting polymer dendrites (CPDs) is exploited to program the non-ideality of their electrochemical capacitances containing constant-phase-elements. Their evolution through structural changes alters the characteristic time constants for them to charge and discharge with the applied voltage stimuli. Under a train of voltage spikes, the evolvable current relaxation of the electrochemical systems promotes short-term plasticity with timescales ranging from milliseconds to seconds. This large window depends on the temporality of the voltage pulses used for reading, but also on the structure of a pair of CPDs on two electrodes, grown by voltage pulses. This study demonstrates how relevant physically transient and non-ideal electrochemical components can be exploited for unconventional electronics, with the aim to mimic a universal property of living organisms which could barely be replicated in a silicon monocrystal.</description>

      <title>Extending the Mott-Gurney law to one-dimensional nonplanar diodes using point transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have applied variational calculus, conformal mapping, and point transformations to generalize the one-dimensional (1D) space-charge limited current density (SCLCD) and electron emission mechanisms to nonplanar geometries; however, these assessments have focused on extending the Child-Langmuir law (CLL) for SCLCD in vacuum. Since the charge in the diode is independent of coordinate system (i.e., covariant), we apply bijective point transformations to extend the Mott-Gurney law (MGL) for the SCLCD in a collisional or semiconductor gap to nonplanar 1D geometries. This yields a modified MGL that replaces the Cartesian gap distance with a canonical gap distance that may be written generally in terms of geometric scale factors that are known for multiple geometries. We tabulate results for common geometries. Such an approach may be applied to any current density, including non-space-charge limited gaps and SCLCD that may fall between the CLL and MGL.</description>

      <title>An accurate measurement of parametric array using a spurious sound filter topologically equivalent to a half-wavelength resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric arrays (PA) offer exceptional directivity and compactness compared to conventional loudspeakers, facilitating various acoustic applications. However, accurate measurement of audio signals generated by PA remains challenging due to spurious ultrasonic sounds arising from microphone nonlinearities. Existing filtering methods, including Helmholtz resonators, phononic crystals, polymer films, and grazing incidence techniques, exhibit practical constraints such as size limitations, fabrication complexity, or insufficient attenuation. To address these issues, we propose and demonstrate a novel acoustic filter based on the design of a half-wavelength resonator. The developed filter exploits the nodal plane in acoustic pressure distribution, effectively minimizing microphone exposure to targeted ultrasonic frequencies. Fabrication via stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing ensures high dimensional accuracy, which is crucial for high-frequency acoustic filters. Finite element method (FEM) simulations guided filter optimization for suppression frequencies at 40 kHz and 60 kHz, achieving high transmission loss (TL) around 60 dB. Experimental validations confirm the filter's superior performance in significantly reducing spurious acoustic signals, as reflected in frequency response, beam pattern, and propagation curve measurements. The proposed filter ensures stable and precise acoustic characterization, independent of measurement distances and incidence angles. This new approach not only improves measurement accuracy but also enhances reliability and reproducibility in parametric array research and development.</description>

      <title>Tuning methods for multigap drift tube linacs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multigap cavities are used extensively in linear accelerators to achieve velocities up to a few percent of the speed of light, driving nuclear physics research around the world. Unlike for single-gap structures, there is no closed-form expression to calculate the output beam parameters from the cavity voltage and phase. To overcome this, we propose to use a method based on the integration of the first and second moments of the beam distribution through the axially symmetric time-dependent fields of the cavity. A beam-based calibration between the model's electric field scaling and the machine's rf amplitudes is presented, yielding a fast online energy change method, returning cavity amplitude and phase necessary for a desired output beam energy and energy spread. The method is validated with 23Na6+ beam energy measurements.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal and temperature-tunable light absorption in AlAs/ITO/GaAs Hybrid Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The single-band high-efficiency light absorption of nanostructures finds extensive applications in var ious fields such as photothermal conversion, optical sensing, and biomedicine. In this paper, a vertically stacked nanohybrid structure is designed with aluminum arsenide (AlAs), indium tin ox ide (ITO) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) stacked, and the photon absorption characteristics of this structure under near-infrared light at a single wavelength of 1240 nm are exploredbased on the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. When AlAs, ITO, and GaAs are stacked and incident light enters from the GaAs side, a local light enhancement phenomenon occurs. The absorption rate can reach 91.67%, and the temperature change rate reaches 55. 53%, allowing for a wide-range regulation the absorption rate by temperature. In addition, the AlAs/ITO/GaAs sandwich-type hybrid structure also exhibits obvious nonreciprocity. With the change in temperature, the absorption rate of different structural sizes varies differently. The structure can be optimized and designed according to the requirements, providing new ideas for the design of multifunctional optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>High Breakdown Electric Field (&gt; 5 MV/cm) in UWBG AlGaN Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the design and demonstration of ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN-channel metal-insulator heterostructure field effect transistors (HEFTs) for high-power, high-frequency applications. We find that the integration of gate dielectrics and field plates greatly improves the breakdown field in these devices, with state-of-art average breakdown field of 5.3 MV/cm (breakdown voltage &gt; 260 V) with an associated maximum current density of 342 mA/mm, and cut-off frequency of 9.1 GHz. Furthermore, low trap-related impact was observed from minimal gate and drain lag estimated from pulsed I-V characteristics. The reported results provide the potential of UWBG AlGaN HEFTs for the next generation high-power radio frequency applications.</description>

      <title>Arrayed waveguide gratings in lithium tantalate integrated photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arrayed Waveguide Gratings (AWGs) are widely used photonic components for splitting and combining different wavelengths of light. They play a key role in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems by enabling efficient routing of multiple data channels over a single optical fiber and as a building block for various optical signal processing, computing, imaging, and spectroscopic applications. Recently, there has been growing interest in integrating AWGs in ferroelectric material platforms, as the platform simultaneously provide efficient electro-optic modulation capability and thus hold the promise for fully integrated WDM transmitters. To date, several demonstrations have been made in the X-cut thin-film lithium niobate ($\mathrm{LiNbO}_3$) platform, yet, the large anisotropy of $\mathrm{LiNbO}_3$ complicates the design and degrades the performance of the AWGs. To address this limitation, we use the recently developed photonic integrated circuits (PICs) based on thin-film lithium tantalate ($\mathrm{LiTaO}_3$), a material with a similar Pockels coefficient as $\mathrm{LiNbO}_3$ but significantly reduced optical anisotropy, as an alternative viable platform. In this work, we manufacture $\mathrm{LiTaO}_3$ AWGs using deep ultraviolet lithography on a wafer-scale. The fabricated AWGs feature a channel spacing of 100 GHz, an insertion loss of &lt; 4 dB and crosstalk of &lt; -14 dB. In addition, we demonstrate a cyclic AWG, as well as a multiplexing and demultiplexing AWG pair for the first time on $\mathrm{LiTaO}_3$ platform. The wafer-scale fabrication of these AWGs not only ensures uniformity and reproducibility, but also paves the way for realizing volume-manufactured integrated WDM transmitters in ferroelectric photonic integrated platforms.</description>

      <title>The destabilizing effect of particle concentration in inclined settlers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Water scarcity has required constant water recycling, leading to a decline in water quality, further exacerbated by high concentrations of fine particles that reduce the efficiency of solid-liquid separation systems. Inclined settlers offer a viable secondary treatment option for high-turbidity water. Effective design requires understanding of operational conditions, geometry, and suspension properties. Using OpenFOAM, computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed for a continuous inclined countercurrent conduit to assess the influence of inlet particle concentration on efficiency, exploring various Surface Overflow Rates (SOR) and inclination angles. The results show that the steady state in which the flow settles is strongly dependent on the particle concentration. For very low particle concentrations, the flow is mostly stationary with little to no resuspension of particles. Increasingly unstable regimes are observed to emerge as the inlet concentration increases, leading to increased particle resuspension. Instabilities arise from overhanging zones at the tip of the suspension, generating recirculation zones that enlarge the resuspension region and induce entrainment within the bulk suspension. Shear instabilities become noticeable at large particle concentrations, further increasing resuspension. Different regimes were identified, influenced by the SOR and the inclination angles. Additionally, a Reynolds number characterizing these systems is proposed alongside a scale analysis. The findings highlight particle concentration as a critical parameter in inclined plate settler design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metamaterials serve as versatile platforms for demonstrating condensed matter physics and non-equilibrium phenomena, with electrical circuits emerging as a particularly compelling medium. This review highlights recent advances in the experimental circuit realizations of topological, non-Hermitian, non-linear, Floquet and other notable phenomena. Initially performed mostly with passive electrical components, topolectrical circuits have evolved to incorporate active elements such as operational amplifiers and analog multipliers that combine to form negative impedance converters, complex phase elements, high-frequency temporal modulators and self-feedback mechanisms. This review provides a summary of these contemporary studies and discusses the broader potential of electrical circuits in physics.</description>

      <title>Resistive switching and charge accumulation in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revealed the resistive switching, negative differential resistance and charge accumulation effects in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders sintered by the auto-combustion sol-gel method and annealed at temperatures from 500{\deg}C to 800{\deg}C. The fraction of the orthorhombic phase, determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), decreases from 91 vol.% to 7 vol.% with an increase in the annealing temperature from 600{\deg}C to 800{\deg}C. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra reveal the great amount of oxygen vacancies in the annealed samples, at that the decrease of the orthorhombic phase fraction (observed with an increase in the annealing temperature) correlates with a decrease in the intensity of EPR spectral lines associated with the oxygen vacancies and impurities. This indicates the participation of oxygen vacancies and other defects in the formation of the orthorhombic phase in the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders. To explain the results of electrophysical measurements, we compare the features of the current-voltage characteristics with the phase composition of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders and with the peculiarities of their EPR spectra. The analysis allows us to relate the resistive switching and charge accumulation observed in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders with the appearance of the ferroelectric-like polar regions in the orthorhombic phase of the nanoparticles, which agrees with the calculations performed in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Bloch phonon-polaritons with anomalous dispersion in polaritonic Fourier crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently suggested concept of a polaritonic Fourier crystal (PFC) is based on a harmonically-corrugated mirror substrate for a thin pristine polaritonic crystal layer. The propagating polaritons in PFC experience a harmonic and mode-selective momentum modulation leading to a manifestation of Bloch modes with practically zero inter-mode scattering. PFC was first demonstrated for the hyperbolic phonon-polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) within its Type II Reststrahlen band (RB-II) where the in-plane components of the dielectric permittivity tensor are isotropic and negative, while the out-of-plane component is positive. By contrast, a Type I Reststrahlen band (RB-I) is characterized by negative out-of-plane and positive in-plane permittivity components, and consequently, the inversion of field symmetry of phonon-polaritons compared to RB-II. Behavior of such RB-I modes in a polaritonic crystal is yet to be explored. Here, we employ a biaxial crystal alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide ({\alpha}-MoO3) and near-field imaging to study polaritonic Bloch modes in a one-dimensional PFC within the RB-I where the mid-infrared phonon-polaritons in {\alpha}-MoO3 have anomalous dispersion and negative phase velocity. Surprisingly, we observe a manifestation of Bloch waves as a dispersionless near-field pattern across the first Brillouin zone, in contrast to RB-II case demonstrated with in-plane isotropic hBN. We attribute this difference to the opposite field symmetry of the lowest-order phonon-polariton mode in the two RBs, leading to a different momentum modulation regime in the polaritonic Fourier crystal. Our results reveal the importance of mode symmetry for polaritonic crystals in general and for the emerging field of Fourier crystals in particular, which promise new ways to manipulate the nanolight.</description>
