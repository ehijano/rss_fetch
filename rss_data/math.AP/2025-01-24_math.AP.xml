      <title>Remarks on hierarchic control for the wave equation in a non cylindrical domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish hierarchic control for the wave equation in a non cylindrical domain $\widehat{Q}$ of $\mathbb{R}^{n + 1}$. We assume that we can act in the dynamic of the system by a hierarchy of controls. According to the formulation given by H. Von Stackelberg \cite{S}, there are local controls, called followers and global controls, called leaders. In fact, one considers situations where there are two cost (objective) functions. One possible way is to cut the control into two parts, one being thought of as "the leader" and the other one as "the follower". This situation is studied in the paper, with one of the cost functions being of the controllability type. Existence and uniqueness is proven. The optimality system is given in the paper.</description>

      <title>Boundedness in a nonlinear chemotaxis-consumption model with gradient terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a chemotaxis-consumption mechanism, in which some chemical signal and cells density interact each other. In order to control the concentration of such a population, sources involving gradient nonlinearities, which introduce a dampening effect on the model, are considered. Moreover, the system is characterized by nonlinear diffusion and sensitivity terms. We derive conditions on some data of the problem so to ensure the boundedness of related solutions.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness for dissipative IPM with data close to a class of special solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the 2-D dissipative incompressible porous media (IPM) equation in both supercritical and subcritical cases. The dissipative IPM equation admits a class of special solutions of the form $\rho(x_1,x_2,t)=f(x_2,t)$, which decay in the mode of the 1-D fractional heat equation. Our main result is the global well-posedness for the dissipative IPM equation with initial data close to this class of special solutions provided that $f$ satisfies certain regularity assumptions.</description>

      <title>Steady Prandtl Expansion for Subsonic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming construction of Prandtl and its high order corrections for compressible fluids with small Mach number, we establish nonlinear remainder bound and justify the validity of the Prandtl layer expansion in the inviscid limit for an insulated boundary. To solve the full steady compressible Navier-Stokes system, which consists a div-curl reduction of \textit{the momentum equations} to an elliptic system for the stream function $\phi $ as well as an transport equation for the pressure $p$. The contruction of $\phi$ is based on an improved Guo-Iyer's $H^{4}$ theory for incompressible flows via development of a $H_{00}^{1/2}$ technique with a type \textit{viscous-inflow} BC, and the pressure $p$ is solved by imposing a key additional \textit{viscous-inflow} boundary condition as \begin{equation} \big\{(\mu +\lambda )u_{s}\Delta_{\varepsilon} p + 2(\frac{\mu}{\lambda}+1)p_s (1-\frac{1}{2}u_s^2)p_{x}\big\}\big|_{x=0}\backsim \text{given.} \end{equation} We reformulate the \textit{energy equation} in terms of the \textit{pseudo entropy} $S$ (not the temperature), which exhibits a crucial uniform bound for the final closure.</description>

      <title>Non-polynomial conserved quantities for ODE systems and its application to the long-time behavior of solutions to cubic NLS systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of small solutions to the initial value problem for a system of cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equations (NLS) in one spatial dimension. We identify a new class of NLS systems for which the global boundedness and asymptotics of small solutions can be established, even in the absence of any effective conserved quantity. The key to this analysis lies in utilizing conserved quantities for the reduced ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems derived from the original NLS systems. In a previous study, the first author investigated conserved quantities expressed as quartic polynomials. In contrast, the conserved quantities considered in the present paper are of a different type and are not necessarily polynomial.</description>

      <title>General Error Estimates of Non Conforming Approximation of System of Reaction-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to establish a first general error estimate for numerical approximations of the system of reaction-diffusion equations (SRDEs), using reasonable regularity assumptions on the exact solutions. We employ the gradient discretisation method (GDM) to discretise the system and prove the existence and uniqueness of the approximate solutions. The analysis provided here is not limited to specific reaction functions, and it is applicable to all conforming and non-conforming schemes fitting within the GDM framework. As an application, we present numerical results based on a finite volume method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the wave equation for the Laplace operator with potential, initial data, and nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. We establish a weak solution by using traces and extension domains. We also establish the existence, uniqueness and consistency of the very weak solution for the wave equation with singularities in the potential, initial data, source term, boundary and boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Modified approach for linear and non-linear IBVPs with fractional dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical and numerical techniques have been developed for solving fractional partial differential equations (FPDEs) and their systems with initial conditions. However, it is much more challenging to develop analytical or numerical techniques for FPDEs with boundary conditions, although some methods do exist to address such problems. In this paper, a modified technique based on the Adomian decomposition method with Laplace transformation is presented, which effectively treats initial-boundary value problems. The non-linear term has been controlled by Daftardar-Jafari polynomials. Our proposed technique is applied to several initial and boundary value problems and the obtained results are presented through graphs. The differing behavior of the solutions for the suggested problems is observed by using various fractional orders. It is found that our proposed technique has a high rate of convergence towards the exact solutions of the problems. Moreover, while implementing this modification, higher accuracy is achieved with a small number of calculations, which is the main novelty of the proposed technique. The present method requires a new approximate solution in each iteration that adds further accuracy to the solution. It demonstrates that our suggested technique can be used effectively to solve initial-boundary value problems of FPDEs.</description>

      <title>Large time behavior for the classical wave equation with different regular data and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly consider large time behavior for the classical free wave equation $u_{tt}-\Delta u=0$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. For the initial data such that $\nabla^su_t(0,\cdot)\in L^2\cap L^{1,1}$, we derive that the quantity of solution $\|u(t,\cdot)\|_{L^2}$ blows up in finite time if $n\leqslant 2s$; blows up in infinite time (growth polynomially or logarithmically) if $2s&lt;n\leqslant 2+2s$; neither decays nor grows if $n&gt;2+2s$, where their optimal upper and lower bounds are obtained. These results show the critical dimensions $n_0=2s$ and $n_1=2+2s$ for the local and global (in time) stabilities, respectively. By dropping the $L^1$ integrability of initial data, this quantity can only grow polynomially for any $n\geqslant 1$. We also apply these results to the undamped $\sigma$-evolution equation, the critical Moore-Gibson-Thompson equation,and the linearized compressible Euler system.</description>

      <title>Reverse Faber-Krahn inequalities for the Logarithmic potential operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a bounded open set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2,$ we consider the largest eigenvalue $\tau_1(\Omega)$ of the Logarithmic potential operator $\mathcal{L}$. If $diam(\Omega)\le 1$, we prove reverse Faber-Krahn type inequalities for $\tau_1(\Omega)$ under polarization and Schwarz symmetrization. Further, we establish the monotonicity of $\tau_1(\Omega\setminus\mathcal{O})$ with respect to certain translations and rotations of the obstacle $\mathcal{O}$ within $\Omega$. The analogous results are also stated for the largest eigenvalue of the Riesz potential operator. Furthermore, we investigate properties of the smallest eigenvalue $\tilde{\tau}_1(\Omega)$ for a domain whose transfinite diameter is greater than 1. Finally, we characterize the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{L}$ on $B_R$, including the $\tilde{\tau}_1(B_R)$ when $R&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Steady 3d Euler flows via a topology-preserving convex integration scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given any smooth solenoidal vector field $v_0$ on $\mathbf T^3$, we show the existence of infinitely many H\"older-continuous steady Euler flows $v$ with the same topology as $v_0$, in certain weak sense. In particular, we show that $v$ possesses a unique flow of the highest H\"older regularity, which is conjugate to the flow of $v_0$ via a volume-preserving H\"older homeomorphism of $\mathbf T^3$. This result extends to the case of Euler equations on toroidal domains, which has applications to the study of plasmas. The proof relies on a novel convex integration scheme incorporating the key idea that the velocity field of the subsolutions must remain diffeomorphic to $v_0$ at each iteration step.</description>

      <title>Small-time local controllability of a KdV system for all critical lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the small-time local controllability problem for the KdV system on an interval with a Neumann boundary control. In 1997, Rosier discovered that the linearized system is uncontrollable if and only if the length is critical, namely $L=2\pi\sqrt{(k^2+ kl+ l^2)/3}$ for some integers $k$ and $l$.
  Coron and Cr\'epeau (2003) proved that the nonlinear system is small-time locally controllable even if the linearized system is not, provided that $k= l$ is the only solution pair. Later, Cerpa and Crepeau showed that the system is large-time locally controllable for all critical lengths. In 2020, Coron, Koenig, and Nguyen found that the system is not small-time locally controllable if $2k+l\not \in 3\mathbb{N}^*$.
  We demonstrate that if the critical length satisfies $2k+l \in 3\mathbb{N}^*$ with $k\neq l$, then the system is not small-time locally controllable. This paper, together with the above results, gives a complete answer to the longstanding open problem on the small-time local controllability of KdV on all critical lengths since the pioneer work by Rosier</description>

      <title>On asymptotic stability of stable Good Boussinesq solitary waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the generalized Good-Boussinesq (GB) model in one dimension, with subcritical power nonlinearity $1&lt;p&lt;5$ and data in the energy space $H^1\times L^2$. This model has solitary waves with speeds $c\in (-1,1)$. If $c^2&gt;\frac{p-1}{4}$, Bona and Sachs showed the orbital stability of such waves. Previously, one of us proved that unstable GB standing waves can be perturbed with particular odd-even data in a suitable submanifold of the energy space, leading to the asymptotic stability property if $p\ge 2$. In this paper we prove that stable GB solitary waves are asymptotically stable in the case of general initial data placed in the energy space for any $p\ge 2$ and speeds $|c|&gt;c_+(p)\geq \sqrt{\frac{p-1}{4}}$. The proof involves the introduction of a new set of virial estimates specifically adapted to the GB system in a moving setting. In particular, a new virial estimate with mixed variables is considered to treat arbitrary scaling and shift modulations. Another new ingredient is the understanding the corresponding linear matrix operator under mixed orthogonality conditions, a feature absent in our previous works.</description>

      <title>On the semi-classical limit for the Landau-Fermi-Dirac equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sequences of solutions to the inhomogeneous Landau-Fermi-Dirac equation with Coulomb potential in which the quantum parameter converges to zero. Our main result establishes the compactness of these sequences, which allows us to show that, up to a subsequence, these solutions converge to a renormalized solution of the classical Landau equation with a defect measure, as defined by Villani.
  To do this, we work in the class of solutions that are obtained through approximation procedures. For these solutions, we were able to show compactness in the vanishing quantum parameter limit through a diagonal argument, which combines techniques from the study of Cauchy problems for both the classical Landau and the Landau-Fermi-Dirac equations.</description>

      <title>Global existence of Lagrangian solutions to the ionic Vlasov--Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the global existence of Lagrangian solutions to the ionic Vlasov--Poisson system under mild integrability assumptions on the initial data. Our approach involves proving the well-posedness of the Poisson--Boltzmann equation for densities in $L^p$ with $p&gt;1$, introducing a novel decomposition technique that ensures uniqueness, stability, and improved bounds for the thermalized electron density. Using this result, we construct global-in-time Lagrangian solutions while demonstrating that the energy functional remains uniformly bounded by its initial value. Additionally, we show that renormalized solutions coincide with Lagrangian solutions, highlighting the transport structure of the system, and prove that renormalized solutions coincide with weak solutions under additional integrability assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model of self-generated directional cell migration on viscoelastic substrates in the absence of apparent intrinsic polarity. We study stationary states and prove that a traveling pulse, which corresponds to the appearance of a persistent collective migration for this model, is only guaranteed for a sufficiently large stiffness. We prove that the equation is globally well-posed, we study the stability of the traveling pulse and we prove that the stationary state is a unique attractive state for the dynamics of the problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a streamlined account of two different regularity methods as well as their connections. We consider the coupling method in the context of tug-of-war with noise stochastic games, and consider viscosity solutions of the $p$-Laplace equation in the context of the Ishii-Lions method.</description>

      <title>The Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the wake of major breakthroughs in General Relativity during the 1960s, Roger Penrose introduced Strong Cosmic Censorship, a profound conjecture regarding the deterministic nature of the theory. Penrose's proposal has since opened far-reaching new mathematical avenues, revealing connections to fundamental questions about black holes and the nature of gravitational singularities. We review recent advances arising from modern techniques in the theory of partial differential equations as applied to Strong Cosmic Censorship, maintaining a focus on the context of gravitational collapse that gave birth to the conjecture.</description>

      <title>v-representability and Hohenberg-Kohn theorem for non-interacting Schr\"odinger operators with distributional potentials in the one-dimensional torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the ground-state density of any non-interacting Schr\"odinger operator on the one-dimensional torus with potentials in a certain class of distributions is strictly positive. This result together with recent results from [Sutter el al (2024), J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 475202] provides a complete characterization of the set of non-interacting v-representable densities on the torus. Moreover, we prove that, for said class of non-interacting Schr\"odinger operators with distributional potentials, the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem holds, i.e., the external potential is uniquely determined by the ground-state density. In particular, the density-to-potential Kohn-Sham map is single-valued, and the non-interacting Lieb functional is differentiable at every point in this space of $v$-representable densities. These results contribute to establishing a solid mathematical foundation for the Kohn-Sham scheme in this simplified setting.</description>

      <title>Synchronization by noise for traveling pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider synchronization by noise for stochastic partial differential equations which support traveling pulse solutions, such as the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. We show that any two pulse-like solutions which start from different positions but are forced by the same realization of a multiplicative noise, converge to each other in probability on a time scale $\sigma^{-2} \ll t \ll \exp(\sigma^{-2})$, where $\sigma$ is the noise amplitude. The noise is assumed to be Gaussian, white in time, colored and periodic in space, and non-degenerate only in the lowest Fourier mode. The proof uses the method of phase reduction, which allows one to describe the dynamics of the stochastic pulse only in terms of its position. The position is shown to synchronize building upon existing results, and the validity of the phase reduction allows us to transfer the synchronization back to the full solution.</description>

      <title>Solutions of differential equations in Freud-weighted Sobolev spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We lay some mathematically rigorous foundations for the resolution of differential equations with respect to semi-classical bases and topologies, namely Freud-Sobolev polynomials and spaces. In this quest, we uncover an elegant theory melding various topics in Numerical and Functional Analysis: Poincar\'e inequalities, Sobolev orthogonal polynomials, Painlev\'e equations and more. Brought together, these ingredients allow us to quantify the compactness of Sobolev embeddings on Freud-weighted spaces and finally resolve some differential equations in this topology. As an application, we rigorously and tightly enclose solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with sextic potential.</description>

      <title>L^p Boundedness of the Scattering Wave Operators of Schroedinger Dynamics with Time-dependent Potentials and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.14356v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes the $L^p$ boundedness of wave operators for linear Schr\"odinger equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with time-dependent potentials. The approach to the proof is based on new cancellation lemmas. As a typical application based on this method, combined with Strichartz estimates is the existence and scattering for nonlinear dispersive equations. For example, we prove global existence and uniform boundedness in $L^{\infty}$, for a class of Hartree nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^3),$ allowing the presence of solitons. We also prove the existence of free channel wave operators in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for $p&gt;p_c(n)$, with $p_c(3)=6$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a symmetrization that preserves the mixed volume of the sublevel sets of a convex function, under which, a P\'olya-Szeg\H o type inequality holds. We refine this symmetrization to obtain a quantitative improvement of the P\'olya-Szeg\H o inequality for the $k$-Hessian integral, and, with similar arguments, we show a quantitative inequality for the comparison proved by Tso \cite{tso} for solutions to the $k$-Hessian equation.
  As an application of the first result, we prove a quantitative version of the Faber-Krahn and Saint-Venant inequalities for these equations.</description>

  We establish interior regularity results of weak solutions and use those results to obtain point-wise asymptotic estimates for solutions to \[ \left\{ \begin{aligned} -\mathrm{div}\,(w|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u)&amp;=w|u|^{q-2}u&amp;&amp;\text{in }\Omega,\\ u\in D^{1,p}&amp;(\Omega,wdx) \end{aligned} \right. \] for a critical exponent $q&gt;p$ in the sense of Sobolev.</description>

Abstract: Considered in this work is the Yang-Mills field in an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, a physically motivated mathematical model introduced by Bizo\'n and Kahl. The kink is a fundamental, strongly unstable stationary solution in this non-perturbative, variable coefficients model, with a polynomial tail and no explicit form. In this paper, we introduce and extend several virial techniques, adapt them to the inhomogeneous medium setting, and construct a finite codimensional manifold of the energy space where the kink is asymptotically stable. In particular, we handle, using virial techniques, the emergence of a weak threshold resonance in the description of the stable manifold.</description>

      <title>Models for information propagation on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.07577v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and unify classes of different models for information propagation over graphs. In a first class, propagation is modelled as a wave which emanates from a set of \emph{known} nodes at an initial time, to all other \emph{unknown} nodes at later times with an ordering determined by the arrival time of the information wave front. A second class of models is based on the notion of a travel time along paths between nodes. The time of information propagation from an initial \emph{known} set of nodes to a node is defined as the minimum of a generalised travel time over subsets of all admissible paths. A final class is given by imposing a local equation of an eikonal form at each \emph{unknown} node, with boundary conditions at the \emph{known} nodes. The solution value of the local equation at a node is coupled to those of neighbouring nodes with lower values. We provide precise formulations of the model classes and prove equivalences between them. Finally we apply the front propagation models on graphs to semi-supervised learning via label propagation and information propagation on trust networks.</description>

      <title>Scattering of Dirac Fields in the Interior of Kerr-Newman(-Anti)-de Sitter Black Holes via Comparison and Symmetry Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a scattering theory for the massive and charged Dirac fields in the interiors of sub-extremal Kerr-Newman(-anti)-de Sitter black holes. More precisely, we show existence, uniqueness and asymptotic completeness of scattering data for such Dirac fields from the event horizon of the black hole to the Cauchy horizon. Our approach relies on constructing the wave operators where the Hamiltonian of the full dynamics is time-dependent. To prove asymptotic completeness, we use two methods. The first involves a comparison operator, while for the second we introduce and employ a symmetry operator of the Dirac equation.</description>

Abstract: We are interested in the feedback stabilization of general linear multi-dimensional first order hyperbolic systems in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Using a Lyapunov function with a suited weight function depending on the system under consideration we show stabilization in $L^2$ for the studied system using a suitable feedback control. Therefore the controllability of the studied system is related to the feasibility of an associated linear matrix inequality.We show the applicability discussing the barotropic Euler equations.</description>

      <title>Kasner-like description of spacelike singularities in spherically symmetric spacetimes with scalar matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of spacelike singularities in spherically symmetric spacetimes obeying the Einstein equations, in the presence of matter. We consider in particular matter described by a scalar field, both in the presence of an electromagnetic field and without. We prove that if a spacelike singularity obeying several reasonable assumptions is formed, then the Hawking mass, the Kretschmann scalar, and the matter fields have inverse polynomial blow-up rates near the singularity that may be described precisely.
  Furthermore, one may view the resulting spacetime in the context of the BKL heuristics regarding space-like singularities in relativistic cosmology. In particular, near any point $p$ on the singular boundary in our spherically symmetric spacetime, we obtain a leading order BKL-type expansion, including a description of Kasner exponents associated to $p$.
  This provides a rigorous description of a detailed correspondence between Kasner-like singularities most often associated to the cosmological setting, and the singularities observed in (spherically symmetric) gravitational collapse. Moreover, we outline a program concerning the study of the stability and instability of spacelike singularities in the latter picture, both outside of spherical symmetry and within (where the electromagnetic field acts as a proxy for angular momentum).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stabilization of partial differential equations is a topic of utmost importance in mathematics as well as in engineering sciences. Concerning one dimensional problems there exists a well developed theory. Due to numerous important applications the interest in boundary feedback control of multi-dimensional hyperbolic systems is increasing. In the present work we want to discuss the relation between some of the most recent results available in the literature. The key result of the present work is to show that the type of system discussed in Yang and Yong (2024) identifies a particular class which falls into the framework presented in Herty and Thein (2024).</description>

      <title>Volume preserving spacetime mean curvature flow in initial data sets and applications to General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a volume preserving curvature evolution of surfaces in an asymptotically Euclidean initial data set with positive ADM-energy. The speed is given by a nonlinear function of the mean curvature which generalizes the spacetime mean curvature recently considered by Cederbaum-Sakovich (Calc. Var. PDE, 2021). Following a classical approach by Huisken-Yau (Invent. Math. 1996), we show that the flow starting from suitably round initial surfaces exists for all times and converges to a constant (spacetime) curvature limit. This provides an alternative construction of the CSTMC foliation by Cederbaum-Sakovich and has applications in the definition of center of mass of an isolated system in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Deep learning methods for stochastic Galerkin approximations of elliptic random PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers stochastic Galerkin approximations of linear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) with stochastic forcing terms and stochastic diffusion coefficients, that cannot be bounded uniformly away from zero and infinity. A traditional numerical method for solving the resulting high-dimensional coupled system of PDEs is replaced by deep learning techniques. In order to achieve this, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which typically operate on the strong residual of the PDE and can therefore be applied in a wide range of settings, are considered. As a second approach, the Deep Ritz method, which is a neural network that minimizes the Ritz energy functional to find the weak solution, is employed. While the second approach only works in special cases, it overcomes the necessity of testing in variational problems while maintaining mathematical rigor and ensuring the existence of a unique solution. Furthermore, the residual is of a lower differentiation order, reducing the training cost considerably. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on several model problems.</description>
