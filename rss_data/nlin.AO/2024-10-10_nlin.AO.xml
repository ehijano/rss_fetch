      <title>Reverse Aperiodic Resonance in Low- to High-Dimensional Bistable Systems: A Complement to Stochastic Resonance Studies in Logic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As circuits continue to miniaturize, noise has become a significant obstacle to performance optimization. Stochastic resonance in logic circuits offers an innovative approach to harness noise constructively; however, current implementations are limited to basic logical functions such as OR, AND, NOR, and NAND, restricting broader applications. This paper introduces a three-dimensional (3D) coupling model to investigate the counterintuitive phenomena that arise in nonlinear systems under noise. Compared to the one-dimensional Langevin equation and the two-dimensional Duffing equation, the 3D coupling model features more adjustable parameters and coupling interactions, enhancing the system's dynamic behavior. The study demonstrates that increasing noise intensity triggers reverse aperiodic resonance, leading to signal phase reversal and amplitude amplification. This phenomenon is attributed to the motion of Brownian particles in a bistable potential well. Additionally, reverse aperiodic resonance addresses the lack of logical negation in traditional stochastic resonance systems by introducing noise-driven phase reversal, providing a novel alternative to conventional inverters.</description>

      <title>Type-III intermittency in emergent bursting dynamics of globally coupled rotators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globally coupled populations of phase rotators with linear adaptive coupling can exhibit collective bursting oscillations between asynchronous and partially synchronized states, which can be either periodic or chaotic. Here, we analyze the transition between these two regimes, where the dynamics consists of periods of nearly regular bursting interspersed with irregular spiking intervals, and demonstrate its correspondence to intermittent transition to chaos. Specifically, we consider a bimodal Kuramoto model with linear global feedback, which allows for a mean-field formulation of the dynamics and thus to investigate the phenomenology in the thermodynamic limit. We reconstruct the one-dimensional first-return maps of inter-burst intervals and estimate the Floquet multiplier associated with the unstable bursting solution. The results indicate type-III intermittency, which is also supported by the scaling of the average laminar periods as the control parameter varies, along with their probability density distribution.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transition in anti-symmetric Lotka-Volterra doublet chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the emergence of topological phase transition in the minimal model of two dimensional rock-paper-scissors cycle in the form of a doublet chain. The evolutionary dynamics of the doublet chain is obtained by solving the anti-symmetric Lotka-Volterra equation. We show that the mass decays exponentially towards edges and robust against small perturbation in the rate of change of mass transfer, a signature of a topological phase. For one of the configuration of our doublet chain, the mass is transferred towards both edges and the bulk is gaped. Further, we confirm this phase transition within the framework of topological band theory. For this we calculate the winding number which change from zero to one for trivial and a non-trivial topological phases respectively.</description>

      <title>Extreme events and power-law distributions from nonlinear quantum dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power-law probability distributions are widely used to model extreme statistical events in complex systems, with applications to a vast array of natural phenomena ranging from earthquakes to stock market crashes to pandemics. We propose the emergence of power-law distributions as a generic feature of quantum systems with strong nonlinear dissipation. We introduce a prototypical family of quantum dynamical systems with nonlinear dissipation, and prove analytically the emergence of power-law tails in the steady state probability distribution for energy. The power law physically originates from the amplification of quantum noise, where the scale of the microscopic fluctuations grows with the energy of the system. Our model predicts a power-law regime with infinite mean energy, which manifests as extreme events and divergences in the measurement statistics. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence of power-law distributions for a general class of nonlinear dynamics known as quantum Li\'enard systems. This phenomenon can be potentially harnessed to develop extreme photon sources for novel applications in light-matter interaction and sensing.</description>

      <title>How Network Topology Affects the Strength of Dangerous Power Grid Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasonably large perturbations may push a power grid from its stable synchronous state into an undesirable state. Identifying vulnerabilities in power grids by studying power grid stability against such perturbations can aid in preventing future blackouts. Probabilistic stability quantifiers such as basin stability, which measures the asymptotic stability of a system, and survivability, which measures the transient stability of a system, have been commonly used to quantify the stability of nodes in a power grid. However, these quantifiers do not provide information about the strength of perturbations that destabilize the system. To measure the strength of perturbations beyond which the stability of the system gets compromised, we employ two probabilistic distance-based stability measures -- basin stability bound, which deals with a system's asymptotic behaviour, and survivability bound, a newly defined stability measure that deals with a system's transient behaviour. Using these stability quantifiers, we conduct a detailed study on the impact of network topology on the strength of dangerous power grid perturbations. We find that certain tree-like structures and node connectivity can strongly predict nodes with low asymptotic and transient stability; we highlight network structures that are particularly vulnerable.</description>
