      <title>A modulated nonlinear system: breathers and time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study space-time modulated system using as a specific example a system of cantilevers with their on-site potential provided by electromagnets fed with DC and AC currents. The system equations are deduced and the effect of the modulation on the dispersion bands is examined. We adapt the theory of breather existence and stability to space-time modulation. We concentrate the numerical calculations in time-modulated system for which we have obtained different types of breathers for a wide range of frequencies that can be classified in two different classes (i) the modulation frequency is an integer multiple of the breather frequency and (ii) the breather frequency is an integer multiple of the modulation frequency. The first class, corresponds to the formation of time crystals as there is no entropy production. The construction of a similar system would be of interest to study the properties of dynamic metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Enhancing PINN Accuracy for the RLW Equation: Adaptive and Conservative Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard physics-informed neural network implementations have produced large error rates when using these models to solve the regularized long wave (RLW) equation. Two improved PINN approaches were developed in this research: an adaptive approach with self-adaptive loss weighting and a conservative approach enforcing explicit conservation laws. Three benchmark tests were used to demonstrate how effective PINN's are as they relate to the type of problem being solved (i.e., time dependent RLW equation). The first was a single soliton traveling along a line (propagation), the second was the interaction between two solitons, and the third was the evolution of an undular bore over the course of $t=250$. The results demonstrated that the effectiveness of PINNs are problem specific. The adaptive PINN was significantly better than both the conservative PINN and the standard PINN at solving problems involving complex nonlinear interactions such as colliding two solitons. The conservative approach was significantly better at solving problems involving long term behavior of single solitons and undular bores. However, the most important finding from this research is that explicitly enforcing conservation laws may be harmful to optimizing the solution of highly nonlinear systems of equations and therefore requires special training methods. The results from our adaptive and conservative approaches were within $O(10^{-5})$ of established numerical solutions for the same problem, thus demonstrating that PINNs can provide accurate solutions to complex systems of partial differential equations without the need for a discretization of space or time (mesh free). Moreover, the finding from this research challenges the assumptions that conservation enforcement will always improve the performance of a PINN and provides researchers with guidelines for designing PINNs for use on specific types of problems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced coherence in the periodically driven two-dimensional XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong optical drives have been shown to induce transient superconducting-like response in materials above their equilibrium $T_c$. Many of these materials already exhibit short-range superconducting correlations in equilibrium. This motivates the question: can external driving enhance coherence in systems with superconducting correlations but no long-range order? We explore this scenario in the two-dimensional XY model with a periodically modulated stiffness using overdamped Langevin dynamics. We find that, even though the modulation leaves the average coupling unchanged, the drive can markedly increase long-range, time-averaged correlations in systems well above the equilibrium Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature. The outcome depends on the ratio of the drive frequency to the intrinsic relaxation rate: faster drives primarily heat the system, suppressing correlations and conductivity. For slower drives, the optical conductivity is modified so that the real part exhibits a prolonged effective Drude scattering time, while the imaginary part has a strengthened low-frequency $1/\omega$ behavior. We map out these regimes across temperature, frequency, and amplitude, and rationalize them via simple analytics and vortex-thermalization arguments. Overall, we identify a generic nonequilibrium route to enhance coherence in XY-like systems, with potential relevance to experiments reporting light-induced superconductivity.</description>

      <title>A Complex Topological Phase in C-Spin Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a new theoretical model for active matter ("complementary-spins" or c-spins), exploring the interplay of positional and orientational order in mobile agents with rotational freedom, divided into two populations with contrasting interactions. The system's behavior depends on its size and a control parameter (circular anisotropy) that splits the agents' natural rotational frequencies. Key findings include distinct phases based on anisotropy: Small Anisotropy: Stable, regular equilibrium patterns emerge. Moderate Anisotropy: Formation of complex, non-equilibrium topological point defects (vortex states), which are bistable with uniform patterns. These robust, self-repairing defects exhibit counter-rotating c-spin loop trains, spin-momentum locking, and dissipationless flow, classified by a two-valued topological charge. High Anisotropy: Transition to active turbulence and loss of order. Statistical analysis reveals a double phase transition at a critical value: a standard symmetry-breaking transition and a novel topological phase transition activating the vortex complexes. Increasing system size enhances organizational complexity and the development of spin-momentum locked transport networks. This model provides a new framework for understanding robustness and morphogenesis in living systems.</description>

      <title>Stability of intrinsic localized modes on the lattice with competing power nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation with competing powers (p,q) satisfying 2 &lt;= p &lt; q. The physically relevant cases are given by (p,q) = (2,3), (p,q) = (3,4), and (p,q) = (3,5). In the anticontinuum limit, all intrinsic localized modes are compact and can be classified by their codes, which record one of two nonzero (smaller and larger) states and their sign alternations. By using the spectral stability analysis, we prove that the codes for larger states of the same sign are spectrally and nonlinearly (orbitally) stable, whereas the codes for smaller states of the alternating signs are spectrally stable but have eigenvalues of negative Krein signature. We also identify numerically the spectrally stable codes which consist of stacked combinations of the sign-definite larger states and the sign-alternating smaller states.</description>

      <title>An amended Ehrenfest theorem for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in one- and two-dimensional potential boxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the usual form of the Ehrenfest theorem (ET), which couples the motion of the center of mass (COM) of the one-dimensional (1D) wave function to the respective classical equation of motion, is not valid in the case of the potential box, confined by the zero boundary conditions. A modified form of the ET was proposed for this case, which includes an effective force originating from the interaction of the 1D quantum particle with the box edges. In this work, we derive an amended ET for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which includes the cubic nonlinear term, as well as for the 2D square-shaped potential box. In the latter case, we derive an amended COM equation of motion with an effective force exerted by the edges of the rectangular box, while the nonlinear term makes no direct contribution to the 1D and 2D versions of the ET. Nonetheless, the nonlinearity affects the amended ET through the edge-generated force. As a result, the nonlinearity of the underlying GPE can make the COM motion in the potential box irregular. The validity of the amended ET for the 1D and 2D GPEs with the respective potential boxes is confirmed by the comparison of numerical simulations of the underlying GPE and the corresponding amended COM equation of motion. The reported findings are relevant to the ongoing experiments carried out for atomic Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in the box potentials.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emergence of solitary waves in active flow networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow networks are fundamental for understanding systems such as animal and plant vasculature or power distribution grids. These networks can encode, transmit, and transform information embodied in the spatial and temporal distribution of their flows. In this work, we focus on a minimal yet physically grounded system that allows us to isolate the fundamental mechanisms by which active flow networks generate and regulate emergent dynamics capable of supporting information transmission. The system is composed of active units that pump fluid and elastic units that store volume. From first principles, we derive a discrete model-an active flow network-that enables the simulation of large systems with many interacting units. Numerically, we show that the pressure field can develop solitary waves, resulting in the spontaneous creation and transmission of localized packets of information stored in the physical properties of the flow. We characterize how these solitary waves emerge from disordered initial conditions in a one-dimensional network, and how their size and propagation speed depend on key system parameters. Finally, when the elastic units are coupled to their neighbors, the solitary waves exhibit even richer dynamics, with diverse shapes and finite lifetimes that display power-law behaviors that we can predict analytically. Together, these results show how simple fluidic elements can collectively create, shape and transport information, laying the foundations for understanding-and ultimately engineering-information processing in active flow systems.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis-induced phase separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemotaxis allows single cells to self-organize at the population level, as classically described by Keller-Segel models. We show that chemotactic aggregation can be understood using a generalized Maxwell construction based on the balance of density fluxes and reactive turnover. This formulation implies that aggregates generically undergo coarsening, which is interrupted and reversed by cell growth and death. Together, both stable and spatiotemporally dynamic aggregates emerge. Our theory mechanistically links chemotactic self-organization to phase separation and reaction-diffusion patterns.</description>

      <title>Coarsening dynamics of chemotactic aggregates</title>

Abstract: Auto-chemotaxis, the directed movement of cells along gradients in chemicals they secrete, is central to the formation of complex spatiotemporal patterns in biological systems. Since the introduction of the Keller--Segel model, numerous variants have been analyzed, revealing phenomena such as coarsening of aggregates, stable aggregate sizes, and spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics. Here, we consider general mass-conserving Keller--Segel models, that is, models without cell growth and death, and analyze the generic long-time dynamics of the chemotactic aggregates. Building on and extending our previous work, which demonstrated that chemotactic aggregation can be understood through a generalized Maxwell construction balancing density fluxes and reactive turnover, we use singular perturbation theory to derive the rates of mass competition between well-separated aggregates. We analyze how this mass-competition process drives coarsening in both diffusion- and reaction-limited regimes, with the diffusion-limited rate aligning with our previous quasi-steady-state analyses. Our results generalize earlier mathematical findings, demonstrating that coarsening is driven by self-amplifying mass transport and aggregate coalescence. Additionally, we provide a linear stability analysis of the lateral instability, predicting it through a nullcline-slope criterion that parallels the curvature criterion in spinodal decomposition. Overall, our findings suggest that chemotactic aggregates behave similarly to phase-separating droplets, providing a robust framework for understanding the coarse-grained dynamics of auto-chemotactic cell populations and a quantitative basis for comparing chemotactic coarsening to canonical non-equilibrium phase separation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-preserving and energy-conserving methods for a hyperbolic approximation of the BBM equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolic approximation of the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (BBM) equation proposed recently by Gavrilyuk and Shyue (2022). We develop asymptotic-preserving numerical methods using implicit-explicit (additive) Runge-Kutta methods that are implicit in the stiff linear part. The new discretization of the hyperbolization conserves important invariants converging to invariants of the BBM equation. We use the entropy relaxation approach to make the fully discrete schemes energy-preserving. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these discretizations.</description>
