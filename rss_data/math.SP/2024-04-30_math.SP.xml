      <title>Exponential localization for eigensections of the Bochner-Schr\"odinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study asymptotic spectral properties of the Bochner-Schr\"odinger operator $H_{p}=\frac 1p\Delta^{L^p\otimes E}+V$ on high tensor powers of a Hermitian line bundle $L$ twisted by a Hermitian vector bundle $E$ on a Riemannian manifold $X$ of bounded geometry under assumption that the curvature form of $L$ is non-degenerate. At an arbitrary point $x_0$ of $X$ the operator $H_p$ can be approximated by a model operator $\mathcal H^{(x_0)}$, which is a Schr\"odinger operator with constant magnetic field. For large $p$, the spectrum of $H_p$ asymptotically coincides, up to order $p^{-1/4}$, with the union of the spectra of the model operators $\mathcal H^{(x_0)}$ over $X$. We show that, if the union of the spectra of $\mathcal H^{(x_0)}$ over the complement of a compact subset of $X$ has a gap, then the spectrum of $H_{p}$ in the gap is discrete and the corresponding eigensections decay exponentially away the compact subset.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic 3-manifolds with uniform spectral gap for coclosed 1-forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two quantifications of being a homology sphere for hyperbolic 3-manifolds, one geometric and one topological: the spectral gap for the Laplacian on coclosed 1-forms and the size of the first torsion homology group. We first construct a sequence of closed hyperbolic integer homology spheres with volume tending to infinity and a uniform coclosed 1-form spectral gap. This answers a question asked by Lin--Lipnowski. We also find sequences of hyperbolic rational homology spheres with the same properties that geometrically converge to a tame limit manifold. Moreover, we show that any such sequence must have unbounded torsion homology growth. Finally we show that a sequence of closed hyperbolic rational homology 3-spheres with uniformly bounded rank and a uniform coclosed 1-form spectral gap must have torsion homology that grows exponentially in volume.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between validity of the $p$-Poincar\'e inequality and finiteness of the strict $p$-capacitary inradius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the $p$-Poincar\'e inequality holds on an open set $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ if and only if the strict $p$-capacitary inradius of $\Omega$ is finite. To that end, new upper and lower bounds for the infimum for the associated nonlinear Rayleigh quotients are derived.</description>

      <title>Structural properties of Krylov subspaces and applications to unbounded self-adjoint operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of the inherent structural properties of Krylov subspaces, in particular for the self-adjoint class of operators, and how they relate with the important phenomenon of `Krylov solvability' of linear inverse problems. Owing to the complexity of the problem in the unbounded setting, recently developed perturbative techniques are used that exploit the use of the weak topology on $\mathcal{H}$. We also make a strong connection between the approximative properties of the Krylov subspace and the famous Hamburger problem of moments, in particular the determinacy condition.</description>

      <title>Maximal multiplicity of Laplacian eigenvalues in negatively curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain the first upper bound on the multiplicity of Laplacian eigenvalues for negatively curved surfaces which is sublinear in the genus g. Our proof relies on a trace argument for the heat kernel, and on the idea of leveraging an r-net in the surface to control this trace. This last idea was introduced in [Jiang-Tidor-Yao-Zhang-Zhao, 2021] for similar spectral purposes in the context of graphs of bounded degree. Our method is robust enough to also yield an upper bound on the ``approximate multiplicity'' of eigenvalues, i.e., the number of eigenvalues in windows of size $1/\log^\beta(g)$, $\beta&gt;0$. This work provides new insights on a conjecture by Colin de Verdi{\`e}re [Colin de Verdi{\`e}re, 1986] and new ways to transfer spectral results from graphs to surfaces.</description>

      <title>On topological states and secular equations for quantum-graph eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum graphs without interaction which contain equilateral cycles possess "topological" bound states which do not correspond to zeroes of one of the two variants of the secular equation for quantum graphs. Instead, their eigenvalues lie in the set of singularities of the vertex-scattering secular matrix. This observation turns out to be representative of a wider phenomenon. We introduce a notion of topological bound states and show that they are linear combinations of functions supported on generators of the fundamental group of the graph (hence the "topological" in the name), including for graphs that have interactions on the edges. Using an Ihara-style theorem, we elucidate the role of such topological bound states in the spectral analysis of quantum graph Hamiltonians using secular matrices. En route we determine the set of the fixed vectors of the bond-scattering matrix.
  This work is dedicated to E.B. Davies on the occasion of his 80th birthday and in honor of his important contributions to the theory of quantum graphs, e.g., \cite{DaExLi,Da13} and of his broad and influential work on spectral theory, e.g., \cite{Da89,Da95}.</description>
