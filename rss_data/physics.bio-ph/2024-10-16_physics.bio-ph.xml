      <title>Intrinsic versus extrinsic cellular decision making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cell routinely responds to one of many competing environmental cues. Does the cell have an intrinsic preference for that cue, or does that cue have the highest extrinsic information content? We introduce a theoretical framework to answer this fundamental question. We derive extrinsic detection limits for four types of directional cues -- external and self-generated chemical gradients, fluid flow, and contact inhibition of locomotion -- and thus predict extrinsic decision boundaries when these cues compete as pairs. Comparing the boundaries to published data from cell migration experiments quantitatively determines the degree to which cell decisions are intrinsic vs. extrinsic, revealing the extent of cells' autonomy and providing interpretation of their response networks.</description>

      <title>Active Screws: Emergent Active Chiral Nematics of Spinning Self-Propelled Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several types of active agents self-propel by spinning around their propulsion axis, thus behaving as active screws. Examples include cytoskeletal filaments in gliding assays, magnetically-driven colloidal helices, and microorganisms like the soil bacterium $\it{M. xanthus}$. Here, we develop a model for spinning self-propelled rods on a substrate, and we coarse-grain it to derive the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. If the rods propel purely along their axis, we obtain equations for a dry active nematic. However, spinning rods can also roll sideways as they move. We find that this transverse motion turns the system into a chiral active nematic. Thus, we identify a mechanism whereby individual chirality can give rise to collective chiral flows. Finally, we analyze experiments on $\it{M. xanthus}$ colonies to show that they exhibit chiral flows around topological defects, with a chiral activity about an order of magnitude weaker than the achiral one. Our work reveals the collective behavior of active screws, which is relevant to colonies of social bacteria and groups of unicellular parasites.</description>

      <title>Approximations of MINFLUX Localization Precision with Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MINFLUX is an emerging super-resolution technology that measures the position of single fluorophores with nanometer precision using fewer photons than any other fluorescence imaging or tracking technique. Here, we derive simple and instructive analytical equations for MINFLUX localization precision with a special focus on background photons. A fluorescence background, either arising from an imperfect zero of the MINFLUX excitation point spread function (PSF) or from auto- or out-of-focus fluorescence, ultimately limits the resolution achievable with MINFLUX. Building on previous work, we try to improve our understanding of the influence of background, especially when it is unknown, through a new set of expressions for the localization precision, based on an explicit background term instead of signal-to-background ratio. We use these equations to generate an intuitive understanding of how fluorescence background affects MINFLUX measurements and illustrate that:
  - The precision of an emitter position estimate depends on the gradient of its excitation profile.
  - Knowledge of the fluorescence background, obtained during post-processing of MINFLUX traces or through separate measurements, provides a better localization precision than in the case of unknown background.
  - In diffraction-limited systems, localization with a PSF that features a near-zero minimum outperforms localization with a maximum.
  We also present an analytical expression for the localization precision in orbital tracking, which we use for comparison to MINFLUX.</description>

      <title>A fluctuation-sensitivity-timescale trade-off in feedback-controlled dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedback control is a renowned mechanism for attenuating intrinsic fluctuation in regulatory networks. However, its impact on the response sensitivity to external signals and the response timescale, which are also critical for signal transmission, has yet to be understood. In this letter, we study a general feedback-controlled network in which the feedback is achieved by a complex interactive module. By comparing the solution of Langevin equations with and without feedback, we analytically derive a fundamental trade-off between fluctuation, sensitivity, and timescale altered by the feedback. We show that feedback control cannot infinitely suppress fluctuation without the cost of reducing sensitivity or response speed. Furthermore, the lower bound for this trade-off can be reduced up to half in non-gradient dynamical systems compared to gradient systems. We validate this trade-off as a tight bound for high-dimensional systems in nonlinear regime through numerical simulations. These results elucidate the fundamental limitation of feedback control in enhancing the information transmission capacity of regulatory networks.</description>
