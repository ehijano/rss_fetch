      <title>Examining Gender Differences in the Impact of Instructional Clarity on Year 9 Students' Mathematics Interest in New Zealand: A Multi-Group Comparison of 2019 TIMSS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grounded in Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT), this study explores how teacher instruction clarity impacts Year 9 students' mathematics interest through the mediating roles of confidence and value, with a focus on gender differences. Structural equation modelling applied to the 2019 New Zealand TIMSS dataset (2,594 girls and 2,651 boys) supports the SCCT framework. While confidence and value have similar mediating effects for boys, confidence plays a more pivotal role for girls. Gender differences are primarily observed in the value-mediated pathway, underscoring persistent challenges to achieving educational equity through teachers' instruction in New Zealand.</description>

      <title>Examining the Impact of Tutorial Activity Engagement on Undergraduate Students' Collaborative Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the impact of tutorial engagement on Collaborative Preferences for Learning Mathematics (CPLM) in a tertiary context. A two-way mixed ANOVA analysed these preferences over a semester in a sample of undergraduate students. As expected, collaborative engagement had a significant main effect, with students who collaborated more reporting stronger preferences for working with their peers (higher CPLM). The absence of an interaction effect between the nature of tutorial engagement and time suggests CPLM differences remain stable. This may indicate that familiar modes of tutorial engagement may reinforce existing collaboration preferences.</description>

      <title>Exploring the relation between mathematical values and achievement among girls: A comparative analysis in single-sex vs. coeducational settings using TIMSS 2019 NZ data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grounded in the social cognitive career theory, this study investigates the influence of values on girls' mathematics achievement across socio-economic status (SES) settings, contrasting single-sex and coeducational schools. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) on 2019 TIMSS New Zealand data (N = 2,898) revealed that single-sex education was associated with enhanced girls' mathematical values in high-SES settings. However, its effect on translating these values into improved mathematics performance was relatively limited. Affluent learning resources were the more immediate factor in improving mathematics performance. Moreover, in low-SES environments, the relation between values and mathematics achievement exhibited a complex nonlinear pattern.</description>

      <title>A survey of congruences and quotients of partially ordered sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03765v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quotient of a poset $P$ is a partial order obtained on the equivalence classes of an equivalence relation $\theta$ on $P$; $\theta$ is then called a congruence if it satisfies certain conditions, which vary according to different theories. The literature on congruences and quotients of partially ordered sets contains a large and profilerating array of approaches, but little in the way of systematic exposition and examination of the subject. We seek to rectify this by surveying the different theories in the literature and providing philosophical discussion on requirements for notions of congruences of posets. We advocate a pluralist approach which recognises that different types of congruence arise naturally in different mathematical situations. There are some notions of congruence which are very general, whilst others capture specific structure which often appears in examples. Indeed, we finish by giving several examples where quotients of posets appear naturally in mathematics.</description>
