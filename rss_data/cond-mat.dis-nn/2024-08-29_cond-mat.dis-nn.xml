      <title>Order and disorder in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets, conventional long-range order is suppressed due to the presence of primitive triangular structural units, and the nature of the ensuing ground state remains elusive. One class of candidate states, extensively sought in experiments and vigorously studied theoretically, is the quantum spin liquid (QSL), a magnetically-disordered state in which all spins participate in a quantum-coherent many-body state. Randomly located impurities, present in all materials, may prevent QSL formation and instead lead to the formation of a spin-glass state. In this article, we review available data on the specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and neutron scattering in GF materials. Such data show that a pure GF magnet possesses a characteristic ``hidden energy scale'' significantly exceeded by the other microscopic energy scales in the material. When cooled down to a temperature below the hidden energy scale, a GF material develops significant short-range order that dominates its properties and, in particular, dictates the spin-glass transition temperature for experimentally accessible impurity densities. We review the manifestations of short-range order in the commonly observed thermodynamics quantities in GF materials, possible scenarios for the hidden energy scale, and related open questions.</description>

      <title>Coherent Information Phase Transition in a Noisy Quantum Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent information quantifies the transmittable quantum information through a channel and is directly linked to the channel's quantum capacity. In the context of dynamical purification transitions, scrambling dynamics sustain extensive and positive coherent information at low measurement rates, but noises can suppress it to zero or negative values. Here we introduce quantum-enhanced operations into a noisy monitored quantum circuit. This circuit, viewed as a quantum channel, undergoes a phase transition in coherent information from a recoverable phase with positive values to an irrecoverable phase with negative values. This transition is modulated by the relative frequency of noise and quantum-enhanced operations. The existence of a recoverable phase implies that quantum-enhanced operations can facilitate reliable quantum information transmission in the presence of diverse noises. Remarkably, we propose a resource-efficient protocol to characterize this phase transition, effectively avoiding post-selection by utilizing every run of the quantum simulation. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical insights and practical implementation, making the phase transition feasible to demonstrate on realistic noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Beating the aliasing limit with aperiodic monotile arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding optimal wave sampling methods has far-reaching implications in wave physics, such as seismology, acoustics, and telecommunications. A key challenge is surpassing the Whittaker-Nyquist-Shannon (WNS) aliasing limit, establishing a frequency below which the signal cannot be faithfully reconstructed. However, the WNS limit applies only to periodic sampling, opening the door to bypass aliasing by aperiodic sampling. In this work, we investigate the efficiency of a recently discovered family of aperiodic monotile tilings, the Hat family, in overcoming the aliasing limit when spatially sampling a wavefield. By analyzing their spectral properties, we show that monotile aperiodic seismic (MAS) arrays, based on a subset of the Hat tiling family, are efficient in surpassing the WNS sampling limit. Our investigation leads us to propose MAS arrays as a novel design principle for seismic arrays. We show that MAS arrays can outperform regular and other aperiodic arrays in realistic beamforming scenarios using single and distributed sources, including station-position noise. While current seismic arrays optimize beamforming or imaging applications using spiral or regular arrays, MAS arrays can accommodate both, as they share properties with both periodic and aperiodic arrays. More generally, our work suggests that aperiodic monotiles can be an efficient design principle in various fields requiring wave sampling.</description>

      <title>Predicting topological invariants and unconventional superconducting pairing from density of states and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competition between magnetism and superconductivity can lead to unconventional and topological superconductivity. However, the experimental confirmation of the presence of Majorana edge states and unconventional pairing currently poses a major challenge. Here we consider a two-dimensional lattice model for a superconductor with spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling to randomly distributed magnetic impurities. Depending on parameters of the model, this system may display topologically trivial or nontrivial edge states. We map out the phase diagram by computing the Bott index, a topological invariant defined in real space. We then use machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the Bott index from the local density of states (LDOS) at zero energy, obtaining high-accuracy results. We also train ML models to predict the amplitude of odd-frequency pairing in the anomalous Green's function at zero energy. Once the ML models are trained using the LDOS, which is experimentally accessible via scanning tunneling spectroscopy, our method could be applied to predict the number of Majorana edge states and to estimate the magnitude of odd-frequency pairing in real materials.</description>

      <title>Memory and Rejuvenation in Glassy Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The memory effect in a single crystal spin glass ($\mathrm{Cu}_{0.92}\mathrm{Mn}_{0.08}$) has been measured using \freq ac susceptibility techniques over a temperature range of $0.4 - 0.7 \, T_g$ and a model of the memory effect has been developed. A double-waiting-time protocol is carried out where the spin glass is first allowed to age at a temperature below $T_g$, followed by a second aging at a lower temperature, \Tw{2}, after it has fully rejuvenated. The model is based on calculating typical coincident growth of correlated regions at the two temperatures. It accounts for the absolute magnitude of the memory effect as a function of both waiting times and temperatures. The data can be explained by the memory loss being a function of the relative change in the correlated volume at the first waiting temperature because of the growth in the correlations at the second waiting temperature.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of probabilistic context-sensitive grammars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07113</link>

Abstract: Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs), which are commonly used to generate trees randomly, have been well analyzed theoretically, leading to applications in various domains. Despite their utility, the distributions that the grammar can express are limited to those in which the distribution of a subtree depends only on its root and not on its context. This limitation presents a challenge for modeling various real-world phenomena, such as natural languages. To overcome this limitation, a probabilistic context-sensitive grammar (PCSG) is introduced, where the distribution of a subtree depends on its context. Numerical analysis of a PCSG reveals that the distribution of a symbol does not constitute a qualitative difference from that in the context-free case, but mutual information does. Furthermore, a novel metric introduced to directly quantify the breaking of this limitation detects a distinct difference between PCFGs and PCSGs. This metric, applicable to an arbitrary distribution of a tree, allows for further investigation and characterization of various tree structures that PCFGs cannot express.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Transition due to Feedback-induced Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The traditional dynamical phase transition refers to the appearance of singularities in an observable with respect to a control parameter for a late-time state or singularities in the rate function of the Loschmidt echo with respect to time. Here, we study the many-body dynamics in a continuously monitored free fermion system with conditional feedback under open boundary conditions. We surprisingly find a novel dynamical transition from a logarithmic scaling of the entanglement entropy to an area-law scaling as time evolves. The transition, which is noticeably different from the conventional dynamical phase transition, arises from the competition between the bulk dynamics and boundary skin effects. In addition, we find that while quasidisorder or disorder cannot drive a transition for the steady state, a transition occurs for the maximum entanglement entropy during the time evolution, which agrees well with the entanglement transition for the steady state of the dynamics under periodic boundary conditions.</description>
