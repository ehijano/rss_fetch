      <title>Additive Enrichment from Coderelictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential linear categories provide the categorical semantics of the multiplicative and exponential fragments of Differential Linear Logic. Briefly, a differential linear category is a symmetric monoidal category that is enriched over commutative monoids (called additive enrichment) and has a monoidal coalgebra modality that is equipped with a codereliction. The codereliction is what captures the ability of differentiating non-linear proofs via linearization in Differential Linear Logic. The additive enrichment plays an important role since it allows one to express the famous Leibniz rule. However, the axioms of a codereliction can be expressed without any sums or zeros. Therefore, it is natural to ask if one can consider a possible non-additive enriched version of differential linear categories. In this paper, we show that even if a codereliction can be technically defined in an non-additive setting, it nevertheless induces an additive enrichment via bialgebra convolution. Thus we obtain a novel characterization of a differential linear category as a symmetric monoidal category with a monoidal bialgebra modality equipped with a codereliction. Moreover, we also show that coderelictions are, in fact, unique. We also introduce monoidal Hopf coalgebra modalities and discuss how antipodes relate to enrichment over Abelian groups.</description>

Abstract: Groupoid cardinality is an invariant of locally finite groupoids which has many of the properties of the cardinality of finite sets, but which takes values in all non-negative real numbers, and accounts for the morphisms of a groupoid. Several results on groupoid cardinality are proved, analogous to the relationship between cardinality of finite sets and i.e. injective or surjective functions. We also generalize to a broad class of (2,1)-categories a famous theorem of Lov\'asz which characterizes the isomorphism type of relational structures by counting the number of homomorphisms into them.</description>

      <title>Roos axiom holds for quasi-coherent sheaves</title>

Abstract: Let $X$ be either a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme, or a Noetherian scheme of finite Krull dimension. We show that the Grothendieck abelian category $X{-}\mathsf{Qcoh}$ of quasi-coherent sheaves on $X$ satisfies the Roos axiom $\mathrm{AB}4^*$-$n$: the derived functors of infinite direct product have finite homological dimension in $X{-}\mathsf{Qcoh}$. In each of the two settings, two proofs of the main result are given: a more elementary one, based on the Cech coresolution, and a more conceptual one, demonstrating existence of a generator of finite projective dimension in $X{-}\mathsf{Qcoh}$ in the semi-separated case and using the co-contra correspondence (with contraherent cosheaves) in the Noetherian case. The hereditary complete cotorsion pair (very flat quasi-coherent sheaves, contraadjusted quasi-coherent sheaves) in the abelian category $X{-}\mathsf{Qcoh}$ for a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme $X$ is discussed.</description>

      <title>Functorial, operadic and modular operadic combinatorics of circuit algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20260</link>

Abstract: Circuit algebras are a symmetric analogue of Jones's planar algebras introduced to study finite-type invariants of virtual knotted objects. Circuit algebra structures appear, in different forms, across mathematics. This paper provides a dictionary for translating between their diverse incarnations and describing their wider context. A formal definition of a broad class of circuit algebras is established and three equivalent descriptions of circuit algebras are provided: in terms of operads of wiring diagrams, modular operads and categories of Brauer diagrams. As an application, circuit algebra characterisations of algebras over the orthogonal and symplectic groups are given.</description>
