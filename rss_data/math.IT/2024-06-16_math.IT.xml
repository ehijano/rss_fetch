      <title>Self-Sustainable Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for Anti-Jamming in Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless devices can be easily attacked by jammers during transmission, which is a potential security threat for wireless communications. Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) attracts considerable attention and is expected to be employed in anti-jamming systems for secure transmission to significantly enhance the anti-jamming performance. However, active RIS introduces external power load, which increases the complexity of hardware and restricts the flexible deployment of active RIS. To overcome these drawbacks, we design a innovative self-sustainable structure in this paper, where the active RIS is energized by harvesting energy from base station (BS) signals through the time dividing based simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (TD-SWIPT) scheme. Based on the above structure, we develop the BS harvesting scheme based on joint transmit and reflecting beamforming with the aim of maximizing the achievable rate of active RIS-assisted system, where the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) tackles the nonconvex optimization problem in the scheme. Simulation results verified the effectiveness of our developed BS harvesting scheme, which can attain higher anti-jamming performance than other schemes when given the same maximum transmit power.</description>

      <title>An I2I Inpainting Approach for Efficient Channel Knowledge Map Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) has received widespread attention as an emerging enabling technology for environment-aware wireless communications. It involves the construction of databases containing location-specific channel knowledge, which are then leveraged to facilitate channel state information (CSI) acquisition and transceiver design. In this context, a fundamental challenge lies in efficiently constructing the CKM based on a given wireless propagation environment. Most existing methods are based on stochastic modeling and sequence prediction, which do not fully exploit the inherent physical characteristics of the propagation environment, resulting in low accuracy and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a Laplacian pyramid (LP)-based CKM construction scheme to predict the channel knowledge at arbitrary locations in a targeted area. Specifically, we first view the channel knowledge as a 2-D image and transform the CKM construction problem into an image-to-image (I2I) inpainting task, which predicts the channel knowledge at a specific location by recovering the corresponding pixel value in the image matrix. Then, inspired by the reversible and closed-form structure of the LP, we show its natural suitability for our task in designing a fast I2I mapping network. For different frequency components of LP decomposition, we design tailored networks accordingly. Besides, to encode the global structural information of the propagation environment, we introduce self-attention and cross-covariance attention mechanisms in different layers, respectively. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the benchmark, achieving higher reconstruction accuracy while with lower computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed approach has a strong generalization ability and can be implemented in different wireless communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multiple Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces Collaborative Wireless Localization System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) collaborative localization system where multiple semi-passive IRSs are deployed in the network to locate one or more targets based on time-of-arrival. It is assumed that each semi-passive IRS is equipped with reflective elements and sensors, which are used to establish the line-of-sight links from the base station (BS) to multiple targets and process echo signals, respectively. Based on the above model, we derive the Fisher information matrix of the echo signal with respect to the time delay. By employing the chain rule and exploiting the geometric relationship between time delay and position, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target's Cartesian coordinate position is derived. Then, we propose a two-stage algorithmic framework to minimize CRB in single- and multi-target localization systems by joint optimizing active beamforming at BS, passive beamforming at multiple IRSs and IRS selection. For the single-target case, we derive the optimal closed-form solution for multiple IRSs coefficients design and propose a lowcomplexity algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers to obtain the optimal solution for active beaming design. For the multi-target case, alternating optimization is used to transform the original problem into two subproblems where semi-definite relaxation and successive convex approximation are applied to tackle the quadraticity and indefiniteness in the CRB expression, respectively. Finally, numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for multiple IRSs collaborative localization system compared to other benchmark schemes as well as the significant performance gains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey articles focuses on emerging connections between the fields of machine learning and data compression. While fundamental limits of classical (lossy) data compression are established using rate-distortion theory, the connections to machine learning have resulted in new theoretical analysis and application areas. We survey recent works on task-based and goal-oriented compression, the rate-distortion-perception theory and compression for estimation and inference. Deep learning based approaches also provide natural data-driven algorithmic approaches to compression. We survey recent works on applying deep learning techniques to task-based or goal-oriented compression, as well as image and video compression. We also discuss the potential use of large language models for text compression. We finally provide some directions for future research in this promising field.</description>

      <title>Compressed Sensor Caching and Collaborative Sparse Data Recovery with Anchor Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the compressed sensor caching problem in wireless sensor networks and devises efficient distributed sparse data recovery algorithms to enable collaboration among multiple caches. In this problem, each cache is only allowed to access measurements from a small subset of sensors within its vicinity to reduce both cache size and data acquisition overhead. To enable reliable data recovery with limited access to measurements, we propose a distributed sparse data recovery method, called the collaborative sparse recovery by anchor alignment (CoSR-AA) algorithm, where collaboration among caches is enabled by aligning their locally recovered data at a few anchor nodes. The proposed algorithm is based on the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm but with message exchange that is reduced by considering the proposed anchor alignment strategy. Then, by the deep unfolding of the ADMM iterations, we further propose the Deep CoSR-AA algorithm that can be used to significantly reduce the number of iterations. We obtain a graph neural network architecture where message exchange is done more efficiently by an embedded autoencoder. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed collaborative recovery algorithms in terms of the improved reconstruction quality and the reduced communication overhead due to anchor alignment.</description>

      <title>Three-Receiver Quantum Broadcast Channels: Classical Communication with Quantum Non-unique Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In network communication, it is common in broadcasting scenarios for there to exist a hierarchy among receivers based on information they decode due, for example, to different physical conditions or premium subscriptions. This hierarchy may result in varied information quality, such as higher-quality video for certain receivers. This is modeled mathematically as a degraded message set, indicating a hierarchy between messages to be decoded by different receivers, where the default quality corresponds to a common message intended for all receivers, a higher quality is represented by a message for a smaller subset of receivers, and so forth. We extend these considerations to quantum communication, exploring three-receiver quantum broadcast channels with two- and three-degraded message sets. Our technical tool involves employing quantum non-unique decoding, a technique we develop by utilizing the simultaneous pinching method. We construct one-shot codes for various scenarios and find achievable rate regions relying on various quantum R\'enyi mutual information error exponents. Our investigation includes a comprehensive study of pinching across tensor product spaces, presenting our findings as the asymptotic counterpart to our one-shot codes. By employing the non-unique decoding, we also establish a simpler proof to Marton's inner bound for two-receiver quantum broadcast channels without the need for more involved techniques. Additionally, we derive no-go results and demonstrate their tightness in special cases.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic quadratic convergence of the Gauss-Newton method for complex phase retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a Gauss-Newton method for solving the complex phase retrieval problem. In contrast to the real-valued setting, the Gauss-Newton matrix for complex-valued signals is rank-deficient and, thus, non-invertible. To address this, we utilize a Gauss-Newton step that moves orthogonally to certain trivial directions. We establish that this modified Gauss-Newton step has a closed-form solution, which corresponds precisely to the minimal-norm solution of the associated least squares problem. Additionally, using the leave-one-out technique, we demonstrate that $m\ge O( n\log^3 n)$ independent complex Gaussian random measurements ensures that the entire trajectory of the Gauss-Newton iterations remains confined within a specific region of incoherence and contraction with high probability. This finding allows us to establish the asymptotic quadratic convergence rate of the Gauss-Newton method without the need of sample splitting.</description>

      <title>On automorphism groups of polar codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past years, Polar codes have arisen as a highly effective class of linear codes, equipped with a decoding algorithm of low computational complexity. This family of codes share a common algebraic formalism with the well-known Reed-Muller codes, which involves monomial evaluations. As useful algebraic codes, more specifically known as decreasing monomial codes, a lot of decoding work has been done on Reed-Muller codes based on their rich code automorphisms. In 2021, a new permutation group decoder, referred to as the automorphism ensemble (AE) decoder, was introduced. This decoder can be applied to Polar codes and has been shown to produce similar decoding effects. However, identifying the right set of code automorphisms that enhance decoding performance for Polar codes remains a challenging task. This paper aims to characterize the full automorphism group of Polar codes. We will prove a reduction theorem that effectively reduces the problem of determining the full automorphism group of arbitrary random Polar codes to that of a specified class of Polar codes. Besides, we give exact classification of the full automorphism groups of families of Polar codes that are constructed using the Reed-Muller codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design a self-decision goal-oriented multiple access scheme, where sensing agents observe a common event and individually decide to communicate the event's attributes as updates to the monitoring agents, to satisfy a certain goal. Decisions are based on the usefulness of updates, generated under uniform, change- and semantics-aware acquisition, as well as statistics and updates of other agents. We obtain optimal activation probabilities and threshold criteria for decision-making under all schemes, maximizing a grade of effectiveness metric. Alongside studying the effect of different parameters on effectiveness, our simulation results show that the self-decision scheme may attain at least 92% of optimal performance.</description>

      <title>Smooth Actual EIRP Control for EMF Compliance with Minimum Traffic Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To mitigate Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) human exposure from base stations, international standards bodies define EMF emission requirements that can be translated into limits on the "actual" Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP), i.e., averaged over a sliding time window. We aim to enable base stations to adhere to these constraints while mitigating any impact on user performance. Specifically, our objectives are to: i) ensure EMF exposure compliance using actual EIRP control when implementing the "actual maximum approach" described in IEC 62232:2022, ii) guarantee a minimum EIRP level, and iii) prevent resource shortages at all times. We first investigate exact and conservative algorithms, with linear and constant complexity, respectively, to compute the maximum allowed EIRP consumption under constraints i) and ii), denoted as EIRP "budget". Subsequently, we design a control method based on Drift-Plus-Penalty theory that preemptively curbs EIRP consumption only when needed to avoid future resource shortages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first propose a simple and unified approach to stability of phaseless operator to both amplitude and intensity measurement, both complex and real cases on arbitrary geometric set, thus characterizing the robust performance of phase retrieval via empirical minimization method. The unified analysis involves the random embedding of concave lifting operator on tangent space. Similarly, we investigate structured matrix recovery problem through the robust injectivity of linear rank one measurement operator on arbitrary matrix set. The core of our analysis lies in bounding the empirical chaos process. We introduce Talagrand's $\gamma_{\alpha}$ functionals to characterize the relationship between the required number of measurements and the geometric constraints. Additionally, adversarial noise is generated to illustrate the recovery bounds are sharp in the above situations.</description>

      <title>SemantIC: Semantic Interference Cancellation Towards 6G Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel anti-interference technique, semantic interference cancellation (SemantIC), for enhancing information quality towards the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. SemantIC only requires the receiver to concatenate the channel decoder with a semantic auto-encoder. This constructs a turbo loop which iteratively and alternately eliminates noise in the signal domain and the semantic domain. From the viewpoint of network information theory, the neural network of the semantic auto-encoder stores side information by training, and provides side information in iterative decoding, as an implementation of the Wyner-Ziv theorem. Simulation results verify the performance improvement by SemantIC without extra channel resource cost.</description>

      <title>Algebra of Nonlocal Boxes and the Collapse of Communication Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication complexity quantifies how difficult it is for two distant computers to evaluate a function f(X,Y), where the strings X and Y are distributed to the first and second computer respectively, under the constraint of exchanging as few bits as possible. Surprisingly, some nonlocal boxes, which are resources shared by the two computers, are so powerful that they allow to collapse communication complexity, in the sense that any Boolean function f can be correctly estimated with the exchange of only one bit of communication. The Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) box is an example of such a collapsing resource, but a comprehensive description of the set of collapsing nonlocal boxes remains elusive.
  In this work, we carry out an algebraic study of the structure of wirings connecting nonlocal boxes, thus defining the notion of the "product of boxes" $P\boxtimes Q$, and we show related associativity and commutativity results. This gives rise to the notion of the "orbit of a box", unveiling surprising geometrical properties about the alignment and parallelism of distilled boxes. The power of this new framework is that it allows us to prove previously-reported numerical observations concerning the best way to wire consecutive boxes, and to numerically and analytically recover recently-identified noisy PR boxes that collapse communication complexity for different types of noise models.</description>
