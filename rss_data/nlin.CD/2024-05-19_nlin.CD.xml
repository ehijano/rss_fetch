      <title>Adversarial Robustness Guarantees for Quantum Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their ever more widespread deployment throughout society, machine learning algorithms remain critically vulnerable to being spoofed by subtle adversarial tampering with their input data. The prospect of near-term quantum computers being capable of running {quantum machine learning} (QML) algorithms has therefore generated intense interest in their adversarial vulnerability. Here we show that quantum properties of QML algorithms can confer fundamental protections against such attacks, in certain scenarios guaranteeing robustness against classically-armed adversaries. We leverage tools from many-body physics to identify the quantum sources of this protection. Our results offer a theoretical underpinning of recent evidence which suggest quantum advantages in the search for adversarial robustness. In particular, we prove that quantum classifiers are: (i) protected against weak perturbations of data drawn from the trained distribution, (ii) protected against local attacks if they are insufficiently scrambling, and (iii) protected against universal adversarial attacks if they are sufficiently quantum chaotic. Our analytic results are supported by numerical evidence demonstrating the applicability of our theorems and the resulting robustness of a quantum classifier in practice. This line of inquiry constitutes a concrete pathway to advantage in QML, orthogonal to the usually sought improvements in model speed or accuracy.</description>

      <title>Boundary Control for Suppressing Chaotic Response to Dynamic Hydrogen Blending in a Gas Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that periodic forcing of nonlinear flows can result in a chaotic response under certain conditions. Such non-periodic and chaotic solutions have been observed in simulations of heterogeneous gas flow in a pipeline with periodic, time-varying boundary conditions. In this paper, we examine a proportional feedback law for boundary control of a parabolic partial differential equation system that represents the flow of two gases through a pipe. We demonstrate that periodic variation of the mass fraction of the lighter gas at the pipe inlet can result in the chaotic propagation of gas pressure waves, and show that appropriate flow control can suppress this response. We examine phase space solutions for the single pipe system subject to boundary control, and use numerical experiments to characterize conditions for the controller gain to suppress chaos.</description>
