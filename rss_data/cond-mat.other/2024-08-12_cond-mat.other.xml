      <title>Eigenvector Localization and Universal Regime Transitions in Multiplex Networks: A Perturbative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the transition between layer-localized and delocalized regimes in a general contact-based social contagion model on multiplex networks. We begin by analyzing the layer-localization to delocalization transition through the inverse participation ratio (IPR). Utilizing perturbation analysis, we derive a new analytical approximation for the transition point and an expression for the IPR in the non-dominant layer within the localized regime. Additionally, we examine the transition from a non-dominant to a dominant regime, providing an analytical expression for the transition point. These transitions are further explored and validated through dynamical simulations.</description>

      <title>Comment on Noise-Induced Subdiffusion in Strongly Localized Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.03786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gopalakrishnan, Islam, and Knap adopted a perturbative approach employing a method to investigate the transport in localized systems coupled to non-Markovian dephasing noise in the deeply localized limit where the single-particle hopping is the smallest energy scale. All their subsequent analytical and numerical calculations are limited to the deeply localized systems. Nevertheless, in the majority of their results, they used this approximation outside this limit which makes their results wrong. We point at these wrong results and propose the changes in the parameter values which can give correct results.</description>

      <title>Disorder Driven Non-Anderson Transition in a Weyl Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For several decades, it was widely believed that a non-interacting disordered electronic system could only undergo an Anderson metal-insulator transition due to Anderson localization. However, numerous recent theoretical works have predicted the existence of a disorder-driven non-Anderson phase transition that differ from Anderson localization. The frustration lies in the fact that this non-Anderson disorder-driven transition has not yet been experimentally demonstrated in any system. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we present a case study of observing the non-Anderson disorder-driven transition by visualizing the electronic structure of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi on surfaces with varying amounts of disorder. Our observations reveal that strong disorder can effectively suppress all surface states in the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi, including the topological surface Fermi arcs. This disappearance of surface Fermi arcs is associated with the vanishing of the bulk topological invariant, indicating a quantum phase transition from a Weyl semimetal to a diffusive metal. By analyzing the changes in the electronic structure of NdAlSi, as the surface degrades, we provide a physical picture of this non-Anderson transition from a Weyl semimetal to a diffuse metal. These observations provide the first direct experimental evidence of the non-Anderson disorder-driven transition, a discovery long anticipated by theoretical physicists. The finding dispels longstanding suspicions among researchers that non-Anderson transitions exist in real quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Secondary and Backscattered Electron Energy Spectra and Yields Analysis: from Theory to Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made significant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and transport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial resolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and electron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample preparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate theoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer simulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a rapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such as electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs, nanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and computational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur when charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single and collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the generation of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the irradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio methods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion systems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in energy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for the accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative approach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and secondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and dielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of irradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological significance.</description>
