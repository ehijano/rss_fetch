      <title>Strong gradient effects on neoclassical electron transport and the bootstrap current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard approaches to neoclassical theory do not extend into regions of strong gradients in tokamaks such as the pedestal and internal transport barriers. Here, we calculate the modifications to neoclassical electron physics inside strong gradient regions of large aspect ratio tokamaks. We show that these modifications are due to the different ion flow and the strong poloidal variation of the potential. We also provide a physical interpretation of the mechanisms that drive poloidal asymmetries and hence a poloidal electric field. We apply our model to two specific example cases of pedestal profiles, calculating the neoclassical electron flux and the bootstrap current. We find that depending on the ion flow, weak gradient neoclassical theory overestimates or underestimates the neoclassical electron transport and the bootstrap current in regions with strong gradients. We show that the determination of the mean parallel flow is more complex than in weak gradient neoclassical theory. For vanishing turbulence, we can determine the radial electric field for a given flow profile in the pedestal.</description>

      <title>Electron Penetration Acceleration in Turbulent Magnetic Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using particle-in-cell simulations to study fast radio burst (FRB) propagation in a tenuous plasma, we identified a novel mechanism that occurs during the growth of turbulent magnetic loops: electron penetration acceleration. The loops have an electromagnetic left-hand chirality distinct from that of well-known quasistatic magnetic islands. The fast electrons penetrate through the loops and thus are accelerated to unexpected relativistic energies due to the symmetry breaking induced by the coupling between the loop field and the non-relativistic electromagnetic wave. The identified features of penetration acceleration and magnetic loops might provide a new perspective for understanding particle injection into relativistic collisionless shock precursors invoked in FRB-swept cosmic backgrounds. Additionally, we show that this FRB-relevant phenomenon could be tested in scaled laboratory experiments using a multi-terawatt laser impinging on gase targets.</description>

      <title>A Runaway Electron Avalanche Surrogate for Partially Ionized Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A physics-constrained deep learning surrogate that predicts the exponential growth rate of runaway electrons (REs) for a plasma containing partially ionized impurities is developed. Specifically, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that learns the adjoint of the relativistic Fokker Planck equation in steady-state is derived, enabling a rapid surrogate of the RE avalanche for a broad range of plasma parameters, motivating a path towards an ML-accelerated integrated description of a tokamak disruption. A steady-state power balance equation together with atomic physics data is embedded directly into the PINN, thus limiting the PINN to train across physically consistent temperatures and charge state distributions. This restricted training domain enables accurate predictions of the PINN while drastically reducing the computational cost of training the model. In addition, a novel closure for the relativistic electron population used when evaluating the secondary source of REs is developed that enables improved accuracy compared to a Rosenbluth-Putvinski source. The avalanche surrogate is verified against Monte Carlo simulations, where it is shown to accurately predict the RE avalanche growth rate across a broad range of plasma parameters encompassing distinct tokamak disruption scenarios.</description>

      <title>Enhanced hot electron generation from liquid jets in moderate intensity laser-plasma interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the generation of MeV temperature electrons using sub-terawatt laser systems with a liquid methanol jet as a target. Remarkably, even at laser intensities of 1016W/cm2, liquid cylindrical (2D) 15 micron methanol jets produce electrons with temperatures of 1 MeV. Hot electron emission characteristics are strikingly similar to those observed in spherical microdroplet (3D) targets. These results validate that modeling such experiments using 2D PIC simulation is not a compromising approximation. This work further simplifies the experimental complexities towards a multi-KHz highly regenerative source of directed multi-MeV electron (and associated x-ray and ion) generation, demanding laser intensities 100x lower than conventional laser plasma sources. Increased source energy and pointing stability are crucial for imaging or radiographic applications from such sources.</description>

      <title>Effect of Spin Polarization on Lattice Vibrations and Electron Wave Interactions in Piezoelectric Semiconductor Quantum Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of spin polarization, induced by the difference in concentration of spin-up and spin-down electrons produced under the influence of a magnetic field, on lattice ion vibrationselectron wave interactions, and the resulting amplification of acoustic waves in spin polarised piezoelectric semiconductor quantum plasma has been studied. The dielectric permittivity of the high-density plasma medium has been evaluated through which the dispersion relation has been set up. The gain coefficient of acoustic waves has been obtained using the modified separate spin evolution quantum hydrodynamic (SSE-QHD) model for piezoelectric semiconductor plasma. The study reveals that quantum effects, including Fermi pressure and quantum Bohm potential, reduce wave frequency while spin polarization increases it. Acoustic gain rises significantly with frequency in the presence of quantum effects. Spin polarization also contributes to a slight increase in acoustic wave amplification.</description>

      <title>Electron Acoustic Solitary Structures in Nanoparticle Doped Semiconductor Quantum Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of electron acoustic waves (EAWs) and their associated solitary structure in semiconductor quantum plasma doped with nanoparticle clusters have been carried out. The system consists of cold and hot electrons, holes, and stationary ions. The theory has been built using the quantum hydrodynamic (QHD) model. The dispersion relation for EAWs has been set up. To explore nonlinear behaviour, the perturbation technique has been applied, leading to the Korteweg de Vries (KdV) equation. The analysis demonstrates that quantum effects stabilize wave propagation at higher frequencies while presence of nanoparticles strongly influence wave dispersion at higher frequencies, resulting in greater dispersion. Nonlinear analysis shows that solitons in quantum plasma attain higher amplitudes and broader structures due to quantum effects and with the inclusion of nanoparticles</description>

      <title>Electron acoustic solitary wave in quantum plasmas with Kappa electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-acoustic solitary waves (EASWs) in quantum plasma comprising stationary ions, cold electrons, hot electrons, and kappa-distributed electrons have been investigated. The generalized Kappa-Fermi distribution has been modified to include electrostatic energy contribution, and the density of Kappa electrons has been obtained using this modified distribution. Utilizing the quantum hydrodynamic (QHD) model, a dispersion relation has been derived for linear EAWs. Employing the standard reductive perturbation technique, a Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation governing the dynamics of EAWs has been derived. The quantum mechanical effects of different parameters like the kappa index, Mach number and equilibrium kappa electron density have been examined on the profiles of EASWs. It is found that the presence of kappa electrons in quantum plasma leads to new results, including steeper dispersion curves, sharper and more localized solitary waves with kappa index and stronger plasma interactions with increased kappa electron density in dense astrophysical environments</description>

      <title>The EMPI Code for Plasma-Induced Effects on Radio Waves I: Non-Magnetized Media and Applications to Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves undergo modifications as they propagate through plasma. We present EMPI (ElectroMagnetic-wave Plasma Interaction), a three-dimensional numerical framework designed to simulate the interaction between radio signals and cold plasma. With input plasma density profiles, intrinsic radio signals, and the time and frequency resolutions of the telescope, the code synthesizes observed signals using first-principles calculations. EMPI is capable of modeling a wide range of plasma distributions, spanning analytically described smooth functions (e.g., Gaussian or exponential profiles), statistical models (e.g., turbulent screens), and discrete macroscopic structures like isolated plasma clumps, which are difficult to model both analytically and statistically. Validation tests demonstrate excellent agreement with established plasma propagation effects, such as dispersion, lensing, scintillation, and scattering. This code provides an efficient method for handling both analytical and statistical scenarios, bridging the gap between these descriptions. Thanks to its comprehensive capabilities, EMPI is particularly useful for studying radio sources with cosmological origin, especially pulse-like signals such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). As these signals travel through diverse and complex plasma environments across the universe, their properties are inevitably altered, resulting in observable changes. In this context, EMPI serves as a valuable tool for studying the propagation effects of these sources, helping to advance the understanding of their essence and the intervening plasma environments.</description>

      <title>H, He-like recombination spectra VI: Quadrupole $l$-changing collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a simple analytic formula that well describes quadrupole $l$-changing collisions of the form $nl \rightarrow nl'$, as confirmed by comparison with numerical quantal Born calculations obtained with the program autostructure (Badnell 2011). Such formulae could easily be included in models of astrophysical plasma emission, such as the hydrogen and helium-like recombination spectra. When compared with the results of previous quantal calculations based upon an analytic solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation by Vrinceanu &amp; Flannery (2001), we find relatively good agreement, with the exception of large $l &gt; n/2$ transitions. We provide a tentative explanation for such discrepancies. However, we also show that the rates for quadrupole $l$-changing collisions are typically two orders of magnitude lower than the dipolar ones. Inclusion of the quadrupolar rates in a hydrogenic collisional-radiative model of nebular plasma shows minimal changes to the level populations, typically within 1% in nebular conditions. Simple and complete theories are now available for $l$-changing collisions suitable for astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>A Kinetic Model of Solar Wind Acceleration Driven by Ambipolar Electric Potential and Velocity-Space Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations revealed that most of the solar wind acceleration occurs very close to the Sun. This acceleration is partly due to the global electric potential originating from the mass disparity between electrons and protons, coupled with the constraints of charge quasi-neutrality and zero-current conditions in the solar wind plasma. However, the exact mechanism that accounts for the remaining acceleration is still not identified. We aim to provide a framework incorporating the electric field-driven component of the acceleration while also introducing an additional acceleration mechanism via velocity-space diffusion of the particles. This will help us determine the extent of extra acceleration, beyond the electric field-driven component, required to fully reproduce the acceleration of the solar wind in theoretical models. We modified an existing kinetic exospheric model to account for the unexplained solar wind acceleration by including velocity-space diffusion. We compared the electric field derived from the sunward deficit of velocity distribution functions observed by PSP between 13.3 and 50 solar radii ($R_s$) with the electric field found self-consistently by the kinetic exospheric model. The effect of velocity-space diffusion is found to reduce the temperature anisotropy and impact the solar wind acceleration while maintaining the electric potential unchanged. It is found that, even without diffusion, the model can reproduce the anticorrelation between the electric potential and the solar wind terminal velocity found by PSP. This suggests that the electric potential might still be of major importance in explaining the solar wind acceleration.</description>
