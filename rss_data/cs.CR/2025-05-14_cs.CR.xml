      <title>Evaluating Explanation Quality in X-IDS Using Feature Alignment Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods have become increasingly important in the context of explainable intrusion detection systems (X-IDSs) for improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of X-IDSs. However, existing evaluation approaches for XAI focus on model-specific properties such as fidelity and simplicity, and neglect whether the explanation content is meaningful or useful within the application domain. In this paper, we introduce new evaluation metrics measuring the quality of explanations from X-IDSs. The metrics aim at quantifying how well explanations are aligned with predefined feature sets that can be identified from domain-specific knowledge bases. Such alignment with these knowledge bases enables explanations to reflect domain knowledge and enables meaningful and actionable insights for security analysts. In our evaluation, we demonstrate the use of the proposed metrics to evaluate the quality of explanations from X-IDSs. The experimental results show that the proposed metrics can offer meaningful differences in explanation quality across X-IDSs and attack types, and assess how well X-IDS explanations reflect known domain knowledge. The findings of the proposed metrics provide actionable insights for security analysts to improve the interpretability of X-IDS in practical settings.</description>

      <title>Browser Security Posture Analysis: A Client-Side Security Assessment Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern web browsers have effectively become the new operating system for business applications, yet their security posture is often under-scrutinized. This paper presents a novel, comprehensive Browser Security Posture Analysis Framework[1], a browser-based client-side security assessment toolkit that runs entirely in JavaScript and WebAssembly within the browser. It performs a battery of over 120 in-browser security tests in situ, providing fine-grained diagnostics of security policies and features that network-level or os-level tools cannot observe. This yields insights into how well a browser enforces critical client-side security invariants. We detail the motivation for such a framework, describe its architecture and implementation, and dive into the technical design of numerous test modules (covering the same-origin policy, cross-origin resource sharing, content security policy, sandboxing, XSS protection, extension interference via WeakRefs, permissions audits, garbage collection behavior, cryptographic APIs, SSL certificate validation, advanced web platform security features like SharedArrayBuffer, Content filtering controls ,and internal network accessibility). We then present an experimental evaluation across different browsers and enterprise scenarios, highlighting gaps in legacy browsers and common misconfigurations. Finally, we discuss the security and privacy implications of our findings, compare with related work in browser security and enterprise endpoint solutions, and outline future enhancements such as real-time posture monitoring and SIEM integration.</description>

      <title>Invariant-Based Cryptography: Toward a General Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a generalized framework for invariant-based cryptography by extending the use of structural identities as core cryptographic mechanisms. Starting from a previously introduced scheme where a secret is encoded via a four-point algebraic invariant over masked functional values, we broaden the approach to include multiple classes of invariant constructions. In particular, we present new symmetric schemes based on shifted polynomial roots and functional equations constrained by symmetric algebraic conditions, such as discriminants and multilinear identities. These examples illustrate how algebraic invariants -- rather than one-way functions -- can enforce structural consistency and unforgeability. We analyze the cryptographic utility of such invariants in terms of recoverability, integrity binding, and resistance to forgery, and show that these constructions achieve security levels comparable to the original oscillatory model. This work establishes a foundation for invariant-based design as a versatile and compact alternative in symmetric cryptographic protocols.</description>

      <title>A Large-Scale Empirical Analysis of Custom GPTs' Vulnerabilities in the OpenAI Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millions of users leverage generative pretrained transformer (GPT)-based language models developed by leading model providers for a wide range of tasks. To support enhanced user interaction and customization, many platforms-such as OpenAI-now enable developers to create and publish tailored model instances, known as custom GPTs, via dedicated repositories or application stores. These custom GPTs empower users to browse and interact with specialized applications designed to meet specific needs. However, as custom GPTs see growing adoption, concerns regarding their security vulnerabilities have intensified. Existing research on these vulnerabilities remains largely theoretical, often lacking empirical, large-scale, and statistically rigorous assessments of associated risks.
  In this study, we analyze 14,904 custom GPTs to assess their susceptibility to seven exploitable threats, such as roleplay-based attacks, system prompt leakage, phishing content generation, and malicious code synthesis, across various categories and popularity tiers within the OpenAI marketplace. We introduce a multi-metric ranking system to examine the relationship between a custom GPT's popularity and its associated security risks.
  Our findings reveal that over 95% of custom GPTs lack adequate security protections. The most prevalent vulnerabilities include roleplay-based vulnerabilities (96.51%), system prompt leakage (92.20%), and phishing (91.22%). Furthermore, we demonstrate that OpenAI's foundational models exhibit inherent security weaknesses, which are often inherited or amplified in custom GPTs. These results highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures and stricter content moderation to ensure the safe deployment of GPT-based applications.</description>

      <title>GDNTT: an Area-Efficient Parallel NTT Accelerator Using Glitch-Driven Near-Memory Computing and Reconfigurable 10T SRAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of quantum computing technology, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has emerged as a pivotal direction for next-generation encryption standards. Among these, lattice-based cryptographic schemes rely heavily on the fast Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) over polynomial rings, whose performance directly determines encryption/decryption throughput and energy efficiency. However, existing software-based NTT implementations struggle to meet the real-time performance and low-power requirements of IoT and edge devices. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an area-efficient highly parallel NTT accelerator with glitch-driven near-memory computing (GDNTT). The design integrates a 10T SRAM for data storage, enabling flexible row/column data access and streamlining circuit mapping strategies. Furthermore, a glitch generator is incorporated into the near-memory computing unit, significantly reducing the latency of butterfly operations. Evaluation results show that the proposed NTT accelerator achieves a 1.5~28* improvement in throughput-per-area compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>LM-Scout: Analyzing the Security of Language Model Integration in Android Apps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developers are increasingly integrating Language Models (LMs) into their mobile apps to provide features such as chat-based assistants. To prevent LM misuse, they impose various restrictions, including limits on the number of queries, input length, and allowed topics. However, if the LM integration is insecure, attackers can bypass these restrictions and gain unrestricted access to the LM, potentially harming developers' reputations and leading to significant financial losses.
  This paper presents the first systematic study of insecure usage of LMs by Android apps. We first manually analyze a preliminary dataset of apps to investigate LM integration methods, construct a taxonomy that categorizes the LM usage restrictions implemented by the apps, and determine how to bypass them. Alarmingly, we can bypass restrictions in 127 out of 181 apps. Then, we develop LM-Scout, a fully automated tool to detect on a large-scale vulnerable usage of LMs in 2,950 mobile apps. LM-Scout shows that, in many cases (i.e., 120 apps), it is possible to find and exploit such security issues automatically. Finally, we identify the root causes for the identified issues and offer recommendations for secure LM integration.</description>

      <title>ABAC Lab: An Interactive Platform for Attribute-based Access Control Policy Analysis, Tools, and Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) provides expressiveness and flexibility, making it a compelling model for enforcing fine-grained access control policies. To facilitate the transition to ABAC, extensive research has been conducted to develop methodologies, frameworks, and tools that assist policy administrators in adapting the model. Despite these efforts, challenges remain in the availability and benchmarking of ABAC datasets. Specifically, there is a lack of clarity on how datasets can be systematically acquired, no standardized benchmarking practices to evaluate existing methodologies and their effectiveness, and limited access to real-world datasets suitable for policy analysis and testing.
  This paper introduces ABAC Lab, an interactive platform that addresses these challenges by integrating existing ABAC policy datasets with analytical tools for policy evaluation. Additionally, we present two new ABAC datasets derived from real-world case studies. ABAC Lab serves as a valuable resource for both researchers studying ABAC policies and policy administrators seeking to adopt ABAC within their organizations. By offering an environment for dataset exploration and policy analysis, ABAC Lab facilitates research, aids policy administrators in transitioning to ABAC, and promotes a more structured approach to ABAC policy evaluation and development.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Analytics for Smart Meter (AMI) Data: A Hybrid Approach to Comply with CPUC Privacy Regulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) data from smart electric and gas meters enables valuable insights for utilities and consumers, but also raises significant privacy concerns. In California, regulatory decisions (CPUC D.11-07-056 and D.11-08-045) mandate strict privacy protections for customer energy usage data, guided by the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs). We comprehensively explore solutions drawn from data anonymization, privacy-preserving machine learning (differential privacy and federated learning), synthetic data generation, and cryptographic techniques (secure multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption). This allows advanced analytics, including machine learning models, statistical and econometric analysis on energy consumption data, to be performed without compromising individual privacy.
  We evaluate each technique's theoretical foundations, effectiveness, and trade-offs in the context of utility data analytics, and we propose an integrated architecture that combines these methods to meet real-world needs. The proposed hybrid architecture is designed to ensure compliance with California's privacy rules and FIPPs while enabling useful analytics, from forecasting and personalized insights to academic research and econometrics, while strictly protecting individual privacy. Mathematical definitions and derivations are provided where appropriate to demonstrate privacy guarantees and utility implications rigorously. We include comparative evaluations of the techniques, an architecture diagram, and flowcharts to illustrate how they work together in practice. The result is a blueprint for utility data scientists and engineers to implement privacy-by-design in AMI data handling, supporting both data-driven innovation and strict regulatory compliance.</description>

      <title>Where the Devil Hides: Deepfake Detectors Can No Longer Be Trusted</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advancement of AI generative techniques, Deepfake faces have become incredibly realistic and nearly indistinguishable to the human eye. To counter this, Deepfake detectors have been developed as reliable tools for assessing face authenticity. These detectors are typically developed on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and trained using third-party datasets. However, this protocol raises a new security risk that can seriously undermine the trustfulness of Deepfake detectors: Once the third-party data providers insert poisoned (corrupted) data maliciously, Deepfake detectors trained on these datasets will be injected ``backdoors'' that cause abnormal behavior when presented with samples containing specific triggers. This is a practical concern, as third-party providers may distribute or sell these triggers to malicious users, allowing them to manipulate detector performance and escape accountability.
  This paper investigates this risk in depth and describes a solution to stealthily infect Deepfake detectors. Specifically, we develop a trigger generator, that can synthesize passcode-controlled, semantic-suppression, adaptive, and invisible trigger patterns, ensuring both the stealthiness and effectiveness of these triggers. Then we discuss two poisoning scenarios, dirty-label poisoning and clean-label poisoning, to accomplish the injection of backdoors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and practicality of our method compared to several baselines.</description>

      <title>On the Account Security Risks Posed by Password Strength Meters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Password strength meters (PSMs) have been widely used by websites to gauge password strength, encouraging users to create stronger passwords. Popular data-driven PSMs, e.g., based on Markov, Probabilistic Context-free Grammar (PCFG) and neural networks, alarm strength based on a model learned from real passwords. Despite their proven effectiveness, the secure utility that arises from the leakage of trained passwords remains largely overlooked. To address this gap, we analyze 11 PSMs and find that 5 data-driven meters are vulnerable to membership inference attacks that expose their trained passwords, and seriously, 3 rule-based meters openly disclose their blocked passwords. We specifically design a PSM privacy leakage evaluation approach, and uncover that a series of general data-driven meters are vulnerable to leaking between 10^4 to 10^5 trained passwords, with the PCFG-based models being more vulnerable than other counterparts; furthermore, we aid in deriving insights that the inherent utility-privacy tradeoff is not as severe as previously thought. To further exploit the risks, we develop novel meter-aware attacks when a clever attacker can filter the used passwords during compromising accounts on websites using the meter, and experimentally show that attackers targeting websites that deployed the popular Zxcvbn meter can compromise an additional 5.84% user accounts within 10 attempts, demonstrating the urgent need for privacy-preserving PSMs that protect the confidentiality of the meter's used passwords. Finally, we sketch some counter-measures to mitigate these threats.</description>

      <title>ROSA: Finding Backdoors with Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A code-level backdoor is a hidden access, programmed and concealed within the code of a program. For instance, hard-coded credentials planted in the code of a file server application would enable maliciously logging into all deployed instances of this application. Confirmed software supply chain attacks have led to the injection of backdoors into popular open-source projects, and backdoors have been discovered in various router firmware. Manual code auditing for backdoors is challenging and existing semi-automated approaches can handle only a limited scope of programs and backdoors, while requiring manual reverse-engineering of the audited (binary) program. Graybox fuzzing (automated semi-randomized testing) has grown in popularity due to its success in discovering vulnerabilities and hence stands as a strong candidate for improved backdoor detection. However, current fuzzing knowledge does not offer any means to detect the triggering of a backdoor at runtime. In this work we introduce ROSA, a novel approach (and tool) which combines a state-of-the-art fuzzer (AFL++) with a new metamorphic test oracle, capable of detecting runtime backdoor triggers. To facilitate the evaluation of ROSA, we have created ROSARUM, the first openly available benchmark for assessing the detection of various backdoors in diverse programs. Experimental evaluation shows that ROSA has a level of robustness, speed and automation similar to classical fuzzing. It finds all 17 authentic or synthetic backdooors from ROSARUM in 1h30 on average. Compared to existing detection tools, it can handle a diversity of backdoors and programs and it does not rely on manual reverse-engineering of the fuzzed binary code.</description>

      <title>Information Leakage in Data Linkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of linking databases that contain sensitive information about individuals across organisations is an increasingly common requirement in the health and social science research domains, as well as with governments and businesses. To protect personal data, protocols have been developed to limit the leakage of sensitive information. Furthermore, privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) techniques have been proposed to conduct linkage on encoded data. While PPRL techniques are now being employed in real-world applications, the focus of PPRL research has been on the technical aspects of linking sensitive data (such as encoding methods and cryptanalysis attacks), but not on organisational challenges when employing such techniques in practice. We analyse what sensitive information can possibly leak, either unintentionally or intentionally, in traditional data linkage as well as PPRL protocols, and what a party that participates in such a protocol can learn from the data it obtains legitimately within the protocol. We also show that PPRL protocols can still result in the unintentional leakage of sensitive information. We provide recommendations to help data custodians and other parties involved in a data linkage project to identify and prevent vulnerabilities and make their project more secure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain is a type of decentralized distributed database. Unlike traditional relational database management systems, it does not require management or maintenance by a third party. All data management and update processes are open and transparent, solving the trust issues of centralized database management systems. Blockchain ensures network-wide consistency, consensus, traceability, and immutability. Under the premise of mutual distrust between nodes, blockchain technology integrates various technologies, such as P2P protocols, asymmetric encryption, consensus mechanisms, and chain structures. Data is distributed and stored across multiple nodes, maintained by all nodes, ensuring transaction data integrity, undeniability, and security. This facilitates trusted information sharing and supervision. The basic principles of blockchain form the foundation for all related research. Understanding the working principles is essential for further study of blockchain technology. There are many platforms based on blockchain technology, and they differ from one another. This paper will analyze the architecture of blockchain systems at each layer, focusing on the principles and technologies of blockchain platforms such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger Fabric. The analysis will cover their scalability and security and highlight their similarities, differences, advantages, and disadvantages.</description>

      <title>Securing RAG: A Risk Assessment and Mitigation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the de facto industry standard for user-facing NLP applications, offering the ability to integrate data without re-training or fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). This capability enhances the quality and accuracy of responses but also introduces novel security and privacy challenges, particularly when sensitive data is integrated. With the rapid adoption of RAG, securing data and services has become a critical priority. This paper first reviews the vulnerabilities of RAG pipelines, and outlines the attack surface from data pre-processing and data storage management to integration with LLMs. The identified risks are then paired with corresponding mitigations in a structured overview. In a second step, the paper develops a framework that combines RAG-specific security considerations, with existing general security guidelines, industry standards, and best practices. The proposed framework aims to guide the implementation of robust, compliant, secure, and trustworthy RAG systems.</description>

      <title>AI-Based Crypto Tokens: The Illusion of Decentralized AI?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the emergence of AI-based tokens, which are cryptographic assets designed to power decentralized AI platforms and services. This paper provides a comprehensive review of leading AI-token projects, examining their technical architectures, token utilities, consensus mechanisms, and underlying business models. We explore how these tokens operate across various blockchain ecosystems and assess the extent to which they offer value beyond traditional centralized AI services. Based on this assessment, our analysis identifies several core limitations. From a technical perspective, many platforms depend extensively on off-chain computation, exhibit limited capabilities for on-chain intelligence, and encounter significant scalability challenges. From a business perspective, many models appear to replicate centralized AI service structures, simply adding token-based payment and governance layers without delivering truly novel value. In light of these challenges, we also examine emerging developments that may shape the next phase of decentralized AI systems. These include approaches for on-chain verification of AI outputs, blockchain-enabled federated learning, and more robust incentive frameworks. Collectively, while emerging innovations offer pathways to strengthen decentralized AI ecosystems, significant gaps remain between the promises and the realities of current AI-token implementations. Our findings contribute to a growing body of research at the intersection of AI and blockchain, highlighting the need for critical evaluation and more grounded approaches as the field continues to evolve.</description>

      <title>ai.txt: A Domain-Specific Language for Guiding AI Interactions with the Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ai.txt, a novel domain-specific language (DSL) designed to explicitly regulate interactions between AI models, agents, and web content, addressing critical limitations of the widely adopted robots.txt standard. As AI increasingly engages with online materials for tasks such as training, summarization, and content modification, existing regulatory methods lack the necessary granularity and semantic expressiveness to ensure ethical and legal compliance. ai.txt extends traditional URL-based access controls by enabling precise element-level regulations and incorporating natural language instructions interpretable by AI systems. To facilitate practical deployment, we provide an integrated development environment with code autocompletion and automatic XML generation. Furthermore, we propose two compliance mechanisms: XML-based programmatic enforcement and natural language prompt integration, and demonstrate their effectiveness through preliminary experiments and case studies. Our approach aims to aid the governance of AI-Internet interactions, promoting responsible AI use in digital ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Winning at All Cost: A Small Environment for Eliciting Specification Gaming Behaviors in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study reveals how frontier Large Language Models LLMs can "game the system" when faced with impossible situations, a critical security and alignment concern. Using a novel textual simulation approach, we presented three leading LLMs (o1, o3-mini, and r1) with a tic-tac-toe scenario designed to be unwinnable through legitimate play, then analyzed their tendency to exploit loopholes rather than accept defeat. Our results are alarming for security researchers: the newer, reasoning-focused o3-mini model showed nearly twice the propensity to exploit system vulnerabilities (37.1%) compared to the older o1 model (17.5%). Most striking was the effect of prompting. Simply framing the task as requiring "creative" solutions caused gaming behaviors to skyrocket to 77.3% across all models. We identified four distinct exploitation strategies, from direct manipulation of game state to sophisticated modification of opponent behavior. These findings demonstrate that even without actual execution capabilities, LLMs can identify and propose sophisticated system exploits when incentivized, highlighting urgent challenges for AI alignment as models grow more capable of identifying and leveraging vulnerabilities in their operating environments.</description>

      <title>Fair Play for Individuals, Foul Play for Groups? Auditing Anonymization's Impact on ML Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms are heavily based on the availability of training data, which, depending on the domain, often includes sensitive information about data providers. This raises critical privacy concerns. Anonymization techniques have emerged as a practical solution to address these issues by generalizing features or suppressing data to make it more difficult to accurately identify individuals. Although recent studies have shown that privacy-enhancing technologies can influence ML predictions across different subgroups, thus affecting fair decision-making, the specific effects of anonymization techniques, such as $k$-anonymity, $\ell$-diversity, and $t$-closeness, on ML fairness remain largely unexplored. In this work, we systematically audit the impact of anonymization techniques on ML fairness, evaluating both individual and group fairness. Our quantitative study reveals that anonymization can degrade group fairness metrics by up to four orders of magnitude. Conversely, similarity-based individual fairness metrics tend to improve under stronger anonymization, largely as a result of increased input homogeneity. By analyzing varying levels of anonymization across diverse privacy settings and data distributions, this study provides critical insights into the trade-offs between privacy, fairness, and utility, offering actionable guidelines for responsible AI development.

      <title>Graph-Based Floor Separation Using Node Embeddings and Clustering of WiFi Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor positioning systems (IPSs) are increasingly vital for location-based services in complex multi-storey environments. This study proposes a novel graph-based approach for floor separation using Wi-Fi fingerprint trajectories, addressing the challenge of vertical localization in indoor settings. We construct a graph where nodes represent Wi-Fi fingerprints, and edges are weighted by signal similarity and contextual transitions. Node2Vec is employed to generate low-dimensional embeddings, which are subsequently clustered using K-means to identify distinct floors. Evaluated on the Huawei University Challenge 2021 dataset, our method outperforms traditional community detection algorithms, achieving an accuracy of 68.97%, an F1- score of 61.99%, and an Adjusted Rand Index of 57.19%. By publicly releasing the preprocessed dataset and implementation code, this work contributes to advancing research in indoor positioning. The proposed approach demonstrates robustness to signal noise and architectural complexities, offering a scalable solution for floor-level localization.</description>

      <title>Mirror Mirror on the Wall, Have I Forgotten it All? A New Framework for Evaluating Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning methods take a model trained on a dataset and a forget set, then attempt to produce a model as if it had only been trained on the examples not in the forget set. We empirically show that an adversary is able to distinguish between a mirror model (a control model produced by retraining without the data to forget) and a model produced by an unlearning method across representative unlearning methods from the literature. We build distinguishing algorithms based on evaluation scores in the literature (i.e. membership inference scores) and Kullback-Leibler divergence.
  We propose a strong formal definition for machine unlearning called computational unlearning. Computational unlearning is defined as the inability for an adversary to distinguish between a mirror model and a model produced by an unlearning method. If the adversary cannot guess better than random (except with negligible probability), then we say that an unlearning method achieves computational unlearning.
  Our computational unlearning definition provides theoretical structure to prove unlearning feasibility results. For example, our computational unlearning definition immediately implies that there are no deterministic computational unlearning methods for entropic learning algorithms. We also explore the relationship between differential privacy (DP)-based unlearning methods and computational unlearning, showing that DP-based approaches can satisfy computational unlearning at the cost of an extreme utility collapse. These results demonstrate that current methodology in the literature fundamentally falls short of achieving computational unlearning. We conclude by identifying several open questions for future work.</description>

      <title>Removing Watermarks with Partial Regeneration using Semantic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI-generated imagery becomes ubiquitous, invisible watermarks have emerged as a primary line of defense for copyright and provenance. The newest watermarking schemes embed semantic signals - content-aware patterns that are designed to survive common image manipulations - yet their true robustness against adaptive adversaries remains under-explored. We expose a previously unreported vulnerability and introduce SemanticRegen, a three-stage, label-free attack that erases state-of-the-art semantic and invisible watermarks while leaving an image's apparent meaning intact. Our pipeline (i) uses a vision-language model to obtain fine-grained captions, (ii) extracts foreground masks with zero-shot segmentation, and (iii) inpaints only the background via an LLM-guided diffusion model, thereby preserving salient objects and style cues. Evaluated on 1,000 prompts across four watermarking systems - TreeRing, StegaStamp, StableSig, and DWT/DCT - SemanticRegen is the only method to defeat the semantic TreeRing watermark (p = 0.10 &gt; 0.05) and reduces bit-accuracy below 0.75 for the remaining schemes, all while maintaining high perceptual quality (masked SSIM = 0.94 +/- 0.01). We further introduce masked SSIM (mSSIM) to quantify fidelity within foreground regions, showing that our attack achieves up to 12 percent higher mSSIM than prior diffusion-based attackers. These results highlight an urgent gap between current watermark defenses and the capabilities of adaptive, semantics-aware adversaries, underscoring the need for watermarking algorithms that are resilient to content-preserving regenerative attacks.</description>

      <title>Area Comparison of CHERIoT and PMP in Ibex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory safety is a critical concern for modern embedded systems, particularly in security-sensitive applications. This paper explores the area impact of adding memory safety extensions to the Ibex RISC-V core, focusing on physical memory protection (PMP) and Capability Hardware Extension to RISC-V for Internet of Things (CHERIoT). We synthesise the extended Ibex cores using a commercial tool targeting the open FreePDK45 process and provide a detailed area breakdown and discussion of the results.
  The PMP configuration we consider is one with 16 PMP regions. We find that the extensions increase the core size by 24 thousand gate-equivalent (kGE) for PMP and 33 kGE for CHERIoT. The increase is mainly due to the additional state required to store information about protected memory. While this increase amounts to 42% for PMP and 57% for CHERIoT in Ibex's area, its effect on the overall system is minimal. In a complete system-on-chip (SoC), like the secure microcontroller OpenTitan Earl Grey, where the core represents only a fraction of the total area, the estimated system-wide overhead is 0.6% for PMP and 1% for CHERIoT. Given the security benefits these extensions provide, the area trade-off is justified, making Ibex a compelling choice for secure embedded applications.</description>

      <title>MUBox: A Critical Evaluation Framework of Deep Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent legal frameworks have mandated the right to be forgotten, obligating the removal of specific data upon user requests. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution by selectively removing learned information from machine learning models. This paper presents MUBox, a comprehensive platform designed to evaluate unlearning methods in deep learning. MUBox integrates 23 advanced unlearning techniques, tested across six practical scenarios with 11 diverse evaluation metrics. It allows researchers and practitioners to (1) assess and compare the effectiveness of different machine unlearning methods across various scenarios; (2) examine the impact of current evaluation metrics on unlearning performance; and (3) conduct detailed comparative studies on machine unlearning in a unified framework. Leveraging MUBox, we systematically evaluate these unlearning methods in deep learning and uncover several key insights: (a) Even state-of-the-art unlearning methods, including those published in top-tier venues and winners of unlearning competitions, demonstrate inconsistent effectiveness across diverse scenarios. Prior research has predominantly focused on simplified settings, such as random forgetting and class-wise unlearning, highlighting the need for broader evaluations across more difficult unlearning tasks. (b) Assessing unlearning performance remains a non-trivial problem, as no single evaluation metric can comprehensively capture the effectiveness, efficiency, and preservation of model utility. Our findings emphasize the necessity of employing multiple metrics to achieve a balanced and holistic assessment of unlearning methods. (c) In the context of depoisoning, our evaluation reveals significant variability in the effectiveness of existing approaches, which is highly dependent on the specific type of poisoning attacks.</description>

      <title>Kudzu: Fast and Simple High-Throughput BFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Kudzu, a high-throughput atomic broadcast protocol with an integrated fast path. Our contribution is based on the combination of two lines of work. Firstly, our protocol achieves finality in just two rounds of communication if all but $p$ out of $n = 3f + 2p + 1$ participating replicas behave correctly, where $f$ is the number of Byzantine faults that are tolerated. Due to the seamless integration of the fast path, even in the presence of more than $p$ faults, our protocol maintains state-of-the-art characteristics. Secondly, our protocol utilizes the bandwidth of participating replicas in a balanced way, alleviating the bottleneck at the leader, and thus enabling high throughput. This is achieved by disseminating blocks using erasure codes. Despite combining a novel set of advantages, Kudzu is remarkably simple: intricacies such as progress certificates, complex view changes, and speculative execution are avoided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last few years several papers investigated selfish mine attacks, most of which assumed that every miner that is not part of the selfish mine pool will continue to mine honestly. However, in reality, remaining honest is not always incentivized, particularly when another pool is employing selfish mining or other deviant strategies. In this work we explore the scenario in which a large enough pool capitalises on another selfish pool to gain 100\% of the profit and commit double spending attacks. We show that this counterstrategy can effectively counter any deviant strategy, and that even the possibility of it discourages other pools from implementing deviant strategies.</description>

Abstract: Training high-quality deep learning models is a challenging task due to computational and technical requirements. A growing number of individuals, institutions, and companies increasingly rely on pre-trained, third-party models made available in public repositories. These models are often used directly or integrated in product pipelines with no particular precautions, since they are effectively just data in tensor form and considered safe. In this paper, we raise awareness of a new machine learning supply chain threat targeting neural networks. We introduce MaleficNet 2.0, a novel technique to embed self-extracting, self-executing malware in neural networks. MaleficNet 2.0 uses spread-spectrum channel coding combined with error correction techniques to inject malicious payloads in the parameters of deep neural networks. MaleficNet 2.0 injection technique is stealthy, does not degrade the performance of the model, and is robust against removal techniques. We design our approach to work both in traditional and distributed learning settings such as Federated Learning, and demonstrate that it is effective even when a reduced number of bits is used for the model parameters. Finally, we implement a proof-of-concept self-extracting neural network malware using MaleficNet 2.0, demonstrating the practicality of the attack against a widely adopted machine learning framework. Our aim with this work is to raise awareness against these new, dangerous attacks both in the research community and industry, and we hope to encourage further research in mitigation techniques against such threats.</description>

      <title>Vulnerabilities that arise from poor governance in Distributed Ledger Technologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) promise decentralization, transparency, and security, yet the reality often falls short due to fundamental governance flaws. Poorly designed governance frameworks leave these systems vulnerable to coercion, vote-buying, centralization of power, and malicious protocol exploits: threats that undermine the very principles of fairness and equity these technologies seek to uphold. This paper surveys the state of DLT governance, identifies critical vulnerabilities, and highlights the absence of universally accepted best practices for good governance. By bridging insights from cryptography, social choice theory, and e-voting systems, we not only present a comprehensive taxonomy of governance properties essential for safeguarding DLTs but also point to technical solutions that can deliver these properties in practice. This work underscores the urgent need for robust, transparent, and enforceable governance mechanisms. Ensuring good governance is not merely a technical necessity but a societal imperative to protect the public interest, maintain trust, and realize the transformative potential of DLTs for social good.</description>

      <title>PoisonCatcher: Revealing and Identifying LDP Poisoning Attacks in IIoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local Differential Privacy (LDP), a robust privacy-protection model, is widely adopted in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) due to its lightweight, decentralized, and scalable. However, its perturbation-based privacy-protection mechanism hinders distinguishing between any two data, thereby facilitating LDP poisoning attacks. The exposed physical-layer vulnerabilities and resource-constrained prevalent at the IIoT edge not only facilitate such attacks but also render existing LDP poisoning defenses, all of which are deployed at the edge and rely on ample resources, impractical.
  This work proposes a LDP poisoning defense for IIoT in the resource-rich aggregator. We first reveal key poisoning attack modes occurring within the LDP-utilized IIoT data-collection process, detailing how IIoT vulnerabilities enable attacks, and then formulate a general attack model and derive the poisoned data's indistinguishability. This work subsequently analyzes the poisoning impacts on aggregated data based on industrial process correlation, revealing the distortion of statistical query results' temporal similarity and the resulting disruption of inter-attribute correlation, and uncovering the intriguing paradox that adversaries' attempts to stabilize their poisoning actions for stealth are difficult to maintain. Given these findings, we propose PoisonCatcher, a solution for identifying poisoned data, which includes time-series detectors based on temporal similarity, attribute correlation, and pattern stability metrics to detect poisoned attributes, and a latent-bias feature miner for identifying poisons. Experiments on the real-world dataset indicate that PoisonCatcher successfully identifies poisoned data, demonstrating robust identification capabilities with F2 scores above 90.7\% under various attack settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cybersecurity demands rigorous and scalable techniques to ensure system correctness, robustness, and resilience against evolving threats. Automated reasoning, encompassing formal logic, theorem proving, model checking, and symbolic analysis, provides a foundational framework for verifying security properties across diverse domains such as access control, protocol design, vulnerability detection, and adversarial modeling. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of the role of automated reasoning in cybersecurity, analyzing how logical systems, including temporal, deontic, and epistemic logics are employed to formalize and verify security guarantees. We examine SOTA tools and frameworks, explore integrations with AI for neural-symbolic reasoning, and highlight critical research gaps, particularly in scalability, compositionality, and multi-layered security modeling. The paper concludes with a set of well-grounded future research directions, aiming to foster the development of secure systems through formal, automated, and explainable reasoning techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing complexity and scale of the Internet of Things (IoT) have made security a critical concern. This paper presents a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for comprehensive threat detection and prevention in IoT environments. The system integrates lightweight LLMs fine-tuned on IoT-specific datasets (IoT-23, TON_IoT) for real-time anomaly detection and automated, context-aware mitigation strategies optimized for resource-constrained devices. A modular Docker-based deployment enables scalable and reproducible evaluation across diverse network conditions. Experimental results in simulated IoT environments demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy, response latency, and resource efficiency over traditional security methods. The proposed framework highlights the potential of LLM-driven, autonomous security solutions for future IoT ecosystems.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into consumer and enterprise applications. Despite their capabilities, they remain susceptible to adversarial attacks such as prompt injection and jailbreaks that override alignment safeguards. This paper provides a systematic investigation of jailbreak strategies against various state-of-the-art LLMs. We categorize over 1,400 adversarial prompts, analyze their success against GPT-4, Claude 2, Mistral 7B, and Vicuna, and examine their generalizability and construction logic. We further propose layered mitigation strategies and recommend a hybrid red-teaming and sandboxing approach for robust LLM security.</description>

      <title>LiteLMGuard: Seamless and Lightweight On-Device Prompt Filtering for Safeguarding Small Language Models against Quantization-induced Risks and Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has influenced the development of their lighter counterparts-Small Language Models (SLMs)-to enable on-device deployment across smartphones and edge devices. These SLMs offer enhanced privacy, reduced latency, server-free functionality, and improved user experience. However, due to resource constraints of on-device environment, SLMs undergo size optimization through compression techniques like quantization, which can inadvertently introduce fairness, ethical and privacy risks. Critically, quantized SLMs may respond to harmful queries directly, without requiring adversarial manipulation, raising significant safety and trust concerns.
  To address this, we propose LiteLMGuard (LLMG), an on-device prompt guard that provides real-time, prompt-level defense for quantized SLMs. Additionally, our prompt guard is designed to be model-agnostic such that it can be seamlessly integrated with any SLM, operating independently of underlying architectures. Our LLMG formalizes prompt filtering as a deep learning (DL)-based prompt answerability classification task, leveraging semantic understanding to determine whether a query should be answered by any SLM. Using our curated dataset, Answerable-or-Not, we trained and fine-tuned several DL models and selected ELECTRA as the candidate, with 97.75% answerability classification accuracy.
  Our safety effectiveness evaluations demonstrate that LLMG defends against over 87% of harmful prompts, including both direct instruction and jailbreak attack strategies. We further showcase its ability to mitigate the Open Knowledge Attacks, where compromised SLMs provide unsafe responses without adversarial prompting. In terms of prompt filtering effectiveness, LLMG achieves near state-of-the-art filtering accuracy of 94%, with an average latency of 135 ms, incurring negligible overhead for users.</description>

      <title>LLM-Text Watermarking based on Lagrange Interpolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs (Large Language Models) has established them as a foundational technology for many AI and ML-powered human computer interactions. A critical challenge in this context is the attribution of LLM-generated text -- either to the specific language model that produced it or to the individual user who embedded their identity via a so-called multi-bit watermark. This capability is essential for combating misinformation, fake news, misinterpretation, and plagiarism. One of the key techniques for addressing this challenge is digital watermarking.
  This work presents a watermarking scheme for LLM-generated text based on Lagrange interpolation, enabling the recovery of a multi-bit author identity even when the text has been heavily redacted by an adversary. The core idea is to embed a continuous sequence of points $(x, f(x))$ that lie on a single straight line. The $x$-coordinates are computed pseudorandomly using a cryptographic hash function $H$ applied to the concatenation of the previous token's identity and a secret key $s_k$. Crucially, the $x$-coordinates do not need to be embedded into the text -- only the corresponding $f(x)$ values are embedded. During extraction, the algorithm recovers the original points along with many spurious ones, forming an instance of the Maximum Collinear Points (MCP) problem, which can be solved efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is highly effective, allowing the recovery of the author identity even when as few as three genuine points remain after adversarial manipulation.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Accuracy and Effectiveness of PII Removal Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of commercial personally identifiable information (PII) removal systems -- commercial services that claim to improve privacy by automating the removal of PII from data broker's databases. Popular examples of such services include DeleteMe, Mozilla Monitor, Incogni, among many others. The claims these services make may be very appealing to privacy-conscious Web users, but how effective these services actually are at improving privacy has not been investigated. This work aims to improve our understanding of commercial PII removal services in multiple ways. First, we conduct a user study where participants purchase subscriptions from four popular PII removal services, and report (i) what PII the service find, (ii) from which data brokers, (iii) whether the service is able to have the information removed, and (iv) whether the identified information actually is PII describing the participant. And second, by comparing the claims and promises the services makes (e.g. which and how many data brokers each service claims to cover). We find that these services have significant accuracy and coverage issues that limit the usefulness of these services as a privacy-enhancing technology. For example, we find that the measured services are unable to remove the majority of the identified PII records from data broker's (48.2% of the successfully removed found records) and that most records identified by these services are not PII about the user (study participants found that only 41.1% of records identified by these services were PII about themselves).</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Uncertainty and Calibration on Likelihood-Ratio Membership Inference Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10686v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a membership inference attack (MIA), an attacker exploits the overconfidence exhibited by typical machine learning models to determine whether a specific data point was used to train a target model. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the likelihood ratio attack (LiRA) within an information-theoretical framework that allows the investigation of the impact of the aleatoric uncertainty in the true data generation process, of the epistemic uncertainty caused by a limited training data set, and of the calibration level of the target model. We compare three different settings, in which the attacker receives decreasingly informative feedback from the target model: confidence vector (CV) disclosure, in which the output probability vector is released; true label confidence (TLC) disclosure, in which only the probability assigned to the true label is made available by the model; and decision set (DS) disclosure, in which an adaptive prediction set is produced as in conformal prediction. We derive bounds on the advantage of an MIA adversary with the aim of offering insights into the impact of uncertainty and calibration on the effectiveness of MIAs. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived analytical bounds predict well the effectiveness of MIAs.</description>

Abstract: Continuing our analysis of quantum machine learning applied to our use-case of malware detection, we investigate the potential of quantum convolutional neural networks. More precisely, we propose a new architecture where data is uploaded all along the quantum circuit. This allows us to use more features from the data, hence giving to the algorithm more information, without having to increase the number of qubits that we use for the quantum circuit. This approach is motivated by the fact that we do not always have great amounts of data, and that quantum computers are currently restricted in their number of logical qubits.</description>

      <title>GRID: Protecting Training Graph from Link Stealing Attacks on GNN Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited superior performance in various classification tasks on graph-structured data. However, they encounter the potential vulnerability from the link stealing attacks, which can infer the presence of a link between two nodes via measuring the similarity of its incident nodes' prediction vectors produced by a GNN model. Such attacks pose severe security and privacy threats to the training graph used in GNN models. In this work, we propose a novel solution, called Graph Link Disguise (GRID), to defend against link stealing attacks with the formal guarantee of GNN model utility for retaining prediction accuracy. The key idea of GRID is to add carefully crafted noises to the nodes' prediction vectors for disguising adjacent nodes as n-hop indirect neighboring nodes. We take into account the graph topology and select only a subset of nodes (called core nodes) covering all links for adding noises, which can avert the noises offset and have the further advantages of reducing both the distortion loss and the computation cost. Our crafted noises can ensure 1) the noisy prediction vectors of any two adjacent nodes have their similarity level like that of two non-adjacent nodes and 2) the model prediction is unchanged to ensure zero utility loss. Extensive experiments on five datasets are conducted to show the effectiveness of our proposed GRID solution against different representative link-stealing attacks under transductive settings and inductive settings respectively, as well as two influence-based attacks. Meanwhile, it achieves a much better privacy-utility trade-off than existing methods when extended to GNNs.</description>

      <title>Governance of Ledger-Anchored Decentralized Identifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Decentralized Identifier (DID) empowers an entity to prove control over a unique and self-issued identifier without relying on any identity provider. The public key material for the proof is encoded into an associated DID document (DDO). This is preferable shared via a distributed ledger because it guarantees algorithmically that everyone has access to the latest state of any tamper-proof DDO but only the entities in control of a DID are able to update theirs. Yet, it is possible to grant deputies the authority to update the DDO on behalf of the DID owner. However, the DID specification leaves largely open on how authorizations over a DDO are managed and enforced among multiple deputies. This article investigates what it means to govern a DID and discusses various forms of how a DID can be controlled by potentially more than one entity. It also presents a prototype of a DID-conform identifier management system where a selected set of governance policies are deployed as Smart Contracts. The article highlights the critical role of governance for the trustworthy and flexible deployment of ledger-anchored DIDs across various domains.</description>

Abstract: Ethical concerns surrounding copyright protection and inappropriate content generation pose challenges for the practical implementation of diffusion models. One effective solution involves watermarking the generated images. Existing methods primarily focus on ensuring that watermark embedding does not degrade the model performance. However, they often overlook critical challenges in real-world deployment scenarios, such as the complexity of watermark key management, user-defined generation parameters, and the difficulty of verification by arbitrary third parties. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Shading++, a diffusion model watermarking method tailored for real-world deployment. We propose a double-channel design that leverages pseudorandom error-correcting codes to encode the random seed required for watermark pseudorandomization, achieving performance-lossless watermarking under a fixed watermark key and overcoming key management challenges. Additionally, we model the distortions introduced during generation and inversion as an additive white Gaussian noise channel and employ a novel soft decision decoding strategy during extraction, ensuring strong robustness even when generation parameters vary. To enable third-party verification, we incorporate public key signatures, which provide a certain level of resistance against forgery attacks even when model inversion capabilities are fully disclosed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Gaussian Shading++ not only maintains performance losslessness but also outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness, making it a more practical solution for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>The Sponge is Quantum Indifferentiable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sponge is a cryptographic construction that turns a public permutation into a hash function. When instantiated with the Keccak permutation, the sponge forms the NIST SHA-3 standard. SHA-3 is a core component of most post-quantum public-key cryptography schemes slated for worldwide adoption.
  While one can consider many security properties for the sponge, the ultimate one is indifferentiability from a random oracle, or simply indifferentiability. The sponge was proved indifferentiable against classical adversaries by Bertoni et al. in 2008. Despite significant efforts in the years since, little is known about sponge security against quantum adversaries, even for simple properties like preimage or collision resistance beyond a single round. This is primarily due to the lack of a satisfactory quantum analog of the lazy sampling technique for permutations.
  In this work, we develop a specialized technique that overcomes this barrier in the case of the sponge. We prove that the sponge is in fact indifferentiable from a random oracle against quantum adversaries. Our result establishes that the domain extension technique behind SHA-3 is secure in the post-quantum setting. Our indifferentiability bound for the sponge is a loose $O(\mathsf{poly}(q) 2^{-\mathsf{min}(r, c)/4})$, but we also give bounds on preimage and collision resistance that are tighter.</description>

      <title>Cryptography without Long-Term Quantum Memory and Global Entanglement: Classical Setups for One-Time Programs, Copy Protection, and Stateful Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how oracles which only allow for classical query access can be used to construct a variety of quantum cryptographic primitives which do not require long-term quantum memory or global entanglement. Specifically, if a quantum party can execute a semi-quantum token scheme (Shmueli 2022) with probability of success $1/2 + \delta$, we can build powerful cryptographic primitives with a multiplicative logarithmic overhead for the desired correctness error. Our scheme makes no assumptions about the quantum party's noise model except for a simple independence requirement: noise on two sets of non-entangled hardware must be independent.
  Using semi-quantum tokens and oracles which can only be queried classically, we first show how to construct a "short-lived" semi-quantum one-time program (OTP) which allows a classical sending party to prepare a one-time program on the receiving party's quantum computer. We then show how to use this semi-quantum OTP to construct a semi-quantum "stateful obfuscation" scheme (which we term "RAM obfuscation"). Importantly, the RAM obfuscation scheme does not require long-term quantum memory or global entanglement. Finally, we show how RAM obfuscation can be used to build long-lived one-time programs and copy-protection schemes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Support Vector Regression for Robust Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) is critical in data analysis, particularly within the domain of IT security. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool for AD in large-scale data. In this study, we explore the potential of quantum ML approaches, specifically quantum kernel methods, for the application to robust AD. We build upon previous work on Quantum Support Vector Regression (QSVR) for semisupervised AD by conducting a comprehensive benchmark on IBM quantum hardware using eleven datasets. Our results demonstrate that QSVR achieves strong classification performance and even outperforms the noiseless simulation on two of these datasets. Moreover, we investigate the influence of - in the NISQ-era inevitable - quantum noise on the performance of the QSVR. Our findings reveal that the model exhibits robustness to depolarizing, phase damping, phase flip, and bit flip noise, while amplitude damping and miscalibration noise prove to be more disruptive. Finally, we explore the domain of Quantum Adversarial Machine Learning and demonstrate that QSVR is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that noise does not improve the adversarial robustness of the model.</description>
