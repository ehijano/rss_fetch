      <title>Characterization of heat transfer in 3D CMOS structures using Sideband Scanning Thermal Wave Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient thermal management is critical for cryogenic CMOS circuits, where local heating can compromise device performance and qubit coherence. Understanding heat flow at the nanoscale in these multilayer architectures requires localized, high-resolution thermal probing techniques capable of accessing buried structures.
  Here, we introduce a sideband thermal wave detection scheme for Scanning Thermal Microscopy, S-STWM, to probe deeply buried heater structures within CMOS dies. By extracting the phase of propagating thermal waves, this method provides spatially resolved insight into heat dissipation pathways through complex multilayer structures. Our approach enables quantitative evaluation of thermal management strategies, informs the design of cryo-CMOS circuits, and establishes a foundation for in situ thermal characterization under cryogenic operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Schr\"odinger CFTs: Factorization, Massless Particles, and a Path to the Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit Schr\"odinger CFTs from a modern point of view. We introduce the ''harmonic trap geometry,'' analogous to the cylinder picture in relativistic CFTs, and demonstrate a state-operator correspondence that applies to all operators, including descendant, massless, and ''normal-ordered operators.'' A thermofield double construction plays an extremely important role. We systematically classify all physical spectra in the harmonic trap and their unitarity bounds, extending earlier results to include both massless and massive states of all spins, providing a new analytic treatment of unitarity bounds, and establishing foundations for a bootstrap. In our reformulation, previously known perturbative non-renormalization theorems follow immediately from non-perturbative factorization at fixed points and along RG flows. Massless states are described by an effective 1d CFT, as predicted by DLCQ, and violate the non-renormalization theorems. We include a self-consistent review of Schr\"odinger CFTs in our framework, making the paper accessible to anyone with a field theory background.</description>

      <title>Zitterbewegung Effect and Quantum Geometry in Non-Hermitian Exciton-Polariton Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analytically derive a semi-classical equation of motion describing the zitterbewegung effects arising in the dynamics of wavepackets in non-Hermitian systems. In Hermitian non-relativistic quantum systems, the zitterbewegung effects can arise due to the spin precession and spin-orbit coupling. Interestingly, the spin dynamics in non-Hermitian systems are qualitatively different because of the effective nonlinear terms induced by the non-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian. In this work, we show the effects from the non-Hermitian spin dynamics by generalising the description of zitterbewegung effects to non-Hermitian systems. We also uncover novel non-Hermitian correction to the group velocity, which can be expressed in terms of the non-Hermitian quantum metric tensor in the absence of out-of-plane effective field.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Interaction Between Thin Conducting Cylinders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ground state and excited state resonance dipole-dipole interaction energy between two elongated conducting molecules are explored. We review the current status for ground state interactions. This interaction is found to be of a much longer range than in the case when the molecules are pointlike and nonconducting. These are well known results found earlier by Davies, Ninham, and Richmond, and later, using a different formalism, by Rubio and co-workers. We show how the theory can be extended to excited state interactions. A characteristic property following from our calculation is that the interaction energy dependence with separation ($R$) goes like $f(R)/R^2$ both for resonance and for the van der Waals case in the long range limit. In some limits $f(R)$ has a logarithmic dependency and in others it takes constant values. We predict an unusual slow decay rate for the energy transfer between conducting molecules.</description>

      <title>Toward a Theory of Phase Transitions in Quantum Control Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control landscape phase transitions (CLPTs) occur as abrupt changes in the cost function landscape upon varying a control parameter, and can be revealed by non-analytic points in statistical order parameters. A prime example are quantum speed limits (QSL) which mark the onset of controllability as the protocol duration is increased. Here we lay the foundations of an analytical theory for CLPTs by developing Dyson, Magnus, and cumulant expansions for the cost function that capture the behavior of CLPTs with a controlled precision. Using linear and quadratic stability analysis, we reveal that CLPTs can be associated with different types of instabilities of the optimal protocol. This allows us to explicitly relate CLPTs to critical structural rearrangements in the extrema of the control landscape: utilizing path integral methods from statistical field theory, we trace back the critical scaling of the order parameter at the QSL to the topological and geometric properties of the set of optimal protocols, such as the number of connected components and its dimensionality. We verify our predictions by introducing a numerical sampling algorithm designed to explore this optimal set via a homotopic stochastic update rule. We apply this new toolbox explicitly to analyze CLPTs in the single- and two-qubit control problems whose landscapes are analytically tractable, and compare the landscapes for bang-bang and continuous protocols. Our work provides the first steps towards a systematic theory of CLPTs and paves the way for utilizing statistical field theory techniques for generic complex control landscapes.</description>

      <title>Bound excited states of Fr\"ohlich polarons in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional Fr\"ohlich model describing the motion of a single electron interacting with optical phonons is a paradigmatic model of quantum many-body physics. We predict the existence of an arbitrarily large number of bound excited states in the strong coupling limit and calculate their excitation energies. Numerical simulations of a discretized model demonstrate the complete amelioration of the projector Monte Carlo sign problem by walker annihilation in an infinite Hilbert space. They reveal the threshold for the occurrence of the first bound excited states at a value of $\alpha \approx 1.73$ for the dimensionless coupling constant. This puts the threshold into the regime of intermediate interaction strength. We find a significant spectral weight and increased phonon number of the bound excited state at threshold.</description>

      <title>Phonon dynamics and chiral modes in the two-dimensional square-octagon lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral phonons, originally identified in two-dimensional hexagonal lattices and later extended to kagome, square, and other lattices, have been extensively studied as manifestations of broken inversion and time-reversal symmetries in vibrational dynamics. In this work, we investigate the vibrational dynamics of the two-dimensional square-octagon lattice using a spring-mass model with central-force interactions. The model incorporates mass contrast and variable coupling strengths among nearest, next-nearest, and third-nearest neighbors. From the dynamical matrix, we obtain the phonon dispersion relations and identify tunable phononic band gaps governed by both mass and spring-constant ratios. The angular dependence of phase and group velocities is analyzed to reveal the pronounced anisotropy inherent to this lattice geometry. We also examine the distinctive features of the square-octagon geometry, including flat-band anomalies in the density of states and anisotropic sound propagation induced by longer-range couplings. In addition, we explore the emergence of chiral phonons by introducing a time reversal symmetry-breaking term in the dynamical matrix, and to elucidate their optical signatures, we construct a minimal model to study infrared circular dichroism arising from chiral phonon modes.</description>
