      <title>Unconventional Materials for Light Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the use of several unconventional materials as detectors for dark matter with mass beneath the MeV scale. These include the transition-metal dichalcogenide TiSe$_2$ hosting a low-energy plasmon in the charge-density-wave phase, Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ containing a low-energy acoustic demon mode, and hole-doped diamond with tunable optical and acoustic plasmon frequencies. We perform first-principles density functional theory computations of their loss functions at non-vanishing momenta and establish their reach into light dark matter parameter space. We show that due to intense low-energy plasmon modes -- of different microscopic origin in each -- the reach of detectors based on these materials could surpass existing proposals by several orders of magnitude for both dark matter scattering and absorption on electrons. The anisotropic response of these materials, which enables directional detection, renders them exceptionally strong detector candidates, motivating the design and fabrication of future devices.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group study of rho condensate at a finite isospin chemical potential in the quark meson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of an isospin chemical potential ($\mu_{I}$) within the quark-meson model, which approximates quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by modeling low energy phenomena such as chiral symmetry breaking and phase structure under varying conditions of temperature and chemical potential. Using the functional renormalization group (FRG) flow equations, we calculate the phase diagram in the chiral limit within the two-flavor quark-meson model in a finite $\mu_{I}$ with $\rho$ vector meson interactions. The $\rho$ vector meson is condensed (in addition to the chiral condensate) when the isospin chemical potential reaches a critical value $\mu_{I} = \mu_{Icrit}$ for various chemical potentials. This occurs when $\mu_{I} &gt; \mu_{Icrit}$. The $\rho$ condensation that results is numerically produced at varying $\rho$ meson couplings. The region dominated by the $\rho$ meson is separated by a second-order phase transition line at low critical $\mu_{I}$ and a first-order transition line at slightly higher values.</description>

      <title>Standard Model Mass Spectrum and Interactions In The Holomorphic Unified Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified, ultraviolet-finite framework for the full Standard Model particle mass spectrum based on the Holomorphic Unified Field Theory augmented by nonlocal entire-function regulators. Starting from a single holomorphic action on the complexified spacetime manifold $M^4_{\mathbb{C}}$, with a Hermitian metric unifying gravity, gauge and matter sectors, we embed exponential regulator insertions to render all loop integrals finite without breaking gauge or diffeomorphism invariance. After spontaneous breaking of the electroweak and grand-unified symmetries, analytic expressions for the charged-lepton, quark and neutrino mass matrices are derived in terms of holomorphic Yukawa textures and regulator form factors. A minimal Froggatt--Nielsen flavon sector fixes all $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients in terms of two continuous inputs. Regulator-suppressed one- and two-loop renormalization group evolution then yields predictions for all fermion masses, CKM and PMNS mixing angles, $W$ and $Z$ boson masses, and the Higgs boson mass and self-couplings. Finally, we show that gauge-coupling unification, three chiral families, hypercharge quantization and the shape of the Higgs potential are genuine predictions of the holomorphic nonlocal framework.</description>

      <title>Leptophilic dark matter in $U(1)_{L_{i}-L_{j}}$ models: a solution to the Fermi-LAT Galactic Center Excess consistent with cosmological and laboratory observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The particle origin of dark matter (DM) remains elusive despite decades of direct, indirect, and collider searches. Several groups have reported a $\gamma$-ray excess toward the Galactic Centre, commonly referred to as the Galactic Centre Excess (GCE). Its spectrum is consistent with annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) of mass $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ GeV and a thermal-relic cross section. Although many concrete WIMP models reproduce the GCE spectrum, most are now excluded by direct detection experiments that are approaching the neutrino floor. We investigate a class of anomaly-free extensions of the Standard Model featuring gauged differences of lepton number, $U(1)_{L_i-L_j}$, and gauged baryon minus lepton number, $U(1)_{B-L}$. We show that these models can reproduce the GCE while remaining compatible with the observed relic abundance. We then impose collider and direct detection constraints, accounting for both tree-level and loop-induced kinetic mixing. The $L_\mu-L_e$ model gives the best fit to the GCE: a DM mass of $m_\chi\sim 40-50$ GeV remains consistent with the muon and electron magnetic moment anomalies, $(g-2)_{\mu,e}$, as well as current collider and direct detection limits, for mediator masses in the range $m_{A'}\sim 70-86$ GeV and a DM-mediator coupling of $(1-5)\times10^{-2}$. By contrast, the $L_e-L_\tau$ and $L_\mu-L_\tau$ models yield poorer fits; satisfying both the relic density and experimental bounds forces the DM mass to lie very close to resonance (i.e., approximately half the mediator mass). Finally, while the $B-L$ model also matches the GCE well, its parameter space is almost entirely ruled out by strong direct detection limits, except for the narrow resonance region where $m_\chi$ should be equal to $m_{A'}/2$ requiring a fine-tuning at the few-percent level.</description>

Abstract: QCD corrections to fermionic Minimal Dark Matter annihilations increase its annihilation cross section (by 2% for a weak doublet, 1.3% for a triplet, 0.5% for a quintuplet) and thereby the the Dark Matter mass required to achieve the observed cosmological relic abundance via thermal freeze-out.</description>

      <title>New high-frequency gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions in the early Universe are a well-motivated source of gravitational waves (GWs). In this Letter, we identify a previously overlooked GW production mechanism: gravitational transition radiation, arising from graviton emission by particles whose mass changes as they pass through expanding bubble walls. Unlike conventional sources such as bubble collisions or sound waves, this mechanism operates at the microscopic scale set by the Lorentz-contracted wall thickness, leading to GW emission at significantly higher frequencies. The resulting spectrum features a distinctive shape with a peak frequency redshifting to $f_{\rm peak}\sim \gamma_w T_0\sim \gamma_w\times 10^{10}\,{\rm Hz}$ where $\gamma_w$ is the Lorentz boost factor of the wall velocity and $T_0$ is the current temperature of the Universe. This mechanism is generic and is expected to operate similarly for domain walls and other relativistic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of the ultra-high-energy neutrino flux by dark matter scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A flux of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos is generally expected to be produced by astrophysical sources at cosmological distances and to reach Earth. In this paper, we investigate the impact of neutrino scattering with dark matter (DM) particles in both the intergalactic medium and the Milky Way on the total flux, energy spectrum, and arrival directions of UHE neutrinos. We emphasize the complementarity of neutrino detectors at different latitudes to probe the anisotropy in the flux at Earth due to the attenuation of the neutrino flux in the Milky Way dark matter halo. We also discuss that, with mild astrophysical assumptions, limits on the DM-$\nu$ scattering cross section can be placed even if the neutrino sources are unknown. Finally, we explore all this phenomenology with the recent UHE neutrino event KM3230213A, and place the corresponding limits in the DM-$\nu$ scattering cross-section.</description>

Abstract: In response to recent experimental findings from the BES III and LHCb collaborations concerning the decay of open charm mesons into three pseudoscalars, we present evidence suggesting that the lightest scalar mesons can be characterized as diquark-antidiquark states mixed with the next-to-light, q\bar q, scalar mesons through six-fermion, instanton-induced interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bootstrap Approach to a Non-Relativistic Potential for Quarkonium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum bootstrap method is applied to determine the bound-state spectrum of Quarkonium systems using a non-relativistic potential approximation. The method translates the Schr\"odinger equation into a set of algebraic recursion relations for radial moments $\langle r^m \rangle$, which are constrained by the positive semidefiniteness of their corresponding Hankel matrices. The numerical implementation is first validated by calculating the $1S$ and $1P$ mass centroids for both charmonium ($c\bar{c}$) and bottomonium ($b\bar{b}$) systems, finding deviations of less than 0.5\% from experimental data from the Particle Data Group (PDG). This analysis is then extended to the hypothetical toponium ($t\bar{t}$) system, predicting a $1S$ ground state mass of $M \approx 344.3 \text{ GeV}$. This theoretical mass is in agreement with the energy of the recently observed resonance-like enhancement in the $t\bar{t}$ cross-section by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. This result provides theoretical support for the interpretation of this experimental phenomenon as the formation of a quasi-bound toponium state and highlights the predictive power of the non-relativistic potential approach for systems of two massive quarks.</description>

      <title>Second-order renormalized Hamiltonian of Yukawa theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the renormalization group procedure for effective particles (RGPEP) we calculate the effective Hamiltonians in the theory of a fermion field coupled to a scalar field via the Yukawa interaction. The theory is renormalized by the addition of counterterms. Necessary counterterms are determined by computing matrix elements of the effective Hamiltonian. All calculations are performed up to the second order in the expansion in powers of the coupling constant. Renormalized effective Hamiltonians are well-defined symmetric operators acting in the Fock space as opposed to the renormalized bare Hamiltonian, which is not well-defined without regularization. We introduce computational techniques that should streamline higher-order calculations and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Probing non-perturbative QCD aspects on particle production in pp collisions with forward-backward correlations using \texttt{PYTHIA8}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ PYTHIA8 simulations to study forward-backward (FB) correlations in pp collisions at LHC energies, probing non-perturbative QCD dynamics via color reconnection (CR) and QCD radiation (ISR/FSR). Using \texttt{PYTHIA8} (v8.311) under ALICE/ATLAS kinematics, we analyze: extensive: FB multiplicity ($b_{\rm corr}^{\rm mult}$) and summed $p_{\rm T}$ ($b_{\rm corr}^{\sum p_{\rm T}}$) correlations; intensive: FB mean $p_{\rm T}$ ($b_{\rm corr}^{\overline p_{\rm T}}$) correlations; and \textit{strongly intensive:} $\Sigma_{\rm N_F N_B}$ quantity in symmetric pseudorapidity intervals, validated against available experimental data. Systematic studies of $b_{\rm corr}^{\rm mult}$ as functions of $\eta_{\rm gap}$, $\eta_{\rm sep}$, and $\eta$-$\varphi$ sectors show MPI-based CR (ranges 3.6, 5.4) and QCD Color Rope significantly improve agreement with data. ISR/FSR critically influence $b_{\rm corr}^{\rm mult}$ and $b_{\rm corr}^{\sum p_{\rm T}}$, with ISR dominant than FSR. Disabling ISR/FSR fails to replicate $\eta_{\rm gap}$-dependent trends. Further, $b_{\rm corr}^{\sum p_{\rm T}}$ shows minimal CR-range sensitivity but the correlation strength increases when CR is disabled. Intensive quantity, $b_{\rm corr}^{\overline p_{\rm T}}$, exhibit the opposite behavior to extensive observables i.e. the magnitude of $b_{\rm corr}^{\overline p_{\rm T}}$ increases with the increase of CR strength, highlighting the distinct influence of CR on intensive versus extensive observables. Its azimuthal dependence indicates that parton showers drive short-range correlations. The analysis of the strongly intensive quantity as a function of pseudorapidity gap indicates that FSR plays a dominant role at larger gaps, in contrast to the behavior observed in FB multiplicity correlations.</description>

      <title>$\gamma, J/\psi$ production through ISR process in electron-positron annihilation at B-factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Initial state radiation (ISR) process, $e^- e^+ \rightarrow^*\gamma\rightarrow \gamma +J/\psi$ observed at high luminosity $e^- e^+$ colliders such as B-factories, with the ISR photon being emitted through the initial electron or positron, prior to their annihilation. The emitted $J/\Psi$ is produced through the photon fragmentation process, with the produced $J/\psi$ in turn decaying into a pair of leptons, $\mu^-+\mu^+$ through the leptonic decay process, $J/\Psi\rightarrow \gamma^*\rightarrow \gamma \mu^- \mu^+$. The cross section for the $J/\Psi$ production, and the branching ratio for the leptonic decay of $J/\Psi\rightarrow \mu^- \mu^+$, both calculated in the framework of Bethe-Salpeter equation are used to work out the cross section for the complete process, $e^- e^+ \rightarrow \gamma +J/\psi\rightarrow \gamma+\mu^- +\mu^+$. Our results are compared with the BaBar data, and other models. This study is then extended to production and decays of $\Upsilon(1S)$ through the ISR process.</description>

      <title>QCD sum rule study of topped mesons within heavy quark effective theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent CMS observation of a near-threshold enhancement in top-quark pair production, we investigate a novel class of hadronic systems containing a single top quark: the topped mesons ($t\bar{q}$, with $\bar q = \bar u, \bar d, \bar s$). In contrast to the extensively studied toponium ($t\bar{t}$) system, analyzed primarily within perturbative QCD, topped mesons offer a complementary nonperturbative probe of QCD dynamics in the heavy-quark limit. These states are expected to exhibit longer lifetimes and narrower decay widths than toponium, as only a single top quark undergoes weak decay. We employ QCD sum rules within the framework of heavy quark effective theory to study the structure and mass spectrum of ground-state topped mesons. Our analysis predicts masses near 173.1 GeV, approximately 0.5-0.6 GeV above the top-quark pole mass. Compared to singly topped baryons ($tqq$, with $q = u, d, s$) studied in [arXiv:2507.05895], topped mesons feature a simpler quark composition and more favorable decay channels, enhancing their potential for both theoretical analysis and experimental discovery.</description>

      <title>Roles of $a_0(980)$ and $a_0(1710)$ in Cabibbo-suppressed process $D^+\to \pi^0\pi^+\eta $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the BESIII amplitude analysis of the single Cabibbo-suppressed process $D^+\to \pi^0\pi^+\eta$, we investigate this reaction by taking into account the contributions from the $a_0(980)$, $\rho$, and $a_0(1710)$, where the scalar meson $a_0(980)$ could be dynamically generated from the $S$-wave pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson interaction within the chiral unitary approach.
  Our theoretical predictions for the $\pi^0\eta$, $\pi^+\eta$, and $\pi^+\pi^0$ invariant mass distributions are in agreement with the BESIII measurements, especially the clear peaks around 1~GeV in the $\pi^0\eta$ and $\pi^+\eta$ invariant mass distributions could be associated with the dynamically generated state $a_0(980)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the intermediate $a_0(1710)$ is also necessary to describe the enhancement structure around $1.6\sim 1.7$~GeV in the $\pi^{0/+}\eta$ invariant mass distribution. More precise experimental measurements of this process could provide deeper insights into the nature of the scalar mesons $a_0(980)$ and $a_0(1710)$.</description>

Abstract: Recent experimental data show an unexpectedly large spin alignment of $\phi$ mesons in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, which can be explained by short-distance fluctuations of strong force fields (vector $\phi$ fields) within the constituent-quark model. We calculate the hyperon spin correlations within the same model, taking into account hydrodynamic effects and a $\phi$ field fluctuating in space-time according to a Gaussian distribution. The $\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ spin correlation induced by the $\phi$ field is shown to be negative as opposed to that of $\Lambda\Lambda$ or $\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$. We thus propose a new net spin correlation as a sensitive probe to separate strong force effects from hydrodynamic ones. With the strength of the field fluctuations extracted from the observed $\phi$ spin alignment, we predict the collision energy dependence of the hyperon spin correlations and also investigate the dependence of net spin correlation on azimuthal-angle and rapidity difference.</description>

      <title>Wiener filtering and multi-tracer techniques for dark matter cross-correlations between gamma-ray emission and galaxy catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-correlations between a gravitational tracer of dark matter and the contribution to the unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) from the radiation produced by the annihilation of the particles responsible for the dark matter, have been established as a powerful tool to investigate the particle physics nature of dark matter. Cross-correlations of the UGRB with galaxy catalogs, cluster catalogs and weak lensing have indeed been measured. In this paper we study statistical techniques that could improve the sensitivity of the cross-correlation techniques on the bounds that can be set to the particle dark matter physical properties. The two methods that we investigate are the application of a Wiener filter and the exploitation of the full multi-tracer information. After identifying the optimal strategies, we show that the adoption of a Wiener filter in the cross-correlation analysis can improve the sensitivity to the dark matter annihilation rate by a factor of 2/2.5 as compared to the standard analysis where no filter is applied. The inclusion of the full multi-tracer information can improve the sensitivity up to a factor of 5 for dark matter masses below about 50 GeV, the Wiener filter remaining the best option for heavier dark matter.</description>

      <title>Love beyond Einstein: Metric reconstruction and Love number in quadratic gravity using WEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tidal Love numbers of static black holes in four-dimensional quadratic theory of gravity, extending the result of GR. We use worldline effective field theory (WEFT) methods to compute metric perturbations from one-point functions, treating the higher-derivative terms perturbatively. We show that insertions of scalar fields on the worldline induce non-zero tidal tails, and the corresponding Love number displays no RG running. The same conclusion holds for the insertions of tensor fields. Furthermore, for scalar dipole perturbations, we derive a Yukawa-deformed Frobenius solution and match the asymptotic behavior to fix the UV charge, finding agreement with EFT predictions of Wilson coefficients. Our work demonstrates that quadratic higher-curvature corrections induce non-zero but scale-independent tidal responses, offering a robust EFT framework to test deviations from GR in gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Bounding anisotropic Lorentz Invariance Violation from measurements of the effective energy scale of quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of energy-dependent photon time delays from distant flaring sources provide significant constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). Such effects originate from modified vacuum dispersion relations, causing differences in propagation times for photons emitted simultaneously from gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, or pulsars. These modifications are often parametrized within a general framework by an effective quantum gravity energy scale $E_{QG,n}$. While such general constraints are well established in the LIV literature, their translation into specific coefficients of alternative theoretical frameworks, such as the Standard-Model Extension (SME), is rarely carried out. In particular, existing bounds on the quadratic case ($n=2$) of $E_{QG,n}$ can be systematically converted into constraints on the non-birefringent, CPT-conserving SME coefficients $c^{(6)}_{(I)jm}$. This work provides a concise overview of the relevant SME formalism and introduces a transparent conversion method from $E_{QG,2}$ to SME parameters. We review the most stringent time-of-flight-based bounds on $E_{QG,n}$ and standardize them by accounting for systematics, applying missing prefactors, and transforming results into two-sided Gaussian uncertainties where needed. We then use these standardized constraints, along with additional bounds from the literature, to improve bounds on the individual SME coefficients of the photon sector by about an order of magnitude. A consistent methodology is developed to perform this conversion from the general LIV framework to the SME formalism.</description>

      <title>Lattice results for the equation of state in dense QCD-like theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent progress in Monte Carlo simulations of dense two-color QCD (QC$_2$D), focusing on the phase diagram, the equation of state, and the sound velocity in the low-temperature regime. In three-color QCD at finite density, especially at low temperatures, the notorious sign problem makes lattice Monte Carlo simulations intractable. In contrast, QC$_2$D is free from this issue due to the pseudoreality of the quark representation. Recent independent lattice studies have revealed unexpected phenomena through first-principles calculations of the phase structure and thermodynamics. A particularly notable finding is that the sound velocity exceeds the so-called conformal (holography) bound, \( c_s^2/c^2 \le 1/3 \), which had not been observed in QCD-like theories at finite temperature. In this review, we focus primarily on results from a series of works by our group~\cite{Iida:2019rah, Iida:2020emi,Iida:2022hyy, Ishiguro:2021yxr, Iida:2024irv}, along with related studies in dense QC$_2$D and three-color QCD with isospin chemical potential. We discuss the possibility and physical implications of conformal bound violation even for three-color dense QCD, together with insights from effective model analyses and recent observations of neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: Lattice QCD calculations have been conducted using large-scale classical computers based on the Lagrangian formalism of field theory for the past 40 years. On the other hand, the advent of quantum computers has brought increasing attention to first-principles computational methods based on the Hamiltonian formalism compatible with these machines. In this talk, we discuss recent results on how to calculate hadronic properties using the Hamiltonian formalism.</description>

      <title>Photon polarization tensor in presence of constant and arbitrary electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the photon polarization tensor at one-loop order in the presence of a constant and uniform electric field. Our calculation is carried out for arbitrary field strength using the Schwinger proper-time formalism, and we explicitly derive an expression for the polarization tensor without approximations. We also present a complementary derivation within the strong field approximation. Our main contribution lies in expressing the polarization tensor in terms of a physically motivated tensor basis that ensures transversality and thus preserves gauge invariance. This basis, constructed from the preferred direction defined by the external electric field, makes explicit the breaking of Lorentz symmetry. We verify the consistency of our results by recovering the well-known vacuum polarization tensor in the zero-field limit and by demonstrating agreement between the strong field limit of the general expression and the result obtained directly in the strong field approximation. Interestingly, in the latter case, only one tensor structure survives, corresponding to the transverse dynamics with respect to the field direction, which highlights the dominance of perpendicular modes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear analysis of causality for heat flow in heavy-ion collisions: constraints from equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the causal parameter space of the Mueller-Israel-Stewart second-order theory for heat-conducting fluids in nonlinear regimes for one-dimensional fluid flow. We show that this parameter space is highly constrained and particularly sensitive to the equation of state and second-order transport coefficients. Through numerical analysis of the characteristic equations, we identify regions of strong hyperbolicity, weak hyperbolicity, and non-hyperbolicity, mapping the boundaries of causality violation as functions of the heat flux to energy density ratio $q/\varepsilon$ and relaxation parameters. We also explore the causality conditions using a realistic lattice QCD-based equation of state. Using the Navier-Stokes approximation, we estimate the heat flow magnitude to assess causality criteria for one-dimensional heat conduction in heavy-ion collisions. Our calculations reveal unrealistically large heat flux values ($|{\bf{q}}|/\varepsilon \sim 330-811$) for typical RHIC conditions when using thermal conductivity estimates from kinetic theory models, suggesting either significant overestimation of transport coefficients or breakdown of the fluid approximation in these extreme conditions. The pressure gradient corrections reduce the heat flow by approximately 15\% but do not resolve the causality concerns.</description>

      <title>Theoretical framework for lattice QCD computations of $B\to K \ell^+ \ell^-$ and $\bar{B}_s\to \ell^+\ell^- \gamma$ decays rates, including contributions from "Charming Penguins"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a strategy for computing the $B\to K\ell^+\ell^-$ and $\bar{B}_s\to\gamma\ell^+\ell^-$ decay amplitudes using lattice QCD (where $\ell^\pm$ are charged leptons). We focus on those terms which contain complex contributions to the amplitude, due to on-shell intermediate states propagating between the weak operator and electromagnetic current(s). Such terms, which are generally estimated using model calculations and represent significant uncertainties in the phenomenological predictions for these decays, cannot be computed using standard lattice QCD techniques. It has recently been shown that such contributions can be computed using spectral-density methods and our proposed strategy, which we discuss in detail, is built on this approach. The complex contributions include the ``charming penguins" (matrix elements of the current-current operators $O_1^{(c)}$ and $O_2^{(c)}$ defined in Eq. (6) below), in which the charm-quark loop can propagate long distances, particularly close to the region of charmonium resonances. They also include the contributions from the chromomagnetic operator ($O_8$ in standard notation, defined in Eq. (8) below). We discuss the renormalization of the ultra-violet divergences, and in particular those which arise due to ``contact" terms, and explain how those which appear as inverse powers of the lattice spacing can be subtracted non-perturbatively. We apply the spectral density methods in an instructive exploratory computation of the charming penguin diagram in $B\to K\ell^+\ell^-$ decays in which the virtual photon is emitted from the charm-quark loop (the diagram in Fig. 1(a) below) and discuss the prospects and strategies for the reliable determination of the amplitudes in future dedicated computations.</description>

      <title>Gauge structure of Yang-Mills theories with extra dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:1801.07843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An effective Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theories with $n$ extra dimensions is constructed. We start from a field theory governed by the extra-dimensional Poincar\'e group $ISO(1,3+n)$ and the extended gauge group $SU(N,M^{4+n})$, characterized by an energy scale $\Lambda$ and assumed to be valid at energies far below this scale. Assuming that the size of the extra dimensions is much larger than the distance scale at which this theory is valid, an effective theory with symmetry groups $ISO(1,3)$ and $SU(N,M^{4})$ is constructed. Such theories are connected by a canonical transformation that hides $ISO(1,3+n)\otimes SU(N,M^{4+n})$ into $ISO(1,3)\otimes SU(N,M^{4})$, and endows the KK gauge fields with mass. Using a set of orthogonal functions $\{f^{(\underline{0})},f^{(\underline{m})}(\bar x)\}$, generated by the Casimir invariant $\bar{P}^2$ associated with the translations subgroup $T(n)\subset ISO(n)$, the degrees of freedom of $ISO(1,3+n)\otimes SU(N,M^{4+n})$ are expanded via a general Fourier series, whose coefficients are the degrees of freedom of $ISO(1,3)\otimes SU(N,M^{4})$. These functions, corresponding to the projection on the coordinates basis $\{|\bar{x} \big &gt;\}$ of the discrete basis $\{|0\big &gt;,|p^{(\underline{m})}\big &gt;\}$ generated by $\bar {P}^2$, are central in defining the effective theory. Components along the base state $f^{(\underline{0})}=\big &lt;\bar x|0\big&gt;$, identified as the standard Yang-Mills fields, do not receive mass at the compactification scale; components along excited states $f^{(\underline{m})}=\big &lt;\bar x|p^{(\underline{m})}\big&gt;$, corresponding to KK excitations, receive mass at this scale. Associated with any direction $|p^{(\underline{m})}\neq0\big &gt;$ there are a massive gauge field and a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Resemblances of this mass-generating mechanism with the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism are stressed.</description>

We calculate loop corrections to the photon-electron vertex and determine analytical formulas for the spin and cyclotron frequencies when the electron is in an external magnetic field. By comparing with current measurements of these observables, we are able to place the strongest constraint on the axion-elecron coupling for axion masses below $3\times10^{-18}\text{eV}$.</description>

Abstract: We construct a realistic supersymmetric model for superheavy metastable cosmic strings (CSs) that can be investigated in the current pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. It is based on shifted $\mu$-hybrid inflation in which the symmetry breaking $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_R\rightarrow SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_{B-L}\times U(1)_R$ proceeds along an inflationary trajectory such that the topologically unstable primordial monopoles are inflated away. {{The breaking of $U(1)_{B-L} \times U(1)_R \rightarrow U(1)_Y$ after inflation ends yields the superheavy metastable CSs carrying the right handed neutrino zero modes that generate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), which we show is consistent with the current PTA data set and the LIGO O3 run}}. The scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are compatible with the Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope measurements. Both reheating and leptogenesis are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>A Dark Matter Fermionic Quantum Fluid from Standard Model Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model of dark matter as a superconducting fluid of Cooper pairs of right handed neutrinos or of vector-like quarks. The superconducting dark matter is induced by attractive channels in the Standard Model Higgs and color sectors of the Standard Model, respectively. We show that, for each case, the solution to the gap equation provides viable dark matter candidates for suitable chemical potential values. The mechanism yields an ultra-light neutrino condensate with a mass of $m_{\rm DM} \sim 10^{-19} \text{eV}$ or a vector-like quark condensate with wide range of possible masses. Both cosmological and particle physics constraints on the model lead to a connection between the number of effective relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$, and the chemical potential and CMB temperature at the time of fermion creation. We also find a relation between the superconducting fermion and baryon densities, with implications for the coincidence between the dark matter and baryon densities in standard cosmology. Given the natural $\text{eV}$ scale of neutrinos, this mechanism may have implications for the Hubble tension.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight dark matter induces time-dependent perturbations in the spacetime metric, enabling its gravitational direct detection. In this work, we propose using astrometry to detect dark matter. After reviewing the calculation of the metric in the presence of scalar dark matter, we study the influence of the perturbations on the apparent motion of astrophysical bodies. We apply our results to angular position measurements of quasars, whose vast distances from Earth present an opportunity to discover dark matter with a mass as low as $10^{-33} \, \mathrm{eV} $. We explore the prospects of very long baseline interferometry and optical astrometric survey measurements for detecting ultralight relics, finding that for the smallest masses, current astrometric surveys can detect dark matter moving locally with a velocity of $10^{-3}$ with energy density as low as $10 ^{ - 4} ~{\rm GeV} / {\rm cm} ^3 $.</description>

Abstract: We explore the phenomenological impact of interference in tree-level contributions to three-body final states in $2\to 3$ scattering processes. This work introduces a novel search strategy leveraging asymmetries to enable sensitivity to CP-violating effects in less well-explored regions of phase space. Analytically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this observable in probing interference between Standard Model charged-current decays and effective left-handed vector interactions, illustrated in a toy model featuring a scalar leptoquark, $S_1 \sim (3, 1, -1/3)$. Numerically, we apply this framework to studying the process $pp\to b \tau\nu$; unlike traditional high-$p_T$ searches or ``bump hunts", this approach utilizes an intermediate energy regime -- where new physics is neither light enough to be produced on shell or heavy enough to justify an effective field theory treatment. A proof-of-principle analysis at parton level demonstrates a percent-level asymmetry, with sensitivity also to BSM weak-CP phase. While the specific phase sensitivity is diminished at particle level due to showering and detector effects, a machine learning classifier can recover sensitively to the presence of SM-BSM interference, significantly outperforming standard analysis methods. Notably discrimination between BSM signal and SM background could be achieved at the 2$\sigma$ level for the current LHC dataset and 8$\sigma$ at the High-Luminosity LHC. Moreover, this asymmetry observable as defined can also be more broadly applied to other searches for CP-violation in $2\to 3$ processes in present and future collider environments.</description>

Abstract: The origin of neutrino masses can be simply attributed to a new scalar beyond the Standard Model. We demonstrate that leptogenesis can explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe already in such a minimal framework, where the electroweak scalar is favored to enhance the baryon asymmetry. Different from traditional leptogenesis, the realization here exploits the thermal behavior of leptons at finite temperatures, which is otherwise kinetically forbidden in vacuum. We present detailed calculations of the CP asymmetry in the Schwinger-Keldysh Closed-Time-Path formalism, and compute the asymmetry evolution via the Kadanoff-Baym equation. Such minimal forbidden neutrinogenesis establishes a direct link between the baryon asymmetry and the CP-violating phase from neutrino mixing, making the scenario a compelling target in neutrino oscillation experiments. Complementary probes from cosmology, flavor physics and colliders are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, we present the model-independent two-loop effective action up to dimension six after integrating out heavy scalar(s) employing the Heat-Kernel method. We compute the effective operators that emerge at two-loop for two example models: heavy electroweak complex Triplet and Doublet scalars. We present our results on the SILH basis. We also capture the effect in the fermion sector. For these two scenarios, we compute all the fermionic effective operators up to dimension six.</description>

      <title>Comment on "QCD factorization with multihadron fragmentation functions"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make several comments on the recent work in Ref.~\cite{Rogers:2024nhb} while also reaffirming and adding to the work in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx}. We show that the factorization formula for $e^+e^-\to (h_1\cdots h_n)\, X$ in Ref.~\cite{Rogers:2024nhb} is equivalent to a version one can derive using the definition of a $n$-hadron fragmentation function (FF) introduced in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx}. In addition, we scrutinize how to generalize the number density definition of a single-hadron FF to a $n$-hadron FF, arguing that the definition given in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx} should be considered the standard one. We also emphasize that the evolution equations for dihadron FFs~(DiFFs) in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx} have the same splitting functions as those for single-hadron FFs. Therefore, the DiFF (and $n$-hadron FF) definitions in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx} have a natural number density interpretation and are consistent with collinear factorization using the standard hard factors and evolution kernels. Moreover, we make clear that the operator definition for the DiFF $D_1^{h_1h_2}(\xi,M_h)$ written down in Ref.~\cite{Rogers:2024nhb} agrees exactly with the one in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx}. Contrary to what is implied in Ref.~\cite{Rogers:2024nhb}, this definition did not appear in the literature prior to the work in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx}. There also seem to be inconsistencies in how $D_1^{h_1h_2}(\xi,M_h)$ appears in previous unpolarized cross section formulas in the literature.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Modular Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the Higgs field as a fundamental scalar in the Standard Model within the framework of modular inflation models, where a modulus field acts as the inflaton and its interactions are governed by an underlying modular symmetry. In general, the Higgs field can participate in the dynamics of modular inflation, leading to a two-field inflationary system-termed \emph{Higgs-Modular inflation}-which exhibits non-trivial dynamics and interesting phenomenological implications. We analyze Higgs-Modular inflation both analytically and numerically, highlighting its attractor behavior and the resulting observational constraints. In particular, we find that Higgs-Modular inflation is favored by the latest data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in certain regions of parameter space. This is in contrast to both pure Higgs inflation and pure modular inflation with a Starobinsky-type potential, which tend to predict a relatively low spectral index. Additionally, we discuss the cutoff scale of this inflationary model and the reheating processes induced by the decays of the modulus and the Higgs field.</description>

      <title>Probing light axion-like particle via primordial black hole evaporation with gamma-ray observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The axion-like particle (ALP) and primordial black hole (PBH) are two representative dark matter (DM) candidates as light bosonic DM and macroscopic objects, respectively. In this work, we investigate the gamma-ray production mechanisms induced by PBH evaporation and ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$. The detection of gamma-rays is also explored in future satellite telescopes, including AMEGO, e-ASTROGAM and MAST. We first propose the evaporation-conversion scenario in which light ALPs are emitted by PBHs and are converted into photons in the presence of magnetic field in the Universe. The second scenario assumes ALPs as dominant DM component in the Milky Way and considers the relativistic electron production from PBH evaporation. The emitted electrons scatter off non-relativistic ALP in DM halo and produce gamma-rays through the ALP-photon coupling. Using the Fisher forecasting method, we calculate the gamma-ray energy spectra from these two scenarios and derive projected sensitivity for the fraction of DM composed of PBHs $f_{\rm PBH}$ and ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$.</description>

      <title>Particle decay as asymptotic narrow parametric resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametric resonance can produce particles from oscillating scalar field, where an exponential growth of the particle number density can be developed. While it has been noticed that stimulated decay in Boltzmann equations exhibits similar parametric dependence of the exponential growth, it is not quantitatively clear yet under what circumstance can the two phenomena reconcile. We demonstrate that trilinear particle interaction in the Boltzmann equation can provide a good approximation to describe the distribution function and the number density in the asymptotic regime of narrow parametric resonance. We find that the crucial treatment leading to the quantitative agreement is a proper Gaussian simulation of the momentum spread inherited from nonrelativistic particle decay. With the simple particle picture, the analytic Boltzmann approximation can be applied to explosive photon production from axions/axion-like particles and to dark matter production from oscillating fields.</description>

      <title>Probing light neutralinos from pair-produced sleptons with displaced vertices at the high-luminosity LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study light neutralinos ($\tilde \chi_1^0$) with masses ranging from 10 GeV to several hundred GeV within the framework of R-parity-violating (RPV) supersymmetry. These light neutralinos can be long-lived, decaying with a macroscopic displacement (order cm) inside the LHC main detectors. Complementing previous works on the subject, here we focus on their production through the electroweak pair production of left-chiral sleptons ($\tilde e_{L}$), with the signal process $pp\to \tilde e^+_{L} \tilde e^-_{L} \to e^+ \tilde \chi_1^0 e^- \tilde \chi_1^0$. In contrast to the previous study with a singly produced slepton, where the RPV coupling $\lambda'_{111}$ induces both the production and decay of the light neutralino, in our scenario the production proceeds through Drell-Yan-like processes that are essentially independent of RPV couplings. Correspondingly, we implement a displaced-vertex search strategy for which our numerical analysis shows that the high-luminosity LHC can probe $\lambda'_{111}$ values up to three orders of magnitude smaller, and neutralino masses up to about four times larger than those accesible in the previously studied single-slepton production scenario.</description>

      <title>A New State of Matter between the Hadronic Phase and the Quark-Gluon Plasma?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice-QCD simulations and theoretical arguments hint at the existence of an intermediate phase of strongly interacting matter between a confined hadron gas and a deconfined Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). We qualitatively and semi-quantitatively explore and differentiate the phase structures in the temperature window from the QCD pseudo-critical temperature $T_c\simeq 160\;\text{MeV}$ to the pure-gluonic deconfinement temperature $T_d\simeq 285\;\text{MeV}$. We propose a three-regime picture using a hadron resonance gas (HRG) description augmented with the glueball spectrum based on the analysis of a large number, $N_c$, of colors. We estimate the entropy density from our model to confirm that the lattice-QCD data are bracketed with three regimes, i.e., a hadron gas, a QGP, and a new phase for $T_c \lesssim T \lesssim T_d$. In this new phase that we name a Spaghetti of Quarks with Glueballs (SQGB), thermal degrees of freedom of quarks are deconfined, yet gluons remain confined in glueballs. Since the Hagedorn temperature, $T_H\sim 285\;\text{MeV}$, is universal in the meson and the glueball sectors, in the infinite $N_c$ limit, the phase diagram in the plane of the baryon chemical potential and the temperature is reduced to the one with the confined and deconfined phases and Quarkyonic Matter at high density. At large but finite $N_c$, an SQGB window may open between these phases. We point out that the SQGB has interesting similarities with Quarkyonic Matter and that this matter in the large $N_c$ limit is confined as measured by the interaction between heavy quarks, but behaves in other respects like a quasi-free gas of quarks. As a result of the extrapolation to $N_c=3$, we present a revised phase diagram with the SQGB phase bounded by thermal crossovers. Finally, we give a quantitative analysis of chiral symmetry restoration in the SQGB phase.</description>

      <title>Bounds and detection of MeV-scale dark matter annihilation to neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current and most upcoming neutrino detectors can only reach a dark matter annihilation cross section to neutrinos larger than the standard freeze-out value, but they open intriguing detection avenues for non-standard dark matter paradigms. An important corollary of these non-standard scenarios is relic dark matter annihilation after neutrino decoupling, which was previously overlooked in constraining MeV-scale dark matter. However, by combining the contributions from entropy injection during neutrino decoupling and from nonthermal neutrino energy release after decoupling, we derive significant constraints on the annihilation cross section to neutrinos, which in some mass regimes become stronger than the current bounds. Furthermore, we find that the lower bounds on dark matter masses become inconclusive under the recent data releases from the DESI, SPT-3G, and ACT collaborations. These bounds determine the extent to which upcoming neutrino detectors will probe dark matter annihilation into neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how a natural neutrino mass hierarchy with large lepton mixing angles may be achieved in a theory of gauge flavour deconstruction. Hitherto it has been shown that neutrino anarchy may result from such theories, but here we show that this need not necessarily be the case. In particular we consider the minimal tri-hypercharge theory, and show that the decomposition of the family hypercharges into the corresponding $B-L$ gauge groups, together with the charged lepton mass hierarchy, implies the sequential dominance conditions for a neutrino mass hierarchy, where lepton mixing originates from both the neutrino and charged lepton sectors. We present novel and model-independent sequential dominance results applicable to this case, but also useful more generally. We also show how natural quark mass and mixing are included in such a framework.</description>

Abstract: We construct a flavour guided model that realises the distinctive Echo 12-23 Texture in the neutrino mass matrix through a non-trivial interplay of symmetries. While the model accounts for charged lepton mass hierarchy, the texture offers interesting insights specifically into neutrino mass ordering and flavour dynamics. With clear imprints on low energy observables, the framework provides a minimal yet testable path toward understanding the origin of neutrino properties.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for sampling singular functions defined on (nested) multi-particle phase spaces, based on a generalisation of parton-shower phase-space generation techniques. At the heart of the method are three key ingredients: 1) the Sudakov sampling by which shower-style calculations sweep across phase space in an ordered manner, from hard to soft; 2) the sequential nesting of multiparticle phase spaces; and 3) the factorisations obeyed by singular multiparton amplitudes on the edges of these phase spaces. We demonstrate a C++ implementation of the proposed algorithm, dubbed Sunshine, for hadronic Z decays, and use it to test the tree-level accuracy of the Vincia sector shower through $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$.</description>

      <title>Understanding the low-lying $\Omega_c$ structures from a coupled-channel perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a systematic analysis of the low-lying $\Omega_c$ structures in a coupled-channel approach. The couplings between meson-baryon channels, $\Xi_c \bar K$, $\Xi_c^{\prime} \bar K$, $\Xi_c^{*} \bar K$, $\Omega_c\eta$ and $\Omega_c^{*}\eta$, and three-quark bare states $\Omega_c(1P_\lambda)$ are considered. We predict a bound state $\Omega_c(2954)$ below the $\Xi_c \bar K$ threshold with $(J^P,j)=(1/2^-,0)$, which can be studied in the final states of $\Omega_c^{(*)} \pi$ and $\Omega_c^{(*)} \gamma$. Also, the resonances $\Omega_c(3000)$ and $\Omega_c(3050)$ can be classified as the lower $(J^P,j)=(1/2^-,1)$ and $(J^P,j)=(3/2^-,1)$ states, respectively. Our present assignments based on this coupled-channel perspective are significantly different from those of traditional three-quark picture and of molecular scenario. The future BelleII and LHCb experiments can search for the bound state $\Omega_c(2954)$ and measure the spin-parities of particles $\Omega_c(3000)$ and $\Omega_c(3050)$ to test our predictions.</description>

      <title>Monophotons from Scalar Portal Dark Matter at Neutrino Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate monophoton signatures arising from dark matter via a $2\to 3$ scattering process $\chi + N \to \chi + N + \gamma$ that is mediated by a virtual scalar and a Standard Model photon. Since the final-state photon carries a large fraction of the initial dark matter's energy, this process offers a compelling handle for probing scalar portal dark matter scenarios. Their distinctive energy, angular, and timing distributions allow for effective separation of signal from neutrino-induced backgrounds. We analyze several models featuring different couplings to the scalar mediator, with the scalar photon coupling serving as the common detection channel. To distinguish between the models, we further examined their distinct spatial distributions. We considered the flux of dark matter produced both at the target and absorber of neutrino facilities such as the BNB, NuMI, and LBNF, and investigated the sensitivities at the ongoing SBND, ICARUS-NuMI, and future DUNE ND detectors. We further investigated the differences in the DM fluxes arising from various production mechanisms, as well as the distinctions between the target and absorber contributions. Our results demonstrate that the sensitivities at the considered experiments, especially DUNE ND, can place significantly improved constraints on viable parameter space in various scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We present the implementation of simplified and full likelihood models for multibin signal regions in CheckMATE. A total of 13 searches are included from ATLAS and CMS, and several methods are presented for the implementation and evaluation of likelihood functions.

Abstract: We develop a novel approach for the self-consistent solution of coupled sets of Bethe-Salpeter and Schwinger-Dyson equations in QCD. This framework allows us to maintain the axial Ward-Takahashi identities of the theory within advanced approximation schemes, such as the skeleton or three-particle irreducible expansions. For this purpose we reformulate the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the axial-vector vertex such that the bulk of its quantum corrections is expressed in terms of a novel vertex. Crucially, this vertex satisfies a symmetry-induced relation of its own, which involves the full quark-gluon vertex. As a result, the Schwinger-Dyson equation reproduces the standard Ward-Takahashi identity satisfied by the axial-vector vertex. Consequently, the known relation between the quark mass function and the wave function of the pion in the chiral limit is duly fulfilled. The present approach offers valuable insights into the interplay between symmetry and dynamics, and provides a practical path towards computations of hadron physics within sophisticated approximations. In particular, the one-loop dressed truncation of the key dynamical equations, including that of the quark-gluon vertex, is shown to be completely compatible with the required symmetry relations. Further extensions and potential phenomenological applications of the developed framework are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantifying EFT Uncertainties in LHC Searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective Field Theory (EFT) is a general framework to parametrize the low-energy approximation to a UV model that is widely used in model-independent searches for new physics. The use of EFTs at the LHC can suffer from a 'validity' issue, since new physics amplitudes often grow with energy and the kinematic regions with the most sensitivity to new physics have the largest theoretical uncertainties. We propose a method to account for these uncertainties with the aim of producing robust model-independent results with a well-defined statistical interpretation. In this approach, one must specify the new operators being studied as well as the new physics cutoff $M$, the energy scale where the EFT approximation breaks down. At energies below $M$, the EFT uncertainties are accounted for by adding additional higher dimensional operators with coefficients that are treated as nuisance parameters. The size of the nuisances are governed by a prior likelihood function that incorporates information about dimensional analysis, naturalness, and the scale $M$. At energies above $M$, our method incorporates the lack of predictivity of the EFT, and we show that this is crucial to obtain consistent results. We perform a number of tests of this method in a simple toy model, illustrating its performance in analyses aimed at new physics exclusion as well as for discovery. The method is conveniently implemented by the technique of event reweighting and is easily ported to realistic LHC analyses. We find that the procedure converges quickly with the number of nuisance parameters and is conservative when compared to UV models. The paper gives a precise meaning and offers a principled and practical solution to the widely debated 'EFT validity issue'.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the behavior of renormalon ambiguities in the context of quasi-parton distribution functions (quasi-PDFs) defined using gradient-flowed fields. We examine how this impacts the UV and IR renomalons. Using the large $\beta_0$ approximation, we find that UV renormalons for zero external momentum quasi-PDF are eliminated by the flow, while IR renormalons persist but are modified at finite flow time. Moreover, we observe that large numerical coefficients associated with flowed operators can enhance power-suppressed contributions, making higher-dimensional operators non-negligible even at small flow times.</description>

Abstract: In top quark condensation the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) boson is a $\bar{t}t$ bound state. With a UV completion of a single coloron exchange interaction, a recent semiclassical treatment gave a novel theory of the BEH boson as an extended object with composite scale $M_0\sim 6$ TeV. Presently we obtain the semiclassical theory as an effective action, using the source/Legendre transformation techniques of Jackiw, \etal, and fermion loop effects in the large-$N_c$ limit by deploying an auxiliary field to implement the sum of leading fermion loop diagrams. The theory remains natural at the loop level, with fine tuning at the level of a few \%, and the effective coupling of the 4-fermion interaction, $\bar{g}_0^2$, is significantly enhanced by quantum loops over the fundamental coloron coupling, $g_0^2$. Hence a relatively weaker ``topcolor'' theory can produce critical coupling in the effective BEH bound state theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quark-mass dependence of the QCD critical point at varying bare up/down quark masses with fixed strange quark mass. We explore the corresponding second-order critical surface in the three-dimensional Columbia plot and study the extension of the associated crossover hyperplane at real and imaginary baryon chemical potential. To this end, we employ a by now well-tested combination of lattice Yang--Mills theory and a (truncated) version of Dyson--Schwinger equations at $N_f=2+1$ quark flavours. We find evidence for a positive curvature of the second order surface at (large) real chemical potential and a crossover region for imaginary chemical potential. Our results support the notion of a tricritical point at finite chemical potential in the chiral limit.</description>

      <title>Branching ratios and CP asymmetries of $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0$ in the improved perturbative QCD formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the idea of fragmented scalar glueball, we investigate the decays $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0$ within the improved perturbative QCD (iPQCD) framework by including the known next-to-leading order corrections. Here, $B^0$ and $f_0$ denote the neutral $B_{d,s}^0$ mesons and the light scalar mesons $f_0(500, 980, 1370, 1500)$ under the $q\bar q$ assignment. The CP-averaged branching ratios (BRs) and the CP asymmetries of $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0$ are evaluated with the $f_0(500)[f_0(1370)]-f_0(980)[f_0(1500)]$ mixing in quark-flavor basis. For effective comparisons with the near-future measurements, we further derive the $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0 (\to \pi^+ \pi^-/K^+ K^-)$ BRs under the narrow-width approximation. ${\rm BR}(B_s^0 \to \eta_c f_0(980) (\to \pi^+ \pi^-))= (2.87^{+1.38}_{-1.29}) \times 10^{-4}$ and ${\rm BR}(B_d^0 \to \eta_c f_0(500)(\to \pi^+\pi^-))/{\rm BR}(B_s^0 \to \eta_c f_0(980)(\to \pi^+\pi^-)) = (12^{+8}_{-7})\%$ obtained in the iPQCD formalism agree with the available measurements and/or predictions within uncertainties. Large BRs of $B_s^0 \to \eta_c f_0(1500) (\to \pi^+ \pi^-/K^+ K^-)$ and large direct CP asymmetries of $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0(1370, 1500)$ are accessible in the LHCb and Belle-II experiments. The experimental tests of these iPQCD predictions would help us to understand the nature of these light scalars more deeply and provide evidences to decipher $f_0(1500)$ as a primary or fragmented scalar glueball potentially.</description>

      <title>Eikonal gravitational-wave lensing in Einstein-aether theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein-aether theory provides a model to test the validity of local Lorentz invariance in gravitational interactions. The speed of gravitational waves as measured from the binary neutron star event GW170817 sets stringent limits on Einstein-aether theory, but only on a combination of the theory's free parameters. For this reason, a significant part of the theory's parameter space remains unconstrained by observations. Motivated by this, we explore the propagation of gravitational waves in Einstein-aether theory over an inhomogeneous background (i.e., gravitational wave lensing) as a potential mechanism to break the degeneracies between the theory's free parameters, and hence enable new constraints on the theory to be obtained. We reduce our analysis to gravitational waves that pass far from the lens' center and short wavelength signals, both compared to the lens' gravitational radius (eikonal limit). By applying these approximations and bringing the field equations into the form of the so-called kinetic matrix and applying a formalism known as the propagation eigenstate framework, we find that the speed of gravitational waves is modified by inhomogeneities in the aether field. However, the modification is common to both gravitational polarizations and vanishes in the limit in which gravitational waves propagate with luminal speed. This lens-dependent gravitational wave speed contrasts with the lens-induced birefringence observed in other theories beyond general relativity, like Horndeski's theory. While the potential to improve tests based on gravitational-wave speed is limited, our formalism sets the basis to fully describe signal propagation over inhomogeneous spacetimes in Einstein-aether theory and other extensions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>A geometric phase approach to quark confinement from stochastic gauge-geometry flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply a stochastic version of the geometric (Ricci) flow, complemented with the stochastic flow of the gauge Yang--Mills sector, in order to seed the chromo-magnetic and chromo-electric vortices that source the area-law for QCD confinement. The area-law is the key signature of quark confinement in Yang--Mills gauge theories with a non-trivial center symmetry. In particular, chromo-magnetic vortices enclosed within the chromo-electric Wilson loops instantiate the area-law asymptotic behaviour of the Wilson loop vacuum expectation values. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow is responsible for the topology changes that induce the appearance of the vortices. When vortices vanish, due to topology changes in the manifolds associated to the hadronic ground states, the evaluation of the Wilson loop yields a dependence on the length of the path, hence reproducing the perimeter law of the hadronic (Higgs) phase of real QCD. Confinement, instead, is naturally achieved within this context as a by-product of the topology change of the manifold over which the dynamics of the Yang--Mills fields is defined. It is then provided by the Aharonov--Bohm effect induced by the concatenation of the compact chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fluxes originated by the topology changes. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow naturally accomplishes a treatment of the emergence of the vortices and the generation of turbulence effects. Braiding and knotting, resulting from topology changes, namely stochastic fluctuations, stabilize the chromo-magnetic vortices. Finally, we observe that dimensional transmutation for the Yang-Mills fields can be derived from the scaling property of the geometric part of the stochastic flow. Specifically, a relation that involves the infrared equilibrium limit of the Planck constant can be derived that yields the correct order of magnitude for $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$.</description>

      <title>Particle Acceleration Time due to Turbulent-Induced Magnetic Reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate a crucial parameter for understanding particle acceleration theory via turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection: the particle acceleration time. We examine particles accelerated either during the jet's dynamic evolution or in a post-processing, nearly stationary regime. We derive the particle acceleration time and compare it with theoretical predictions for both the Fermi and drift regimes identified in the simulations. In the Fermi regime, the acceleration time is expected to be independent of the particles' energy, for constant reconnection velocity, as energy increases exponentially with time. Conversely, we expect the reconnection acceleration time to depend on the current sheet's thickness and the reconnection velocity, a dependence recently revisited by xu and lazarian 2023. They identified three conditions for \(t_{acc}\). We tested these relations using statistical distributions of the current sheets' thickness and reconnection velocities in the turbulent jet over time. The resulting average value of \(t_{acc}\) was found to be nearly constant with particle energy. We compared this acceleration time with the average acceleration time derived directly from 50,000 particles accelerated in situ in the same relativistic jet. When considering a longer time interval for particle acceleration in a nearly stationary snapshot of the turbulent jet, we find that the acceleration time during the Fermi regime remains nearly independent of particle energy and aligns with the acceleration time theoretical relations up to the threshold energy, attained when the particles Larmor radius becomes as large as the thickness of the largest current sheets. Beyond this threshold, the acceleration regime shifts to the slower drift regime, showing strong energy dependence, as predicted. The results also indicate a clear dominance of the Fermi regime of acceleration.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the fluctuations of the net-baryon number near the critical point of the liquid-gas phase transition. We use the parity doublet model in the mean-field approximation fixed to the zero-temperature properties of nuclear matter to account for critical behavior. We explicitly calculate the fluctuations of the net-proton and net-neutron numbers as well as their correlations in the isospin-symmetric matter. We focus on the qualitative properties and systematics of the first- to fourth-order susceptibilities and their ratios. We demonstrate that the fluctuations of net-proton number do not reflect the total net-baryon number fluctuations in the vicinity of the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition. We also study the behavior of the baryon and proton number factorial cumulants. We highlight the importance of the non-trivial correlations between protons and neutrons.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Disruption of Axion Minihalos by Multiple Stellar Encounters in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If QCD axion dark matter formed post-inflation, axion miniclusters emerged from isocurvature fluctuations and later merged hierarchically into minihalos. These minihalos, potentially disrupted by stellar encounters in the Milky Way, affect axion detectability. We extend prior analyses by more accurately incorporating multiple stellar encounters and dynamical relaxation timescales, simulating minihalo orbits in the Galactic potential.
  Our results show stellar interactions are more destructive than previously estimated, reducing minihalo mass retention at the solar system to ~30%, compared to earlier estimates of ~60%. This enhanced loss arises from cumulative energy injections when relaxation periods between stellar encounters are accounted for.
  The altered minihalo mass function implies a larger fraction of axion dark matter occupies inter-minihalo space, potentially increasing the local axion density and improving haloscope detection prospects. This work highlights the significance of detailed modeling of stellar disruptions in shaping the axion dark matter distribution.</description>

      <title>Double sine-Gordon class of universal coarsening dynamics in a spin-1 Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13986v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Far from equilibrium, universal dynamics prevails in many different situations, from pattern coarsening to turbulence. A central longstanding problem concerns the development of a theory of coarsening that rests on the microscopic properties of the system and allows identifying the interaction mechanisms underlying a possible overarching universality class of the associated scaling dynamics. In quantum systems, this is complicated by the existence of nonlinear and topological excitations due to the compact nature of phase degrees of freedom. We show that the double sine-Gordon model as a noncompact low-energy effective model of the spin-1 Bose gas accounts for subdiffusive coarsening dynamics, identifying field configurations spread over multiple wells of the sinusoidal potential as a precondition for the slow scaling. This is in contrast to diffusion-type scaling which the model is known to exhibit as well, where field configurations are seen to not extend over more than two wells. Experimental observations of a spinor BEC support these characteristics, thus constituting a platform for the investigation of sine-Gordon dynamics. Our results point to a path towards a classification of pattern coarsening in many-body systems on the basis of microscopic models.</description>

      <title>About testing Bell locality at colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colliders enable the testing of quantum mechanics at its most fundamental level, and in the presence of both strong and electroweak interactions. Particle physics naturally provides examples of systems that consist not only of qubits but also qutrits. Quantum tomography at colliders makes possible the measurement of entanglement and the testing of Bell locality. We provide a comprehensive explanation of how this is achieved and why it offers a novel perspective on the loopholes exploited by local hidden variable models to evade Bell tests.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuits for simulating neutrino propagation in matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of particle phenomena is a rapidly advancing field of research. With the widespread availability of quantum simulators, a given quantum system can be simulated in numerous ways, offering flexibility in implementation and exploration. Here, we perform quantum simulation of neutrino propagation in matter, a phenomenon that plays a crucial role in neutrino oscillations. We present quantum circuits with novel gate arrangements to simulate neutrino propagation in both constant and varying matter density profiles. The oscillation probabilities are determined by encoding and measuring the qubit states in the neutrino flavor basis, showing excellent agreement with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>On Measuring Stimulated Photon-photon Scattering using Multiple Ultraintense Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stimulated photon-photon scattering is a predicted consequence of quantum electrodynamics that has yet to be measured directly. Measuring the cross-section for stimulated photon-photon scattering is the aim of a flagship experiment for NSF OPAL, a proposed laser user facility with two, 25-PW beamlines. We present optimized experimental designs for achieving this challenging and canonical measurement. A family of experimental geometries is identified that satisfies the momentum- and energy-matching conditions for two selected laser frequency options. Numerical models predict a maximum signal exceeding 1000 scattered photons per shot at the experimental conditions envisaged at NSF OPAL. Experimental requirements on collision geometry, polarization, cotiming and copointing, background suppression, and diagnostic technologies are investigated numerically. These results confirm that a beam cotiming shorter than the pulse duration and control of the copointing on a scale smaller than the shortest laser wavelength are needed to robustly scatter photons on a per-shot basis. Finally, we assess the bounds that a successful execution of this experiment may place on the mass scale of Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics beyond the Standard Model of physics.</description>

      <title>Transverse-momentum-dependent pion structures from lattice QCD: Collins-Soper kernel, soft factor, TMDWF, and TMDPDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04625v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\perp \gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670 MeV mass.</description>

      <title>Unified Radial Distributions of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14426v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A method is presented for obtaining unified radial distributions of dark matter properties for different galaxies independent of their mass, type, or size. The publicly available measurements of 2693 stellar objects of 153 different galaxies of the SPARC-group [3] are used to demonstrate the effectivity of the method. The obtained unified radial distributions of dark matter properties like velocity, acceleration, mass and mass density give a detailed understanding of the general dark matter behavior within in the galaxies.</description>

      <title>From Nuclear Matter with Quenched $g_A$ to Compact-Star Matter with a Signal for Emergent Hidden Scale Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04939v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ``unorthodox" idea is developed that the long-standing mystery in nuclear physics of the effective axial-current coupling constant in nuclei, $g_A^{\rm eff}\approx 1$, could be interpreted in terms of an emerging hidden scale symmetry in dense compact-star matter. Arguments are presented using an effective field theory anchored on a renormalization-group approach to interacting baryons on the Fermi surface coupled with hidden symmetric heavy mesonic degrees of freedom that enables one to go beyond Weinberg's nuclear effective field theory involving nucleon and pion fields only, referred hereon to as $\chi$EFT$_\pi$. Both hidden local and scale symmetries, the former involving the vector mesons $\rho$ and $\omega$ and the latter the hidden scalar meson, a dilaton $\hat{\sigma}$ (i.e., $f_0(500)$), play the crucial role. Going beyond the density regime applicable to normal nuclear matter $n_0$, the notion of ``hadron-quark continuity HQC)" is brought in via the skyrmion structure of the nucleon argued to be valid in QCD at large $N_c$ limit and the large $N^\prime$ limit of the Grassmannian model $G/H= [O(N^\prime)/O(N^\prime-p) \times O(p)]$ where $N^\prime=4$ and $p=2$ for hidden local symmetry and the IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f \leq 3$ involving ``genuine/QCD-conformal dilaton" for hidden scale symmetry. The connection between the quenched $g_A$ and the sound speed $v^2_{s}/c^2\approx 1/3$ inside dense compact stars could be interpreted as a signal for emergent ``pseudo-conformal" symmetry.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Analytic model for Effects of Fuzzy Dark Matter Granule Perturbations on Orbital Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In fuzzy dark matter scenarios, the quantum wave nature of ultralight axion-like particles generates stochastic density fluctuations inside dark matter halos. These fluctuations, known as granules, perturb the orbits of subhalos and other orbiting bodies. While previous studies have simulated these effects using N-body techniques or modeled them statistically using diffusion approximations, we propose an alternative framework based on representing the perturbations as a Fourier series with random coefficients, which can be applied to individual orbits, not just populations. We extend the model to finite-size subhalos, identifying a critical length scale below which subhalos behave as point-mass particles. In contrast, larger subhalos exhibit suppressed perturbations from granules due to their extended mass profiles. Using FDM-Simulator, we validate our finite-size model by isolating granule accelerations and confirming their statistical effects on subhalo dynamics.</description>
