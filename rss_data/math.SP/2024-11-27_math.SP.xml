      <title>Detecting eigenvalues in a fourth-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a non-regular Maslov box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Maslov index to study the eigenvalue problem arising from the linearisation about a standing wave in the fourth-order cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE). Our analysis is motivated by a recent work by Bandara et. al., in which the fourth-order cubic NLSE was shown to support infinite families of multipulse soliton solutions with various symmetry properties. By using a homotopy argument, we prove a lower bound for the number of real unstable eigenvalues. We also give a Vakhitov-Kolokolov type stability criterion, which is sufficient to determine the spectral stability or instability for certain classes of standing waves. The interesting aspects of this problem as an application of the Maslov index are the instances of non-regular crossings; in particular, we encounter crossing forms with degeneracies of both zero and nonzero rank. We handle such degeneracies by analysing the partial signatures of higher order crossing forms, using a definition of the Maslov index developed by Piccione and Tausk.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue bounds for Schr\"odinger operators with complex potentials on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove eigenvalue bounds for Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta_g+V$ on compact manifolds with complex potentials $V$. The bounds depend only on an $L^q$-norm of the potential, and they are shown to be optimal, in a certain sense, on the round sphere and more general Zoll manifolds. These bounds are natural analogues of Frank's \cite{MR2820160} results in the Euclidean case.</description>

      <title>On the first hitting time of a high-dimensional orthant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a collection of independent standard Brownian particles (or random walks), starting from a configuration where at least one particle is positive, and study the first time they all become negative. This is clearly equivalent to studying the first hitting time from the negative orthant or the first exit time from the complement of the negative orthant. While it turns out to be possible to compute the distribution of these hitting times for one and two particles, the distribution (and even its tail asymptotics) is not known in closed form for three or more particles. In this paper we study the tail asymptotics of the distribution as the number of particles tends to infinity. Our main techniques come from spectral geometry: we prove new asymptotic estimates for the principal eigenvalue of the complement of a high-dimensional orthant, which we believe are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A reverse Faber-Krahn inequality for the magnetic Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the first eigenvalue of the magnetic Laplacian in a bounded and simply connected planar domain, with uniform magnetic field and Neumann boundary conditions. We investigate the reverse Faber-Krahn inequality conjectured by S. Fournais and B. Helffer, stating that this eigenvalue is maximized by the disk for a given area. Using the method of level lines, we prove the conjecture for small enough values of the magnetic field (those for which the corresponding eigenfunction in the disk is radial).</description>

      <title>Cheeger inequalities on simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cheeger-type inequalities in which the decomposability of a graph and the spectral gap of its Laplacian mutually control each other play an important role in graph theory and network analysis, in particular in the context of expander theory. The natural problem to extend such inequalities to simplicial complexes and their higher order Eckmann Laplacians has been open for a long time. Before proving any inequality, however, one needs to identify the right Cheeger-type constant for which such an inequality can hold. Here, we solve this problem. Our solution involves and combines constructions from simplicial topology, signed graphs, Gromov filling radii and an interpolation between the standard 2-Laplacians and the analytically more difficult 1-Laplacians, for which, however, the inequalities become equalities. It is then natural to develop a general theory for $p$-Laplacians on simplicial complexes and investigate the related Cheeger-type inequalities.</description>
