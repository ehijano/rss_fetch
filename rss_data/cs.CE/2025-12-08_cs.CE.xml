      <title>From Text to Returns: Using Large Language Models for Mutual Fund Portfolio Optimization and Risk-Adjusted Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has enormous potential for improving two critical areas in investing, namely portfolio optimization (choosing the best combination of assets) and risk management (protecting those investments). Our study works at this intersection, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to upgrade how financial decisions are traditionally made. This research specifically tested how well advanced LLMs like Microsoft Phi 2, Mistral 7B, and Zypher 7B can create practical, risk-aware strategies for investing mutual funds in different sectors of the economy. Our method is sophisticated: it combines a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, which enables the LLM to check external, real-time data with standard financial optimization methods. The model's advice is context-aware because we feed it large economic signals, like changes in the global economy. The Zypher 7B model was the clear winner. It consistently produced strategies that maximized investment returns while delivering better risk-adjusted results than the other models. Its ability to process complex relationships and contextual information makes it a highly powerful tool for financial allocation. In conclusion, our findings show that GenAI substantially improves performance over basic allocation methods. By connecting GenAI to real-world financial applications, this work lays the groundwork for creating smarter, more efficient, and more adaptable solutions for asset management professionals.</description>

      <title>Smart Timing for Mining: A Deep Learning Framework for Bitcoin Hardware ROI Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bitcoin mining hardware acquisition requires strategic timing due to volatile markets, rapid technological obsolescence, and protocol-driven revenue cycles. Despite mining's evolution into a capital-intensive industry, there is little guidance on when to purchase new Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware, and no prior computational frameworks address this decision problem. We address this gap by formulating hardware acquisition as a time series classification task, predicting whether purchasing ASIC machines yields profitable (Return on Investment (ROI) &gt;= 1), marginal (0 &lt; ROI &lt; 1), or unprofitable (ROI &lt;= 0) returns within one year. We propose MineROI-Net, an open source Transformer-based architecture designed to capture multi-scale temporal patterns in mining profitability. Evaluated on data from 20 ASIC miners released between 2015 and 2024 across diverse market regimes, MineROI-Net outperforms LSTM-based and TSLANet baselines, achieving 83.7% accuracy and 83.1% macro F1-score. The model demonstrates strong economic relevance, achieving 93.6% precision in detecting unprofitable periods and 98.5% precision for profitable ones, while avoiding misclassification of profitable scenarios as unprofitable and vice versa. These results indicate that MineROI-Net offers a practical, data-driven tool for timing mining hardware acquisitions, potentially reducing financial risk in capital-intensive mining operations. The model is available through: https://github.com/AMAAI-Lab/MineROI-Net.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Hit Moving Targets? Tracking Evolving Signals in Corporate Disclosures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moving targets -- managers' strategic shifting of key performance metrics when the original targets become difficult to achieve -- have been shown to predict subsequent stock underperformance. However, our work reveals that the method employed in that study exhibits two key limitations that hinder the accuracy -- noise in the extracted targets and loss of contextual information -- both of which stem primarily from the use of a named entity recognition (NER). To address these two limitations, we propose an LLM-based target extraction method with a newly defined metric that better captures semantic context. This approach preserves semantic context beyond simple entity recognition and yields consistently higher predictive power than the original approach. Overall, our approach enhances the granularity and accuracy of financial text-based performance prediction.</description>

      <title>Accelerating shape optimization by deep neural networks with on-the-fly determined architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In component shape optimization, the component properties are often evaluated by computationally expensive simulations. Such optimization becomes unfeasible when it is focused on a global search requiring thousands of simulations to be evaluated. Here, we present a viable global shape optimization methodology based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms accelerated by deep neural networks (DNNs). Our methodology alternates between evaluating simulations and utilizing the generated data to train DNNs with various architectures. When a suitable DNN architecture is identified, the DNN replaces the simulation in the rest of the global search. Our methodology was tested on five ZDT benchmark functions, showing itself at the level of and sometimes more flexible than other state-of-the-art acceleration approaches. Then, it was applied to a real-life optimization problem, namely the shape optimization of a single-phase ejector. Compared with a non-accelerated methodology, ours was able to save weeks of CPU time in solving this problem. To experimentally confirm the performance of the optimized ejector shapes, four of them were 3D printed and tested on the lab scale confirming the predicted performance. This suggests that our methodology could be used for acceleration of other real-life shape optimization problems.</description>

      <title>NAWOA-XGBoost: A Novel Model for Early Prediction of Academic Potential in Computer Science Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) suffers from limited global search ability, slow convergence, and tendency to fall into local optima, restricting its effectiveness in hyperparameter optimization for machine learning models. To address these issues, this study proposes a Nonlinear Adaptive Whale Optimization Algorithm (NAWOA), which integrates strategies such as Good Nodes Set initialization, Leader-Followers Foraging, Dynamic Encircling Prey, Triangular Hunting, and a nonlinear convergence factor to enhance exploration, exploitation, and convergence stability. Experiments on 23 benchmark functions demonstrate NAWOA's superior optimization capability and robustness. Based on this optimizer, an NAWOA-XGBoost model was developed to predict academic potential using data from 495 Computer Science undergraduates at Macao Polytechnic University (2009-2019). Results show that NAWOA-XGBoost outperforms traditional XGBoost and WOA-XGBoost across key metrics, including Accuracy (0.8148), Macro F1 (0.8101), AUC (0.8932), and G-Mean (0.8172), demonstrating strong adaptability on multi-class imbalanced datasets.</description>

      <title>LAET: A Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning Framework for Pretrained Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed the financial industry, enabling advancements in areas such as textual analysis, risk management, and forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\sim$3B parameters). This work bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research and real-world deployment with efficient and scalable models for financial applications.</description>
