      <title>Non-collapsing volume estimate for local K\"ahler metrics in big cohomology classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a uniform local non-collapsing volume estimate for a large family of K\"ahler metrics in the big cohomology classes. The key ingredient is a generalization of a mixed energy estimate for functions in the complex Sobolev space to the setting of big cohomology classes.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Shrinking Sasaki-Ricci Solitons I: Fundamental Equations and Characterization of Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study some properties of Sasaki-Ricci soltions as the singularity models of Sasaki-Ricci flows. First, we establish some fundamental equations about the Sasaki-Ricci soltions which enable us to obtain the potential estimate and the positivity of the scalar curvature. Subsequently, two criteria about the transverse rigidity of Sasaki-Ricci soltions are given; and then, as an essential application, we prove that any Sasaki-Ricci soltion of low dimension with constant scalar curvature must be Sasaki-Einstein.</description>

      <title>The Funk-Finsler Structure in the Constant Curvature Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we {\it find} the infinitesimal structure of Funk-Finsler metric in spaces of constant curvature. We investigate the geometry of this Funk-Finsler metric by explicitly computing its $S$-curvature, Riemann curvature, Ricci curvature, and flag curvature. Moreover, we show that the $S$-curvature of the Funk-Finsler metric in hyperbolic space is bounded above by $\frac{3}{2}$, in spherical space bounded below by $\frac{3}{2}$, and in Euclidean case it is identically equal to $\frac{3}{2}$. Further, we show that the flag curvature of the Funk-Finsler metric in hyperbolic space is bounded above by $-\frac{1}{4}$, in spherical space bounded below by $-\frac{1}{4}$, and in Euclidean case it is identically equal to $-\frac{1}{4}$.</description>

      <title>On a non-local area-preserving curve flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a new area-preserving curvature flow for closed convex planar curves. This flow will decrease the length of the evolving curve and make the curve more and more circular during the evolution process. And finally, the curve converges to a finite circle in $C^{\infty}$ sense as time goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>Twisted Poincar\'e duality for orientable Poisson manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We geometrize the constructions of twisted Poisson modules introduced by Luo-Wang-Wu, and Poisson chain complexes with coefficients in Poisson modules defined in the algebraic setting to the geometric setting of Poisson manifolds. We then prove that for any orientable Poisson manifold $M$, there is an explicit chain isomorphism between the Poisson cochain complex with coefficients in any Poisson geometric module and the Poisson chain complex with coefficients in the corresponding twisted Poisson geometric module, induced by a modular vector field of $M$. These are the geometric analogues of results obtained by Luo-Wang-Wu for smooth Poisson algebras with trivial canonical bundle. In particular, a version of twisted Poincar\'e duality is established between the Poisson homologies and the Poisson cohomologies of an orientable Poisson manifold with coefficients in an arbitrary vector bundle with a flat contravariant connection. This generalizes the duality theorems for orientable Poisson manifolds established by Evens-Lu-Weinstein, and by Xu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we first characterize Poisson quasi-Nijenhuis structures on three-dimensional oriented manifolds whose underlying Poisson tensor never vanishes, and we show that each of these structures is involutive. Then we prove that every such three-dimensional Poisson quasi-Nijenhuis manifold is a Haantjes manifold and that it carries a generalized Lenard-Magri chain.</description>

      <title>Effective stability of negatively curved Einstein metrics in dimensions at most 12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if a closed manifold admits a metric that is almost hyperbolic in a suitable sense, then it also admits a negatively curved Einstein metric, and the pinching constant measuring the almost hyperbolicity does \emph{not} depend on an upper diameter or volume bound. As an application we obtain that in dimension $n \in [4,12]\setminus \{11\}$, a $(1+\varepsilon)$-pinched negatively curved metric that is hyperbolic outside a region of bounded geometry is close to a negatively curved Einstein metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a uniqueness theorem for the Dirichlet problem of minimal maps into general Riemannian manifolds with non-positive sectional curvature, improving Theorem 5.2 of Lee-Ooi-Tsui's paper published in J. Geom. Anal.. The proof of this theorem is based on the convexity of several functions in terms of squared singular values along the geodesic homotopy of two given minimal maps.</description>

      <title>BGG Sequences -- A Riemannian perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BGG resolutions and generalized BGG resolutions from representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras have been generalized to sequences of invariant differential operators on manifolds endowed with a geometric structure belonging to the family of parabolic geometries. Two of these structures, conformal structures and projective structures occur as weakenings of a Riemannian metric respectively of a specified torsion-free connection on the tangent bundle. In particular, one obtains BGG sequences on open subsets of $\mathbb R^n$ as very special cases of the construction. It turned out that several examples of the latter sequences are of interest in applied mathematics, since they can be used to construct numerical methods to study operators relevant for elasticity theory, numerical relativity and related fields.
  This article is intended to provide an intermediate level between BGG sequences for parabolic geometries and the case of domains in $\mathbb R^n$. We provide a construction of conformal BGG sequences on Riemannian manifolds and of projective BGG sequences on manifolds endowed with a volume preserving linear connection on their tangent bundle. These constructions do not need any input from parabolic geometries. Except from standard differential geometry methods the only deeper input comes from representation theory. So one can either view the results as a simplified version of the constructions for parabolic geometries in an explicit form. Alternatively, one can view them as providing an extension of the simplified constructions for domains in $\Bbb R^n$ to general Riemannian manifolds or to manifolds endowed with an appropriate connection on the tangent bundle.</description>

Abstract: In the paper, we give four different examples of the rescaled Dirac operator by the perturbation of the function f. Further, based on the trilinear Clifford multiplication by functional of differential one-forms, we compute the spectral torsion for four kinds of rescaled Dirac operator on even-dimensional oriented compact spin Riemannian manifolds without boundary.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Shock Filtering on the Space of Positions and Orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Regularised Diffusion-Shock (RDS) filtering from Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^2$ to the space of positions and orientations $\mathbb{M}_2 := \mathbb{R}^2 \times S^1$. This has numerous advantages, e.g. making it possible to enhance and inpaint crossing structures, since they become disentangled when lifted to $\mathbb{M}_2$. We create a version of the algorithm using gauge frames to mitigate issues caused by lifting to a finite number of orientations. This leads us to study generalisations of diffusion, since the gauge frame diffusion is not generated by the Laplace-Beltrami operator. RDS filtering compares favourably to existing techniques such as Total Roto-Translational Variation (TR-TV) flow, NLM, and BM3D when denoising images with crossing structures, particularly if they are segmented. Additionally, we see that $\mathbb{M}_2$ RDS inpainting is indeed able to restore crossing structures, unlike $\mathbb{R}^2$ RDS inpainting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected, simply connected three-dimensional Lie group (unimodular or non-unimodular) equipped with a left-invariant (Riemannian or Lorentzian) metric $g$. Using Lie theoretical methods, we present a unified approach to obtain all pairs $(G, g)$ whose full isometry group $\mathrm{Isom}(G, g)$ has dimension greater or equal to four. As a consequence, we determine, for every pair $(G, g)$ up to automorphism and scaling, the dimension of $\mathrm{Isom}(G, g)$, which can be three, four or six.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically geodesic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sequence of distinct closed surfaces in a hyperbolic 3-manifold M is asymptotically geodesic if their principal curvatures tend uniformly to zero. When M has finite volume, we show such sequences are always asymptotically dense in the 2-plane Grassmann bundle of M. When M has infinite volume and is geometrically finite, we show such sequences do not exist. As an application of the former, we obtain partial answers to the question of whether a negatively curved Riemannian 3-manifold that contains a sequence of asymptotically totally geodesic or totally umbilic surfaces must be hyperbolic. Finally, we give examples to show that if the dimension of M is greater than 3, the possible limiting behavior of asymptotically geodesic surfaces is less constrained than for totally geodesic surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to gain a better understanding of weak and strong positivity for exterior forms on complex vector spaces. We prove a dimensionality reduction argument for positive forms, which allows us to restrict to the case of $(2,2)$-forms in $\mathbb{C}^4$. In this setting, we find criteria for weak positivity based on the associated Hermitian matrix. As an application we prove, by duality, the strong positivity of some families of $(2,2)$-forms, already of interest in works by other authors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of prescribing Gaussian curvature and geodesic curvature in a compact surface with boundary with conical singularities and corners. Solutions are obtained using a new variational formulation, recently introduced for the regular counterpart of the problem and extended here to the singular case. As far as we know, this is the first result for the problem of prescribed curvatures in surfaces with singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a semi-simple real Lie group of real rank one and $\Gamma$ be a discrete subgroup in $G$ such that $\Gamma \backslash G$ has finite volume. We introduce a new group $C^*$-algebra $C^*_r(G, \Gamma)$, which provides a natural framework for defining index classes of Dirac-type operators on the locally symmetirc space $\Gamma \backslash G /K$. We show that Dirac operators define elements in the $K$-theory of $C^*_r(G, \Gamma)$ and use Hecke correspondences to study their Lefschetz numbers. Our main result is an explicit formula for the Lefschetz number of Hecke operators.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger evolution on surfaces in 3D contact sub-Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a 3-dimensional contact sub-Riemannian manifold and $S$ a surface embedded in $M$. Such a surface inherits a field of directions that becomes singular at characteristic points. The integral curves of such field define a characteristic foliation $\mathscr{F}$. In this paper we study the Schr\"odinger evolution of a particle constrained on $\mathscr{F}$. In particular, we relate the self-adjointness of the Schr\"odinger operator with a geometric invariant of the foliation. We then classify a special family of its self-adjoint extensions: those that yield disjoint dynamics.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic construction of the $\mathbb{H}^3$-Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory and correspondence with Liouville theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models are among the most basic and most studied Conformal Field Theories (CFT). They have had a huge influence not only in physics but also in mathematics, in representation theory and geometry. However their rigorous probabilistic construction and analysis starting from the path integral is still missing and all their properties have been obtained algebraically from their postulated affine Lie algebra symmetry. Initially considered as taking values in a compact semisimple Lie Group G, the WZW model also has a "dual" formulation where the group $G$ is replaced by the homogenous space $G^{\mathbb{C}}/G$, where $G^{\mathbb{C}}$ is the complexification of $G$, and it has been argued that the former can be (re-)constructed from the latter. For $G={\rm SU}(2)$, the space ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})/{\rm SU}(2)$ can be identified with the three dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^3$ and, in physics, the corresponding CFT has been studied as the simplest example of the AdS/CFT correspondence. A surprising correspondence between the $\mathbb{H}^3$-WZW CFT and the Liouville CFT was found by Ribault and Teschner and later generalised by Hikida and Shomerus. This correspondence has been dubbed by Gaiotto-Teschner as the "quantum analytic Langlands correspondence" since the analytic Langlands correspondence of Etingof, Frenkel and Kazhdan seems to emerge in its formal semi classical limit. In this paper we give a rigorous construction of the path integral for the $\mathbb{H}^3$-WZW model on a closed Riemann surface $\Sigma$, twisted by an arbitrary smooth gauge field on $\Sigma$. Using the probabilistic path integral we prove a correspondence between the correlation functions of the primary fields of the $\mathbb{H}^3$ model and those of Liouville CFT extending the expressions proposed by Ribault-Teschner and by Hikida-Schomerus to this general setup.</description>

      <title>Entropic Selection Principle for Monge's Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the small regularization limit of entropic optimal transport when the cost function is the Euclidean distance in dimensions $d &gt; 1$, and the marginal measures are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Our results establish that the limiting optimal transport plan is supported on transport rays. Furthermore, within each transport ray, the limiting transport plan uniquely minimizes a relative entropy functional with respect to specific reference measures supported on the rays. This provides a complete and unique characterization of the limiting transport plan. While similar results have been obtained for $d = 1$ in \cite{Marino} and for discrete measures in \cite{peyr\'e2020computationaloptimaltransport}, this work resolves the previously open case in higher dimensions $d&gt;1.$</description>

      <title>Integral Ricci Curvature for Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of integral Ricci curvature $I_{\kappa_0}$ for graphs, which measures the amount of Ricci curvature below a given threshold $\kappa_0$. We focus our attention on the Lin-Lu-Yau Ricci curvature. As applications, we prove a Bonnet-Myers-type diameter estimate, a Moore-type estimate on the number of vertices of a graph in terms of the maximum degree $d_M$ and diameter $D$, and a Lichnerowicz-type estimate for the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the Graph Laplacian, generalizing the results obtained by Lin, Lu, and Yau. All estimates are uniform, depending only on geometric parameters like $\kappa_0$, $I_{\kappa_0}$, $d_M$, or $D$, and do not require the graphs to be positively curved.</description>

      <title>A delayed interior area-to-height estimate for the Curve Shortening Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In (Sobnack &amp; Topping; 2024a, 2024b), Topping &amp; the author proposed the principle of 'delayed parabolic regularity' for the Curve Shortening Flow; in (Sobnack &amp; Topping, 2024a), they provided a handful of proper graphical situations in which their delayed regularity framework is valid. In this paper, we show that there holds an interior graphical estimate for the Curve Shortening Flow in the spirit of the proposed framework. More precisely, we show the following $ \mathrm{L}^1_\mathrm{loc} $-to-$ \mathrm{L}^\infty_\mathrm{loc} $ estimate: If a smooth Graphical Curve Shortening Flow $ u : (-1, 1) \times [0, T) \mapsto \mathbb{R} $ starts from a function $ u_0 := u( \, \cdot \, , 0) : (-1, 1) \mapsto \mathbb{R} $ with $ \mathrm{L}^1(\!(-1,1)\!) $ norm strictly less than $ \pi T $, then after waiting for the 'magic time' $ t_\star : = \| u_0 \|_{\mathrm{L}^1(\!(-1,1)\!)} / \pi $, the size $ |u(0, t)| $ of $ u( \, \cdot \, , t) $ at the origin at any time $ t \in (t_\star, T) $ is controlled purely in terms of $ \| u_0 \|_{\mathrm{L}^1(\!(-1,1)\!)} $ and $ t - t_\star $. We apply our estimate to construct Graphical Curve Shortening Flows starting weakly from Radon measures without point masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. In this article we establish an $L^p$-Hodge decomposition theorem on sub-Riemannian compact contact manifolds without boundary, related to the Rumin complex of differential forms. Given an $L^p$- Rumin's form, we adopt an approach in the spirit of Morrey's book to obtain a decomposition with higher regular ``primitives'' i.e. that belong to suitable Sobolev classes. Our proof relies on recent results obtained in [4] and [6].</description>

      <title>Napoleonic Constructions in the Hyperbolic Plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Euclidean setting, Napoleon's Theorem states that if one constructs an equilateral triangle on either the outside or the inside of each side of a given triangle and then connects the barycenters of those three new triangles, the resulting triangle happens to be equilateral. The case of spherical triangles has been recently shown to be different: on the sphere, besides equilateral triangles, a necessary and sufficient condition for a given triangle to enjoy the above Napoleonic property is that its congruence class should lie on a suitable surface (namely, an ellipsoid in suitable coordinates). In this article we show that the hyperbolic case is significantly different from both the Euclidean and the spherical setting. Specifically, we establish here that the hyperbolic plane does not admit any Napoleonic triangle, except the equilateral ones. Furthermore, we prove that iterated Napoleonization of any triangle causes it to become smaller and smaller, more and more equilateral and converge to a single point in the limit.</description>

      <title>Extremals on Lie groups with asymmetric polyhedral Finsler structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.02465v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study extremals on Lie groups $G$ endowed with a left invariant polyhedral Finsler structure. We use the Pontryagin's Maximal Principle (PMP) to find curves on the cotangent bundle of the group, such that its projections on $G$ are extremals. Let $\mathfrak g$ and $\mathfrak g^\ast$ be the Lie algebra of $G$ and its dual space respectively. We represent this problem as a control system $\mathfrak a^\prime (t)= -\mathrm{ad}^\ast(u(t))(\mathfrak a(t))$ of Euler-Arnold type equation, where $u(t)$ is a measurable control in the unit sphere of $\mathfrak g$ and $\mathfrak a(t)$ is an absolutely continuous curve in $\mathfrak g^\ast$. A solution $(u(t), \mathfrak a(t))$ of this control system is a Pontryagin extremal and $\mathfrak a(t)$ is its vertical part. In this work we show that for a fixed vertical part of the Pontryagin extremal $\mathfrak a(t)$, the uniqueness of $u(t)$ such that $(u(t),\mathfrak a(t))$ is a Pontryagin extremal can be studied through an asymptotic curvature of $\mathfrak a(t)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Min-Oo's Conjecture is a positive curvature version of the positive mass theorem. Brendle, Marques, and Neves produced a perturbative counterexample to this conjecture. In 2021, Carlotto asked if it is possible to develop a novel gluing method in the setting of Min-Oo's Conjecture and in doing so produce new counterexamples. Here we build upon the perturbative counterexamples of Brendle--Marques--Neves in order to construct counterexamples that make advances on the theme expressed in Carlotto's question. These new counterexamples are non-perturbative in nature; moreover, we also produce examples with more complicated topology. Our main tool is a quantitative version of Gromov--Lawson Schoen--Yau surgery.</description>

Abstract: We explore for compact Riemannian surfaces whose boundary consists of a single closed geodesic the relationship between orthospectrum and boundary length. More precisely, we establish a uniform lower bound on the boundary length in terms of the orthospectrum when fixing a metric invariant of the surface related to the classical notion of volume entropy. This inequality can be thought of as a Riemannian analog of Basmajian's identity for hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

We prove some basic diffeological properties for tiling spaces and analyze two different fiber bundle structures of tiling spaces over irrational tori. We use the diffeological classification of irrational tori which captures their arithmetical escence in order to inherit the diffeological equivalence in the context of one-dimensional tiling spaces.</description>

      <title>Invariant divisors and equivariant line bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar relative invariants play an important role in the theory of group actions on a manifold as their zero sets are invariant hypersurfaces. Relative invariants are central in many applications, where they often are treated locally since an invariant hypersurface may not be a locus of a single function. Our aim is to establish a global theory of relative invariants.
  For a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of holomorphic vector fields on a complex manifold $M$, any holomorphic $\mathfrak{g}$-invariant hypersurface is given in terms of a $\mathfrak{g}$-invariant divisor. This generalizes the classical notion of scalar relative $\mathfrak{g}$-invariant. Any $\mathfrak{g}$-invariant divisor gives rise to a $\mathfrak{g}$-equivariant line bundle, and a large part of this paper is therefore devoted to the investigation of the group $\mathrm{Pic}_{\mathfrak{g}}(M)$ of $\mathfrak{g}$-equivariant line bundles. We give a cohomological description of $\mathrm{Pic}_{\mathfrak{g}}(M)$ in terms of a double complex interpolating the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex for $\mathfrak{g}$ with the \v{C}ech complex of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on $M$.
  We also obtain results about polynomial divisors on affine bundles and jet bundles. This has applications to the theory of differential invariants. Those were actively studied in relation to invariant differential equations, but the description of multipliers (or weights) of relative differential invariants was an open problem. We derive a characterization of them with our general theory. Examples, including projective geometry of curves and second-order ODEs, not only illustrate the developed machinery, but also give another approach and rigorously justify some classical computations. At the end, we briefly discuss generalizations of this theory.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness on average of large isoperimetric sets in noncompact manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M^n,g)$ be a complete Riemannian manifold which is not isometric to $\mathbb{R}^n$, has nonnegative Ricci curvature, Euclidean volume growth, and quadratic Riemann curvature decay. We prove that there exists a set $\mathcal{G}\subset (0,\infty)$ with density $1$ at infinity such that for every $V\in \mathcal{G}$ there is a unique isoperimetric set of volume $V$ in $M$; moreover, its boundary is strictly volume preserving stable.
  The latter result cannot be improved to uniqueness or strict stability for every large volume. Indeed, we construct a complete Riemannian surface satisfying the previous assumptions and with the following additional property: there exist arbitrarily large and diverging intervals $I_n\subset (0,\infty)$ such that isoperimetric sets with volumes $V\in I_n$ exist, but they are neither unique nor do they have strictly volume preserving stable boundaries.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on strong $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures with torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $\mathrm{G}_2$-structure on a $7$-manifold $M$ is called a $\mathrm{G}_2T$-structure if $M$ admits a $\mathrm{G}_2$-connection $\nabla^T$ with totally skew-symmetric torsion $T_\varphi$. If furthermore, $T_\varphi$ is closed then it is called a strong $\mathrm{G}_2T$-structure. In this paper we investigate the geometry of (strong) $\mathrm{G}_2T$-manifolds in relation to its curvature, $S^1$ action and almost Hermitian structures. In particular, we study the Ricci flatness condition of $\nabla^T$ and give an equivalent characterisation in terms of geometric properties of the $\mathrm{G}_2$ Lee form. Analogous results are also obtained for almost Hermitian $6$-manifolds with skew-symmetric Nijenhuis tensor. Moreover, by considering the $S^1$ reduction by the dual of the $\mathrm{G}_2$ Lee form, we show that Ricci-flat strong $\mathrm{G}_2T$-structures correspond to solutions of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ heterotic system on certain almost Hermitian half-flat $6$-manifolds. Many explicit examples are described and in particular, we construct the first examples of strong $\mathrm{G}_2T$-structures with $\nabla^T$ not Ricci flat. Lastly, we classify $\mathrm{G}_2$-flows inducing gauge fixed solutions to the generalised Ricci flow akin to the pluriclosed flow in complex geometry. The approach is this paper is based on the representation theoretic methods due to Bryant.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to relax convexity assumption on some classical results in mean curvature flow. In the first half of the paper, we prove a generalized version of Hamilton's differential Harnack inequality which holds for mean convex solutions to mean curvature flow with a lower bound on $\frac{\lambda_1}{H}$ where $\lambda_1$ is the smallest principal curvature. Then, we use classical maximum principle to provide several characterizations of family of shrinking spheres for closed, mean convex ancient solution to mean curvature flow with a lower bound on $\frac{\lambda_1 + .. + \lambda_k}{H}$ for some $1 \leq k \leq d-1$, where $\lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq .. \leq \lambda_d$ are the principal curvatures.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a geometric correspondence between football metrics on $S^{2}$ and isometric immersions into $\mathbb{E}^{3}$, explicitly realizing a family of constant curvature one surfaces each endowed with two conical singularities. Our constructive proof demonstrates that every constant curvature one metric on $S^{2}$ with two conical singularities admits an isometric immersion in $\mathbb{E}^{3}$. Furthermore, we develop computational visualizations of these immersed surfaces, uncovering a novel geometric manifestation of the football geometry within $\mathbb{E}^{3}$.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected center-free simple real algebraic group of rank one and $\Gamma &lt; G$ be a Zariski dense torsion-free convex cocompact subgroup. We prove that the frame flow on $\Gamma \backslash G$, i.e., the right translation action of a one-parameter subgroup $\{a_t\}_{t \in \mathbb R} &lt; G$ of semisimple elements, is exponentially mixing with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure. The key step is proving suitable generalizations of the local non-integrability condition and the non-concentration property which are essential for Dolgopyat's method. This generalizes the work of Sarkar-Winter for $G = \operatorname{SO}(n, 1)^\circ$ and also strengthens the mixing result of Winter in the convex cocompact case.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that generalized Hukuhara directional differentiability of an interval-valued function (IVF) defined on Riemannian manifolds is not equivalent to the directional differentiability of its center and half-width functions and hence not to its end point functions. This contrasts with S.-L. Chen's \cite{chen} assertion which says the equivalence holds in terms of endpoint functions of an IVF which is defined on a Hadamard manifold. Additionally, the paper addresses some other inaccuracies which arise when assuming the convexity of a function at a single point in its domain. In light of these arguments, the paper presents some basic results that relate to both the convexity and directional differentiability of an IVF.</description>

      <title>RKHS, Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on arbitrary compact smooth manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we define Berezin-type and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on compact smooth manifolds. The method is we embed the smooth manifold of real dimension $n$ into ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and induce the quantizations from there. The standard way by which reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are defined on submanifolds gives a way to define the pullback coherent states. In Berezin-type quantization the Hilbert space of quantization is the pullback (by the embedding) of the Hilbert space of geometric quantization of ${\mathbb C}P^n$. In the Odzijewicz-type quantization one has to consider a tensor product of the geometric quantization line bundle with holomorphic $n$-forms. In the Berezin case, the operators that are quantized are those induced from the ambient space ${\mathbb C}P^n$. The Berezin-type quantization exhibited here is a generalization of an earlier work of the author and Ghosh. In both Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations we first exhibit this quantization explicitly on ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and we induce the quantization on the smooth compact embedded manifold from ${\mathbb C}P^n$.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing and essential spectral gaps for Anosov subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski dense $\Theta$-Anosov subgroup of a connected semisimple real algebraic group for some nonempty subset of simple roots $\Theta$. In the Anosov setting, there is a natural compact metric space $\mathcal{X}$ equipped with a family of translation flows $\{a^{\mathsf{v}}_t\}_{t \in \mathbb R}$, parameterized by vectors $\mathsf{v}$ in the interior of the $\Theta$-limit cone $\mathcal{L}_\Theta$ of $\Gamma$, which are conjugate to reparametrizations of the Gromov geodesic flow. We prove that for all $\mathsf{v}$ outside an exceptional cone $\mathscr{E} \subset \operatorname{int}\mathcal{L}_\Theta$, which is a smooth image of the linear spans of the walls of the Weyl chamber, the translation flow is exponentially mixing with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure associated to $\mathsf{v}$. Moreover, the exponential rate is uniform for a compact set of such vectors. We also obtain an essential spectral gap for the Selberg zeta function and a prime orbit theorem with a power saving error term. Our proof relies on Lie theoretic techniques to prove the crucial local non-integrability condition (LNIC) for the translation flows and thereby implement Dolgopyat's method in a uniform fashion. The exceptional cone $\mathscr{E}$ arises from the failure of LNIC for those vectors.</description>

      <title>On the Last Kervaire Invariant Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the element $h_6^2$ is a permanent cycle in the Adams spectral sequence. As a result, we establish the existence of smooth framed manifolds with Kervaire invariant one in dimension 126, thereby resolving the final case of the Kervaire invariant problem.
  Combining this result with the theorems of Browder, Mahowald--Tangora, Barratt--Jones--Mahowald, and Hill--Hopkins--Ravenel, we conclude that smooth framed manifolds with Kervaire invariant one exist in and only in dimensions $2, 6, 14, 30, 62$, and $126$.</description>
