      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the complexity of solving orientable quadratic equations in wreath products $A\wr B$ of finitely generated abelian groups. We give a classification of cases (depending on genus and other characteristics of a given equation) when the problem is computationally hard or feasible.</description>

      <title>Dimensions of finitely generated simple groups and their subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct finitely generated simple torsion-free groups with strong homological control. Our main result is that every subset of $\mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$, with some obvious exceptions, can be realized as the set of dimensions of subgroups of a finitely generated simple torsion-free group. This is new even for basic cases such as $\{ 0, 1, 3 \}$ and $\{ 0, 1, \infty \}$, even without simplicity or finite generation, and answers a question of Talelli and disproves a conjecture of Petrosyan. Moreover, we prove that every countable group of dimension at least $2$ embeds into a finitely generated simple group of the same dimension. These are the first examples of finitely generated simple groups with dimension other than $2$ or $\infty$. Our method combines small cancellation theory with group theoretic Dehn filling, and allows to do several other exotic constructions with control on the dimension. Along the way we construct relative versions of torsion-free Tarski monsters, and construct the first uncountable family of pairwise non-measure equivalent finitely generated torsion-free groups.</description>

      <title>Conjugacy and Least Commutative Congruences in Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a semigroup $S$ and $s,t \in S$, write $s \sim_p^1 t$ if $s=pr$ and $t=rp$, for some $p,r \in S \cup \{1\}$. This relation, known as "primary conjugacy", along with its transitive closure $\sim_p$, has been extensively used and studied in many fields of algebra. This paper is devoted to a natural generalization, defined by $s \sim_s^1 t$ whenever $s=p_1\cdots p_{n}$ and $t=p_{f(1)}\cdots p_{f(n)}$, for some $p_1, \dots, p_n \in S \cup \{1\}$ and permutation $f$ of $\{1, \dots, n\}$, together with its transitive closure $\sim_s$. The relation $\sim_s$ is the congruence generated by either $\sim_p^1$ or $\sim_p$, and is moreover the least commutative congruence on any semigroup. We explore general properties of $\sim_s$, discuss it in the context of groups and rings, compare it to other semigroup conjugacy relations, and fully describe its equivalence classes in free, Rees matrix, graph inverse, and various transformation semigroups.</description>

      <title>Finding cycle types in permutation groups with few generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem whether a given permutation group contains a permutation with a given cycle type is studied. This problem is known to be NP-complete. In this paper it is shown that the problem can be solved in logspace for a cyclic permutation group and that it is NP-complete for a 2-generated abelian permutation group. In addition it is shown that it is NP-complete whether a 2-generated abelian permutation group contains a fixpoint-free permutation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M. Kapranov and V. Schechtman introduced the contingency metamatrix for a finite Coxeter group and conjectured that the contingency metamatrix is totally positive. For the Coxeter groups of type $A$, this conjecture has been proved by P. Etingof. In this article, we prove this conjecture for the Coxeter groups of type $B$ and exceptional types.</description>

      <title>Ring theory in o-minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general ring theory in the o-minimal setting culminating in a description of all the definable rings in an arbitrary o-minimal structure. We show that every definably connected ring with non-trivial multiplication defines an infinite field and it is essentially semialgebraic. A surprisingly strong correspondence between definably connected rings and finite-dimensional associative $\mathbb{R}$-algebras is established. Every ideal of a definable unital ring is definable, from which it follows that every definable unital ring is Artinian and Noetherian. If a definable ring $R$ is not unital, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for $R$ to embed in a definable unital ring as an ideal. Moreover, when this is the case, we provide the smallest such definable unital ring $R^{\wedge}$, its definable unitazation.</description>

      <title>Row and column detection complexities of character tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Character tables of finite groups and closely related commutative algebras have been investigated recently using new perspectives arising from the AdS/CFT correspondence and low-dimensional topological quantum field theories. Two important elements in these new perspectives are physically motivated definitions of quantum complexity for the algebras and a notion of row-column duality. These elements are encoded in properties of the character table of a group G and the associated algebras, notably the centre of the group algebra and the fusion algebra of irreducible representations of the group. Motivated by these developments, we define row and column versions of detection complexities for character tables, and investigate the relation between these complexities under the exchange of rows and columns. We observe regularities that arise in the statistical averages over small character tables and propose corresponding conjectures for arbitrarily large character tables.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Anosov surfaces and Dynamics in 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine which closed orientable $3$-manifolds $M$ admit a self-homeomorphism restricting to a pseudo-Anosov map on an incompressible subsurface $\Sigma$, which we call a pseudo-Anosov surface. When $M$ is irreducible, we show that the self-homeomorphism of $M$ is isotopic rel $\Sigma$ to a "partially pseudo-Anosov" homeomorphism, a notion that we will introduce. This is motivated by the corresponding results for Anosov tori in irreducible $3$-manifolds, and the connection to partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms, obtained by F. Rodriguez-Hertz, J. Rodriguez-Hertz and R. Ures.</description>

      <title>A Presentation for the Group of Pure Symmetric Outer Automorphisms of a Given Splitting of a Free Product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a concise presentation for the group of pure symmetric outer automorphisms of a given splitting of a free product $G_{1}\ast\dots\ast G_{n}$. These are the (outer) automorphisms which preserve the conjugacy classes of the free factors $G_{i}$. This is achieved by considering the action of these automorphisms on a particular subcomplex of `Outer Space', which we show to be simply connected. We then apply a theorem of K. S. Brown to extract our presentation.</description>

      <title>The ideal separation property for reduced group $C^*$-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say that an inclusion of an algebra $A$ into a $C^*$-algebra $B$ has the ideal separation property if closed ideals in $B$ can be recovered by their intersection with $A$. Such inclusions have attractive properties from the point of view of harmonic analysis and noncommutative geometry. We establish several permanence properties of locally compact groups for which $L^1(G) \subseteq C^*_{\mathrm{red}}(G)$ has the ideal separation property.</description>

      <title>Strict comparison in reduced group $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every $n\geq 2$, the reduced group $C^*$-algebras of the countable free groups $C^*_r(\mathbb{F}_n)$ have strict comparison. Our method works in a general setting: for $G$ in a large family of non-amenable groups, including hyperbolic groups, free products, mapping class groups, right-angled Artin groups etc., we have $C^*_r(G)$ have strict comparison. This work also has several applications in the theory of $C^*$-algebras including: resolving Leonel Robert's selflessness problem for $C^*_r(G)$; uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$ up to approximate unitary equivalence into $C^*_r(G)$; full computations of the Cuntz semigroup of $C^*_r(G)$ and future directions in the $C^*$-classification program.</description>

      <title>Boundary actions of Bass-Serre Trees and the applications to $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Bass-Serre theory from the perspectives of $C^*$-algebras and topological dynamics. In particular, we investigate the actions of fundamental groups of graphs of groups on their Bass-Serre trees and the associated boundaries, through which we identify new families of $C^*$-simple groups including certain tubular groups, fundamental groups of certain graphs of groups with one vertex group acylindrically hyperbolic and outer automorphism groups $\operatorname{Out}(BS(p, q))$ of Baumslag-Solitar groups. In addition, we study $n$-dimensional Generalized Baumslag-Solitar ($\text{GBS}_n$) groups. We first recover a result by Minasyan and Valiunas on the characterization of $C^*$-simplicity for $\text{GBS}_1$ groups and identify new $C^*$-simple $\text{GBS}_n$ groups including the Leary-Minasyan group. These $C^*$-simple groups also provide new examples of highly transitive groups. Moreover, we demonstrate that natural boundary actions of these $C^*$-simple fundamental groups of graphs of groups give rise to the new purely infinite crossed product $C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Hybrid spherical designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spherical $t$-designs are finite point sets on the unit sphere that enable exact integration of polynomials of degree at most $t$ via equal-weight quadrature. This concept has recently been extended to spherical $t$-design curves by the use of normalized path integrals. However, explicit examples of such curves are rare.
  We construct new spherical $t$-design curves for small $t$ based on the edges of a distinct subclass of convex polytopes. We then introduce hybrid $t$-designs that combine points and curves for exact polynomial integration of higher degree. Our constructions are based on the vertices and edges of dual pairs of convex polytopes and polynomial invariants of their symmetry group. A notable result is a hybrid $t$-design for $t=19$.</description>
