      <title>A gluing construction of singular solutions for a fully non-linear equation in conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we produce families of complete, non-compact Riemannian metrics with positive constant $\sigma_2$--curvature on the sphere $\mathbb S^n$, $n&gt;4$, with a prescribed singular set $\Lambda$ given by a disjoint union of closed submanifolds whose dimension is positive and strictly less than $(n-\sqrt{n}-2)/2$. The $\sigma_2$--curvature in conformal geometry is defined as the second elementary symmetric polynomial of the eigenvalues of the Schouten tensor, which yields a fully non-linear PDE for the conformal factor. We show that the classical gluing method of Mazzeo-Pacard (JDG 1996) for the scalar curvature still works in the fully non-linear setting. This is a consequence of the conformal properties of the $\sigma_2$ equation, which imply that the linearized operator has good mapping properties in weighted spaces. Our method could be potentially generalized to any $\sigma_k$, $2\leq k&lt;n/2$, nevertheless, the numerology becomes too involved.</description>

      <title>A singular Riemannian Geometry Approach to Deep Neural Networks III. Piecewise Differentiable Layers and Random Walks on $n$-dimensional Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are playing a crucial role in everyday life, with the most modern generative models able to achieve impressive results. Nonetheless, their functioning is still not very clear, and several strategies have been adopted to study how and why these model reach their outputs. A common approach is to consider the data in an Euclidean settings: recent years has witnessed instead a shift from this paradigm, moving thus to more general framework, namely Riemannian Geometry. Two recent works introduced a geometric framework to study neural networks making use of singular Riemannian metrics. In this paper we extend these results to convolutional, residual and recursive neural networks, studying also the case of non-differentiable activation functions, such as ReLU. We illustrate our findings with some numerical experiments on classification of images and thermodynamic problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every gradient shrinking soliton of the generalized Ricci flow on compact manifold is a Ricci soliton. And we prove that the pluriclosed soliton is gradient Kahler-Ricci soliton under a broad cohomological condition. Moreover, we construct the first example of non-trivial shrinking generalized soliton, which can serve as a singularity model of the generalized Ricci flow.</description>

      <title>On harmonic maps from the complex plane to hyperbolic 3-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any twisted ideal polygon in $\mathbb{H}^3$, we construct a harmonic map from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{H}^3$ with a polynomial Hopf differential, that is asymptotic to the given polygon, and is a bounded distance from a pleated plane. Our proof uses the harmonic map heat flow. We also show that such a harmonic map is unique once we prescribe the principal part of its Hopf differential.</description>

      <title>Maximality and Cauchy developments of Lorentzian length spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article suggests the definition of 'Lorentzian space' weakening the notion of Lorentzian length space just as much that it allows for a functor from the category of causally continuous Lorentzian manifolds to the corresponding category of Lorentzian spaces, and considers three problems in the context of maximal Cauchy developments of Lorentzian length spaces (LLSs): The first is to define pointed Gromov-Hausdorff metrics for spatially and temporally noncompact LLSs, the second to present an explicit non-spacetime example of a maximal vacuum Cauchy development in the LLS category, the third to define canonical representatives for developments. A certain regularity property for geodesics plays a key role in each of the problems.</description>

      <title>Formal principle with convergence for rational curves of Goursat type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a conjecture that a general member of a bracket-generating family of rational curves in a complex manifold satisfies the formal principle with convergence, namely, any formal equivalence between such curves is convergent. If the normal bundles of the rational curves are positive, the conjecture follows from the results of Commichau-Grauert and Hirschowitz. We prove the conjecture for the opposite case when the normal bundles are furthest from positive vector bundles among bracket-generating families, namely, when the families of rational curves are of Goursat type. The proof uses natural ODEs associated to rational curves of Goursat type and corresponding Cartan connections constructed by Doubrov-Komrakov-Morimoto. As an example, we see that a general line on a smooth cubic fourfold satisfies the formal principle with convergence.</description>

      <title>Generalized Positive Energy Representations of the Group of Compactly Supported Diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by asymptotic symmetry groups in general relativity, we consider projective unitary representations $(\overline{\rho}, \mathcal{H})$ of the Lie group $\mathrm{Diff}_c(M)$ of compactly supported diffeomorphisms of a smooth manifold $M$ that satisfy a so-called generalized positive energy condition. In particular, this captures representations that are in a suitable sense compatible with a KMS state on the von Neumann algebra generated by $\overline{\rho}$. We show that if $M$ is connected and $\dim(M) &gt; 1$, then any such representation is necessarily trivial on the identity component $\mathrm{Diff}_c(M)_0$. As an intermediate step towards this result, we determine the continuous second Lie algebra cohomology $H^2_{\mathrm{ct}}(\mathcal{X}_c(M), \mathbb{R})$ of the Lie algebra of compactly supported vector fields (which is subtly different from Gelfand--Fuks cohomology).</description>

      <title>Index theory of hypoelliptic operators on Carnot manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.04717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the index theory of hypoelliptic operators on Carnot manifolds -- manifolds whose Lie algebra of vector fields is equipped with a filtration induced from sub-bundles of the tangent bundle. A Heisenberg pseudodifferential operator, elliptic in the calculus of van Erp-Yuncken, is hypoelliptic and Fredholm. Under some geometric conditions, we compute its Fredholm index by means of operator $K$-theory. These results extend the work of Baum-van Erp (Acta Mathematica '2014) for co-oriented contact manifolds to a methodology for solving this index problem geometrically on Carnot manifolds.
  Under the assumption that the Carnot manifold is regular, i.e. has isomorphic osculating Lie algebras in all fibres, and admits a flat coadjoint orbit, the methodology derived from Baum-van Erp's work is developed in full detail. In this case, we develope $K$-theoretical dualities computing the Fredholm index by means of geometric $K$-homology a la Baum-Douglas. The duality involves a Hilbert space bundle of flat orbit representations. Explicit solutions to the index problem for Toeplitz operators and operators of the form "$\Delta_H+\gamma T$" are computed in geometric $K$-homology, extending results of Boutet de Monvel and Baum-van Erp, respectively, from co-oriented contact manifolds to regular polycontact manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We prove that there exists at least one positive Einstein metric on $\mathbb{HP}^{m+1}\sharp \overline{\mathbb{HP}}^{m+1}$ for $m\geq 2$. Based on the existence of the first Einstein metric, we give a criterion to check the existence of a second Einstein metric on $\mathbb{HP}^{m+1}\sharp \overline{\mathbb{HP}}^{m+1}$. We also investigate the existence of cohomogeneity one positive Einstein metrics on $\mathbb{S}^{4m+4}$ and prove the existence of a non-standard Einstein metric on $\mathbb{S}^8$.</description>

      <title>On conformal biharmonic maps and hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we initiate a thorough geometric study of the conformal bienergy functional which consists of the standard bienergy augmented by two additional curvature terms. The conformal bienergy is conformally invariant in dimension four and its precise structure is motivated by the Paneitz operator from conformal geometry. The critical points of the conformal bienergy are called conformal biharmonic maps.
  Besides establishing a number of basic results on conformal biharmonic maps, we pay special attention to conformal biharmonic hypersurfaces in space forms. For hypersurfaces in spheres, we determine all conformal biharmonic hyperspheres and then we classify all conformal biharmonic generalized Clifford tori. Moreover, in sharp contrast to biharmonic hypersurfaces, we show that there also exist conformal biharmonic hypersurfaces of hyperbolic space, pointing out a fundamental difference between biharmonic and conformal biharmonic hypersurfaces.
  Finally, we also study the stability of the conformal biharmonic hyperspheres in spheres and explicitly compute their index and nullity. In particular, we obtain that the index of the equator $\mathbb{S}^4$ of $\mathbb{S}^5$ is zero, i.e., it is stable, while the index of the equator $\mathbb{S}^5$ of $\mathbb{S}^6$ is seven.</description>

      <title>On the Moser's Bernstein Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the following version of the famous Bernstein's theorem: Let $X\subset \mathbb R^{n+k}$ be a closed and connected set with Hausdorff dimension $n$. Assume that $X$ satisfies the monotonicity formula at $p\in X$. Then, the following statements are equivalent:
  (1) $X$ is an affine linear subspace;
  (2) $X$ is a definable set that is Lipschitz regular at infinity and its geometric tangent cone at infinity, $C(X,\infty)$, is a linear subspace;
  (3) $X$ is a definable set, blow-spherical regular at infinity and $C(X,\infty)$ is a linear subspace;
  (4) $X$ is a definable set that is Lipschitz normally embedded at infinity and $C(X,\infty)$ is a linear subspace;
  (5) the density of $X$ at infinity is 1.
  Consequently, we prove the following generalization of Bernstein's theorem: Let $X\subset \mathbb R^{n+1}$ be a closed and connected set with Hausdorff dimension $n$. Assume that $X$ satisfies the monotonicity formula at $p\in X$ and there are compact sets $K\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\tilde K\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ such that $X\setminus \tilde K$ is a minimal hypersurface that is the graph of a $C^2$-smooth function $u\colon \mathbb{R}^{n}\setminus K\to \mathbb{R}$. Assume that $u$ has bounded derivative whenever $n&gt;7$. Then $X$ is a hyperplane. Several other results are also presented. For example, we generalize the o-minimal Chow's theorem, we prove that any entire complex analytic set that is bi-Lipschitz homeomorphic to a definable set in an o-minimal structure must be an algebraic set. We also obtain that Yau's Bernstein Problem, which says that an oriented stable complete minimal hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with $n\leq 6$ must be a hyperplane, holds true whether the hypersurface is a definable set in an o-minimal structure.</description>

      <title>Continuity of HYM connections with respect to metric variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the set of (real Dolbeault classes of) balanced metrics $\Theta$ on a balanced manifold $X$ with respect to which a torsion-free coherent sheaf $\mathcal{E}$ on $X$ is slope stable. We prove that the set of all such $[\Theta] \in H^{n - 1,n - 1}(X,\mathbb{R})$ is a convex cone defined by a finite number of linear inequalities. For this, we prove that the set of all $c_1(\mathcal{S})$ for $\mathcal{S} \subset \mathcal{E}$ saturated and coherent is finite.
  When $\mathcal{E}$ is a Hermitian vector bundle, the Kobayashi--Hitchin correspondence provides associated Hermitian Yang--Mills connections, which we show depend continuously on the metric, even around classes with respect to which $\mathcal{E}$ is only semi-stable. In this case, the holomorphic structure induced by the connection is the holomorphic structure of the associated graded object. The method relies on semi-stable perturbation techniques for geometric PDEs with a moment map interpretation and is quite versatile, and we hope that it can be used in other similar problems.</description>

      <title>Quasi-rectifiable Lie algebras for partial differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce families of quasi-rectifiable vector fields and study their geometric and algebraic aspects. Then, we analyse their applications to systems of partial differential equations. Our results explain, in a simpler manner, previous findings about hydrodynamic-type equations. Facts concerning families of quasi-rectifiable vector fields, their relation to Hamiltonian systems, and practical procedures for studying such families are developed. We introduce and analyse quasi-rectifiable Lie algebras, which are motivated by geometric and practical reasons. We classify different types of quasi-rectifiable Lie algebras, e.g. indecomposable ones up to dimension five. New methods for solving systems of hydrodynamic-type equations are established to illustrate our results. In particular, we study hydrodynamic-type systems admitting $k$-wave solutions through quasi-rectifiable Lie algebras of vector fields. We develop techniques for obtaining the submanifolds related to quasi-rectifiable Lie algebras of vector fields and systems of partial differential equations admitting a nonlinear superposition rule: the PDE Lie systems.</description>
