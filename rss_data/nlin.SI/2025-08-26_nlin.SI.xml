      <title>Arithmetic dynamics of a discrete Painlev\'e equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the orbits of a discrete Painlev\'e equation over finite fields and show that the number of points in such orbits satisfy the Hasse bound. The orbits turn out to lie on algebraic curves, whose defining polynomials are given explicitly. Moreover, these curves are shown to have genus less than or equal to one, which contrasts sharply with the case of discrete Painlev\'e equations over $\mathbb{C}$, whose generic solutions are believed to be more transcendental than elliptic functions.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity, KAM, FPUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boltzmann introduced the microcanonical ensemble in
  1868, \cite{Bo868-a}, and immediately attempted to give an
  example of a system whose stationary states would be described
  by the emsemble (as suggested also by his ergodic
  hypothesis). The example, \cite{Bo868-b}, has been recently
  shown to be incorrect, if taken literally: the point was to
  suppose that constants of motion, if any besides the energy,
  would necessarily be smooth functions; and soon later he warned
  on the dangers implicit in a similar assumption. Fifty years
  later Fermi wrote a paper attempting to prove that in general a
  nonlinear system should be ergodic, \cite{Fe923}: but his proof
  relied again on Boltzmann's assumption. Thirty-four more years
  elapsed, and Fermi returned on the problem collaborating with
  Pasta, Ulam, Tsingou: the surprise was that the considered non
  linear chain was apparently not following the ergodic
  hypothesis. In the same year Kolmogorov had proved the
  conservation of many quasi periodic motions in nonlinear
  perturbations of integrable systems, \cite{Ko954}: his theorem was
  considered, already a few years later, a possible explanation
  of the FPUT work, \cite{Fo992}. This was only the beginning of intense
  research: here a brief sketch is presented to illustrate the
  above themes and the connection with the multiscale aspects of
  the problems, and the ``Renormalization group method'' intended
  as a map $\RR$ whose iterations can be interpreted as
  successive magnifications, zooming on ever smaller regions of
  phase space in which motions develop closer and closer to the
  searched quasi periodic motion of given spectrum.</description>

      <title>Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting the tsunami-like solitons with rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operator describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductor. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator by Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr\"odinger-Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we coin \textit{the KdV rocks}. In the Zakharov-Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions comes from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multi-valued Baker-Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider its classification.</description>

      <title>The Painlev\'{e} I hierarchy: Correspondence between the isomonodromic approach and the minimal models of the KP hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two approaches to the Painlev\'{e} I hierarchy are discussed: the isomonodromic construction based on meromorphic connections, and the minimal models construction based on a reduction of the KP hierarchy. An explicit correspondence between both formalisms is built which gives the identification of these setups. In particular, this provides new expressions for the Lax matrices and Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Calogero-Sutherland hyperbolic system and Heckman-Opdam $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ hypergeometric function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove equivalence of two integral representations for the wave functions of hyperbolic Calogero-Sutherland system. For this we study two families of Baxter operators related to hyperbolic Calogero-Sutherland and rational Ruijsenaars models; the first one as a limit from hyperbolic Ruijsenaars system, while the second one independently. Besides, computing asymptotics of integral representations and also the value at zero point, we identify them with renormalized Heckman-Opdam $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ hypergeometric function.</description>

      <title>Fractal decompositions and tensor network representations of Bethe wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of a generic $M$-particle Bethe wavefunction (not necessarily an eigenstate of an integrable model) on a 1d lattice by dividing the lattice into $L$ parts and decomposing the wavefunction into a sum of products of $L$ local wavefunctions. Using the fact that a Bethe wavefunction accepts a \textit{fractal} multipartite decomposition -- it can always be written as a linear combination of $L^M$ products of $L$ local wavefunctions, where each local wavefunction is in turn also a Bethe wavefunction -- we then build \textit{exact, analytical} tensor network representations with finite bond dimension $\chi=2^M$, for a generic planar tree tensor network (TTN), which includes a matrix product states (MPS) and a regular binary TTN as prominent particular cases. For a regular binary tree, the network has depth $\log_{2}(N/M)$ and can be transformed into an adaptive quantum circuit of the same depth, composed of unitary gates acting on $2^M$-dimensional qudits and mid-circuit measurements, that deterministically prepares the Bethe wavefunction. Finally, we put forward a much larger class of \textit{generalized} Bethe wavefunctions, for which the above decompositions, tensor network and quantum circuit representations are also possible.</description>
