      <title>Pulse Shape Discrimination Algorithms: Survey and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive survey and benchmark of pulse shape discrimination (PSD) algorithms for radiation detection, classifying nearly sixty methods into statistical (time-domain, frequency-domain, neural network-based) and prior-knowledge (machine learning, deep learning) paradigms. We implement and evaluate all algorithms on two standardized datasets: an unlabeled set from a 241Am-9Be source and a time-of-flight labeled set from a 238Pu-9Be source, using metrics including Figure of Merit (FOM), F1-score, ROC-AUC, and inter-method correlations. Our analysis reveals that deep learning models, particularly Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and hybrid approaches combining statistical features with neural regression, often outperform traditional methods. We discuss architectural suitabilities, the limitations of FOM, alternative evaluation metrics, and performance across energy thresholds. Accompanying this work, we release an open-source toolbox in Python and MATLAB, along with the datasets, to promote reproducibility and advance PSD research.</description>

      <title>The High Level Trigger and Express Data Production at STAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has developed and deployed a high-performance High Level Trigger (HLT) and Express Data Production system to enable real-time event processing during the Beam Energy Scan phase-II (BES-II) program. Designed to meet the demands of high event rates and complex final states, the HLT performs online tracking, event reconstruction, and physics object selection using parallelized algorithms including the Cellular Automaton Track Finder and the KF Particle Finder, optimized for identifying both long- and short-lived particles.
  Tightly integrated with the STAR data acquisition (DAQ) and detector control systems, the HLT employs a dedicated computing cluster to perform near real-time calibration, vertexing, and event filtering. The Express Data Production pipeline runs concurrently, enabling fast reconstruction and immediate physics analysis. This architecture allows for real-time monitoring of data quality, detector performance, and beam conditions, supporting dynamic feedback during operations.
  This framework has been instrumental in enabling prompt identification of rare signals such as hyperons and hypernuclei. Notably, it enabled the first real-time reconstruction of ${}^5_{\Lambda}\mathrm{He}$ hypernuclei with high statistical significance, as well as efficient processing of hundreds of millions of heavy-ion collision events during BES-II.
  The successful operation of this real-time system demonstrates its effectiveness in handling high data volumes while maintaining stringent physics quality standards. It establishes a scalable and modular model for future high-luminosity experiments requiring integrated online tracking, event selection, and rapid offline-quality reconstruction within hours of data taking.</description>

      <title>High-precision Penning trap mass measurements of neutron-rich chlorine isotopes at the N=28 shell closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although it is known that the $N=28$ spherical shell closure erodes, the strength of the closure with decreasing proton number $Z&lt;20$ is an open question in nuclear structure. In this region of interest, direct high-precision mass measurements of neutron-rich $^{43-45}$Cl isotopes were performed at the Low Energy Beam and Ion Trap (LEBIT) when coupled to the National Superconducting Cyclotron Lab. The resulting mass excesses (MEs) are ME($^{43}$Cl) = -24114.4(1.7) keV, ME($^{44}$Cl) = -20450.8(10.6) keV, and ME($^{45}$Cl) = -18240.1(3.7) keV, and improve the uncertainty of these masses by up to a factor of ~40 compared to the previous values reported in the 2020 Atomic Mass Evaluation. Comparison to $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations using the Valence-Space In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (VS-IMSRG) shows good agreement up to and including the closure.</description>

      <title>Global Extraction of the $\rm^{12}C$ Nuclear Electromagnetic Response Functions (${\cal R}_L$ and ${\cal R}_T$) and Comparisons to Nuclear Theory and Neutrino/Electron Monte Carlo Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have performed a global extraction of the ${\rm ^{12}C}$ longitudinal (${\cal R}_L$) and transverse (${\cal R}_T$) nuclear electromagnetic response functions from an analysis of all available electron scattering data on carbon. The response functions are extracted for energy transfer $\nu$, spanning the nuclear excitation, quasielastic (QE), resonance and inelastic continuum over a large range of the square of the four-momentum transfer, $Q^2.$ In addition, we perform a universal fit to all ${\rm ^{12}C}$ electron scattering data which also provides parmeterizations of ${\cal R}_L$ and ${\cal R}_T$ over a larger kinematic range. Given the nuclear physics common to both electron and neutrino scattering from nuclei, extracted response functions from electron scattering spanning a large range of $Q^2$ and $\nu$ also provide a powerful tool for validation and tuning of neutrino Monte Carlo (MC) generators. In this paper we focus on the nuclear excitation, single nucleon (QE-1p1h) and two nucleon (2p2h) final state regions and compare the measurements to theoretical predictions including ``Energy Dependent-Relativistic Mean Field'' (ED-RMF), ``Green's Function Monte Carlo'' (GFMC), "Short Time Approximation Quantum Monte Carlo" (STA-QMC), an improved superscaling model (SuSAv2), "Correlated Fermi Gas" (CFG), as well as the \nuwro{}, and \achilles~ generators. Combining the ED-RMF-QE-1p1h predictions with the SuSAv2-MEC-2p2h predictions provides a good description of ${\cal R}_L$ and ${\cal R}_T$ for both single nucleon (from QE and nuclear excitations) and two nucleon final states over the entire kinematic range.</description>

      <title>Evolution of shell structure at $\mathbf{N=32}$ and 34: Insights from realistic nuclear forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated the evolution of shell structure at $N=32$ and 34 in neutron-rich nuclei beyond the stability line using realistic nuclear forces, employing the state-of-the-art valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group method. The shell gaps are discussed from the excitation energies of the first $2^+$ states and the evolution of effective single-particle energies. We addressed different components of the nuclear interaction--central, spin-orbit, and tensor--and their roles in the development of shell gaps far from stability. The calculated results align well with the available experimental data and suggest a strengthening of the $N=34$ subshell gap and a weakening of the $N=32$ subshell gap below Ca. Additionally, the low-energy structures of the exotic $N=32$ isotones below Ca revealed that their ground states exhibit large deformation and coexist with a weakly deformed band at low excitation energy. The present work demonstrates essential components of the nuclear force in shaping magic numbers far from stability and provides deeper insights into the structure of exotic nuclei from the underlying nuclear forces.</description>

      <title>Rescattering effects on spin-interference for $\rho^{0}$ photoproduction in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements by various experiments in ultra-peripheral collisions have observed spin-interference in $\rho^{0}$ photoproduction, marking a breakthrough in Fermi-scale quantum interference experiments. Building on this, STAR extended the measurement to hadronic heavy-ion collisions, where significant rescattering effects on $\rho^{0}$ mesons were expected. In this study, we investigate how these rescattering effects influence the measurement of spin-interference. By embedding $\rho^{0}$ mesons produced via photoproduction, modeled by the Vector Meson Dominance model, into the Ultrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics framework, we estimate the impact on the $\cos2\phi$ and $\cos4\phi$ modulations, where $\phi$ is the angle between $\rho^{0}$ and one of the daughters' ($\pi^{\pm}$) transverse momentum. The results indicate a significant suppression of the $\cos2\phi$ modulation, while the $\cos4\phi$ modulation remains largely unaffected, which provides insight for understanding the difference due to rescattering effects between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions for $\rho^{0}$ photoproduction in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Transverse-momentum-dependent pion structures from lattice QCD: Collins-Soper kernel, soft factor, TMDWF, and TMDPDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04625v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\perp \gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670 MeV mass.</description>

      <title>Low-metallicity nova explosions: a site for weak rp-process nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical novae are common cataclysmic events involving a binary system of a white dwarf and a main sequence or red giant companion star. In metal-poor environments, these explosions produce ejecta different from their solar counterparts due to the accretion of sub-solar metallicity material onto the white dwarf. In particular, it has been suggested that the nucleosynthesis flow in such low-metallicity nova explosions extends up to the Cu-Zn region, much beyond the expected endpoint, around Ca, predicted for solar-metallicity classical novae. This behavior resembles a weak rp-process, and such nuclear activity has never been observed in accreting white dwarf binaries with typical accretion flows. In this work, we study the characteristics of the weak rp-process for four nova models with metallicities $Z= 2\times 10^{-9}$, $10^{-7}$, $2\times 10^{-6}$, and $2\times 10^{-5}$, and explore the impact of the nuclear physics uncertainties via a Monte Carlo sensitivity study. We identify nuclear reactions whose uncertainties affect the production of intermediate-mass nuclei under these conditions. These reactions and relevant nuclear quantities are targets for measurements at stable or radioactive beam facilities to reduce their rate uncertainties.</description>
