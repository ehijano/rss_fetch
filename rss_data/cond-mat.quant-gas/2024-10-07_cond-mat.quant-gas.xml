      <title>Restored condensate fraction and correlated droplets in one-dimensional dipolar Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of self-bound states in a one-dimensional dipolar Bose gas under the influence of both strong short-range repulsive and strong non-local attractive interactions. While conventional methods like the Bogoliubov de-Gennes (BdG) method typically fail in regimes with strong interactions due to significant quantum depletion, we reveal a particular scenario where the interplay of these strong interactions significantly mitigates quantum depletion, thus restoring the applicability of the BdG method. Remarkably, this restoration occurs even though the system exhibits pronounced anti-bunching, a feature usually linked with strongly correlated systems. By comparing our BdG results with exact ab initio calculations, we confirm the accuracy of the BdG approach in predicting the ground-state energy and correlation functions under these conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adjusting the polarization direction of the dipoles allows for a tunable transition between a strongly interacting regime and the novel balanced regime explored in this research.</description>

      <title>Early warning signals of the tipping point in strongly interacting Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of tipping points is essential for prediction of collapses or other sudden changes in complex systems. Applications include studies of ecology, thermodynamics, climatology, and epidemiology. However, detecting early signs of proximity to a tipping is made challenging by complexity and non-linearity. Strongly interacting Rydberg atom gases offer model systems that offer both complexity and non-linearity, including phase transition and critical slowing down. Here, via an external probe we observe prior warning of the proximity of a phase transition of Rydberg thermal gases. This warning signal is manifested as a deviation from linear growth of the variance with increasing probe intensity. We also observed the dynamics of the critical slowing down behavior versus different time scales, and atomic densities, thus providing insights into the study of a Rydberg atom system's critical behavior. Our experiment suggests that the full critical slowing down dynamics of strongly-interacting Rydberg atoms can be probed systematically, thus providing a benchmark with which to identify critical phenomena in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting Phase Coherence of 2D Bose Gases via Noise Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the noise correlations of two-dimensional (2D) Bose gases after free expansion, and use them to characterize the in-situ phase coherence across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. The noise-correlation function features a characteristic spatial oscillatory behavior in the superfluid phase, which gives direct access to the superfluid exponent. This oscillatory behavior vanishes above the BKT critical point, as we demonstrate for both single-layer and decoupled bilayer 2D Bose gases. Our work establishes noise interferometry as an important general tool to probe and identify many-body states of quantum gases, extending its application to previously inaccessible correlation properties in multimode systems.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics and atom-pair coherence in strongly interacting Bose-Fermi mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical treatments of non-equilibrium dynamics in strongly interacting Bose-Fermi mixtures are complicated by the inherent non-Gaussian nature of the vacuum two-body physics, invalidating the typical Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation. Here, we apply the cumulant expansion to study non-equilibrium Bose-Fermi mixtures, which allows us to explicitly include the missing non-Gaussian quantum correlations, leading to a consistent dynamical theory of a Bose-Fermi mixture near an interspecies Feshbach resonance. We first apply our theory to a study of atom-pair coherence in the gas, which is significantly enhanced by the competing influences of the Fermi sea and Bose-Einstein condensation, in agreement with analytical calculations. Then, we study the depletion of a degenerate Bose-Fermi mixture following a quench to the unitary regime, characterizing the resulting depletion of the Bose-Einstein condensate, the deformation of the Fermi surface, and the production of molecules. We find that at early times, the population dynamics scale quadratically with the hold time, and define an associated characteristic timescale set by the parameters of the mixture and the width of the Feshbach resonance.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Virial Expansion for the Optical Response of Doped Two-Dimensional Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum virial expansion for the optical response of a doped two-dimensional semiconductor. As we show, this constitutes a perturbatively exact theory in the high-temperature or low-doping regime, where the electrons' thermal wavelength is smaller than their interparticle spacing. The virial expansion predicts new features of the photoluminescence, such as a non-trivial shape of the attractive branch related to universal low-energy exciton-electron scattering and an associated shift of the attractive peak from the trion energy. Our results are in excellent agreement with recent experiments on doped monolayer MoSe$_2$ [Zipfel et al., Phys. Rev. B 105, 075311 (2022)] and they imply that the trion binding energy is likely to have been overestimated in previous measurements. Our theory furthermore allows us to formally unify two distinct theoretical pictures that have been applied to this system, with the conventional trion picture results emerging as a high-temperature and weak-interaction limit of Fermi polaron theory.</description>

      <title>An energy-dependent broadening of Rashba-like spin splitting in Au2Sb surface alloy with periodic structural defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06183v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we report a novel AuSb 2D superstructure on Au(111) that shows agreements and discrepancies to the expected electronic features of the ideal 2D surface alloys with $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ periodicity. Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we find a spin splitting of the alloy bands with antiparallel spin polarization, stemming from Rashba spin-orbit coupling. However, the observed Rashba bands are significantly broadened. Taking advantage of the good agreement between the experimental results and DFT calculations, we determine that the broadening of the Rashba band is due to the perturbations from the 3-pointed-star-shaped defects acting as nonresonant impurities in the Au2Sb superstructure. These periodic defects can shift the energy position of the Rashba band without breaking the in-plane rotational symmetry and mirror symmetry, which suggests that introducing periodic defects into a Rashba SOC system possesses a great potential in engineering the spin-dependent properties of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic Driving for Periodically Driven Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems have emerged as a useful technique to engineer the properties of quantum systems, and are in the process of being developed into a standard toolbox for quantum simulation. An outstanding challenge that leaves this toolbox incomplete is the manipulation of the states dressed by strong periodic drives. The state-of-the-art in Floquet control is the adiabatic change of parameters. Yet, this requires long protocols conflicting with the limited coherence times in experiments. To achieve fast control of nonequilibrium quantum matter, we generalize the notion of variational counterdiabatic driving away from equilibrium focusing on Floquet systems. We derive a nonperturbative variational principle to find local approximations to the adiabatic gauge potential for the effective Floquet Hamiltonian. It enables transitionless driving of Floquet eigenstates far away from the adiabatic regime. We discuss applications to two-level, Floquet band, and interacting periodically driven models. The developed technique allows us to capture nonperturbative photon resonances and obtain high-fidelity protocols that respect experimental limitations like the locality of the accessible control terms.</description>

      <title>Bound-state confinement after trap-expansion dynamics in integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrable systems possess stable families of quasiparticles, which are composite objects (bound states) of elementary excitations. Motivated by recent quantum computer experiments, we investigate bound-state transport in the spin-$1/2$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain ($XXZ$ chain). Specifically, we consider the sudden vacuum expansion of a finite region $A$ prepared in a non-equilibrium state. In the hydrodynamic regime, if interactions are strong enough, bound states remain confined in the initial region. Bound-state confinement persists until the density of unbound excitations remains finite in the bulk of $A$. Since region $A$ is finite, at asymptotically long times bound states are "liberated" after the "evaporation" of all the unbound excitations. Fingerprints of confinement are visible in the space-time profiles of local spin-projection operators. To be specific, here we focus on the expansion of the $p$-N\'eel states, which are obtained by repetition of a unit cell with $p$ up spins followed by $p$ down spins. Upon increasing $p$, the bound-state content is enhanced. In the limit $p\to\infty$ one obtains the domain-wall initial state. We show that for $p&lt;4$, only bound states with $n&gt;p$ are confined at large chain anisotropy. For $p\gtrsim 4$, also bound states with $n=p$ are confined, consistent with the absence of transport in the limit $p\to\infty$. The scenario of bound-state confinement leads to a hierarchy of timescales at which bound states of different sizes are liberated, which is also reflected in the dynamics of the von Neumann entropy.</description>

      <title>Partial yet definite emergence of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class in isotropic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrable spin chains with a continuous non-Abelian symmetry, such as the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, show superdiffusive transport with little theoretical understanding. Although recent studies reported a surprising connection to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class in that case, this view was most recently questioned by discrepancies in full counting statistics. Here, by combining extensive numerical simulations of classical and quantum integrable isotropic spin chains with a framework developed by exact studies of the KPZ class, we characterize various two-point quantities that remain hitherto unexplored in spin chains, and find full agreement with KPZ scaling laws without adjustable parameters. This establishes the partial emergence of the KPZ class in integrable isotropic spin chains. Moreover, we reveal that the KPZ scaling laws are intact in the presence of an energy current, under the appropriate Galilean boost required by the propagation of spacetime correlation.</description>
