      <title>Improving AI weather prediction models using global mass and energy conservation schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather prediction (AIWP) models are powerful tools for medium-range forecasts but often lack physical consistency, leading to outputs that violate conservation laws. This study introduces a set of novel physics-based schemes designed to enforce the conservation of global dry air mass, moisture budget, and total atmospheric energy in AIWP models. The schemes are highly modular, allowing for seamless integration into a wide range of AI model architectures. Forecast experiments are conducted to demonstrate the benefit of conservation schemes using FuXi, an example AIWP model, modified and adapted for 1.0-degree grid spacing. Verification results show that the conservation schemes can guide the model in producing forecasts that obey conservation laws. The forecast skills of upper-air and surface variables are also improved, with longer forecast lead times receiving larger benefits. Notably, large performance gains are found in the total precipitation forecasts, owing to the reduction of drizzle bias. The proposed conservation schemes establish a foundation for implementing other physics-based schemes in the future. They also provide a new way to integrate atmospheric domain knowledge into the design and refinement of AIWP models.</description>

      <title>Diving Deep: Forecasting Sea Surface Temperatures and Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This overview paper details the findings from the Diving Deep: Forecasting Sea Surface Temperatures and Anomalies Challenge at the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD) 2024. The challenge focused on the data-driven predictability of global sea surface temperatures (SSTs), a key factor in climate forecasting, ecosystem management, fisheries management, and climate change monitoring. The challenge involved forecasting SST anomalies (SSTAs) three months in advance using historical data and included a special task of predicting SSTAs nine months ahead for the Baltic Sea. Participants utilized various machine learning approaches to tackle the task, leveraging data from ERA5. This paper discusses the methodologies employed, the results obtained, and the lessons learned, offering insights into the future of climate-related predictive modeling.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Super-Resolution Simulation Method of Three-Dimensional Street-Scale Atmospheric Flows for Real-Time Urban Micrometeorology Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A two-stage super-resolution simulation method is proposed for street-scale air temperature and wind velocity, which considerably reduces computation time while maintaining accuracy. The first stage employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to correct large-scale flows above buildings in the input low-resolution simulation results. The second stage uses another CNN to reconstruct small-scale flows between buildings from the output of the first stage, resulting in high-resolution inferences. The CNNs are trained using high-resolution simulation data for the second stage and their coarse-grained version for the first stage as the ground truth, where the high-resolution simulations are conducted independently of the low-resolution simulations used as input. This learning approach separates the spatial scales of inference in each stage. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated using micrometeorological simulations in an actual urban area around Tokyo Station in Japan. The super-resolution simulation successfully inferred high-resolution atmospheric flows, reducing errors by approximately 50% compared to the low-resolution simulations. Furthermore, the two-stage approach enabled localized high-resolution inferences, reducing GPU memory usage to as low as 12% during training. The total wall-clock time for 60-min predictions was reduced to 6.83 min, which was 3.32% of the high-resolution simulation time.</description>

      <title>Direct in-situ observations of wave-induced floe collisions in the deeper Marginal Ice Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ocean waves propagating through the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) and the pack ice are strongly attenuated. This attenuation is critical for protecting sea ice from energetic wave events that could otherwise lead to sea ice break-up and dislocation over large areas. Despite the importance of waves-in-ice attenuation, the exact physical mechanisms involved, and their relative importance, are still uncertain. Here we present direct in situ measurements of floe-floe interactions under the influence of waves, including collisions between adjacent floes. The collision events we report are aligned with the incoming wave direction, and phase-locked to the wave signal, which indicates that the individual collisions we detect are wave-induced. The observations indicate a possible correlation between sudden increases in wave activity and the frequency of floe-floe collisions</description>
