      <title>Subcycle phase matching effects in short attosecond pulse trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation (HHG) in gases driven by intense laser fields has become a cornerstone technique for producing attosecond pulses and probing ultrafast electronic motion in matter. By manipulating the microscopic and macroscopic dynamics involved in HHG, it is possible to tailor the temporal and spectral properties of attosecond light pulses. In this work, we control the carrier-to-envelope phase (CEP) of ultrashort femtosecond laser pulses to generate short trains of attosecond pulses that we characterize using two-color laser-assisted photoionization. We observe strong and unexpected variations of the photoelectron spectra as a function of the photoelectron kinetic energy as we change the CEP of the driving pulses. To interpret our results, we carried out HHG simulations that include microscopic and macroscopic effects. We find that the time-dependent phase-matching of the harmonics and the temporal chirp of the attosecond pulses play a major role in our observation, opening new perspectives for temporally resolving and controlling the HHG process.</description>

      <title>Rotational coherences in O$_2^+$ following strong-field ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the wave packet that remains bound in the ground and excited cationic states of oxygen after strong-field ionization by an intense 800-nm pulse. Much weaker probe pulses (800 or 264 nm) are used to dissociate these still-bound cations. The momentum distribution of O$^+$ is measured as a function of pump-probe delay and Fourier-transformed to obtain kinetic-energy-dependent and rotational-state-resolved quantum beat spectra. The sub-cm$^{-1}$ resolution of the Fourier transform allows unambiguous identification of the electronic, vibrational, and rotational states populated by the pump and then dissociated by the probe. Although strong-field ionization is expected to populate the lower-lying $X^2\Pi_g$ and $a^4\Pi_u$ states more effectively than the $b^4\Sigma^{-}_g$ state, a wave packet in the $X^2\Pi_g$ state is seen only with the 264-nm probe and only weak signatures of the $a^4\Pi_u$ states are found with either probe. The experiment confirms the role of the resonant coupling between the $b^4\Sigma^{-}_g$ and $a^4\Pi_u$ states by the 800 nm pulses [Xue \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. A 97, 043409 (2018)] and reveals the importance of rovibrational excitation in determining the momentum distribution of the O$^+$ fragments. The strong $X^2\Pi_g$ state contribution observed with the 264-nm probe also shows the importance of resonant coupling in the probe pulse. The sub-cm$^{-1}$ resolution also resolves spin-orbit splitting in both the $X^2\Pi_g$ and $a^4\Pi_u$ state wave packets.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the incident electron momentum for resonant few-photon Kapitza-Dirac scattering in bichromatic laser fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonrelativistic Kapitza-Dirac scattering of electrons from counterpropagating bichromatic laser waves is studied in the resonant Bragg regime, taking the electron spin into account. We show that the intrinsic field-induced detuning, which arises in the Rabi oscillation dynamics between initial and scattering state of the electron, can be compensated by a suitable adjustment of its incident momentum. Analytical formulas of the optimized electron momentum for spin-dependent three-photon and spin-independent four-photon Kapitza-Dirac scattering are obtained from simplified model systems in reduced dimensionality, which preserve the characteristic properties of the process.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing with ultracold simulators in lattice and ensemble systems: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensing of parameters is an important aspect in all disciplines, with applications ranging from fundamental science to medicine. Quantum sensing and metrology is an emerging field that lies at the cross-roads of quantum physics, quantum technology, and the discipline in which the parameter estimation is to be performed. While miniaturization of devices often requires quantum mechanics to be utilized for understanding and planning of a parameter estimation, quantum-enhanced sensing is also possible that uses paradigmatic quantum characteristics like quantum coherence and quantum entanglement to go beyond the so-called standard quantum limit. The current review hopes to bring together the concepts related to quantum sensing as realized in ensemble systems, like spin ensembles, light-matter systems, and Bose-Einstein condensates, and lattice systems, like those which can be modelled by the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum spin models.</description>

      <title>Tuning of electronic properties in highly lattice-mismatched epitaxial SmN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the electronic properties of epitaxial SmN thin films can be effectively tuned during growth by controlling the synthesis parameters. By carefully adjusting these parameters, we are able to drive SmN from an insulating ferromagnetic state to a ferromagnetic metallic state. However, no signatures of previously reported superconductivity were observed down to 0.35 K, even in the most conductive samples. We discuss possible scenarios for the absence of superconductivity in these films and examine implications for the underlying pairing mechanism in this material. These findings open a new pathway for the epitaxial engineering of multifunctional materials, enabling the monolithic integration of diverse electronic phases, such as ferromagnetism and metallicity, without the lattice mismatch and strain typically associated with heteroepitaxial growth of dissimilar materials.</description>

      <title>Fast Coherent Splitting of Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparation of non-trivial quantum states without introducing unwanted excitations or decoherence remains a central challenge in utilizing ultracold atomic systems for quantum simulation. We employ optimal control methods to realize fast, coherent splitting of a one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, achieving minimal classical excitations while preserving quantum correlations. Furthermore, we explore two-step protocols in which controlled classical motion is first induced and subsequently suppressed via tailored control sequences. Our experiments highlight the potential of optimal control for quantum state engineering and dynamical control in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Soliton and traveling wave solutions in coupled one-dimensional condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold condensates provide a unique platform for exploring soliton physics. Motivated by the recent experiments realizing the sine-Gordon model in a split one-dimensional (1D) BEC, we demonstrate that this system naturally supports various density and phase solitons. We explore the physics using the bosonization technique, in which the phase and density are conjugate pairs, and determine its effective Language equation and the associated equation of motion. We show that in the presence of asymmetry between the two condensates, new solutions beyond those in the sine-Gordon model emerge. We calculate the traveling wave solutions and soliton solutions in this model and determine their corresponding energy densities analytically. Finally, we discuss the relevance of these solutions to the experiments and discuss their observations. This theory does not rely on the mechanism of quasi-particle excitation, which yields the Lee-Huang-Yang correction in higher dimensions, and is thus much more suitable to describe the physics in 1D systems. Since the physical models have already been realized in experiments, this work opens a new frontier for the realization of various soliton and periodic solutions using two coupled condensates.</description>

      <title>Quantum control of a single $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ molecular ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Science is founded on the benchmarking of theoretical models against experimental measurements, with the challenge that for all but the simplest systems, the calculations required for high precision become extremely challenging. $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ is the simplest stable molecule, and its structure is calculable to high precision. However, studying $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ experimentally presents significant challenges: Standard control methods such as laser cooling are not applicable due to the long lifetimes of its rotational and vibrational states. Here we solve this issue by combining buffer gas cooling to quench the $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ rovibrational excitation with quantum logic operations between $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ and a co-trapped 'helper' ion to control the molecule's hyperfine structure. This enables us to perform pure quantum state preparation, coherent control, and non-destructive readout, which we use to demonstrate high-resolution microwave spectroscopy in the hyperfine structure of $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ with a precision of 2 Hz. Our results pave the way for high precision spectroscopy of $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ in both the microwave and optical domains. Due to the wide applicability of buffer gas cooling, our method provides a general tool for molecular ion species that are hard to control with quantum logic tools alone.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of the 3P0 clock state natural lifetime in 87Sr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical lattice clocks based on the narrow (5s2)1S0 - (5s5p)3P0 transition in neutral strontium (Sr) are among the most precise and accurate measurement devices in existence. Although this transition is completely forbidden by selection rules, state mixing from the hyperfine interaction in 87Sr provides a weakly allowed transition that can be coherently driven with practical clock laser intensities. While the coherent interrogation times of optical clocks are typically set by the linewidth of the probe laser, this limitation can be overcome in synchronous differential comparisons between ensembles. In such measurements the natural lifetime of the 1S0-3P0 clock transition becomes the fundamental limiting factor to the duration of a single run of the experiment. However, a direct measurement of the decay rate of the clock excited state is quite challenging due to the competing effects of other loss channels such as Raman scattering, inelastic collisions and atom-loss due to background gas. In this work, we monitor the decay of Sr atoms trapped in an optical lattice and initialized in the 3P0 state. By making measurements of high and low density ensembles of both 87Sr and 88Sr across varying lattice trap depths, we isolate radiative decay, which accounts for a significant fraction of the observed decays at low depths. We obtain a natural radiative decay lifetime of 167(+79/-40) s for the 3P0 clock state in 87Sr, a value that is consistent with previously reported measurements and theoretical predictions. We also introduce an additional measurement scheme that involves repeated measurements of the ground state population within a single experimental sequence, validating our model and the consistency of the measured rates.</description>

      <title>Orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transform minima in molecular ionization probabilities into maxima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the tunneling regime and at sufficiently low field amplitudes, the shape of orientation-dependent molecular ionization rate curves usually resembles the shape of the ionized orbital. As the ionizing field strength increases, the shape of the ionization rate can deviate from this pattern. The oft-cited explanation is that the increasing contribution of excited states relative to the ground state modifies the distribution. In this paper, we show that orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, which are independent of excited-state effects, can also significantly modify the angular dependence of the yields of widely studied molecules where excited state effects are negligible. For example, we find that in CH$_3$Br, the interplay between orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transforms a local minimum in the orientation-dependent ionization rate to a local maximum as the ionizing field strength increases. To simulate orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, we use the one-electron weak-field asymptotic theory including the first-order correction (OE-WFAT(1)) in the integral representation. Since OE-WFAT(1) incurs expensive computations when the number of orientation angles is large, we also reformulate the original OE-WFAT(1) algorithm into a partial-wave expansion form, which greatly enhances the efficiency of the method.</description>

      <title>Plane-selective manipulations of nuclear spin qubits in a three-dimensional optical tweezer array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the central challenges for a practical fault-tolerant quantum computer is scalability. A three-dimensional structure of optical tweezer arrays offers the potential for scaling up neutral atom processors. However, coherent local operations, essential for quantum error correction, have yet to be explored for this platform. Here, we demonstrate plane-by-plane initialization of nuclear spin qubits of ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$ atoms in a three-dimensional atom array and plane-dependent coherent temporal evolution of qubits, as well as plane-selective qubit manipulation by exploiting the plane-selective excitation of the atoms from the ${}^1S_0$ to the ${}^3P_2$ state. This plane-selective manipulation technique paves the way for quantum computing and quantum simulation in three-dimensional multilayer architectures.</description>
