      <title>The increasing fragmentation of global science limits the diffusion of ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global scientific landscape emerges from a complex interplay of collaboration and competition, where nations vie for dominance while simultaneously fostering the diffusion of knowledge on a global scale. This raises crucial questions: What underlying patterns govern international scientific recognition and influence? How does this structure impact knowledge dissemination? Traditional models view the global scientific ecosystem through a core-periphery lens, with Western nations dominating knowledge production. Here, we investigate the dynamics of international scientific recognition through the lens of national preferences, introducing a novel signed measure to characterize national citation preferences and enabling a network analysis of international scientific recognition. We find that scientific recognition is related to cultural and political factors in addition to economic strength and scientific quality. Our analysis challenges the conventional core-periphery narrative, uncovering instead several communities of international knowledge production that are rapidly fragmenting the scientific recognition ecosystem. Moreover, we provide compelling evidence that this network significantly constrains the diffusion of ideas across international borders. The resulting network framework for global scientific recognition sheds light on the barriers and opportunities for collaboration, innovation, and the equitable recognition of scientific advancements, with significant consequences for policymakers seeking to foster inclusive and impactful international scientific endeavors.</description>

      <title>Commute with Community: Enhancing Shared Travel through Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shared mobility redefines urban transportation, offering economic and environmental benefits by reducing pollution and urban congestion. However, in the post-pandemic era, the shared mobility sector is grappling with a crisis of trust, particularly concerning passenger hesistancy towards shared transportation options. To address these problems, in this paper we take social network into consideration and propose a novel carpooling matching framework based on graph neural network and reinforcement learning,increasing the carpooling rate to 48% and reducing the average delay time to 6.1 minutes and average detour distance to 2.8km. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative metric, termed 'tolerance' for mobility scheduling models to effectively quantify users' sensitivity to social distancing. We conduct a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate that our model offers a viable approach to amplify the benefits, delivering resilient strategies for the advancement and proliferation of shared mobility incentives.</description>

      <title>Economical-Epidemiological Analysis of the Coffee Trees Rust Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14515</link>

Abstract: Coffee leaf rust is a prevalent botanical disease that causes a worldwide reduction in coffee supply and its quality, leading to immense economic losses. While several pandemic intervention policies (PIPs) for tackling this rust pandemic are commercially available, they seem to provide only partial epidemiological relief for farmers. In this work, we develop a high-resolution economical-epidemiological model that captures the rust pandemic's spread in coffee tree farms and its associated economic impact. Through extensive simulations for the case of Colombia, a country that consists mostly of small-size coffee farms and is the second-largest coffee producer in the world, our results show that it is economically impractical to sustain any profit without directly tackling the rust pandemic. Furthermore, even in the hypothetical case where farmers perfectly know their farm's epidemiological state and the weather in advance, any rust pandemic-related efforts can only amount to a limited profit of roughly 4% on investment. In the more realistic case, any rust pandemic-related efforts are expected to result in economic losses, indicating that major disturbances in the coffee market are anticipated.</description>
