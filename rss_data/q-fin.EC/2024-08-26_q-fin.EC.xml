      <title>Education Opportunities for Rural Areas: Evidence from China's Higher Education Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the causal impact of education opportunities on rural areas by exploiting the higher education expansion (HEE) in China in 1999. By utilizing the detailed census data, the cohort-based difference-in-differences design indicates that the HEE increased college attendance and encouraged more people to attend senior high schools and that the effect is more significant in rural areas. Then we apply a similar approach to a novel panel data set of rural villages and households to examine the effect of education opportunities on rural areas. We find contrasting impacts on income and life quality between villages and households. Villages in provinces with higher HEE magnitudes underwent a drop in the average income and worse living facilities. On the contrary, households sending out migrants after the HEE experienced an increase in their per capita income. The phenomenon where villages experienced a ``brain drain'' and households with migrants gained after the HEE is explained by the fact that education could serve as a way to overcome the barrier of rural-urban migration. Our findings highlight the opposed impacts of education opportunities on rural development and household welfare in rural areas.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Effect of Market Risks on New Pension System and Government Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines how market risks impact the sustainability and performance of the New Pension System (NPS). NPS relies on defined contributions from both employees and employers to build a corpus during the employee's service period. Upon retirement, employees use the corpus fund to sustain their livelihood. A critical concern for individuals is whether the corpus will grow sufficiently to be sustainable or if it will deplete, leaving them financially vulnerable at an advanced age. We explore the impact of market risks on the performance of the corpus resulting from the NPS. To address this, we quantify market risks using Monte Carlo simulations with historical data to model their impact on NPS. We quantify the risk of pension corpus being insufficient and the cost to the Government to hedge the risk arising from guaranteeing the pension.</description>

      <title>Using satellite imagery to monitor remote rural economies at high frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite global progress in reducing extreme poverty, stubborn pockets remain, often in remote and fragile regions. A fundamental obstacle to further progress is that remoteness and fragility also constrain our ability to monitor economic conditions. Using satellite imagery, we develop a new approach to monitor economic activity at periodic markets, focal points for rural trade throughout history and much of the world today. We describe how to detect marketplaces without pre-existing maps and how to construct an up-to-weekly measure of their activity. We show that we successfully detect marketplaces and that activity correlates with other measures of economic activity, captures seasonal patterns, and responds to local weather and conflict. Drawing on high frequency, globally available imagery, our approach enables real-time monitoring of economic activity independent of ground conditions. .</description>

      <title>AI and Jobs: Has the Inflection Point Arrived? Evidence from an Online Labor Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has renewed the debate on the important issue of "technology displacement". While prior research has investigated the effect of information technology in general on human labor from a macro perspective, this paper complements the literature by examining the impact of LLMs on freelancers from a micro perspective. Specifically, we leverage the release of ChatGPT to investigate how AI influences freelancers across different online labor markets (OLMs). Employing the Difference-in-Differences method, we discovered two distinct scenarios following ChatGPT's release: 1) the displacement effect of LLMs, featuring reduced work volume and earnings, as is exemplified by the translation &amp; localization OLM; 2) the productivity effect of LLMs, featuring increased work volume and earnings, as is exemplified by the web development OLM. To shed light on the underlying mechanisms, we developed a Cournot-type competition model to highlight the existence of an inflection point for each occupation which separates the timeline of AI progress into a honeymoon phase and a substitution phase. Before AI performance crosses the inflection point, human labor benefits each time AI improves, resulting in the honeymoon phase. However, after AI performance crosses the inflection point, additional AI enhancement hurts human labor. Further analyzing the progression from ChatGPT 3.5 to 4.0, we found three effect scenarios (i.e., productivity to productivity, displacement to displacement, and productivity to displacement), consistent with the inflection point conjecture. Heterogeneous analyses reveal that U.S. web developers tend to benefit more from the release of ChatGPT compared to their counterparts in other regions, and somewhat surprisingly, experienced translators seem more likely to exit the market than less experienced translators after the release of ChatGPT.</description>
