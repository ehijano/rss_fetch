      <title>Power Domain Sparse Dimensional Constellation Multiple Access (PD-SDCMA): A Novel PD-NOMA for More Access Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of the 6G mobile communication network era, the existing non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) technology faces the challenge of high successive interference in multi-user scenarios, which limits its ability to support more user access. To address this, this paper proposes a novel power-domain sparse-dimensional constellation multiple-access scheme (PD-SDCMA). Through the signal space dimension selection strategy (S2D-strategy), this scheme sparsely superposes low-dimensional constellations onto high-dimensional signal spaces, and reduces the high-order interference caused by SC by taking advantage of the non-correlation between dimensions. Specifically, PD-SDCMA reduces the successive interference between users by sparsifying the dimension allocation of constellation superposition and designs a sparse superposition method based on the theory of vector space signal representation. Simulation results show that, under the AWGN channel, PD-SDCMA significantly outperforms the traditional PD-NOMA in terms of the number of supported users under QPSK and 16QAM modulations, and also has better BER performance. This paper provides a new solution for efficient spectrum utilization in future scenarios with large-scale user access.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Setting out a path to use quantum computing within a company is not as straightforward as the implementation of classical ICT-projects. The technology is fundamentally different and not mature yet, which makes the development and use uncertain, non-linear and more complex. Being also a potential disruptive technology makes it for a company important to be aware of the possible business value generated by using quantum computing and be prepared for taking this technology in production. In this article we present Quantum Organisational Readiness Levels to determine the degree of readiness for implementation of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>SmartEdge: Smart Healthcare End-to-End Integrated Edge and Cloud Computing System for Diabetes Prediction Enabled by Ensemble Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) revolutionizes smart city domains such as healthcare, transportation, industry, and education. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is gaining prominence, particularly in smart hospitals and Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM). The vast volume of data generated by IoMT devices should be analyzed in real-time for health surveillance, prognosis, and prediction of diseases. Current approaches relying on Cloud computing to provide the necessary computing and storage capabilities do not scale for these latency-sensitive applications. Edge computing emerges as a solution by bringing cloud services closer to IoMT devices. This paper introduces SmartEdge, an AI-powered smart healthcare end-to-end integrated edge and cloud computing system for diabetes prediction. This work addresses latency concerns and demonstrates the efficacy of edge resources in healthcare applications within an end-to-end system. The system leverages various risk factors for diabetes prediction. We propose an Edge and Cloud-enabled framework to deploy the proposed diabetes prediction models on various configurations using edge nodes and main cloud servers. Performance metrics are evaluated using, latency, accuracy, and response time. By using ensemble machine learning voting algorithms we can improve the prediction accuracy by 5% versus a single model prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) nodes and devices has seamlessly integrated technology into everyday life, amplifying the demand for optimized computing solutions. To meet the critical Quality of Service (QoS) requirements such as reduced latency, efficient bandwidth usage, swift reaction times, scalability, privacy, and security serverless edge computing has emerged as a transformative paradigm. This systematic literature review explores the current landscape of serverless edge computing, analyzing recent studies to uncover the present state of this technology. The review identifies the essential features of serverless edge computing, focusing on architectural designs, QoS metrics, implementation specifics, practical applications, and communication modalities central to this paradigm. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes existing research efforts, providing a comparative analysis based on these classifications. The paper concludes with an in depth discussion of open research challenges and highlights promising future directions that hold potential for advancing serverless edge computing research.</description>

      <title>Qubit-Efficient Quantum Annealing for Stochastic Unit Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Unit Commitment (SUC) has been proposed to manage the uncertainties driven by the integration of renewable energy sources. When solved by Benders Decomposition (BD), the master problem becomes a binary integer programming which is NP-hard and computationally demanding for classical computational methods. Quantum Annealing (QA), known for efficiently solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, presents a potential solution. However, existing quantum algorithms rely on slack variables to handle linear binary inequality constraints, leading to increased qubit consumption and reduced computational efficiency. To solve the problem, this paper introduces the Powell-Hestenes-Rockafellar Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier (PHR-ALM) method to eliminate the need for slack variables so that the qubit consumption becomes independent of the increasing number of bender's cuts. To further reduce the qubit overhead, quantum ADMM is applied to break large-scale SUC into smaller blocks and enables a sequential solution. Consequently, the Quantum-based PHR-ADMM (QPHR-ADMM) can significantly reduce qubit requirements and enhancing the applicability of QA in SUC problem. The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed QPHR-ADMM algorithm, indicating its superior time efficiency over classical approaches for large scale QUBO problems under the D-Wave QPU showcases.</description>

      <title>A Trust-Aware and Cost-Optimized Blockchain Oracle Selection Model with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of blockchain technology has driven the widespread application of decentralized applications (DApps) across various fields. However, DApps cannot directly access external data and rely on oracles to interact with off-chain data. As a bridge between blockchain and external data sources, oracles pose potential risks of malicious behavior, which may inject incorrect or harmful data, leading to trust and security issues. Additionally, with the surge in data requests, the disparity in oracle trustworthiness and costs has increased, making the dynamic selection of the most suitable oracle for each request a critical challenge. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Trust-Aware and Cost-Optimized Blockchain Oracle Selection Model with Deep Reinforcement Learning (TCO-DRL). The model incorporates a comprehensive trust management mechanism to evaluate oracle reputation from multiple dimensions and employs an improved sliding time window to monitor reputation changes in real time, enhancing resistance to malicious attacks. Moreover, TCO-DRL uses deep reinforcement learning algorithms to dynamically adapt to fluctuations in oracle reputation, ensuring the selection of high-reputation oracles while optimizing node selection, thereby reducing costs without compromising data quality. We implemented and validated TCO- DRL on Ethereum. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, TCO-DRL reduces the allocation rate to malicious oracles by more than 39.10% and saves over 12.00% in costs. Furthermore, simulated experiments on various malicious attacks further validate the robustness and effectiveness of TCO-DRL</description>

      <title>An Autonomous Network Orchestration Framework Integrating Large Language Models with Continual Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 6G networks aim to achieve global coverage, massive connectivity, and ultra-stringent requirements. Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGINs) and Semantic Communication (SemCom) are essential for realizing these goals, yet they introduce considerable complexity in resource orchestration. Drawing inspiration from research in robotics, a viable solution to manage this complexity is the application of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although the use of LLMs in network orchestration has recently gained attention, existing solutions have not sufficiently addressed LLM hallucinations or their adaptation to network dynamics. To address this gap, this paper proposes a framework called Autonomous Reinforcement Coordination (ARC) for a SemCom-enabled SAGIN. This framework employs an LLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generator (RAG) monitors services, users, and resources and processes the collected data, while a Hierarchical Action Planner (HAP) orchestrates resources. ARC decomposes orchestration into two tiers, utilizing LLMs for high-level planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents for low-level decision-making, in alignment with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) concept. The LLMs utilize Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for few-shot learning, empowered by contrastive learning, while the RL agents employ replay buffer management for continual learning, thereby achieving efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of ARC, along with a comprehensive discussion on potential future research directions to enhance and upgrade ARC.</description>

      <title>Imprinto: Enhancing Infrared Inkjet Watermarking for Human and Machine Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid paper interfaces leverage augmented reality to combine the desired tangibility of paper documents with the affordances of interactive digital media. Typically, virtual content can be embedded through direct links (e.g., QR codes); however, this impacts the aesthetics of the paper print and limits the available visual content space. To address this problem, we present Imprinto, an infrared inkjet watermarking technique that allows for invisible content embeddings only by using off-the-shelf IR inks and a camera. Imprinto was established through a psychophysical experiment, studying how much IR ink can be used while remaining invisible to users regardless of background color. We demonstrate that we can detect invisible IR content through our machine learning pipeline, and we developed an authoring tool that optimizes the amount of IR ink on the color regions of an input document for machine and human detectability. Finally, we demonstrate several applications, including augmenting paper documents and objects.</description>

      <title>LionHeart: A Layer-based Mapping Framework for Heterogeneous Systems with Analog In-Memory Computing Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When arranged in a crossbar configuration, resistive memory devices can be used to execute Matrix-Vector Multiplications (MVMs), the most dominant operation of many Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, in constant time complexity. Nonetheless, when performing computations in the analog domain, novel challenges are introduced in terms of arithmetic precision and stochasticity, due to non-ideal circuit and device behaviour. Moreover, these non-idealities have a temporal dimension, resulting in a degrading application accuracy over time. Facing these challenges, we propose a novel framework, named LionHeart, to obtain hybrid analog-digital mappings to execute Deep Learning (DL) inference workloads using heterogeneous accelerators. The accuracy-constrained mappings derived by LionHeart showcase, across different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and one transformer-based network, high accuracy and potential for speedup. The results of the full system simulations highlight run-time reductions and energy efficiency gains that exceed 6X, with a user-defined accuracy threshold for a fully digital floating point implementation. LionHeart is open-sourced here: https://github.com/IBM/lionheart.</description>

      <title>Transmissive Beyond Diagonal RIS-Mounted LEO Communication for NOMA IoT Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology has emerged as a transformative solution for enhancing satellite networks in next-generation wireless communication. The integration of RIS in satellite networks addresses critical challenges such as limited spectrum resources and high path loss, making it an ideal candidate for next-generation Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This paper provides a new framework based on transmissive beyond diagonal RIS (T-BD-RIS) mounted low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The NOMA power allocation at LEO and phase shift design at T-BD-RIS are optimized to maximize the system's spectral efficiency. The optimization problem is formulated as non-convex, which is first transformed using successive convex approximation and then divided into two problems. A closed-form solution is obtained for LEO satellite transmit power using KKT conditions, and a semi-definite relaxation approach is adopted for the T-BD-RIS phase shift design. Numerical results are obtained based on Monte Carlo simulations, which demonstrate the advantages of T-BD-RIS in satellite networks.</description>

      <title>EDA-Q: Electronic Design Automation for Superconducting Quantum Chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic Design Automation (EDA) plays a crucial role in classical chip design and significantly influences the development of quantum chip design. However, traditional EDA tools cannot be directly applied to quantum chip design due to vast differences compared to the classical realm. Several EDA products tailored for quantum chip design currently exist, yet they only cover partial stages of the quantum chip design process instead of offering a fully comprehensive solution. Additionally, they often encounter issues such as limited automation, steep learning curves, challenges in integrating with actual fabrication processes, and difficulties in expanding functionality. To address these issues, we developed a full-stack EDA tool specifically for quantum chip design, called EDA-Q. The design workflow incorporates functionalities present in existing quantum EDA tools while supplementing critical design stages such as device mapping and fabrication process mapping, which users expect. EDA-Q utilizes a unique architecture to achieve exceptional scalability and flexibility. The integrated design mode guarantees algorithm compatibility with different chip components, while employing a specialized interactive processing mode to offer users a straightforward and adaptable command interface. Application examples demonstrate that EDA-Q significantly reduces chip design cycles, enhances automation levels, and decreases the time required for manual intervention. Multiple rounds of testing on the designed chip have validated the effectiveness of EDA-Q in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Reconstruction from Power Side-Channel Attacks on Quantum Computer Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interest in quantum computing has grown rapidly in recent years, and with it grows the importance of securing quantum circuits. A novel type of threat to quantum circuits that dedicated attackers could launch are power trace attacks. To address this threat, this paper presents first formalization and demonstration of using power traces to unlock and steal quantum circuit secrets. With access to power traces, attackers can recover information about the control pulses sent to quantum computers. From the control pulses, the gate level description of the circuits, and eventually the secret algorithms can be reverse engineered. This work demonstrates how and what information could be recovered. This work uses algebraic reconstruction from power traces to realize two new types of single trace attacks: per-channel and total power attacks. The former attack relies on per-channel measurements to perform a brute-force attack to reconstruct the quantum circuits. The latter attack performs a single-trace attack using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming optimization. Through the use of algebraic reconstruction, this work demonstrates that quantum circuit secrets can be stolen with high accuracy. Evaluation on 32 real benchmark quantum circuits shows that our technique is highly effective at reconstructing quantum circuits. The findings not only show the veracity of the potential attacks, but also the need to develop new means to protect quantum circuits from power trace attacks. Throughout this work real control pulse information from real quantum computers is used to demonstrate potential attacks based on simulation of collection of power traces.</description>

      <title>QuCLEAR: Clifford Extraction and Absorption for Quantum Circuit Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing carries significant potential for addressing practical problems. However, currently available quantum devices suffer from noisy quantum gates, which degrade the fidelity of executed quantum circuits. Therefore, quantum circuit optimization is crucial for obtaining useful results. In this paper, we present QuCLEAR, a compilation framework designed to optimize quantum circuits. QuCLEAR significantly reduces both the two-qubit gate count and the circuit depth through two novel optimization steps. First, we introduce the concept of Clifford Extraction, which extracts Clifford subcircuits to the end of the circuit while optimizing the gates. Second, since Clifford circuits are classically simulatable, we propose Clifford Absorption, which efficiently processes the extracted Clifford subcircuits classically. We demonstrate our framework on quantum simulation circuits, which have wide-ranging applications in quantum chemistry simulation, many-body physics, and combinatorial optimization problems. Near-term algorithms such as VQE and QAOA also fall within this category. Experimental results across various benchmarks show that QuCLEAR achieves up to a $77.7\%$ reduction in CNOT gate count and up to an $84.1\%$ reduction in entangling depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Cache Coherence Over Disaggregated Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02088v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disaggregating memory from compute offers the opportunity to better utilize stranded memory in cloud data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute nodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes. However, the limited computing power on disaggregated memory servers makes traditional cache coherence protocols suboptimal, particularly in the case of stranded memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a Shared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence without imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. It aligns the state machine of the shared-exclusive latch protocol with the MSI protocol , thereby ensuring both atomicity of data access and cache coherence with sequential consistency. SELCC embeds cache-ownership metadata directly into the RDMA latch word, enabling efficient cache ownership management via RDMA atomic operations. SELCC can serve as an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory with APIs that resemble main-memory accesses. A concurrent B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms are realized using SELCC's abstraction layer. Experimental results show that SELCC significantly outperforms Remote-Procedure-Call-based protocols for cache coherence under limited remote computing power. Applications on SELCC achieve comparable or superior performance over disaggregated memory compared to competitors.</description>

      <title>Integration of Beyond Diagonal RIS and UAVs in 6G NTNs: Enhancing Aerial Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06073</link>

Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology shows great potential in sixth-generation (6G) terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) since it can effectively change wireless settings to improve connectivity. Extensive research has been conducted on traditional RIS systems with diagonal phase response matrices. The straightforward RIS architecture, while cost-effective, has restricted capabilities in manipulating the wireless channels. The beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) greatly improves control over the wireless environment by utilizing interconnected phase response elements. This work proposes the integration of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications and BD-RIS in 6G NTNs, which has the potential to further enhance wireless coverage and spectral efficiency. We begin with the preliminaries of UAV communications and then discuss the fundamentals of BD-RIS technology. Subsequently, we discuss the potential of BD-RIS and UAV communications integration. We then proposed a case study based on UAV-mounted transmissive BD-RIS communication. Finally, we highlight future research directions and conclude this work.</description>

      <title>Embracing Reconfigurable Antennas in the Tri-hybrid MIMO Architecture for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication has led to immense enhancements in data rates and efficient spectrum management. The evolution of MIMO, though, has been accompanied by increased hardware complexity and array sizes, causing the system power consumption to increase. Despite past advances in power-efficient hybrid architectures, new solutions are needed to enable extremely large-scale MIMO deployments for 6G and beyond. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture that integrates low-power reconfigurable antennas with both digital and analog precoding. This \emph{tri-hybrid} approach addresses key limitations in traditional and hybrid MIMO systems by improving power consumption and adds a new layer for signal processing. We provide an analysis of the proposed architecture and compare its performance with existing solutions, including fully-digital and hybrid MIMO systems. The results demonstrate significant improvements in energy efficiency, highlighting the potential of the tri-hybrid system to meet the growing demands of future wireless networks. We conclude the paper with a summary of design and implementation challenges, including the need for technological advancements in reconfigurable array hardware and tunable antenna parameters.</description>

      <title>Real-world Troublemaker: A 5G Cloud-controlled Track Testing Framework for Automated Driving Systems in Safety-critical Interaction Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Track testing plays a critical role in the safety evaluation of autonomous driving systems (ADS), as it provides a real-world interaction environment. However, the inflexibility in motion control of object targets and the absence of intelligent interactive testing methods often result in pre-fixed and limited testing scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 5G cloud-controlled track testing framework, Real-world Troublemaker. This framework overcomes the rigidity of traditional pre-programmed control by leveraging 5G cloud-controlled object targets integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT) and vehicle teleoperation technologies. Unlike conventional testing methods that rely on pre-set conditions, we propose a dynamic game strategy based on a quadratic risk interaction utility function, facilitating intelligent interactions with the vehicle under test (VUT) and creating a more realistic and dynamic interaction environment. The proposed framework has been successfully implemented at the Tongji University Intelligent Connected Vehicle Evaluation Base. Field test results demonstrate that Troublemaker can perform dynamic interactive testing of ADS accurately and effectively. Compared to traditional methods, Troublemaker improves scenario reproduction accuracy by 65.2\%, increases the diversity of interaction strategies by approximately 9.2 times, and enhances exposure frequency of safety-critical scenarios by 3.5 times in unprotected left-turn scenarios.</description>
