      <title>The existence and asymptotic stability of Plasma-Sheaths to the full Euler-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main concern of this paper is to study large-time behavior of the sheath to the full Euler-Poisson system. As is well known, the monotone stationary solution under the Bohm criterion can be referred to as the sheath which is formed by interactions of plasma with wall. So far, the existence and asymptotic stability of stationary solutions in one-dimensional half space to the full Euler-Poisson system have been proved in \cite{DYZ2021}. In the present paper, we extend the results in \cite{DYZ2021} to $N$-dimensional ($N$=1,2,3) half space. By assuming that the velocity of the positive ion satisfies the Bohm criterion at the far field, we establish the global unique existence and the large time asymptotic stability of the sheath in some weighted Sobolev spaces by weighted energy method. Moreover, the time-decay rates are also obtained. A key different point from \cite{DYZ2021} is to derive some boundary estimates on the derivative of the potential in the $x_1$-direction.</description>

      <title>Minimizing movements for forced anisotropic curvature flow of droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study forced anisotropic curvature flow of droplets on an inhomogeneous horizontal hyperplane. As in [Bellettini, Kholmatov: J. Math. Pures Appl. (2018)] we establish the existence of smooth flow, starting from a regular droplet and satisfying the prescribed anisotropic Young's law, and also the existence of a $1/2$-H\"older continuous in time minimizing movement solution starting from a set of finite perimeter. Furthermore, we investigate various properties of minimizing movements, including comparison principles, uniform boundedness and the consistency with the smooth flow.</description>

      <title>A priori $L^\infty-$bound for Ginzburg-Landau energy minimizers with divergence penalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider minimizers $u_\varepsilon$ of the Ginzburg-Landau energy with quadratic divergence penalization on a simply-connected two-dimensional domain $\Omega$. On the boundary, strong tangential anchoring is imposed. We prove that minimizers satisfy a $L^\infty$-bound uniform in $\varepsilon$ when $\Omega$ has $C^{2,1}-$boundary and that the Lipschitz constant blows up like $\varepsilon^{-1}$ when $\Omega$ has $C^{3,1}-$boundary. Our theorem extends to $W^{2,p}-$regularity result for our elliptic system with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the stationary Boltzmann equation with the incoming boundary condition for the hard potential cases. Assuming the smallness of the domain and a suitable normal curvature condition on the boundary, we find a suitable solution space which is a proper subset of the $W^{1,p}$ space.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a two phase flow model of biofilm spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free boundaries of biofilms advancing on surfaces evolve according to conservation laws coupled with systems of partial differential equations for velocities, pressures and chemicals affecting cell behavior. Thin film approximations lead to complicated quasi-stationary systems coupling stationary transport equations and compressible Stokes systems with convection-reaction-diffusion equations.We establish existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions of the different submodels involved and then obtain well posedness results for the full system. Our analysis relies on the construction of weak solutions for the steady transport equations under sign assumptions and the reformulation of the compressible Stokes problem as an elliptic system with enhanced regularity properties on the pressure. We need to consider velocity fields whose divergence and normal boundary components satisfy sign conditions, instead of vanishing as classical results require. Applications include the study of cells, biofilms and tissues, where one phase is a liquid solution, whereas the other one is assorted biomass.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rates For Tikhonov Regularization of Coefficient Identification Problems in Robin-Boundary Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the convergence rate for Tikhonov regularization of the problem of identifying the coefficient $a \in L^{\infty}(\Omega)$ in the Robin-boundary equation $-\mathrm{div}(a\nabla u)-bu=f,~ x \in \Omega \subset \mathbb R^M,~ M \geq 1$ and $u=0,~ x ~on~ \partial\Omega$, where $f(x)\in L^{\infty}(\Omega)$. Assume we only know the imprecise values of $u$ in the subset $\Omega_1 \subset \Omega$ given by $z^{\delta} \in {H}^1(\Omega_1)$, satisfies $\|u-z^{\delta}\|_{H^1(\Omega_1)}\leq \delta$. We assume $u$ satisfy the following boundary conditions on $\partial\Omega_1$: \begin{align*} \nabla u \cdot \vec{n}+\gamma u =0~on~\partial\Omega_1, \end{align*} where $\vec{n}$ is the normal vector of $\partial\Omega_1$ and $\gamma&gt;0$ is a constant. We regularize this problem by correspondingly minimizing the strictly convex functional:
  \begin{align*}
  \min \limits_{a \in \mathbb A} &amp;\frac12 \int_{\Omega_1} a | {\nabla(U(a)-z^\delta)}|^2 +\frac12\int_{\partial\Omega_1} a\gamma [U(a)-z^\delta]^2-\frac12 \int_{\Omega_1} b [U(a)-z^\delta]^2\\ &amp;+ \rho \| a-a^* \|^2_{L^2(\Omega)},
  \end{align*}
  where $U(a)$ is a map for $a$ to the solution of the Robin-boundary problem, $\rho &gt; 0$ is the regularization parameter and $a^*$ is a priori estimate of $a$. We prove that the functional attain a unique global minimizer on the admissible set. Further, we give very simple source condition without the smallness requirement on the source function which provide the convergence rate $O(\sqrt{\delta})$ for the regularized solution.</description>

      <title>Multifractal scaling and the Euler equations on R^3/Z^3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Euler equations describing the motion of an incompressible fluid on the cubic torus with real initial data. We construct solutions on the Fourier side which display a sudden loss of regularity within finite time even for highly regular initial data. Moreover, the solution may regain its initial regularity within finite time. This loss of regularity may coincide with the appearance of a certain type of multifractal scaling of the solutions.</description>

      <title>A Fischer type decomposition theorem from the apolar inner product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study initiated by H. S. Shapiro on Fischer decompositions of entire functions, showing that such decomposition exist in a weak sense (we do not prove uniqueness) under hypotheses regarding the order of the entire function $f$ to be expressed as $f= P\cdot q+r$, the polynomial $P$, and bounds on the apolar norm of homogeneous polynomials of degree $m$.
  These bounds, previously used by Khavinson and Shapiro, and by Ebenfelt and Shapiro, can be interpreted as a quantitative, asymptotic strengthening of Bombieri's inequality. In the special case where both the dimension of the space and the degree of $P$ are two, we characterize for which polynomials $P$ such bounds hold.</description>

      <title>Fischer decompositions for entire functions of sufficiently low order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of decompositions of the form $f=P\cdot q+r$ with $P_k^{\ast}\left( D\right) r=0 $, where $f$ is entire, $P$ a polynomial and $P^{\ast}_k$ the principal part of $P$ with its coefficients conjugated, was achieved in \cite{AlRe23} under certain restrictions on the order of $f$. Here we prove uniqueness, thereby obtaining Fischer decompositions, under conditions that sometimes match those required for existence, and sometimes are more restrictive, depending on the parameters involved.</description>

      <title>Stationary non-radial localized patterns in the planar Swift-Hohenberg PDE: constructive proofs of existence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a methodology for establishing constructive proofs of existence of smooth, stationary, non-radial localized patterns in the planar Swift-Hohenberg equation. Specifically, given an approximate solution $u_0$, we construct an approximate inverse for the linearization around $u_0$, enabling the development of a Newton-Kantorovich approach. Consequently, we derive a sufficient condition for the existence of a unique localized pattern in the vicinity of $u_0$. The verification of this condition is facilitated through a combination of analytic techniques and rigorous numerical computations. Moreover, an additional condition is derived, establishing that the localized pattern serves as the limit of a family of periodic solutions (in space) as the period tends to infinity. The integration of analytical tools and meticulous numerical analysis ensures a comprehensive validation of this condition. To illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology, we present computer-assisted proofs for the existence of three distinct unbounded branches of periodic solutions in the planar Swift-Hohenberg equation, all converging towards a localized planar pattern, whose existence is also proven constructively. All computer-assisted proofs, including the requisite codes, are accessible on GitHub at \cite{julia_cadiot}.</description>

      <title>New functional inequalities with applications to the arctan-fast diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a couple of new nonlinear functional inequalities of Sobolev type akin to the logarithmic Sobolev inequality. In particular, one of the inequalities reads $$ \int_{\mathbb{S}^1}\arctan\left(\frac{\partial_x u}{u}\right)\partial_xu \,dx\geq \arctan\left(\|u(t)\|_{\dot{W}^{1,1}(\mathbb{S}^1)}\right)\|u(t)\|_{\dot{W}^{1,1}(\mathbb{S}^1)}. $$ Then, these inequalities are used in the study of the nonlinear \emph{arctan}-fast diffusion equation $$ \partial_t u-\partial_x\arctan\left(\frac{\partial_x u}{u}\right)=0. $$ For this highly nonlinear PDE we establish a number of well-posedness results and qualitative properties.</description>

      <title>Which shapes can appear in a Curve Shortening Flow Singularity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study possible tangles that can occur in singularities of solutions to plane Curve Shortening Flow. We exhibit solutions in which more complicated tangles with more than one self-intersection disappear into a singular point. It seems that there are many examples of this kind and that a complete classification presents a problem similar to the problem of classifying all knots in $\mathbb R^3$. As a particular example, we introduce the so-called $n$-loop curves, which generalize Matt Grayson's Figure-Eight curve, and we conjecture a generalization of the Coiculescu-Schwarz asymptotic bow-tie result, namely, a vanishing $n$-loop, when rescaled anisotropically to fit a square bounding box, converges to a "squeezed bow-tie," i.e. the curve $\{(x, y) : |x|\leq 1, y=\pm x^{n-1}\}\cup\{(\pm 1, y) : |y|\leq 1\}$. As evidence in support of the conjecture, we provide a formal asymptotic analysis on one hand, and a numerical simulation for the cases $n=3$ and $n=4$ on the other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider deterministic Mean Field Games (MFG) in all Euclidean space with a cost functional continuous with respect to the distribution of the agents and attaining its minima in a compact set. We first show that the static MFG with such a cost has an equilibrium, and we build from it a solution of the ergodic MFG system of 1st order PDEs with the same cost. Next we address the long-time limit of the solutions to finite horizon MFG with cost functional satisfying various additional assumptions, but not the classical Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition. Instead we assume that the cost has the same set of minima for all measures describing the population. We prove the convergence of the distribution of the agents and of the value function to a solution of the ergodic MFG system as the horizon of the game tends to infinity, extending to this class of MFG some results of weak KAM theory.</description>

Our proofs rely on uniform estimates on growing domains, on the uniqueness and nondegeneracy of the ground state of the problem in RN , and on a new symmetry characterization of the eigenfunctions of the linearized eigenvalue problem in domains which are convex in the x1 - direction and symmetric with respect to a hyperplane reflection.</description>

Abstract: A filtration system, comprising a Biot poroelastic solid coupled to an incompressible Stokes free-flow, is considered in 3D. Across the flat 2D interface, the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman coupling conditions are taken. In the inertial, linear, and non-degenerate case, the hyperbolic-parabolic coupled problem is posed through a dynamics operator on an appropriate energy space, adapted from Stokes-Lam\'e coupled dynamics. A semigroup approach is utilized to circumvent issues associated to mismatched trace regularities at the interface. $C_0$-semigroup generation for the dynamics operator is obtained with a non-standard maximality argument. The latter employs a mixed-variational formulation in order to invoke the Babu\v{s}ka-Brezzi theorem. The Lumer-Philips theorem yields semigroup generation, and thereby, strong and generalized solutions are obtained. As the dynamics are linear, a standard argument by density obtains weak solutions; we extend this argument to the case where the Biot compressibility of constituents degenerates. Thus, for the inertial Biot-Stokes filtration, we provide a clear elucidation of strong and weak solutions, as well as their regularity through associated estimates.</description>

Abstract: We establish spectral, linear, and nonlinear stability of the vanishing and slow-moving travelling waves that arise as time asymptotic solutions to the Fisher-Stefan equation. Nonlinear stability is in terms of the limiting equations that the asymptotic waves satisfy.</description>

      <title>Existence of singular rotationally symmetric gradient Ricci solitons in higher dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.13685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using fixed point argument we give a proof for the existence of singular rotationally symmetric steady and expanding gradient Ricci solitons in higher dimensions with metric $g=\frac{da^2}{h(a^2)}+a^2g_{S^n}$ for some function $h$ where $g_{S^n}$ is the standard metric on the unit sphere $S^n$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for any $n\ge 2$. More precisely for any $\lambda\ge 0$ and $c_0&gt;0$, we prove that there exist infinitely many solutions $h\in C^2((0,\infty);\mathbb{R}^+)$ for the equation $2r^2h(r)h_{rr}(r)=(n-1)h(r)(h(r)-1)+rh_r(r)(rh_r(r)-\lambda r-(n-1))$, $h(r)&gt;0$, in $(0,\infty)$ satisfying $\underset{\substack{r\to 0}}{\lim}\,r^{\sqrt{n}-1}h(r)=c_0$ and prove the higher order asymptotic behaviour of the global singular solutions near the origin. We also find conditions for the existence of unique global singular solution of such equation in terms of its asymptotic behaviour near the origin.</description>

      <title>Post-Lie algebras of derivations and regularity structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a commutative algebra $A$, we exhibit a canonical structure of post-Lie algebra on the space $A\otimes Der(A)$ where $Der(A)$ is the space of derivations on $A$, in order to use the machinery given in [Guin &amp; Oudom 2008] and [Ebrahimi-Fard &amp; Lundervold &amp; Munthe-Kaas 2015] and to define a Hopf algebra structure on the associated enveloping algebra with a natural action on $A$. We apply these results to the setting of [Linares &amp; Otto &amp; Tempelmayr 2023], giving a simpler and more efficient construction of their action and extending the recent work [Bruned &amp; Katsetsiadis]. This approach gives an optimal setting to perform explicit computations in the associated structure group.</description>
