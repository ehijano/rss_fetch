      <title>Thermal Structure and Millimeter Emission of Protoplanetary Disk with embedded protoplanets from radiative transfer modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of protoplanets and circumplanetary disks provides a unique opportunity to characterize planet formation through observations. Massive protoplanets shape the physical and chemical structure of their host circumstellar disk by accretion, localized emission, and disk depletion. In this work, we study the thermal changes induced within the disk by protoplanet accretion and synthetic predictions through hydrodynamical simulations with post-processed radiative transfer with an emphasis on radio millimeter emission. We explored distinct growth conditions and varied both planetary accretion rates and the local dust-to-gas mass ratios for a protoplanet at 1200 K. The radiative transfer models show that beyond the effect of disk gaps, in most cases, the CPD and the planet's emission locally increase the disk temperature. Moreover, depending on the local dust-to-gas depletion and accretion rate, the CPD presence may have detectable signatures in millimeter emission. It also has the power to generate azimuthal asymmetries important for continuum subtraction. Thus, if other means of detection of protoplanets are proven, the lack of corresponding evidence at other wavelengths can set limits on their growth timescales through a combined analysis of the local dust-to-gas ratio and the accretion rate.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 Spectrophotometry Reveals Inefficient Day-to-Night Heat Redistribution in the Highly Irradiated Brown Dwarf SDSS 1557B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs in ultra-short period orbits around white dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to study the properties of tidally-locked, fast rotating (1-3 hr), and highly-irradiated atmospheres. Here, we present phase-resolved spectrophotometry of the white dwarf-brown dwarf (WD-BD) binary SDSS 1557, which is the fifth WD-BD binary in our six-object sample. Using the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 Near-infrared G141 instrument, the 1.1 to 1.7 $\mu$m phase curves show rotational modulations with semi-amplitudes of 10.5$\pm$0.1%. We observe a wavelength dependent amplitude, with longer wavelengths producing larger amplitudes, while no wavelength dependent phase shifts were identified. The phase-resolved extracted BD spectra exhibit steep slopes and are nearly featureless. A simple radiative energy redistribution atmospheric model recreates the hemisphere integrated brightness temperatures at three distinct phases and finds evidence for weak redistribution efficiency. Our model also predicts a higher inclination than previously published. We find that SDSS 1557B, the second most irradiated BD in our sample, is likely dominated by clouds on the night side, whereas the featureless day side spectrum is likely dominated by H$^-$ opacity and a temperature inversion, much like the other highly-irradiated BD EPIC2122B.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium tides and magnetic activity in stars with close-by massive planets. The intriguing case of WASP-18</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WASP-18 is an F6V star that hosts a planet with a mass of about 10 Jupiter masses and an orbital period of 0.94 days. In spite of its relatively fast rotation and young age, the star remains undetected in X-rays, thus implying a very low level of magnetic activity. To account for such unexpected properties, we propose a mechanism that modifies the internal stratification and the photospheric magnetic activity of a late-type main sequence star with a close-by massive planet based on the action of the equilibrium tide. We speculate that the horizontal flow produced by the equilibrium tide may interact with the convective plumes in the overshoot layer below the stellar outer convective envelope. The interaction is characterized by a very high Reynolds number leading to the development of turbulent boundary layers at the surface of such structures, whereas turbulent wakes extend over most of the overshoot layer that they straddle. We propose that such a tidally induced turbulence can lead to a reduction of the filling factor of the downdrafts in the overshoot layer. As a consequence, the absolute value of the sub-adiabatic gradient increases in that layer hindering the emergence of magnetic flux tubes responsible for the formation of photospheric starspots. We conjecture that this process is occurring in WASP-18, thus providing a possible mechanism to account for the very low level of magnetic activity observed for such a planet host.</description>

      <title>A generalizable method for estimating meteor shower false positives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The determination of meteor shower or parent body associations is inherently a statistical problem. Traditional methods, primarily the similarity discriminants, have limitations, particularly in handling the increasing volume and complexity of meteoroid orbit data.
  Aims. We aim to introduce a new, more statistically robust and generalizable method for estimating false positive detections in meteor shower identification, leveraging Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).
  Methods. Utilizing a dataset of 824 fireballs observed by the European Fireball Network, we apply a multivariate Gaussian kernel within KDE and z-score data normalization. Our method analyzes the parameter space of meteoroid orbits and geocentric impact characteristics, focusing on four different similarity discriminants: DSH, D', DH, and DN.
  Results. The KDE methodology consistently converges towards a true established shower-associated fireball rate within the EFN dataset of 18-25% for all criteria. This indicates that the approach provides a more statistically robust estimate of the shower-associated component.
  Conclusions. Our findings highlight the potential of KDE, combined with appropriate data normalization, in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of meteor shower analysis. This method addresses the existing challenges posed by traditional similarity discriminants and offers a versatile solution adaptable to varying datasets and parameters.</description>

      <title>Jupiter Co-Orbital Comet P/2023 V6 (PANSTARRS): Orbital History and Modern Activity State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the transient Jupiter co-orbital comet P/2019 LD2 (ATLAS) drew significant interest. Not only will LD2 transition between being a Centaur and a Jupiter Family Comet (JFC) in 2063, the first time this process can be observed as it happens, it is also very active for its large heliocentric distance. We present observations and orbital integrations of the newly discovered transient Jupiter co-orbital comet P/2023 V6 (PANSTARRS), the second such object known. Despite similar modern orbits, V6 is significantly (15 times) less active than LD2 and most JFCs as determined via Afrho measurements at the same heliocentric distance. We find V6 is co-orbital between 2020 and 2044, twice the duration of LD2, but it will not become a JFC soon. We interpret these differences in activity as evolutionary, with V6 having lost a significant fraction of its near-surface ice compared to LD2 by previously being warmer. While V6's pre-encounter orbit was somewhat warmer than LD2's, future thermal modeling will be needed to understand if this can explain their differences or if a more significant difference further into the past is required. This is more evidence that LD2 is a pristine and ice-rich object, and thus it may display very strong activity when it becomes a JFC. We sue the differences between V6 and LD2 to discuss the interpretation of cometary activity at large heliocentric distances as well as the small end of the crater record of the Galilean Satellites. Continuing observations of both objects are highly encouraged.</description>

      <title>Solar photospheric spectrum microvariability II. Observed relations to magnetic activity and radial-velocity modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searches for small exoplanets around solar-type stars are limited by stellar physical variability. While chromospheric variability is well studied, observing, modeling. and understanding the much smaller fluctuations in photospheric spectral line strengths, shapes, and shifts is challenging. Extreme precision radial-velocity spectrometers now enable extreme precision stellar spectroscopy and time series of the Sun seen as a star permit monitoring of its photospheric variability. Fluctuations in their line strengths may well correlate with radial-velocity excursions and identify observable proxies for their monitoring. From three years of HARPS-N observations of the Sun-as-a-star, one thousand low-noise spectra are selected, and line absorption measured in Fe I, Fe II, Mg I, Mn I, H-alpha, H-beta, H-gamma, Na I, and the G-band. Their variations and likely atmospheric origins are examined, also with respect to simultaneously measured chromospheric emission and apparent radial velocity. Systematic line-strength variability is seen, largely shadowing the solar-cycle evolution of Ca II H &amp; K emission, but with smaller amounts, typically on a sub-percent level. Among iron lines, greatest amplitudes are for Fe II in the blue, while the trends change sign among differently strong lines in the green Mg I triplet and between Balmer lines. Variations in the G-band core are greater than of the full G-band, in line with theoretical predictions. No variation is detected in the semi-forbidden Mg I 457.1 nm. Hyperfine split Mn I behaves largely similar to Fe I. For lines at longer wavelengths, telluric absorption limits the achievable precision. Microvariability in the solar photospheric spectrum thus displays systematic signatures among various features. These measure something different than the classical Ca II H &amp; K index while still reflecting a strong influence from magnetic regions.</description>

      <title>The AstraLux-TESS high-spatial resolution imaging survey. Search for stellar companions of 215 planet candidates from TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chance-aligned sources or blended companions can cause false positives in planetary transit detections or simply bias the determination of the candidate properties. In the era of high-precision space-based photometers, the need for high-spatial resolution images has demonstrated to be critical for validating and confirming transit signals. This already applied to the Kepler mission, it is now applicable to the TESS survey and will be critical for PLATO. We present the results of the AstraLux-TESS survey, a catalog of high-spatial resolution images obtained with the AstraLux instrument (Calar Alto) in the context of the TESS Follow-up Observing Program. We use the lucky-imaging technique to obtain high-spatial resolution images from planet candidate hosts included mostly in two relevant regimes: exoplanet candidates belonging to the level-one requirement of the TESS mission (planets with radii $R&lt;4~R_{\oplus}$), and candidates around intermediate-mass stars. Among the 185 planet host candidate stars observed, we found 13 (7%) to be accompanied by additional sources within 2.2 arcsec separation. Among them, six are not associated to sources in the Gaia DR3 catalog, thus contaminating the TESS light curve. We provide upper limits and probabilities to the possible existence of field contaminants through the sensitivity limits of our images. Among the isolated hosts, we can discard hazardous companions (bright enough to mimic a planetary transit signals) for all their planets. The results from this catalog are key for the statistical validation of small planets (prime targets of the TESS mission) and planets around intermediate-mass stars in the main-sequence. These two populations of planets are hard to confirm with the radial velocity technique. Our results also demonstrate the importance of this type of follow-up observations for future transit missions like PLATO, even in the Gaia era.</description>

      <title>Relative Occurrence Rate Between Hot and Cold Jupiters as an Indicator to Probe Planet Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a second-order statistic parameter $\varepsilon$, the relative occurrence rate between hot and cold Jupiters ($\varepsilon=\eta_{\rm HJ}/\eta_{\rm CJ}$), to probe the migration of gas giants. Since the planet occurrence rate is the combined outcome of the formation and migration processes, a joint analysis of hot and cold Jupiter frequency may shed light on the dynamical evolution of giant planet systems. We first investigate the behavior of $\varepsilon$ as the stellar mass changes observationally. Based on the occurrence rate measurements of hot Jupiters ($\eta_{\rm HJ}$) from the TESS survey and cold Jupiters ($\eta_{\rm CJ}$) from the CLS survey, we find a tentative trend (97% confidence) that $\varepsilon$ drops when the stellar mass rises from $0.8$ to $1.4\ M_\odot$, which can be explained by different giant planet growth and disk migration timescales around different stars. We carry out planetesimal and pebble accretion simulations, both of which could reproduce the results of $\eta_{\rm HJ}$, $\eta_{\rm CJ}$ and $\varepsilon$. Our findings indicate that the classical core accretion + disk migration model can explain the observed decreasing trend of $\varepsilon$. We propose two ways to increase the significance of the trend and verify the anti-correlation. Future works are required to better constrain $\varepsilon$, especially for M dwarfs and for more massive stars.</description>

Abstract: After decades of relative neglect, interest in Venus surges anew in the planetary science community and the public. New missions are planned and selected, and will pave the way to the decade of Venus, as new observations allow us to uncover some of the many mysteries our closest Solar System neighbor still harbors. Building on the legacy of past works, here, we discuss the state of our understanding of Venus, from both observation and modeling. We describe each of the envelopes of the planet, from its atmosphere to its interior with an eye for the most recent advances and current topics of interest. We then briefly discuss coupled modelling efforts to better constrain the evolution of the planet. Finally, we describe how the upcoming missions and concepts will further lift the veil on Venus' secrets.</description>

      <title>The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) Science White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) is proposed as a new facility dedicated to the efficient delivery of spectroscopic surveys. This white paper summarises the initial concept as well as the corresponding science cases. WST will feature simultaneous operation of a large field-of-view (3 sq. degree), a high multiplex (20,000) multi-object spectrograph (MOS) and a giant 3x3 sq. arcmin integral field spectrograph (IFS). In scientific capability these requirements place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work synergistically with future ground and space-based facilities. This white paper shows that WST can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; origin of stars and planets; time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. WST's uniquely rich dataset will deliver unforeseen discoveries in many of these areas. The WST Science Team (already including more than 500 scientists worldwide) is open to the all astronomical community.
