      <title>Decoding Dmrt1: Insights into vertebrate sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation</title>

Abstract: Dmrt1 is pivotal in testis formation and function by interacting with genes crucial for Sertoli cell differentiation, such as Sox9. It represses female-determining pathways and ovarian formation by silencing Foxl2. Across 127 vertebrate species, Dmrt1 exhibits sexually dimorphic expression, prior to and during gonadal sex differentiation and in adult testes, implicating its role in master regulation of sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation. Dmrt1 emerges as a master sex-determining gene in one fish, frog, chicken and reptile. Recent studies suggest epigenetic regulation of Dmrt1 in its promoter methylation and transposable element insertion introducing epigenetic modification to cis-regulatory elements, alongside non-coding RNA involvement, in a wide spectrum of sex-determining mechanisms. Additionally, alternative splicing of Dmrt1 was found in all vertebrate groups except amphibians. Dmrt1 has evolved many lineage-specific isoforms (ranging from 2 to 10) but has no sex-specific splicing variants in any taxa, which is in sharp contrast to the constitutional sex-specific splicing of Dsx in insects. Future research should focus on understanding the molecular basis of environmental sex determination from a broader taxon, and the molecular basis of epigenetic regulation. It is also essential to understand why and how multiple alternative splicing variants of Dmrt1 evolve and the specific roles each isoform plays in sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation, as well as the significant differences in the molecular mechanisms and functions of alternative splicing between Dmrt1 in vertebrates and sex-specific splicing of Dsx in insects. Understanding the differences could provide deeper insights into the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms between vertebrates and insects.</description>
