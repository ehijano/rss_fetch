      <title>Diffusion, Long-Time Tails, and Localization in Classical and Quantum Lorentz Models: A Unifying Hydrodynamic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-time tails, or algebraic decay of time-correlation functions, have long been known to exist both in many-body systems and in models of non-interacting particles in the presence of quenched disorder that are often referred to as Lorentz models. In the latter, they have been studied extensively by a wide variety of methods, the best known example being what is known as weak-localization effects in disordered systems of non-interacting electrons. This paper provides a unifying, and very simple, approach to all of these effects. We show that simple modifications of the diffusion equation due to either a random diffusion coefficient, or a random scattering potential, accounts for both the decay exponents and the prefactors of the leading long-time tails in the velocity autocorrelation functions of both classical and quantum Lorentz models.</description>

      <title>Generalized hetero-associative neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While auto-associative neural networks (e.g., the Hopfield model implementing the standard Hebbian prescription for learning) play as the reference setting for pattern recognition and associative memory in statistical mechanics, hetero-associative extensions (despite much less investigated) display richer emergent computational skills. Here we study the simplest generalization of the Kosko's Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM), namely a Three-directional Associative Memory (TAM), that is a tripartite neural network equipped with generalized Hebbian weights. We study its information processing capabilities analytically (via statistical mechanics and signal-to-noise techniques) and computationally (via Monte Carlo simulations). Confined to the replica symmetric description, we provide phase diagrams for this network in the space of the control parameters, highlighting the existence of a region where the machine can successful perform recognition as well as other tasks. For instance, it can perform pattern disentanglement, namely when inputted with a mixture of patterns, the network is able to return the original patterns, namely to disentangle the signal's components. Further, they can also perform retrieval of (Markovian) sequences of patterns and they can also disentangle mixtures of periodic patterns: should these mixtures be sequences that combine patterns alternating at different frequencies, these hetero-associative networks can perform generalized frequency modulation by using the slowly variable sequence of patterns as the base-band signal and the fast one as the information carrier.</description>

      <title>Rapid Assessment of Stable Crystal Structures in Single Phase High Entropy Alloys Via Graph Neural Network Based Surrogate Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an effort to develop a rapid, reliable, and cost-effective method for predicting the structure of single-phase high entropy alloys, a Graph Neural Network (ALIGNN-FF) based approach was introduced. This method was successfully tested on 132 different high entropy alloys, and the results were analyzed and compared with density functional theory and valence electron concentration calculations. Additionally, the effects of various factors, including lattice parameters and the number of supercells with unique atomic configurations, on the prediction accuracy were investigated. The ALIGNN-FF based approach was subsequently used to predict the structure of a novel cobalt-free 3d high entropy alloy, and the result was experimentally verified.</description>

      <title>Ratio Divergence Learning Using Target Energy in Restricted Boltzmann Machines: Beyond Kullback--Leibler Divergence Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose ratio divergence (RD) learning for discrete energy-based models, a method that utilizes both training data and a tractable target energy function. We apply RD learning to restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are a minimal model that satisfies the universal approximation theorem for discrete distributions. RD learning combines the strength of both forward and reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) learning, effectively addressing the "notorious" issues of underfitting with the forward KLD and mode-collapse with the reverse KLD. Since the summation of forward and reverse KLD seems to be sufficient to combine the strength of both approaches, we include this learning method as a direct baseline in numerical experiments to evaluate its effectiveness. Numerical experiments demonstrate that RD learning significantly outperforms other learning methods in terms of energy function fitting, mode-covering, and learning stability across various discrete energy-based models. Moreover, the performance gaps between RD learning and the other learning methods become more pronounced as the dimensions of target models increase.</description>

      <title>Dataset-Free Weight-Initialization on Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In feed-forward neural networks, dataset-free weight-initialization method such as LeCun, Xavier (or Glorot), and He initializations have been developed. These methods randomly determine the initial values of weight parameters based on specific distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions) without using training datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a dataset-free weight-initialization method is yet to be developed for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are probabilistic neural networks consisting of two layers, In this study, we derive a dataset-free weight-initialization method for Bernoulli--Bernoulli RBMs based on a statistical mechanical analysis. In the proposed weight-initialization method, the weight parameters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is optimized based on our hypothesis which is that a standard deviation providing a larger layer correlation (LC) between the two layers improves the learning efficiency. The expression of the LC is derived based on a statistical mechanical analysis. The optimal value of the standard deviation corresponds to the maximum point of the LC. The proposed weight-initialization method is identical to Xavier initialization in a specific case (i.e., in the case the sizes of the two layers are the same, the random variables of the layers are $\{-1,1\}$-binary, and all bias parameters are zero).</description>

      <title>Mechanical hysterons with tunable interactions of general sign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hysterons are the basic units of hysteresis that underlie many of the complex behaviors of disordered matter. Recent work has sought to develop designs for mechanical hysterons, both to better understand their interactions and to create materials that respond to their mechanical environment in novel ways. Elastic structures including slender beams, creased sheets, and shells offer the requisite bistability for artificial hysterons, but producing and controlling interactions between such structures has proven challenging. Here we report a mechanical hysteron composed of rigid bars and linear springs, which has controllable properties and tunable interactions of general sign. We derive an approximate mapping from the system parameters to the hysteron properties, and we show how collective behaviors of multiple hysterons can be targeted by adjusting geometric parameters on the fly. Our results provide a basic step towards hysteron-based materials that can sense, compute, and respond to their mechanical environment.</description>

      <title>Geometric control and memory in networks of bistable elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sequential response of driven frustrated media encodes memory effects and hidden computational capabilities. While abstract hysteron models can capture these effects, they require phenomenologically introduced interactions, limiting their predictive power. Here we introduce networks of bistable elements - physical hysterons - whose interactions are controlled by the networks' geometry. These networks realize a wide range of previously unobserved exotic pathways, including those that surpass current hysteron models. Our work paves the way for advanced microscopic models of memory and the rational design of (meta)materials with targeted pathways and capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic driving of systems of particles can create crystalline structures in time. Such systems can be used to study solid-state physics phenomena in the time domain. In addition, it is possible to engineer the wave-number band structure of optical systems and to realize photonic time crystals by periodic temporal modulation of the material properties of the electromagnetic wave propagation medium. We introduce here a versatile averaged-permittivity approach which empowers emulating various condensed matter phases in the time dimension in a traveling wave resonator. This is achieved by utilizing temporal modulation of permittivity within a small segment of the resonator and the spatial shape of the segment. The required frequency and depth of the modulation are experimentally achievable, opening a pathway for research into the practical realisation of crystalline structures in time utilising microwave and optical systems.</description>

      <title>Probing marginal stability in the spherical $p=2$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the marginally stable nature of the low-temperature trivial spin glass phase in the spherical $p=2$ spin glass, by perturbing the system with three different kinds of non-linear interactions. In particular, we compare the effect of three additional dense four-body interactions: ferromagnetic couplings, purely disordered couplings and couplings with competing disordered and ferromagnetic interactions. Our study, characterized by the effort to present in a clear and pedagogical way the derivation of all the results, shows that the marginal stability property of the spherical spin glass depends in fact on which kind of perturbation is applied to the system: in general, a certain degree of frustration is needed also in the additional terms in order to induce a transition from a trivial to a non-trivial spin-glass phase. On the contrary, the addition of generic non-frustrated interactions does not destabilize the trivial spin-glass phase.</description>

      <title>Revisiting multiple trapping and release electronic transport in amorphous semiconductors exemplified by a-Si:H</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple trapping and release (MTR) is a typical transport mechanism of electron carriers in amorphous and other disordered semiconductors where localized states are significant. Quantitative description of MTR, however, has been based on an "abrupt" mobility edge model, which relies on two underpinning simplifications: (i) states above the conduction band mobility edge are extended and any of them is omnipresent in space, whereas states below the mobility edge are localized and they exist in space as pointlike sites; (ii) all states are evenly distributed in space, and the local density of states (DOS) distribution is spatially invariant. The prequel to this paper [Y. Luo and A. J. Flewitt, Phys. Rev. B 109, 104203 (2024)] demonstrates that neither of these simplifications is valid. Hence, this paper reinvestigates MTR transport. Through a probabilistic analysis of the microscopic charge transport details, this paper rigorously demonstrates that, first, the experimentally measured mobility edge is an effective quantity which is different from the actual critical energy that demarcates extended states and localized states of an amorphous semiconductor. Second, the experimentally derived extended-state mobility is also an effective quantity which turns out to be higher than the actual mobility of free electrons in the material. The hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) discussed in the prequel, being an intensively studied sample in the past, is used as an example to concretize the analysis.</description>

      <title>Multifractality and Hyperuniformity in Quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard Models with and without Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clarifying similarities and differences in physical properties between crystalline and quasicrystalline systems is one of central issues in studying quasicrystals. To contribute to this, we apply multifractal and hyperuniform analyses to nonuniform spatial patterns in the Bose-Hubbard model on the Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings. Based on the mean-field approximation, we obtain real-space distributions of local superfluid amplitude and bosonic condensate. In both Mott insulating and superfluid phases, the distributions are hyperuniform. Analyzing the order metric that quantifies the complexity of nonuniform spatial patterns, we find that both quasicrystals show a significant increase of the order metric at a phase boundary between the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, in stark contrast to the case of a periodic square lattice. Our results suggest that hyperuniformity is a useful concept to differentiate between crystalline and quasicrystalline bosonic systems. The order metric clarifies if the distribution of a physical quantity reflects the point distribution or not, and quantifies how complex the distribution is in comparison with the point distribution. Moreover, we introduce on-site random potentials into these quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard models, leading to a Bose glass phase. Contrary to the Mott insulating and superfluid phases, we find that the Bose glass phase is multifractal. The same multifractality appears on a Bose glass phase in the periodic square lattice. Therefore, multifractality is common in a Bose glass phase irrespective of the periodicity of systems.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodicity protects quantized transport in disordered systems without gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The robustness of topological properties, such as quantized currents, generally depends on the existence of gaps surrounding the relevant energy levels or on symmetry-forbidden transitions. Here, we observe quantized currents that survive the addition of bounded local disorder beyond the closing of the relevant instantaneous energy gaps in a driven Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper chain, a prototypical model of quasiperiodic systems. We explain the robustness using a local picture in \textit{configuration-space} based on Landau-Zener transitions, which rests on the Anderson localisation of the eigenstates. Moreover, we propose a protocol, directly realizable in for instance cold atoms or photonic experiments, which leverages this stability to prepare topological many-body states with high Chern numbers and opens new experimental avenues for the study of both the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects.</description>

      <title>Operator space fragmentation in perturbed Floquet-Clifford circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet quantum circuits are able to realise a wide range of non-equilibrium quantum states, exhibiting quantum chaos, topological order and localisation. In this work, we investigate the stability of operator localisation and emergence of chaos in random Floquet-Clifford circuits subjected to unitary perturbations which drive them away from the Clifford limit. We construct a nearest-neighbour Clifford circuit with a brickwork pattern and study the effect of including disordered non-Clifford gates. The perturbations are uniformly sampled from single-qubit unitaries with probability $p$ on each qubit. We show that the interacting model exhibits strong localisation of operators for $0 \le p &lt; 1$ that is characterised by the fragmentation of operator space into disjoint sectors due to the appearance of wall configurations. Such walls give rise to emergent local integrals of motion for the circuit that we construct exactly. We analytically establish the stability of localisation against generic perturbations and calculate the average length of operator spreading tunable by $p$. Although our circuit is not separable across any bi-partition, we further show that the operator localisation leads to an entanglement bottleneck, where initially unentangled states remain weakly entangled across typical fragment boundaries. Finally, we study the spectral form factor (SFF) to characterise the chaotic properties of the operator fragments and spectral fluctuations as a probe of non-ergodicity. In the $p = 1$ model, the emergence of a fragmentation time scale is found before random matrix theory sets in after which the SFF can be approximated by that of the circular unitary ensemble. Our work provides an explicit description of quantum phases in operator dynamics and circuit ergodicity which can be realised on current NISQ devices.</description>
