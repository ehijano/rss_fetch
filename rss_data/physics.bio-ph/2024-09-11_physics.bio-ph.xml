      <title>Geometric Effects in Large Scale Intracellular Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work probes the role of cell geometry in orienting self-organized fluid flows in the late stage Drosophila oocyte. Recent theoretical work has shown that a model, which relies only on hydrodynamic interactions of flexible, cortically anchored microtubules (MTs) and the mechanical loads from molecular motors moving upon them, is sufficient to generate observed flows. While the emergence of flows has been studied in spheres, oocytes change shape during streaming and it was unclear how robust these flows are to the geometry of the cell. Here we use biophysical theory and computational analysis to investigate the role of geometry and find that the axis of rotation is set by the shape of the domain and that the flow is robust to biologically relevant perturbations of the domain shape. Using live imaging and 3D flow reconstruction, we test the predictions of the theory/simulation, finding consistency between the model and live experiments, further demonstrating a geometric dependence on flow direction in late-stage Drosophila oocytes.</description>

      <title>Spatial structure facilitates evolutionary rescue by cost-free drug resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacterial populations often have complex spatial structures, which can impact their evolution. Here, we study how spatial structure affects the evolution of antibiotic resistance in a bacterial population. We consider a minimal model of spatially structured populations where all demes (i.e., subpopulations) are identical and connected to each other by identical migration rates. We show that spatial structure can facilitate the survival of a bacterial population to antibiotic treatment, starting from a sensitive inoculum. Indeed, the bacterial population can be rescued if antibiotic resistant mutants appear and are present when drug is added, and spatial structure can impact the fate of these mutants and the probability that they are present. Specifically, if the mutation that provides resistance is neutral or effectively neutral, its probability of fixation is increased in smaller populations. This promotes local fixation of resistant mutants in the structured population, which facilitates evolutionary rescue by cost-free drug resistance. Once the population is rescued by resistance, migrations allow resistant mutants to spread in all demes. Our main results extend to the case where there are resistant mutants in the inoculum, and to more complex spatial structures. They also extend to resistant mutants that carry a fitness cost, although the timescales involved are longer.</description>

      <title>Signatures of criticality in turning avalanches of schooling fish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moving animal groups transmit information through propagating waves or behavioral cascades, exhibiting characteristics akin to systems near a critical point from statistical physics. Using data from freely swimming schooling fish in an experimental tank, we investigate spontaneous behavioral cascades involving turning avalanches, where large directional shifts propagate across the group. We analyze several avalanche metrics and provide a detailed picture of the dynamics associated to turning avalanches, employing tools from avalanche behavior in condensed matter physics and seismology. Our results identify power-law distributions and robust scale-free behaviour through data collapses and scaling relationships, confirming a necessary condition for criticality in fish schools. We explore the biological function of turning avalanches and link them to collective decision-making processes in selecting a new movement direction for the school. We report relevant boundary effects arising from interactions with the tank walls and influential roles of boundary individuals. Finally, spatial and temporal correlations in avalanches are explored using the concept of aftershocks from seismology, revealing clustering of avalanche events below a designated timescale and an Omori law with a faster decay rate than observed in earthquakes.</description>

      <title>Settling aerodynamics is a driver of symmetry in deciduous tree leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leaves shed by deciduous trees contain 40\% of the annually sequestered carbon, and include nutrients vital to the expansion and health of forest ecosystems. To achieve this, leaves must fall quickly to land near the parent tree -- otherwise, they are lost to the wind, like pollen or gliding seeds. However, the link between leaf shape and sedimentation speed remains unclear. To gauge the relative performance of extant leaves, we developed an automated sedimentation apparatus (ASAP) capable of performing $\sim100$ free fall experiments per day on biomimetic paper leaves. The majority of 25 representative leaves settle at rates similar to our control (a circular disc). Strikingly, the Arabidopsid mutant asymmetric leaves1 (as1) fell 15\% slower than the wild type. Applying the as1-digital mutation to deciduous tree leaves revealed a similar speed reduction. Data correlating shape and settling across a broad range of natural, mutated, and artificial leaves support thefast-leaf-hypothesis: Deciduous leaves are symmetric and relatively unlobed in part because this maximizes their settling speed and concomitant nutrient retention.</description>
