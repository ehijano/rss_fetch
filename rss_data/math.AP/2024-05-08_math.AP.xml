      <title>Boundedness in a chemotaxis system with weakly singular sensitivity in dimension two with arbitrary sub-quadratic degradation sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the global existence and boundedness of solutions to a chemotaxis system with weakly singular sensitivity and sub-logistic sources in a two dimensional domain. X. Zhao (Nonlinearity; 2023; 36; 3909-3938 ) showed that the logistic degradation, $-\mu u^2$, can prevent blow-up under the largeness assumption on $\mu$. In this paper, we improve the result by replacing the quadratic degradation by sub-logistic one, $-\frac{\mu u^2}{\ln^\beta(u+e)}$ with $\beta \in (0,1)$, and removing the largeness assumption on $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Singularity Structures of Linear Inviscid Damping in a Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies singularity structures of the linear inviscid damping of two-dimensional Euler equations in a finite periodic channel. We introduce a recursive definition of singularity structures which characterize the singularities of the spectrum density function from different sources: the free part and the boundary part of the Green function. As an application, we demonstrate that the stream function exhibits smoothness away from the channel's boundary, yet it presents singularities in close proximity to the boundary. The singularities arise due to the interaction of boundary and interior singularities of the spectrum density function. We also show that the behavior of the initial data and background flow have an impact on the regularity of different components of the stream function.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rate of the Hypersonic Similarity for Two-Dimensional Steady Potential Flows with Large Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the optimal convergence rate of the hypersonic similarity for two-dimensional steady potential flows with {\it large data} past over a straight wedge in the $BV\cap L^1$ framework, provided that the total variation of the large data multiplied by $\gamma-1+\frac{a_{\infty}^2}{M_\infty^2}$ is uniformly bounded with respect to the adiabatic exponent $\gamma&gt;1$, the Mach number $M_\infty$ of the incoming steady flow, and the hypersonic similarity parameter $a_\infty$. Our main approach in this paper is first to establish the Standard Riemann Semigroup of the initial-boundary value problem for the isothermal hypersonic small disturbance equations with large data and then to compare the Riemann solutions between two systems with boundary locally case by case. Based on them, we derive the global $L^1$--estimate between the two solutions by employing the Standard Riemann Semigroup and the local $L^1$--estimates. We further construct an example to show that the convergence rate is optimal.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the rigidity property of a wave component coupled in a wave-Klein-Gordon system. We prove that when the radiation field of the wave component vanishes at the null infinity, the initial data of this component also vanish, therefor there is no wave in the whole spacetime</description>

      <title>Mack modes in supersonic boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the transition mechanism of boundary layer flows is of great significance in physics and engineering, especially due to the current development of supersonic and hypersonic aircraft. In this paper, we construct multiple unstable acoustic modes so-called Mack modes, which play a crucial role during the early stage of transition in the supersonic boundary layer. To this end, we develop an inner-outer gluing iteration to solve a hyperbolic-elliptic mixed type and singular system.</description>

      <title>$C^\infty$ well-posedness of higher order hyperbolic pseudo-differential equations with multiplicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study higher order hyperbolic pseudo-differential equations with variable multiplicities. We work in arbitrary space dimension and we assume that the principal part is time-dependent only. We identify sufficient conditions on the roots and the lower order terms (Levi conditions) under which the corresponding Cauchy problem is $C^\infty$ well-posed. This is achieved via transformation into a first order system, reduction into upper-triangular form and application of suitable Fourier integral operator methods previously developed for hyperbolic non-diagonalisable systems. We also discuss how our result compares with the literature on second and third order hyperbolic equations.</description>

      <title>Unique continuation at the boundary for divergence form elliptic equations on quasiconvex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a quasiconvex Lipschitz domain and $A(x)$ be a $d \times d$ uniformly elliptic, symmetric matrix with Lipschitz coefficients. Assume a nontrivial $u$ solves $-\nabla \cdot (A(x) \nabla u) = 0$ in $\Omega$, and $u$ vanishes on $\Sigma = \partial \Omega \cap B$ for some ball $B$. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the existence of a countable collection of open balls $(B_i)_i$ such that the restriction of $u$ to $B_i \cap \Omega$ maintains a consistent sign. Furthermore, for any compact subset $K$ of $\Sigma$, the set difference $K \setminus \bigcup_i B_i$ is shown to possess a Minkowski dimension that is strictly less than $d - 1 - \epsilon$. As a consequence, we prove Lin's conjecture in quasiconvex domains.</description>

      <title>Existence and dynamics of normalized solutions to Schr\"odinger equations with generic double-behaviour nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of solutions $(\underline u,\lambda_{\underline u})\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N; \mathbb{R}) \times \mathbb{R}$ to \[ -\Delta u + \lambda u = f(u) \quad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^N \] with $N \ge 3$ and prescribed $L^2$ norm, and the dynamics of the solutions to \[ \begin{cases} \mathrm{i} \partial_t \Psi + \Delta \Psi = f(\Psi)\\ \Psi(\cdot,0) = \psi_0 \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N; \mathbb{C}) \end{cases} \] with $\psi_0$ close to $\underline u$. Here, the nonlinear term $f$ has mass-subcritical growth at the origin, mass-supercritical growth at infinity, and is more general than the sum of two powers. Under different assumptions, we prove the existence of a locally least-energy solution, the orbital stability of all such solutions, the existence of a second solution with higher energy, and the strong instability of such a solution.</description>

      <title>The Harnack inequality fails for nonlocal kinetic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Harnack inequality fails for nonlocal kinetic equations. Such equations arise as linearized models for the Boltzmann equation without cutoff and are of hypoelliptic type. We provide a counterexample for the simplest equation in this theory, the fractional Kolmogorov equation. Our result reflects a purely nonlocal phenomenon since the Harnack inequality holds true for local kinetic equations like the Kolmogorov equation.</description>

      <title>Kiselman Minimum Principle and Rooftop Envelopes in Complex Hessian Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of $m$-subharmonic functions with respect to a semipositive $(1,1)$-form in Euclidean domains, providing a significant element in understanding geodesics within the context of complex Hessian equations. Based on the foundational Perron envelope construction, we prove a decomposition of $m$-subharmonic solutions, and a general comparison principle that effectively manages singular Hessian measures. Additionally, we establish a rooftop equality and an analogue of the Kiselman minimum principle, which are crucial ingredients in establishing a criterion for geodesic connectivity among $m$-subharmonic functions, expressed in terms of their asymptotic envelopes.</description>

      <title>Tunable Localisation in Parity-Time-Symmetric Resonator Arrays with Imaginary Gauge Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to illustrate both analytically and numerically the interplay of two fundamentally distinct non-Hermitian mechanisms in a deep subwavelength regime. Considering a parity-time symmetric system of one-dimensional subwavelength resonators equipped with two kinds of non-Hermiticity - an imaginary gauge potential and on-site gain and loss - we prove that all but two eigenmodes of the system decouple when going through an exceptional point. By tuning the gain-to-loss ratio, the system changes from a phase with unbroken parity-time symmetry to a phase with broken parity-time symmetry. At the macroscopic level, this is observed as a transition from symmetrical eigenmodes to condensated eigenmodes at one edge of the structure. Mathematically, it arises from a topological state change. The results of this paper open the door to the justification of a variety of phenomena arising from the interplay between non-Hermitian reciprocal and non-reciprocal mechanisms not only in subwavelength wave physics but also in quantum mechanics where the tight binding model coupled with the nearest neighbour approximation can be analysed with the same tools as those developed here.</description>

      <title>Sobolev mappings on metric spaces and Minkowski dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the class of compactly H\"older mappings between metric spaces and determine the extent to which they distort the Minkowski dimension of a given set. These mappings are defined purely with metric notions and can be seen as a generalization of Sobolev mappings, without the requirement for a measure on the source space. In fact, we show that if $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a continuous mapping lying in some super-critical Newtonian-Sobolev space $N^{1,p}(X,\mu)$, under standard assumptions on the metric measure space $(X,d,\mu)$, it is then a compactly H\"older mapping. The dimension distortion result we obtain is new even for Sobolev mappings between weighted Euclidean spaces and generalizes previous results of Kaufman and Bishop-Hakobyan-Williams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with inverse crack scattering problems for time-harmonic acoustic waves. We prove that a piecewise linear crack with the sound-soft boundary condition in two dimensions can be uniquely determined by the far-field data corresponding to a single incident plane wave or point source. We propose two non-iterative methods for imaging the location and shape of a crack. The first one is a contrast sampling method, while the second one is a variant of the classical factorization method but only with one incoming wave. Newton's iteration method is then employed for getting a more precise reconstruction result. Numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid method.</description>

Abstract: The vector potential is a fundamental concept widely applied across various fields. This paper presents an existence theorem of a vector potential for divergence-free functions in $W^{m,p}(\mathbb{R}^N,\mathbb{T})$ with general $m,p,N$. Based on this theorem, one can establish the space decomposition theorem for functions in $W^{m,p}_0(\operatorname{curl};\Omega,\mathbb{R}^N)$ and the trace theorem for functions in $W^{m,p}(\Omega)$ within the Lipschitz domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$. The methods of proof employed in this paper are straightforward, natural, and consistent.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to the dynamics of a tracer particle coupled to a Bose scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a tracer particle coupled to a Bose scalar field and study the regime where the field's propagation speed approaches infinity. For initial states devoid of field excitations, we introduce an effective approximation of the time-evolved wave function and prove its validity in Hilbert space norm. In this approximation, the field remains in the vacuum state while the tracer particle propagates with a modified dispersion relation. Physically, the new dispersion relation can be understood as the effect of radiative corrections due to interactions with virtual bosons. Mathematically, it is defined as the solution of a self-consistent equation, whose form depends on the relevant time scale.</description>

      <title>Pointwise Regularity for Fully Nonlinear Elliptic Equations in General Forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.00324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop systematically the pointwise regularity for viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear elliptic equations in general forms. In particular, the equations with quadratic growth (called natural growth) in the gradient are covered. We obtain a series of interior and boundary pointwise $C^{k,\alpha}$ regularity ($k\geq 1$ and $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$). In addition, we also derive the pointwise $C^k$ regularity ($k\geq 1$) and $C^{k,\mathrm{lnL}}$ regularity ($k\geq 0$), which correspond to the end points $\alpha=0$ and $\alpha=1$ respectively. Some regularity results are new even for the linear equations. Moreover, the minimum requirements are imposed to obtain above regularity and our proofs are simple.</description>

      <title>Damped Strichartz estimates and the incompressible Euler--Maxwell system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04277v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Euler--Maxwell systems describe the dynamics of inviscid plasmas. In this work, we consider an incompressible two-dimensional version of such systems and prove the existence and uniqueness of global weak solutions, uniformly with respect to the speed of light $c\in (c_0,\infty)$, for some threshold value $c_0&gt;0$ depending only on the initial data. In particular, the condition $c&gt;c_0$ ensures that the velocity of the plasma nowhere exceeds the speed of light and allows us to analyze the singular regime $c\to\infty$.
  The functional setting for the fluid velocity lies in the framework of Yudovich's solutions of the two-dimensional Euler equations, whereas the analysis of the electromagnetic field hinges upon the refined interactions between the damping and dispersive phenomena in Maxwell's equations in the whole space. This analysis is enabled by the new development of a robust abstract method allowing us to incorporate the damping effect into a variety of existing estimates. The use of this method is illustrated by the derivation of damped Strichartz estimates (including endpoint cases) for several dispersive systems (including the wave and Schr\"odinger equations), as well as damped maximal regularity estimates for the heat equation. The ensuing damped Strichartz estimates supersede previously existing results on the same systems.</description>

      <title>Fundamental solutions and critical Lane-Emden exponents for nonlinear integral operators in cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study the fundamental solutions or "$\alpha$-harmonic functions" for some nonlinear positive homogeneous nonlocal elliptic problems in conical domains, such as \begin{eqnarray*}\label{ecbir1a1} {\mathcal F }(u)=0\ \ \hbox{in} \ \ \mathcal{C}_\omega,\quad u=0\ \ \hbox{in} \ \ \mathbb{R}^n\setminus \mathcal{C}_\omega ,\ \ \end{eqnarray*} where $\omega$ is a proper $C^2$ domain in $S^{N-1}$ for $ N\geq 2$, $\mathcal{C}_\omega:=\{x\,:\,x\neq 0, {|x|^{-1}}x\in \omega\}$ is the cone-like domain related to $\omega$, and ${\mathcal F }$ is an extremal fully nonlinear integral operator. We prove the existence of two fundamental solutions that are homogeneous and do not change signs in the cone; one is bounded at the origin and the other at infinity.
  As an application, we use the fundamental solutions obtained to prove Liouville type theorems in cones for supersolutions of the Lane-Emden-Fowler equation in the form \begin{eqnarray*}\label{eq 0.2} {\mathcal F }(u)+u^p = 0\ \ \hbox{in} \ \ \mathcal{C}_\omega, \quad u=0\ \ \hbox{in} \ \ \mathbb{R}^n\setminus \mathcal{C}_\omega.\ \ \end{eqnarray*} We also prove a generalized Hopf type lemma in domains with corners. Most of our results are new even when ${\mathcal F }$ is the fractional Laplacian operator.</description>

      <title>Inversion of the attenuated momenta ray transform of planar symmetric tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a reconstruction method that stably recovers the real valued, symmetric tensors compactly supported in the Euclidean plane, from knowledge of their attenuated momenta ray transform. The problem is recast as an inverse boundary value problem for a system of transport equations, which we solve by an extension of Bukhgeim's $A$-analytic theory. The method of proof is constructive. To illustrate the reconstruction method, we present results obtained in the numerical implementation for the non-attenuated case of 1-tensors. This new version now includes the results of the preprint arXiv: 2307.10758.</description>

      <title>Sharp conditions for exponential and non-exponential uniform stabilization of the time-dependent damped wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is classical that uniform stabilization of solutions to the autonomous damped wave equation is equivalent to every geodesic meeting the positive set of the damping, which is called the geometric control condition. In this paper, it is shown that for time-dependent damping, a generalization of the geometric control condition is equivalent to uniform stabilization at an exponential rate. Additionally, non-exponential uniform stabilization rates are computed for damping which do not satisfy this geometric control condition. Decay rates are guaranteed via an observability argument, including a new uniform time-dependent observability inequality. Bounds on decay rates are proved via a Gaussian beam construction.</description>

      <title>Global $L^\infty$-estimate for general quasilinear elliptic equations in arbitrary domains of $\mathbb{R}^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper our main goal is to present a new global $L^\infty$-estimate for a general class of quasilinear elliptic equations of the form $$ -div \mathcal{A}(x,u,\nabla u)=\mathcal{B}(x,u,\nabla u) $$ under minimal structure conditions on the functions $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, and in arbitrary domains of $\mathbb{R}^N$. The main focus and the novelty of the paper is to prove $L^\infty$-estimate of the form $$ |u|_{\infty, \Omega}\le C \Phi(|u|_{\beta,\Omega}) $$ where $\Phi: \mathbb{R}^+\to \mathbb{R}^+$ is a data independent function with $\lim_{s\to 0^+}\Phi(s)=0$.</description>

      <title>A new mathematical model for cell motility with nonlocal repulsion from saturated areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this work is the modelling of large single populations of cells under different interactions among themselves, in balance with natural random diffusion. We focus on cell-cell adhesion mechanisms for one single population confined in isolated domains. Our most relevant contribution is the proposal of a mathematical model, that includes a nonlocal saturation coefficient multiplying an appropriate nonlocal drift term, that can even induce repulsion effects from saturated areas.</description>

      <title>The 2D Gray-Scott system of equations: constructive proofs of existence of localized stationary patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a method to perform constructive proofs of existence of smooth planar localized patterns in the Gray-Scott model. Specifically, we construct a natural Hilbert space $H^l$ for the study of systems of autonomous semi-linear PDEs, on which products and differential operators are well-defined. Then, given an approximate solution $\mathbf{u}_0$, we derive a Newton-Kantorovich approach based on the construction of an approximate inverse of the linearization around $\mathbf{u}_0$. In particular, we derive a condition under which we prove the existence of a unique solution in a neighborhood of $\mathbf{u}_0$. Such a condition can be verified thanks to the explicit computation of different upper bounds, for which analytical details are presented. Furthermore, we provide an extra condition under which localized patterns are proven to be the limit of an unbounded branch of (spatially) periodic solutions as the period tends to infinity. We then demonstrate our approach by proving (constructively) the existence of four different localized patterns in the 2D Gray-Scott model. In addition, these solutions are proven to satisfy the $D_4$-symmetry. That is, the symmetry of the square. The algorithmic details to perform the computer-assisted proofs are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>$k$-convex hypersurfaces with prescribed Weingarten curvature in warped product manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider Weingarten curvature equations for $k$-convex hypersurfaces with $n&lt;2k$ in a warped product manifold $\overline{M}=I\times_{\lambda}M$. Based on the conjecture proposed by Ren-Wang in \cite{Ren2}, which is valid for $k\geq n-2$, we derive curvature estimates for equation $\sigma_k(\kappa)= \psi (V, \nu (V))$ through a straightforward proof. Furthermore, we also obtain an existence result for the star-shaped compact hypersurface $\Sigma$ satisfying the above equation by the degree theory under some sufficient conditions.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Monte Carlo methods for the Dean-Kawasaki equation from Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic PDEs of Fluctuating Hydrodynamics are a powerful tool for the description of fluctuations in many-particle systems. In this paper, we develop and analyze a Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) scheme for the Dean--Kawasaki equation, a pivotal representative of this class of SPDEs. We prove analytically and demonstrate numerically that our MLMC scheme provides a significant reduction in computational cost (with respect to a standard Monte Carlo method) in the simulation of the Dean--Kawasaki equation. Specifically, we link this reduction in cost to having a sufficiently large average particle density, and show that sizeable cost reductions can be obtained even when we have solutions with regions of low density. Numerical simulations are provided in the two-dimensional case, confirming our theoretical predictions.
  Our results are formulated entirely in terms of the law of distributions rather than in terms of strong spatial norms: this crucially allows for MLMC speed-ups altogether despite the Dean--Kawasaki equation being highly singular.</description>

      <title>Strong solutions to McKean-Vlasov SDEs associated to a class of degenerate Fokker-Planck equations with coefficients of Nemytskii-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the nondegenerate case is well-known, there are only few results on the existence of strong solutions to McKean-Vlasov SDEs with coefficients of Nemytskii-type in the degenerate case. We consider a broad class of degenerate nonlinear Fokker-Planck(-Kolmogorov) equations with coefficients of Nemytskii-type. This includes, in particular, the classical porous medium equation perturbed by a first-order term with initial datum in a subset of probability densities, which is dense with respect to the topology inherited from $L^1$, and, in the one-dimensional setting, the classical porous medium equation with initial datum in an arbitrary point $x\in\mathbb{R}$. For these kind of equations the existence of a Schwartz-distributional solution $u$ is well-known. We show that there exists a unique strong solution to the associated degenerate McKean-Vlasov SDE with time marginal law densities $u$. In particular, every weak solution to this equation with time marginal law densities $u$ can be written as a functional of the driving Brownian motion.
  Moreover, plugging any Brownian motion into this very functional yields a weak solution with time marginal law densities $u$.</description>
