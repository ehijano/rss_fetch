      <title>Suppression of coherent light scattering in a three-dimensional atomic array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how atoms collectively interact with light is not only important for fundamental science, but also crucial for designing light-matter interfaces in quantum technologies. Over the past decades, numerous studies have focused on arranging atoms in ordered arrays and using constructive (destructive) interference to enhance (suppress) the coupling to electromagnetic fields, thereby tailoring collective light-matter interactions. These studies have mainly focused on one- and two-dimensional arrays. However, only three-dimensional (3D) arrays can demonstrate destructive interference of coherent light scattering in all directions. This omnidirectional suppression of coherent light scattering in 3D atomic arrays has thus far not been experimentally demonstrated. Here, we observe a strong reduction of light scattering in a 3D atomic array prepared in the form of a Mott insulator in optical lattices. The residual light scattering is shown to be caused by the delocalization of atoms, Raman scattering, and inelastic scattering associated with saturation. We also demonstrate how light scattering can be a sensitive probe for density fluctuations in many-body states in optical lattices, enabling us to characterize the superfluid-to-Mott insulator phase transition as well as defects generated by dynamical parameter ramps. The results of our work can be used to prepare subradiant states for photon storage and probe correlations for many-body systems in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Circulation Statistics and Migdal Area Rule Beyond the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism in a Newborn Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts that a newly formed superfluid prepared by a finite-time thermal quench is populated with vortices. The universality of vortex number statistics, beyond KZM, enables the characterization of circulation statistics within any region of area $A$ enclosed by a loop $C$. Migdal's minimal area rule of classical turbulence predicts that the probability density function of circulation around a closed contour is independent of the contour's shape. We verify the Migdal area rule for small loops with respect to the distance between the vortex and antivortex pairs and further characterize its universal breakdown for bigger loops. We further uncovered the nonequilibrium universality dictated by the KZM dynamics, which results in power-law scalings of the moments of the circulation statistics as a function of the quench time.</description>

      <title>Exact kinetic propagators for coherent state complex Langevin simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and benchmark an improved algorithm for complex Langevin simulations of bosonic coherent state path integrals. Our approach utilizes a Strang splitting of the imaginary-time propagator rather than the conventional linear-order Taylor expansion, allowing us to construct an action that incorporates higher-order terms at negligible computational cost. The resulting algorithm enjoys guaranteed linear stability independent of the imaginary-time discretization, enabling more resource-efficient simulations. We demonstrate this improved performance for single-species bosons and for two-component bosons with Rashba spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Quantum Time Crystals and Interacting Chiral Gauge Theories in Atomic BECs III: Role of the Page-Wootters mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build the case that our published chiral soliton model [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 250402 (2019)] can lead to a genuine quantum time crystal for smaller atom numbers. To do this we compare results from the chiral soliton model with exact numerical solutions for the ground state of the three-particle Schr\"odinger equation in the limit that the spatial profile of the soliton is largely independent of its center-of-mass motion. The connection between the two approaches is found via the Page-Wootters mechanism, and this is what allows for dynamical evolution even in the quantum ground state, as required for a genuine quantum time crystal.</description>

      <title>Unified Field-integral Thermodynamics of Bose Mixtures: Stability and Critical Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a unified thermodynamic framework for Bose mixtures at finite temperatures based on the functional field integral, within which the decision on whether to discard the anomalous densities, when determining the density configuration and stability matrix, yields distinct theories. Beyond the existing Hartree-Fock approximation and Ota-Giorgini-Stringari theory, retaining the anomalous densities throughout will provide a completely self-consistent thermodynamic description, requiring the combination of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation and the representative statistical ensemble. Comparing three approaches for predicting magnetic susceptibility, we highlight the role of anomalous densities in stabilizing superfluid mixtures. We further unveil that Feshbach coupling can either expand the regime of atomic and molecular superfluids, or induce a phase transition to a pure molecular superfluid, depending on their density ratio. Importantly, we show that thermal fluctuations will trigger a phase transition from stable to unstable mixtures, where anomalous densities can serve as distinct signatures for experimental observation.</description>

      <title>Analytical study of a finite-range impurity in a one-dimensional Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional Bose gases present an interesting setting to study the physics of Bose polarons, as density fluctuations play an enhanced role due to reduced dimensionality. Theoretical descriptions of this system have predominantly relied on contact pseudopotentials to model the impurity-bath interaction, leading to unphysical results in the strongly coupled limit. In this work, we analytically solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, using a square well potential instead of a zero-range potential, for the ground-state wave function of a static impurity. We compute perturbative corrections arising from infinitesimally slow impurity motion. The polaron energy and effective mass remain finite in the strongly coupled regime, in contrast to the divergent behavior obtained using a contact potential. Moreover, we provide a universal description in this limit characterized by the dimensionless ratio $\bar{w} \equiv w/\xi$ between the interaction range $w$ of the impurity-bath potential and the coherence length $\xi$ of the Bose gas. The effective mass exhibits a $1/ \bar{w}$ scaling. The energy of the attractive polaron scales as $-1/\bar{w}^3$, whereas the repulsive polaron features subleading corrections to the dark soliton energy at the order $\bar{w}^3$.</description>

      <title>Supersolid phases of bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersolids--the enigmatic phase of quantum matter, with properties resembling both the superfluid and solid states--have been actively sought over the past 70 years. We provide a comprehensive review of the developments to date in experimental and theoretical studies of the supersolid phases of bosons, with a particular focus on their observation in ultracold atomic gases. Additionally, the use of optical lattices facilitates the realization of `lattice-supersolids', which paves the way to study the effect of correlations in a controlled manner. A brief theoretical framework is presented to characterize this puzzling state with competing orders and to gain insight into its basic properties. Various types of supersolid phases and the different platforms used to achieve them are described. Finally, we discuss the future prospects of research and the potential to achieve supersolids with more exotic features.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transition through tunable nearest-neighbor interactions in a one-dimensional lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of a one-dimensional model of hardcore bosons or spinless fermions with tunable nearest-neighbor interactions. By introducing alternating repulsive and attractive interactions on consecutive bonds, we show that the system undergoes a transition from a bond-ordered (BO) phase to a charge-density wave-II (CDW-II) phase as the attractive interaction strength increases at a fixed repulsive interaction. For a specific interaction pattern, the BO phase exhibits topological properties, which vanish when the pattern is altered, leading to a transition from a topological BO phase to a trivial BO phase through a gap-closing point where both interactions vanish. We identify these phases using a combination of order parameters, topological invariants, edge-state analysis and Thouless charge pumping. By extending our analysis beyond half-filling, we explore the phase diagram across all densities and identify the superfluid (SF) and the pair-superfluid (PSF) phases, characterized by single-particle and bound-pair excitations at incommensurate densities. The proposed model is experimentally realizable in platforms such as Rydberg excited or ultracold atoms in optical lattices, offering a versatile framework to study such interplay between topology and interactions in low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium, Relaxation and Fluctuations in homogeneous Bose-Einstein Condensates: Linearized Classical Field Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open quantum systems theory is central to describing the dynamics and equilibration of dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). We present an analysis of the linearized stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE) describing finite-temperature BECs. Our treatment provides an optimal choice for the cut-off that divides the Bose gas into the low-energy coherent region forming a classical wave, and the high-energy thermal cloud treated as a reservoir. Moreover, it highlights the relevance of energy damping, the number-conserving scattering between thermal and coherent atoms. We analyze the equilibrium properties and near-equilibrium relaxation of a homogeneous BEC in one, two and three dimensions at high phase-space density, and calculate the autocorrelation function and power spectrum of the density and phase fluctuations. Simulations of the full non-linear SPGPE are in close agreement, and extend our arguments beyond the linear regime. Our work suggests the need for a re-examination of decay processes in BECs studied under the neglect of energy damping.</description>

      <title>Axially confined binary quantum droplets: ground states and central vortices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold miscible mixtures of bosonic gases have been observed to form quantum droplet states stabilized by beyond-mean-field quantum fluctuations. Here we study the properties of the droplets when subjected to harmonic trapping in one dimension, using a combination of numerical, variational and analytical approaches. We map out the phase diagram between bound droplets and the unbound gas state and the form of the ground states. We additionally consider how the droplet solutions are modified by the presence of a central vortex and use these results to estimate the critical rotation frequency for vortices to be energetically favored. Our work helps to understand the physics of self-bound droplets and vortex droplets in flattened geometries.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in imbalanced bilayer Hubbard model: enhanced $d$-wave and weakened $s^\pm$-wave pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the bilayer model with two layers of imbalanced densities coupled by the interlayer hybridization. Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal SC occurs at a moderate imbalance, whose SC is solely hosted by the layer with higher density (lower hole doping). Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. The uncovered SC hosted by a single layer is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.</description>
