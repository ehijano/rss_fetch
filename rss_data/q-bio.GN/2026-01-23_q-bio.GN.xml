      <title>PhageMind: Generalized Strain-level Phage Host Range Prediction via Meta-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteriophages (phages) are key regulators of bacterial populations and hold great promise for applications such as phage therapy, biocontrol, and industrial fermentation. The success of these applications depends on accurately determining phage host range, which is often specific at the strain level rather than the species level. However, existing computational approaches face major limitations: many rely on genus-specific features that do not generalize across taxa, while others require large amounts of training data that are unavailable for most bacterial lineages. These challenges create a critical need for methods that can accurately predict strain-level phage-host interactions across diverse bacterial genera, particularly under data-limited conditions. We present PhageMind, a learning framework designed to address this challenge by enabling efficient transfer of knowledge across bacterial genera. PhageMind is trained to identify shared principles of phage-bacterium interactions from well-studied systems and to rapidly adapt these principles to new genera using only a small number of known interactions. To reflect the biological basis of infection, we represent phage-host relationships using a knowledge graph that explicitly incorporates phage tail fiber proteins and bacterial O-antigen biosynthesis gene clusters, and we use this representation to guide interaction prediction. Across four bacterial genera (Escherichia, Klebsiella, Vibrio, and Alteromonas), PhageMind achieves high prediction accuracy and shows strong adaptability to new lineages. In particular, in leave-one-genus-out evaluations, the model maintains robust performance when only limited reference data are available, demonstrating its potential as a scalable and practical tool for studying phage-host interactions across the global phageome.</description>

      <title>SAGE-FM: A lightweight and interpretable spatial transcriptomics foundation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables spatial gene expression profiling, motivating computational models that capture spatially conditioned regulatory relationships. We introduce SAGE-FM, a lightweight spatial transcriptomics foundation model based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) trained with a masked central spot prediction objective. Trained on 416 human Visium samples spanning 15 organs, SAGE-FM learns spatially coherent embeddings that robustly recover masked genes, with 91% of masked genes showing significant correlations (p &lt; 0.05). The embeddings generated by SAGE-FM outperform MOFA and existing spatial transcriptomics methods in unsupervised clustering and preservation of biological heterogeneity. SAGE-FM generalizes to downstream tasks, enabling 81% accuracy in pathologist-defined spot annotation in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and improving glioblastoma subtype prediction relative to MOFA. In silico perturbation experiments further demonstrate that the model captures directional ligand-receptor and upstream-downstream regulatory effects consistent with ground truth. These results demonstrate that simple, parameter-efficient GCNs can serve as biologically interpretable and spatially aware foundation models for large-scale spatial transcriptomics.</description>

      <title>In vitro binding energies capture Klf4 occupancy across the human genome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by binding to specific genomic loci determined by DNA sequence. Their sequence specificity is commonly summarized by a consensus binding motif. However, eukaryotic genomes contain billions of low-affinity DNA sequences to which TFs associate with a sequence-dependent binding energy. We currently lack insight into how the genomic sequence defines this spectrum of binding energies and the resulting pattern of TF localization. Here, we set out to obtain a quantitative understanding of sequence-dependent TF binding to both motif and non-motif sequences. We achieve this by first pursuing accurate measurements of physical binding energies of the human TF Klf4 to a library of short DNA sequences in a fluorescence-anisotropy-based bulk competitive binding assay. Second, we show that the highly non-linear sequence dependence of Klf4 binding energies can be captured by combining a linear model of binding energies with an Ising model of the coupled recognition of nucleotides by a TF. We find that this statistical mechanics model parametrized by our in vitro measurements captures Klf4 binding patterns on individual long DNA molecules stretched in the optical tweezer, and is predictive for Klf4 occupancy across the entire human genome without additional fit parameters.</description>

      <title>GENERator: A Long-Context Generative Genomic Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07272v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of DNA sequencing has produced vast genomic datasets, yet interpreting and engineering genomic function remain fundamental challenges. Recent large language models have opened new avenues for genomic analysis, but existing approaches are often limited by restricted training scope, constrained generative capability, or prohibitive computational cost. We introduce GENErator, a generative genomic foundation model for long-context DNA modeling, with a context length of 98k nucleotides, pre-trained on 386 billion nucleotides of eukaryotic DNA. Without task-specific fine-tuning, GENERator exhibits strong intrinsic capabilities: unsupervised embedding analyses reveal phylogenetically coherent structure, and sequence recovery benchmarks demonstrate generative accuracy comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art models with substantially improved computational efficiency. In a zero-shot setting, GENERator achieves competitive variant effect prediction performance relative to alignment-based methods, while remaining fully alignment-free and broadly applicable across species. With task-specific fine-tuning, the model attains leading performance on established genomic benchmarks. We further demonstrate practical generative applications. GENERator can generate protein-coding DNA sequences that translate into structurally plausible proteins and, through a prompt-guided design framework, design cis-regulatory elements with targeted activity profiles, including synthetic super-enhancers validated by high-throughput UMI-STARR-seq assays. Together, these results establish GENERator as an efficient and biologically grounded framework for genomic interpretation and programmable sequence design.
