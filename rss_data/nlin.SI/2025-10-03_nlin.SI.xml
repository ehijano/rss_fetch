      <title>The noncommutative KP hierarchy and its solution via descent algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the solution to the complete noncommutative Kadomtsev--Petviashvili (KP) hierarchy. We achieve this via direct linearisation which involves the Gelfand--Levitan--Marchenko (GLM) equation. This is a linear integral equation in which the scattering data satisfies the linearised KP hierarchy. The solution to the GLM equation is then shown to coincide with the solution to the noncommutative KP hierarchy. We achieve this using two approaches. In the first approach we use the standard Sato-Wilson dressing transformation. In the second approach, which was pioneered by Poppe, we assume the scattering data is semi-additive and by direct substitution, we show that the solution to the GLM equation satisfies the infinite set of field equations representing the noncommutative KP hierarchy. This approach relies on the augmented pre-Poppe algebra. This is a representative algebra that underlies the field equations representing the hierarchy. It is nonassociative and isomorphic to a descent algebra equipped with a grafting product. While we perform computations in the nonassociative descent algebra, the final result which establishes the solution to the complete hierarchy, resides in the natural associative subalgebra. The advantages of this second approach are that it is constructive, explicit, highlights the underlying combinatorial structures within the hierarchy, and reveals the mechanisms underlying the solution procedure.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative multiple bi-orthogonal polynomials: formal approach and integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the non-commutative multiple bi-orthogonal polynomial systems, which simultaneously generalize the concepts of multiple orthogonality, matrix orthogonal polynomials and of the bi-orthogonality. We present quasideterminantal expressions for such polynomial systems in terms of formal bi-moments. The normalization functions for such monic polynomials satisfy the non-commutative Hirota equations, while the polynomials provide solution of the corresponding linear system. This shows, in particular, that our polynomial systems form a part of the theory of integrable systems. We study also a specialization of the problem to non-commutative multiple orthogonal polynomials, what results in the corresponding Hankel-type quasideterminantal expressions in terms of the moments. Moreover, such a reduction allows to introduce in a standard way the discrete-time variable and gives rise to an integrable system which is non-commutative version of the multidimensional discrete-time Toda equations.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the $R$-matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17773v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A bootstrap program is presented for algebraically solving the $R$-matrix of a generic integrable quantum spin chain from its Hamiltonian. The Yang-Baxter equation contains an infinite number of seemingly independent constraints on the operator valued coefficients in the expansion of the $R$-matrices with respect to their spectral parameters, with the lowest order one being the Reshetikhin condition. These coefficients can be solved iteratively using Kennedy's inversion formula, which reconstructs the $R$-matrix after an infinite number of steps. For a generic Hamiltonian, the procedure could fail at any step, making the conditions useful as an integrability test. However in all known examples they all turn out to be satisfied whenever the lowest order condition is. It remains to be understood whether they are all implied by the Reshetikhin condition.</description>
