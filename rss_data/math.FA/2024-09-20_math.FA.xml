      <title>Toeplitz operators on some function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider studies of Toeplitz operators on function spaces (the weighted Bergman space, the generalized derivative Hardy space) and the H-Toeplitz operators on the Bergman space. Past studies have considered the presence or absence of hyponormality or questions of contractivity or expansivity; we provide structure theorems for these operators that allow us to recapture, and often considerably improve, these results. In some cases these operators or their adjoints are actually in more restrictive classes, such as subnormal or moment infinitely divisible ($\mathcal{MID}$).</description>

      <title>On symmetric and approximately symmetric operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of local orthogonality preserving operators to study the right-symmetry of operators. As a consequence of our work, we show that any smooth compact operator defined on a smooth and reflexive Banach space is either a rank one operator or it is not right-symmetric. We show that there are no right-symmetric smooth compact operators defined on a smooth and reflexive Banach space that fails to have any non-zero left-symmetric point. We also study approximately orthogonality preserving and reversing operators (in the sense of Chmieli\'{n}ski and Dragomir). We show that on a finite-dimensional Banach space, an operator is approximately orthogonality preserving (reversing) in the sense of Dragomir if and only if it is an injective operator.</description>

Abstract: We study approximately orthogonality (in the sense of Dragomir) preserving and reversing operators. We obtain a complete characterization of approximate orthogonality preserving and reversing operators for a class of operators. We also study the locally approximate orthogonality preserving and reversing operators defined on some finite-dimensional Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>A non-uniform Datko-Pazy theorem for bounded operator semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a non-uniform analogue of the classical Datko-Pazy theorem. Our main result shows that an integrability condition imposed on orbits originating in a fractional domain of the generator (as opposed to all orbits) implies polynomial stability of a bounded $C_0$-semigroup. As an application of this result we establish polynomial stability of a semigroup under a certain non-uniform Lyapunov-type condition. We moreover give a new proof, under slightly weaker assumptions, of a recent result deducing polynomial stability from a certain non-uniform observability condition.</description>

      <title>Singular integrals on $ax+b$ hypergroups and an operator-valued spectral multiplier theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L_\nu = -\partial_x^2-(\nu-1)x^{-1} \partial_x$ be the Bessel operator on the half-line $X_\nu = [0,\infty)$ with measure $x^{\nu-1} \,\mathrm{d} x$. In this work we study singular integral operators associated with the Laplacian $\Delta_\nu = -\partial_u^2 + e^{2u} L_\nu$ on the product $G_\nu$ of $X_\nu$ and the real line with measure $\mathrm{d} u$. For any $\nu \geq 1$, the Laplacian $\Delta_\nu$ is left-invariant with respect to a noncommutative hypergroup structure on $G_\nu$, which can be thought of as a fractional-dimension counterpart to $ax+b$ groups. In particular, equipped with the Riemannian distance associated with $\Delta_\nu$, the metric-measure space $G_\nu$ has exponential volume growth. We prove a sharp $L^p$ spectral multiplier theorem of Mihlin--H\"ormander type for $\Delta_\nu$, as well as the $L^p$-boundedness for $p \in (1,\infty)$ of the associated first-order Riesz transforms. To this purpose, we develop a Calder\'on--Zygmund theory \`a la Hebisch--Steger adapted to the nondoubling structure of $G_\nu$, and establish large-time gradient heat kernel estimates for $\Delta_\nu$. In addition, the Riesz transform bounds for $p &gt; 2$ hinge on an operator-valued spectral multiplier theorem, which we prove in greater generality and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On Convergent Dynamic Mode Decomposition and its Equivalence with Occupation Kernel Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new technique for norm-convergent dynamic mode decomposition of deterministic systems. The developed method utilizes recent results on singular dynamic mode decomposition where it is shown that by appropriate selection of domain and range Hilbert spaces, the Liouville operator (also known as the Koopman generator) can be made to be compact. In this paper, it is shown that by selecting appropriate collections of finite basis functions in the domain and the range, a novel finite-rank representation of the Liouville operator may be obtained. It is also shown that the model resulting from dynamic mode decomposition of the finite-rank representation is closely related to regularized regression using the so-called occupation kernels as basis functions.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Approximation and Learning via Optimal Approximation by ReLU MLPs of Maximal Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The foundations of deep learning are supported by the seemingly opposing perspectives of approximation or learning theory. The former advocates for large/expressive models that need not generalize, while the latter considers classes that generalize but may be too small/constrained to be universal approximators. Motivated by real-world deep learning implementations that are both expressive and statistically reliable, we ask: "Is there a class of neural networks that is both large enough to be universal but structured enough to generalize?"
  This paper constructively provides a positive answer to this question by identifying a highly structured class of ReLU multilayer perceptions (MLPs), which are optimal function approximators and are statistically well-behaved. We show that any $L$-Lipschitz function from $[0,1]^d$ to $[-n,n]$ can be approximated to a uniform $Ld/(2n)$ error on $[0,1]^d$ with a sparsely connected $L$-Lipschitz ReLU MLP of width $\mathcal{O}(dn^d)$, depth $\mathcal{O}(\log(d))$, with $\mathcal{O}(dn^d)$ nonzero parameters, and whose weights and biases take values in $\{0,\pm 1/2\}$ except in the first and last layers which instead have magnitude at-most $n$. Unlike previously known "large" classes of universal ReLU MLPs, the empirical Rademacher complexity of our class remains bounded even when its depth and width become arbitrarily large. Further, our class of MLPs achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ when given $N$ i.i.d. normalized sub-Gaussian training samples.
  We achieve this by avoiding the standard approach to constructing optimal ReLU approximators, which sacrifices regularity by relying on small spikes. Instead, we introduce a new construction that perfectly fits together linear pieces using Kuhn triangulations and avoids these small spikes.</description>

      <title>Positive solutions of singular elliptic problems with unbounded exponents and unbounded convection term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of a solution for a class of Dirichlet problems with a singularity and a convection term. Precisely, we consider the existence of a positive solution to the Dirichlet problem $$-\Delta_p u = \frac{\lambda}{u^{\alpha}} + f(x,u,\nabla u)$$ in a bounded, smooth domain $\Omega$. The convection term has exponents with no upper limitations neither in $u$ nor in $\nabla u$. This is somewhat unexpected and rare. So, we address a wide range of problems not yet contained in the literature.
  The solution of the problem combines the definition of an auxiliary problem, the method of sub- and super-solution and Schauder's fixed point theorem.</description>

      <title>Compensated Integrability in bounded domains: Applications to gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accurate functional inequality for Div-BV positive symmetric tensors $A$ in a bounded domain $U\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ arises whenever the tangential part of the normal trace $\gamma_\nu A\sim A\vec\nu$ is a finite measure over $\partial U$. The proof involves an extension operator to a neighbourhood of $\bar U$. The resulting inequality depends upon the domain only through the $C^3$-regularity of $\partial U$, some constant involving the curvature and its first derivatives.This abstract statement applies to several models of Gas Dynamics (Euler system, Hard Spheres dynamics), as the boundary condition (slip, or reflection) tells us that $A\vec\nu$ is parallel to $\vec\nu$, where $A$ is the mass-momentum tensor.</description>

Abstract: We extend the notion of generalized Drazin-Riesz inverse introduced for bounded linear operators in \cite{Ziv} to elements in a complex unital semi-simple Banach algebra. Several characterizations and properties of generalized Drazin-Riesz invertible elements are given. In particular, we extend those of \cite{AbZg1,Djor,Ziv}.</description>

      <title>Existence, symmetry and regularity of ground states of a non linear choquard equation in the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the positive solutions of the following nonlinear Choquard equation involving the green kernel of the fractional operator $(-\Delta_{\mathbb{B}^N})^{-\alpha/2}$ in the hyperbolic space \begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned} -\Delta_{\mathbb{B}^{N}} u \, - \, \lambda u \, &amp;= \left[(- \Delta_{\mathbb{B}^{N}})^{-\frac{\alpha}{2}}|u|^p\right]|u|^{p-2}u,
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation} where $\Delta_{\mathbb{B}^{N}}$ denotes the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $\mathbb{B}^{N}$, $\lambda \leq \frac{(N-1)^2}{4}$, $1 &lt; p &lt; 2^*_{\alpha} = \frac{N+\alpha}{N-2}$, $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; N$, $N \geq 3$, $2^*_\alpha$ is the critical exponent in the context of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality. This study is analogous to the Choquard equation in the Euclidean space, which involves the non-local Riesz potential operator. We consider the functional setting within the Sobolev space $H^1(\mathbb{B}^N)$, employing advanced harmonic analysis techniques, particularly the Helgason Fourier transform and semigroup approach to fractional Laplacian. Moreover, the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality on complete Riemannian manifolds, as developed by Varopoulos, is pivotal in our analysis. We prove an existence result for the above problem in the subcritical case. Moreover, we also demonstrate that solutions exhibit radial symmetry, and establish the regularity properties.</description>
