      <title>The cosmic timeline implied by the highest redshift quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional picture of supermassive black-hole growth in the standard model had already been seriously challenged by the emergence of $\sim 10^9\;M_\odot$ quasars at $z\sim 7.5$, conflicting with the predicted formation of structure in the early $\Lambda$CDM Universe. But the most recent {\it JWST} discovery of a $\sim 10^8\;M_\odot$ source at $z\sim 10.1$ argues even more strongly against the possibility that these black holes were created in Pop II or III supernovae, followed by Eddington-limited accretion. Attempts at resolving this anomaly have largely focused on the formation of seeds via an exotic, direct collapse of primordial gas to an initial mass $\sim 10^5\;M_\odot$ -- a process that has never been seen anywhere in the cosmos. Our goal in this {\it Letter} is to demonstrate that the emergence of these black holes is instead fully consistent with standard astrophysics in the context of the alternative Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology known as the $R_{\rm h}=ct$ universe. We show that, while the predicted evolution in the standard model is overly compressed, the creation, growth and appearance of such high-$z$ quasars fall comfortably within the evolutionary history in this cosmology, thereby adding considerable observational support to the existing body of evidence favoring it over the standard scenario.</description>

      <title>The FLAMINGO project: cosmology with the redshift dependence of weak gravitational lensing peaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing (WL) convergence peaks contain valuable cosmological information in the regime of non-linear collapse. Using the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we study the physical origin and redshift distributions of the objects generating WL peaks selected from a WL convergence map mimicking a $\textit{Euclid}$ signal. We match peaks to individual haloes and show that the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR$~&gt;~5$) WL peaks measured by Stage IV WL surveys primarily trace $M_{\mathrm{200c}} &gt; 10^{14}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ haloes. We find that the WL peak sample can compete with the purity and completeness of state-of-the-art X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster abundance inferences. By comparing the distributions predicted by simulation variations that have been calibrated to the observed gas fractions of local clusters and the present-day galaxy stellar mass function, or shifted versions of these, we illustrate that the shape of the redshift distribution of SNR$~&gt;~5$ peaks is insensitive to baryonic physics while it does change with cosmology. The difference highlights the potential of using WL peaks to constrain cosmology. As the number density of WL peaks scales differently with cosmology and baryonic feedback, WL peak statistics can simultaneously calibrate baryonic feedback and constrain cosmology.</description>

      <title>The imprint of cosmic voids from the DESI Legacy Survey DR9 LRGs in the Planck 2018 lensing map through spectroscopically calibrated mocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cross-correlation of cosmic voids with the lensing convergence ($\kappa$) map of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) fluctuations provides a powerful tool to refine our understanding of the cosmological model. However, several studies have reported a moderate tension between the lensing imprint of cosmic voids on the observed CMB and the simulated $\mathrm{\Lambda}$CDM signal. To address this "lensing-is-low" tension and to obtain new, precise measurements, we exploit the large DESI Legacy Survey Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) dataset, covering approximately 19,500 $\deg^2$ of the sky and including about 10 million LRGs at $z &lt; 1.05$. Our $\mathrm{\Lambda}$CDM template was created using the Buzzard mocks, which we specifically calibrated to match the clustering properties of the observed galaxy sample by exploiting more than one million DESI spectra. We identified our catalogs of 3D voids in the range $0.35 &lt; z &lt; 0.95$, dividing the sample into bins according to the redshift and $\lambda_\mathrm{v}$ values of the voids. We report a 14$\sigma$ detection of the lensing signal, with $A_\kappa = 1.016 \pm 0.054$, which increases to 17$\sigma$ when considering the void-in-void ($A_\kappa = 0.944 \pm 0.064$) and the void-in-cloud ($A_\kappa = 0.975 \pm 0.060$) populations individually, the highest detection significance for studies of this kind. We observe a full agreement between the observations and $\mathrm{\Lambda}$CDM predictions across all redshift bins, sky regions, and void populations considered. In addition to these findings, our analysis highlights the importance of matching sparseness and redshift error distributions between mocks and observations, as well as the role of $\lambda_\mathrm{v}$ in enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Massive black holes or stars first: the key is the residual cosmic electron fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations have unveiled that the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) were in place at z $\geq$ 10, a few hundred Myrs after the Big Bang. These discoveries are providing strong constraints on the seeding of BHs and the nature of the first objects in the Universe. Here, we study the impact of the freeze-out electron fractions ($f_e$) at the end of the epoch of cosmic recombination on the formation of the first structures in the Universe. At $f_e$ below the current fiducial cosmic values of $\rm \sim 10^{-4}$, the baryonic collapse is delayed due to the lack of molecular hydrogen cooling until the host halo masses are increased by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the standard case and reach the atomic cooling limit. This results in an enhanced enclosed gas mass by more than an order of magnitude and higher inflow rates of up to $0.1~M_{\odot}/{yr}$. Such conditions are conducive to the formation of massive seed BHs with $\sim 10^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$. Our results reveal a new pathway for the formation of massive BH seeds which may naturally arise from free</description>

      <title>Primordial non-Gaussianity systematics from redshift mismatch with SPHEREx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to differentiate between different models of inflation through the imprint of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) requires a tight constraint on the local PNG parameter $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{loc}}$. Future large scale structure surveys like \textit{Euclid}, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, and the Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) will play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of the inflationary epoch. In this light, we present forecasts on PNG with tomographic angular power spectrum from simulations of SPHEREx. We put forward the effects of redshift bin mismatch of galaxies as a source of systematic error when estimating $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{loc}}$ and galaxy linear halo bias. We %use \texttt{GLASS} to simulate $500$ SPHEREx-like galaxy density fields, and divide the galaxies into $13$ redshift bins assuming Gaussian photometric redshift errors. We show that the misclassification of galaxies in redshift bins can result in strong apparent tensions on $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{loc}}$ up to $\sim 3\sigma$ and up to $\sim 9\sigma$ on galaxy bias. We propose a scattering matrix formalism to mitigate bin mismatch of galaxies and to obtain unbiased estimates of cosmological parameters from tomographic angular clustering measurements.</description>

      <title>The relation of galaxies and dark matter haloes to the filamentary cosmic web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Millennium Simulation to study the relation of galaxies and dark matter haloes to the cosmic web. We define the web as the unique, fully connected, percolating object with (unsmoothed) matter density everywhere exceeding 5.25 times the cosmic mean. This object contains 35\% of all cosmic mass but occupies only 0.62\% of all cosmic volume. It contains 26\% of dark matter haloes of mass $10^{11}M_\odot$, rising to 50\% at $10^{12.7}M_\odot$, and to $&gt;90\%$ above $10^{14}M_\odot$. In contrast, it contains 45\% of all galaxies of stellar mass $10^{8.5}M_\odot$, rising to 50\% at $10^{10}M_\odot$, to 60\% at $10^{11}M_\odot$ and to 90\% at $10^{11.5}M_\odot$. This difference arises because a large fraction of all satellite and backsplash galaxies are part of the cosmic web. Indeed, more than 50\% of web galaxies are satellites for stellar masses below that of the Milky Way, rising to about 70\% below $10^{10}M_\odot$, whereas centrals substantially outnumber satellites in the non-web population at all stellar masses. As a result, web galaxies have systematically lower specific star-formation rates (sSFR's) than non-web galaxies. For the latter, the distributions of stellar mass and sSFR are almost independent of web distance. Furthermore, for both central and satellite galaxies, the sSFR distributions at given stellar mass are identical in and outside the web, once differences in backsplash fraction are accounted for. For the galaxy formation model considered here, differences between web and non-web galaxy populations are almost entirely due to the difference in halo mass distribution between the two environments.</description>

      <title>Accelerating HI density predictions during the Epoch of Reionization using a GPR-based emulator on N-body simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building fast and accurate ways to model the distribution of neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is essential for interpreting upcoming 21 cm observations. A key component of semi-numerical models of reionization is the collapse fraction field $f_{\text{coll}}(\mathbf{x})$, which represents the fraction of mass within dark matter halos at each location. Using high-dynamic range N-body simulations to obtain this is computationally prohibitive and semi-analytical approaches, while being fast, end up compromising on accuracy. In this work, we bridge the gap by developing a machine learning model that can generate $f_{\text{coll}}$ maps by sampling from the full distribution of $f_{\text{coll}}$ conditioned on the dark matter density contrast $\delta$. The conditional distribution functions and the input density field to the model are taken from low-dynamic range N-body simulations that are more efficient to run. We evaluate the performance of our ML model by comparing its predictions to a high-dynamic range N-body simulation. Using these $f_{\text{coll}}$ maps, we compute the HI and HII maps through a semi-numerical code for reionization. We are able to recover the large-scale HI density field power spectra $(k \lesssim 1\ h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ at the $\lesssim10\%$ level, while the HII density field is reproduced with errors well below 10% across all scales. Compared to existing semi-analytical prescriptions, our approach offers significantly improved accuracy in generating the collapse fraction field, providing a robust and efficient alternative for modeling reionization.</description>

      <title>Reducing nuisance prior sensitivity via non-linear reparameterization, with application to EFT analyses of large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many physical models contain nuisance parameters that quantify unknown and irrelevant properties of an experiment. Typically, these cannot be measured except by fitting the models to the data from the experiment, requiring simultaneous measurement of interesting parameters that are our target of inference and nuisance terms that are not directly of interest. A recent example of this is fitting Effective Field Theory (EFT) models to large-scale structure (LSS) data to make cosmological inferences. These models have a large number of nuisance parameters that are typically correlated with cosmological parameters in the posterior, leading to strong dependence on the nuisance parameter priors. We introduce a reparametrization method that leverages Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to decorrelate nuisance parameters from the parameters of interest in the likelihood, even in the presence of non-linear relationships. This reparametrization forms a natural basis within which to define priors that are independent between nuisance and target parameters: the separation means that the marginal posterior for cosmological parameters does not depend on simple priors placed on nuisance terms. In application to EFT models using LSS data, we demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to robust cosmological inference.</description>

      <title>Learning from galactic rotation curves: a neural network approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a galaxy, given its observed rotation curve, can one directly infer parameters of the dark matter density profile (such as dark matter particle mass $m$, scaling parameter $s$, core-to-envelope transition radius $r_t$ and NFW scale radius $r_s$), along with Baryonic parameters (such as the stellar mass-to-light ratio $\Upsilon_*$)? In this work, using simulated rotation curves, we train neural networks, which can then be fed observed rotation curves of dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies from the SPARC catalog, to infer parameter values and their uncertainties. Since observed rotation curves have errors, we also explore the very important effect of noise in the training data on the inference. We employ two different methods to quantify uncertainties in the estimated parameters, and compare the results with those obtained using Bayesian methods. We find that the trained neural networks can extract parameters that describe observations well for the galaxies we studied.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Effects of Coupling Extended Proca-Nuevo Gravity on Cosmic Expansion with Recent Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Coupling Extended Proca-Nuevo gravity, a non-linear theory extending from dRGT massive gravity with a spin-1 field. This theory is shown to yield reliable, ghost-free cosmological solutions, modeling both the Universe's thermal history and late-time acceleration. By analyzing data from Dark energy spectroscopic instruments (DESI), Cosmic Chronometer (CCh), Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), and Type Ia Supernova (SNeIa), we derive parameter constraints with up to 3$\sigma$ confidence, demonstrating good agreement with observations. Our comparison of $BAO$ data from $WiggleZ$ and $DESI$ highlights its constraining power on the Hubble constant. The analysis of the cosmographic parameter, $q$ shows the statistical compatibility with the recent data. Further, this indicates that Universe's current accelerated expansion aligns with quintessential behavior.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory and In-In Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The predictions of inflation are usually defined in terms of equal time in-in correlation functions in an accelerating cosmological background. These same observables exist for quantum field theory in other spacetimes, including flat space. In this paper, we will explore how the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) and effective field theory (EFT) apply to these observables in both flat and de Sitter space. Specifically, we show that matching the short- and long-distance calculations requires additional terms localized at the time of the measurement that are not captured by the effective action of the EFT. These additional terms only correct the local and semi-local terms in the EFT correlators. In flat space, we give an explicit demonstration by matching in-in correlators of light scalars interacting with a heavy field with the EFT result. We then show how these additional terms arise generically via exact RG. We also compare these explicit results in flat space with the corresponding theory in de Sitter and show that the local terms typically redshift away. Our results are closely related to momentum space entanglement that arises from tracing over short-wavelength modes.</description>

      <title>Dark Galactic subhalos and the Gaia snail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia has revealed a clear signal of disequilibrium in the solar neighborhood in the form of a spiral (or snail) feature in the vertical phase-space distribution. We investigate the possibility that this structure emerges from ongoing perturbations by dark $\left(10^{6} M_{\odot} - 10^8 M_{\odot}\right)$ Galactic subhalos. We develop a probabilistic model for generating subhalo orbits based on a semi-analytic model of structure formation, and combine this framework with an approximate prescription for calculating the response of the disk to external perturbations. We also develop a phenomenological treatment for the diffusion of phase-space spirals caused by gravitational scattering between stars and giant molecular clouds, a process that erases the kinematic signatures of old ($t \gtrsim 0.6$ Gyr) events. Perturbations caused by dark subhalos are, on average, orders of magnitude weaker than those caused by luminous satellite galaxies, but the ubiquity of dark halos predicted by cold dark matter makes them a more probable source of strong perturbation to the dynamics of the solar neighborhood. Dark subhalos alone do not cause enough disturbance to explain the Gaia snail, but they excite fluctuations of $\sim 0.1-0.5 \ \rm{km} \ \rm{s^{-1}}$ in the mean vertical velocity of stars near the Galactic midplane that should persist to the present day. Subhalos also produce correlations between vertical frequency and orbital angle that could be mistaken as originating from a single past disturbance. Our results motivate investigation of the Milky Way's dark satellites by characterizing their kinematic signatures in phase-space spirals across the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev cosmography in the framework of extended symmetric teleparallel theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmography has been extensively utilized to constrain the kinematic state of the Universe using measured distances. In this work, we propose a new method to reconstruct coupling theories using the first kind of Chebyshev polynomial for two variables in which the functional form of the $f(Q,T)$ theory has been obtained. Further, the unknowns that appeared in the series are constrained using the cosmographic parameters. We find the explicit form of the luminosity distance in terms of cosmographic parameters to perform MCMC analysis using the PANTHEON+SH0ES data set. Through the distance modulus function, we observe that the result comes out to be an excellent match to the standard cosmological model and data.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter annihilation in the Large Magellanic Cloud from multiple low-frequency radio observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-frequency radio emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud~(LMC) is assumed to be dominated by nonthermal synchrotron radiation from energy loss of energetic $e^+/e^-$ in magnetic field. Two different kinds of sources of $e^+/e^-$, dark matter~(DM) annihilation and cosmic rays~(CR) related to massive stars, are taken into account in this paper. We fit the multiple low-frequency radio observations, from 19.7 MHz to 1.4 GHz, with a double power-law model $S_{nth} =S_{DM}(\frac {\nu}{\nu_{\star}})^{-\alpha_{DM}}+S_{CR}( \frac {\nu}{\nu_{\star}})^{-\alpha_{CR}} $. $\nu_{\star}$ is set to be $1.4$ GHz and $S_{CR}$ could be determined from the 24 $\mu m$ luminosity based on the global radio-infrared correlation. Our best fit with a fixed $\alpha_{CR}$ changing from $0.80$ to $0.55$ yields $\alpha_{DM}$ ranging from $0.21$ to $0.66$. Given a fixed value of $\alpha_{CR}$, we derive the upper limits of synchrotron emission induced by dark matter annihilation at different radio frequencies. Larger value of $\alpha_{CR}$ represents for a harder $e^+/e^-$ spectrum from cosmic rays, which leads to a smaller value of $\alpha_{DM}$ and allow less synchrotron emission resulted from dark matter annihilation in lower frequency. Under the same assumption on the magnetic field, we find that the lower the frequency, the stronger the restriction on DM parameter space. Meanwhile, as the peak frequency of synchrotron radiation decrease with the energy of $e^+/e^-$, constraints on DM properties obtained from lower frequency are more severe in the case of DM with lower mass. Future low-frequency radio survey should be considered a promising and powerful way to constrain DM.</description>

      <title>On electroweak metastability and Higgs inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the central values of the relevant experimental inputs, that is the strong coupling constant and the top quark and Higgs masses, the effective Higgs potential displays two minima, one at the electroweak scale and a deeper one at high energies. We review the phenomenology of the Higgs inflation model, extending the Standard Model to include a non-minimal coupling to gravity; as recently shown, even configurations that would be metastable in the Standard Model, become viable for inflation if the non-minimal coupling is large enough to flatten the Higgs potential at field values below the barrier between the minima.</description>

      <title>First Detection of Radio Emission from the Intermediate Mass Black Hole in POX 52: Deep Multi-Band Observations with ATCA and VLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first multi-band centimeter detection of POX 52, a nearby dwarf galaxy believed to habor a robust intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). We conducted the deep observations using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), spanning frequencies from 4.5 to 10 GHz, as well as the sensitive observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) operating in its most extended A-configuration at S band (2--4 GHz) and C band (4--8 GHz). In the ATCA observations, the source shows a compact morphology, with only one direction marginally resolved. The higher resolution of the VLA allowed us to slightly resolve the source, fitting it well with a two-dimensional Gaussian model. The detected radio emission confirms the presence of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity, indicating either a low-power jet or AGN-driven winds/outflows. Our dual-epoch observations with ATCA and VLA, together with previous non-detection flux density upper limits, reveal radio emission variability spanning two decades. In addition, we find that POX 52 aligns well with the low-mass extension of the fundamental plane for high-accretion, radio-quiet massive AGNs.</description>

      <title>The Outskirt Stellar Mass of Low-Redshift Massive Galaxies is an Excellent Halo Mass Proxy in Illustris/IllustrisTNG Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations suggest that the extended stellar halos of low-redshift massive galaxies are tightly connected to the assembly of their dark matter halos. In this paper, we use the Illustris, IllustrisTNG100, and IllustrisTNG300 simulations to compare how different stellar aperture masses trace halo mass. For massive central galaxies ($M_\star\geq 10^{11.2}M_\odot$), we find that a 2D outskirt stellar mass measured between 50 to 100 kpc ($M_{\star,[50,100]}$) consistently outperforms other aperture-based stellar masses. We further show that $M_{\star,[50,100]}$ correlates better with halo mass than the total amount of accreted stars (the ex situ mass), which suggests that not all accreted stars connect to halo assembly equally. While the galaxy formation recipes are different between Illustris and IllustrisTNG100, the two simulations yield consistent ex situ outskirt fractions for massive galaxies (about 70% in $M_{\star,[50,100]}$). These results demonstrate the potential of using the outskirt stellar mass to deepen our understanding of galaxy-halo connection in massive dark matter halos and trace dark matter halos better.</description>

      <title>Self-interactions of ultralight spinless dark matter to the rescue?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous observations on astrophysical and cosmological scales can be interpreted to mean that, in addition to the familiar kind of matter well described by the standard model of elementary particle physics, there exists Dark Matter (DM). The fundamental properties of the elementary particles which make up the DM e.g. particle mass, spin, couplings etc are currently being observationally constrained. In particular, if DM particles have spin zero, there exist recent constraints which suggest a lower limit on its mass which is often a couple of orders of magnitude larger than $10^{-22}$ eV. In this talk, we will (a) argue that these limits are based on the assumption that the self coupling of the spinless DM particles is negligible, and, (b) show how some of these lower limits will get modified in the presence of incredibly feeble self interactions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the impact of neutrino mass hierarchies on neutrino mass constraints in light of recent DESI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results from DESI combined with cosmic microwave background data give the tightest constraints on the sum of neutrino masses to date. However, these analyses approximate the neutrino mass hierarchy by three degenerate-mass (DM) neutrinos, instead of the normal (NH) and inverted hierarchies (IH) informed by terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments. Given the stringency of the upper limits from DESI data, we test explicitly whether the inferred neutrino constraints are robust to the choice of neutrino mass ordering using both Bayesian and frequentist methods. For Planck data alone, we find that the DM hierarchy presents a good approximation to the physically motivated hierarchies while showing a strong dependence on the assumed lower bound of the prior, confirming previous studies. For the combined Planck and DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data, we find that assuming NH ($M_\mathrm{tot} &lt; 0.13\,\mathrm{eV}$) or IH ($M_\mathrm{tot} &lt; 0.16\,\mathrm{eV}$) loosens the Bayesian upper limits compared to the DM approximation ($M_\mathrm{tot} &lt; 0.086\,\mathrm{eV}$). The frequentist analysis shows that the different neutrino models fit the data equally well and the loosening of the constraints can thus be attributed to the lower bounds induced by NH and IH. Overall, we find that the DM hierarchy presents a good approximation to the physically motivated hierarchies also for Planck+DESI data as long as the corresponding lower neutrino mass bounds are imposed.</description>

      <title>Loop Corrections in Gravitational Wave Spectrum in Single Field Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the one-loop corrections in power spectrum of long gravitational waves induced from small scale modes in the models of single field inflation undergoing a phase of ultra-slow-roll (USR). We show that the spectrum of long tensor perturbations are largely unaffected by the loop corrections from the short scalar modes. In particular, the spectrum of long tensor perturbations is insensitive to the sharpness of the transition from the USR phase to the final slow-roll phase. This is in contrast to the case of scalar power spectrum in which the loop corrections can be large for a sharp transition while it is slow-roll suppressed in a mild transition. We study the tensor-scalar-scalar bispectrum in the squeezed limit and demonstrate that the Maldacena consistency condition does hold.</description>

      <title>Weak Lensing Reconstruction by Counting DECaLS Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alternative to weak lensing measurements through cosmic shear, we present a weak lensing convergence $\hat{\kappa}$ map reconstructed through cosmic magnification effect in DECaLS galaxies of the DESI imaging surveys DR9. This is achieved by linearly weighing $12$ maps of galaxy number overdensity in different magnitude bins of $grz$ photometry bands. The weight is designed to eliminate the mean galaxy deterministic bias, minimize galaxy shot noise while maintaining the lensing convergence signal. We also perform corrections of imaging systematics in the galaxy number overdensity. The $\hat{\kappa}$ map has $8365$ deg$^2$ sky coverage. Given the low number density of DECaLS galaxies, the $\hat{\kappa}$ map is overwhelmed by shot noise and the map quality is difficult to evaluate using the lensing auto-correlation. Alternatively, we measure its cross-correlation with the cosmic shear catalogs of DECaLS galaxies of DESI imaging surveys DR8, which has $8365$ deg$^2$ overlap in sky coverage with the $\hat{\kappa}$ map. We detect a convergence-shear cross-correlation signal with $S/N\simeq 10$. The analysis also shows that the galaxy intrinsic clustering is suppressed by a factor $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ and the residual galaxy clustering contamination in the $\hat{\kappa}$ map is consistent with zero. Various tests with different galaxy and shear samples, and the Akaike information criterion analysis all support the lensing detection. So is the imaging systematics corrections, which enhance the lensing signal detection by $\sim 30\%$. We discuss various issues for further improvement of the measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the tension between cosmological models and JWST red candidate massive galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a Python tool to estimate the tail distribution of the number of dark matter halos beyond a mass threshold and in a given volume in a light-cone. The code is based on the extended Press-Schechter model and is computationally efficient, typically taking a few seconds on a personal laptop for a given set of cosmological parameters. The high efficiency of the code allows a quick estimation of the tension between cosmological models and the red candidate massive galaxies released by the James Webb Space Telescope, as well as scanning the theory space with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. As an example application, we use the tool to study the cosmological implication of the candidate galaxies presented in Labb\'e et al. (2023). The standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model is well consistent with the data if the star formation efficiency can reach $\sim 0.3$ at high redshift. For a low star formation efficiency $\epsilon \sim 0.1$, $\Lambda$CDM model is disfavored at $\sim 2\sigma$-$3\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how galaxy pairs are oriented in three dimensions within cosmic filaments using data from the EAGLE simulation. We identify filament spines using DisPerSE and isolate galaxies residing in filamentary environments. Employing a FoF algorithm, we delineate individual filaments and determine their axes by diagonalizing the moment of inertia tensor. The orientations of galaxy pairs relative to the axis of their host filament are analyzed. Our study covers diverse subsets of filaments identified through varying linking lengths, examining how galaxy pairs align with the filament axis across different spatial parameters such as pair separation and distance from the filament spine. We observe a nearly uniform probability distribution for the cosine of the orientation angle, which is nearly identical in each case. We also investigate the effects of redshift space distortions and confirm that the probability distributions remain uniform in both real space and redshift space. To validate our approach, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations using various theoretical probability distributions. Our analysis does not reveal any evidence of preferential alignment of galaxy pairs within cosmic filaments in hydrodynamical simulations.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the $S_8$ tension and evidence for interacting dark energy from redshift-space distortion measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations, Weak Lensing surveys, and $f\sigma_8(z)$ measurements from Redshift-Space Distortions (RSD) have revealed a significant ($\sim$3$-$5$\sigma$) discrepancy in the inferred value of the matter clustering parameter $S_8$. In this work, we investigate the implications of RSD for a cosmological framework postulating an interaction between Dark Energy (DE) and Dark Matter (DM). We explore scenarios where DM can transfer energy-momentum to DE or vice versa. The energy-momentum flow is characterized by the strength and the sign of the coupling parameter $\xi$. Our baseline analysis combines RSD measurements with the latest data from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) observed by DESI, Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus sample, and CMB data from Planck. We demonstrate that RSD measurements provide significant additional information imposing new and strong upper bounds on possible interaction in the dark sector. Models with $\xi &gt; 0$ can effectively alleviate the tension in $S_8$, presenting them as compelling alternatives.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the primordial curvature perturbations on small scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ has been measured with high precision on large scales $10^{-4}\lesssim k\lesssim 3~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, basing on the observations of cosmic microwave background, Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and large scale structure. On small scales $3\lesssim k \lesssim 10^{23}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, the constrains are mainly from the studies on the primordial black holes (PBHs). Specifically, on small scales $10^{17}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{23}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$, the limits arise from studies on the lightest supersymmetric particles produced by PBHs radiation and the stable Planck-mass relics after its evaporation. It has been demonstrated that the big bang nucleosynthesis can be used to constrain the initial fraction of PBHs with masses $10^{9}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{13}~{\rm g}$, corresponding to the scales $10^{16}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{18}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. Recently, on one hand, it is found that the evaporation of light PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{9}\rm g$) can modify the expansion rate of the Universe and the baryon-to-photon ratio, resulting in the influences on the primordial abundance of light nuclei. On the other hand, it has been proposed that the `memory burden' effect can slow down the mass loss rate of black hole (BH), leading to the existence of light PBHs by now. Based on the recent theoretical research process of BH and the limits on the (initial) mass fraction of light PBHs with masses $10^{4}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{10}~\rm g$, we derive new constraints on $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ on small scales $1.5\times 10^{18}\lesssim k\lesssim 2.5\times 10^{21}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, which are rarely studied in previous literature.</description>

Abstract: We present an analysis of 102 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in nearby (z &lt; 0.1), x-ray selected galaxy clusters. This is the largest such sample to date and is based on archival data primarily from ZTF and ATLAS. We divide our SNe Ia into an inner cluster sample projected within $r_{500}$ of the cluster center and an outer cluster sample projected between $r_{500}$ and $2\,r_{500}$. We compare these to field samples of SNe Ia at similar redshifts in both quiescent and star-forming host galaxies. Based on SALT3 fits to the light curves, we find that the inner cluster SNe Ia have a higher fraction of fast-evolving objects (SALT3 $x_1 &lt; -1$) than the outer cluster or field quiescent samples. This implies an intrinsically different population of SNe Ia occurs in inner cluster environments, beyond known correlations based on host galaxy alone. Our cluster samples show a strongly bimodal $x_1$ distribution with a fast-evolving component that dominates the inner cluster objects ($\gtrsim$ 75%) but is just a small fraction of SNe Ia in field star-forming galaxies ($\lesssim$ 10%). We do not see strong evidence for variations in the color (SALT3 $c$) distributions among the samples and find only minor differences in SN Ia standardization parameters and Hubble residuals. We suggest that the age of the stellar population drives the observed distributions, with the oldest populations nearly exclusively producing fast-evolving SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Source anisotropies and pulsar timing arrays</title>

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTA) hunt for gravitational waves (GW) by searching for the correlations that GWs induce in the time-of-arrival residuals from different pulsars. If the GW sources are of astrophysical origin, then they are located at discrete points on the sky. However, PTA data are often modeled, and subsequently analyzed, via a "standard Gaussian ensemble". That ensemble is obtained in the limit of an infinite density of vanishingly weak, Poisson-distributed sources. In this paper, we move away from that ensemble, to study the effects of two types of "source anisotropy". The first (a), which is often called "shot noise", arises because there are $N$ discrete GW sources at specific sky locations. The second (b) arises because the GW source positions are not a Poisson process, for example, because galaxy locations are clustered. Here, we quantify the impact of (a) and (b) on the mean and variance of the pulsar-averaged Hellings and Downs correlation. For conventional PTA sources, we show that the effects of shot noise (a) are much larger than the effects of clustering (b).</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis via Bubble Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel realization of leptogenesis from the decays of sterile (right-handed) neutrinos (RHNs) produced from runaway bubble collisions at a first order phase transition. Such configurations can produce heavy RHNs with mass many orders of magnitude above the scale of symmetry breaking as well as the temperature of the plasma, thereby enabling high scale leptogenesis without the need for high reheat temperatures while also naturally suppressing washout effects. This mechanism also extends the window of viability to RHN masses $\gtrsim 10^{14}$ GeV, the natural scale for type-I seesaw with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ couplings, where standard thermal leptogenesis cannot produce the observed baryon asymmetry. The corresponding phase transitions are at scales $\gtrsim\!10^9$ GeV and produce gravitational wave signals that could be detected by future experiments.</description>

      <title>Next-generation global gravitational-wave detector network: Impact of detector orientation on compact binary coalescence and stochastic gravitational-wave background searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, currently in their preparatory phase, have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics. We examine how the arm orientations of the proposed detectors influence the sensitivity of a combined Einstein Telescope - Cosmic Explorer network with respect to the sensitivity to the stochastic gravitational-wave background and compact binary coalescences, where measuring both gravitational-wave polarizations is favorable. We present a method to optimize the arm orientations in the network for these two targets, and also demonstrate how to achieve a balanced configuration for both stochastic background and compact binary coalescence searches. For five specific network configurations, we explicitly compare the sensitivity to the stochastic background and binary neutron star mergers. For the latter, we conduct Bayesian parameter estimation on the extrinsic parameters of a reference binary neutron star system to assess sky localization and distance estimation capabilities. These are illustrated through efficiency curves showing the fraction of events meeting sky localization and distance uncertainty criteria as a function of redshift. Our findings suggest that globally coordinating efforts towards the next-generation gravitational-wave detector network is advantageous.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Galaxies or Cirrus? Decomposition of Galactic Cirrus in Deep Wide-Field Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffuse Galactic cirrus, or Diffuse Galactic Light (DGL), can be a prominent component in the background of deep wide-field imaging surveys. The DGL provides unique insights into the physical and radiative properties of dust grains in our Milky Way, and it also serves as a contaminant on deep images, obscuring the detection of background sources such as low surface brightness galaxies. However, it is challenging to disentangle the DGL from other components of the night sky. In this paper, we present a technique for the photometric characterization of Galactic cirrus, based on (1) extraction of its filamentary or patchy morphology and (2) incorporation of color constraints obtained from Planck thermal dust models. Our decomposition method is illustrated using a $\sim$10 deg$^2$ imaging dataset obtained by the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, and its performance is explored using various metrics which characterize the flatness of the sky background. As a concrete application of the technique, we show how removal of cirrus allows low surface brightness galaxies to be identified on cirrus-rich images. We also show how modeling the cirrus in this way allows optical DGL intensities to be determined with high radiometric precision.</description>
