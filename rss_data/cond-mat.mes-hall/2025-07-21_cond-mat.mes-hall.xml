      <title>The Hofstadter Butterfly: Bridging Condensed Matter, Topology, and Number Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Celebrating its golden jubilee, the Hofstadter butterfly fractal emerges as a remarkable fusion of art and science. This iconic X shaped fractal captivates physicists, mathematicians, and enthusiasts alike by elegantly illustrating the energy spectrum of electrons within a two dimensional crystal lattice influenced by a magnetic field. Enriched with integers of topological origin that serve as quanta of Hall conductivity, this quantum fractal and its variations have become paradigm models for topological insulators, novel states of matter in 21st century physics. This paper delves into the theoretical framework underlying butterfly fractality through the lenses of geometry and number theory. Within this poetic mathematics, we witness a rare form of quantum magic: Natures use of abstract fractals in crafting the butterfly graph itself. In its simplest form, the butterfly graph tessellates a two dimensional plane with trapezoids and triangles, where the quanta of Hall conductivity are embedded in the integer sloped diagonals of the trapezoids. The theoretical framework is succinctly expressed through unimodular matrices with integer coefficients, bringing to life abstract constructs such as the Farey tree, the Apollonian gaskets, and the Pythagorean triplet tree.</description>

      <title>Spin-Electric Control of Individual Molecules on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual magnetic molecules are promising building blocks for quantum technologies because of their chemical tunability, nanoscale dimensions, and ability to self-assemble into ordered arrays. However, harnessing their properties in quantum information processing requires precise local control of their spin properties. In this work, we present spin-electric coupling (SEC) for two molecular spin systems, iron phthalocyanine (FePc) and Fe-FePc complexes, adsorbed on a surface. We use electron spin resonance combined with scanning tunnelling microscopy (ESR-STM) to locally address them with the STM tip and electrically tune them using the applied bias voltage. These measurements reveal a pronounced nonlinear voltage dependence of the resonance frequency, linked to the energic onset of other molecular orbitals. We attribute this effect to a transport-mediated exchange field from the magnetic tip, providing a large, highly localized, and broadly applicable SEC mechanism. Finally, we demonstrate that the SEC enables all-electrical coherent spin control: In Rabi oscillation measurements of both single and coupled Fe-FePc complexes we show that the spin dynamics can be tuned, demonstrating a pathway towards electrically controlled quantum operation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Coherence with a Clock Transition and Dynamical Decoupling in the Cr$_7$Mn Molecular Nanomagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular magnets are attractive as spin qubits due to their chemical tunability, addressability through electron-spin resonance techniques, and long coherence times. Clock transitions (CTs), for which the system is immune to the effect of magnetic-field fluctuations to first order, provide a method to enhance the coherence time $T_2$, and to reveal mechanisms of decoherence that are not due to such fluctuations. Here we investigate two variants of Cr$_7$Mn, a spin-1 molecular nanomagnet, at fields near a zero-field CT. We find that at temperatures $\le$2 K, $T_2\sim1$ $\mu$s at the CT using a Hahn-echo pulse sequence. Away from the CT, electron-spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) oscillations due to coupling to nuclear spins are observed and have a $T_2$ as high as $1.35$ $\mu$s, indicating a distinct mechanism of coherence preservation. Dynamical decoupling with the CPMG pulse sequence yields $T_2\sim\!2.8$ $\mu$s at the CT and up to $\sim\!3.6$ $\mu$s in the ESEEM regime along with a demodulation of the oscillatory behavior. The experimental values of $T_2$ are largely independent of the degree of dilution of the molecules in solvent or whether the solvent is deuterated, indicating that much of the decoherence and ESEEM arises from sources within the molecules themselves. To account for decoherence, we develop a model that includes not only field fluctuations but also fluctuations in the CT transition frequency itself. Our results can be well explained by treating the environment as a combination of noise at the nuclear Larmor precession frequency and $1/f$ noise in the transverse anisotropy parameter $E$. Such information about the microscopic origins of decoherence can aid the rational design of molecular-based spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Resonant two-qubit gates for fermionic simulations with spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In gate-defined semiconductor spin qubits, the highly tunable Heisenberg exchange interaction is leveraged to implement fermionic two-qubit gates such as CZ and SWAP. However, the broader family of fermionic simulation (fSim) gates remains unexplored, and has the potential to enhance the performance of near-term quantum simulation algorithms. Here, we demonstrate a method to implement the fSim gate set in spin qubits using a single pulse combining baseband and resonant exchange drives. This approach minimizes gate duration and drive amplitude, mitigating decoherence and crosstalk. We validate its effectiveness by realizing a resonant iSWAP gate between two hole spins in germanium, achieving a fidelity of 93.8(5)% extracted with interleaved randomized benchmarking. Quantum process tomography confirms accurate gate calibration and identifies qubit decoherence as the dominant error source. Our results establish a practical route toward a versatile and efficient two-qubit gate set for spin-based quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Intraband circular photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the semiclassical theory including the Berry curvature dipole, side jumps and skew scattering for a quantitative description of the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals at intraband absorption. In contrast to gapped systems where they completely exhaust all contributions to the CPGE current, all previously known semiclassical mechanisms give a result different from that obtained using a complete quantum-mechanical approach. We show that this difference in the existing quasiclassical and full quantum-mechanical approaches persists at all spatial ranges of the disorder potential. Apparently, the implementation of another microscopic mechanism into the quasiclassical description of the CPGE is required.</description>

      <title>Resonant Photoluminescence of Quantum Incompressible Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate resonant photoluminescence arising from incompressible quantum liquids formed in two-dimensional electron systems. We demonstrate that, for excitons composed of a photoexcited electron occupying the upper spin sublevel of the zeroth Landau level and a valence-band hole, the influence of disorder potential fluctuations on optical recombination is strongly suppressed, indicating complete screening of the disorder. We identify an optical invariant quantity that is insensitive to excitation energy yet strongly dependent on the electron temperature, serving as a probe of exciton recombination in quantum liquids. Analysis of this quantity reveals that quantum-liquid formation initiates at (n = 1/3) as the electron temperature decreases, consistent with the Laughlin state. Upon further cooling, the range of filling factors exhibiting quantum-liquid behavior expands continuously from (n = 1/3) toward (n = 1/2). Transitions between distinct incompressible quantum-liquid states occur smoothly, without well-defined phase boundaries separating insulating and conducting regimes. Locally, the system retains quantum-liquid characteristics even as bulk transport measurements indicate finite conductivity. Finally, we present a phase diagram delineating the stability region of incompressible quantum liquids relative to conductive phases.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Surface States of $Fe_3O_4$ Nanoparticles for Enhanced Magnetic Anisotropy and Induction Efficacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetite ($Fe_3O_4$) nanoparticles are crucial for biomedical applications, including magnetic hyperthermia, targeted drug delivery, and MRI contrast enhancement, due to their biocompatibility and unique physicochemical properties. Here, we investigate how surface states influence their induction performance. Heat treatment removes surface water and FeOOH, forming a ${\gamma}$-$Fe_2O_3$ shell, as confirmed by synchrotron powder diffraction, neutron powder diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and time-of-flight inelastic neutron spectroscopy. AC magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that this surface modification enhances magnetic anisotropy and reduces the spin relaxation time, leading to a 140% increase in the specific absorption rate. Additionally, the increased anisotropy suppresses the low-temperature clustered spin-glass transition and raises the blocking temperature. These findings highlight surface-state engineering as a powerful approach to optimizing $Fe_3O_4$ nanoparticles for biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Alignment behavior of 2D diopsides (d-silicates) under the influence of an AC electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the alignment of two dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for optimizing their electronic and mechanical properties in next generation devices. This study explores how electric fields can manipulate the orientation of 2D diopside (CaMgSi2O6) flakes, a flexible silicate material, through a phenomenon called flexoelectricity, where applied voltage generates mechanical strain. We exfoliated diopside crystals into ultrathin flakes, placed them on microelectrodes, and used AC electric fields to induce alignment via acoustic strain. Raman spectroscopy showed that the flakes reoriented/realigned under the field, with vibrational peaks weakening most at high frequencies (10 MHz). Electrical tests revealed this alignment improves conductivity by 20-30%, as straightened flakes create better pathways for current flow. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations further explained how these flakes naturally align on surfaces within picoseconds, matching our experimental observations. Together, these findings demonstrate a practical way to tune diopside properties using electric fields, opening doors for its use in flexible electronics, sensors, and energy devices.</description>

      <title>Density Matrix Geometry and Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometry plays a fundamental role in a wide range of physical responses, from anomalous transport coefficients to their related sum rules. Notable examples include the quantization of the Hall conductivity and the Souza-Wilkens-Martin (SWM) sum rule -- both valid at zero temperature, independent of interactions and disorder. The finite-temperature generalization of the SWM sum rule has been explored in the literature, revealing deep connections to the geometry of density matrices. Building on recent advances in time-dependent geometric frameworks, we propose a time-dependent quantum geometric tensor for thermal density matrices. This formalism provides a unified interpretation of known sum rules within the framework of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, further elucidating their fundamental geometric origin. In addition, it provides experimentally accessible methods to probe quantum geometry beyond the zero-temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Predicting interface and spin states in armchair graphene nanoribbon junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of interface states emerging at junctions between armchair graphene nanoribbons of varying widths. By exploring diverse width combinations and junction geometries, we demonstrate that predicting the precise number of interface states requires considerations beyond the topological classification alone; specifically, the width differences and bonding configuration at the interface play crucial roles. For junctions involving ribbons with small gaps, we further examine how an applied strain affects their topological properties and, consequently, the interface states formed. The spin states at these junctions are investigated using the mean-field Hubbard model, revealing how the magnetic behavior at the interface depends on the number of localized states present. These results are summarized in a series of ``rules of thumb" to predict the number of localized states and the magnetic moment at the junction. Our findings contribute to understanding and engineering localized states in graphene-based devices, providing guidelines for manipulating electronic and magnetic properties through structural design.</description>

      <title>Emergent topology by Landau level mixing in quantum Hall-superconductor nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence of novel topological phases in quantum Hall-superconductor hybrid systems driven by Landau level mixing and spin-orbit interactions. Focusing on a narrow superconducting stripe atop a two-dimensional electron gas, we identify regimes where the hybridization of the chiral Andreev states at each side of the stripe leads to different phases beyond the long sought $p$-wave superconducting one. These topological phases exhibit distinctive transport signatures, including quantized nonlocal conductance arising from electron cotunneling at filling factor $\nu=1$, which can coexist with quantized crossed Andreev reflection at $\nu=2$. A combination of numerical simulations and effective modelling reveals the role of spin-orbit coupling and stripe geometry in controlling these transitions. Our findings suggest new strategies for realizing and detecting topology in proximized quantum Hall devices.</description>

      <title>Fast charge noise sensing using a spectator valley state in a singlet-triplet qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor spin qubits are a promising platform for quantum computing but remain vulnerable to charge noise. Accurate, in situ measurement of charge noise could enable closed-loop control and improve qubit performance. Here, we propose a method for real-time detection of charge noise using a silicon singlet-triplet qubit with one electron initialized in an excited valley state. This valley excitation acts as a spectator degree of freedom, coupled to a high-quality resonator via the exchange interaction, which is sensitive to charge-noise-induced voltage fluctuations. Dispersive readout of the resonator enables a continuous, classical measurement of exchange fluctuations during qubit operation. Signal-to-noise analysis shows that, under realistic device parameters, sub-microsecond measurement times are possible using a quantum-limited amplifier. Even without such an amplifier, sub-millisecond performance is achievable with appropriately engineered resonator parameters. This approach allows the probe to monitor slow drift in exchange in real time, opening the door to feedback and feedforward strategies for maintaining high-fidelity quantum operations. Importantly, the protocol preserves spin coherence and can be run concurrently with qubit logic gates.</description>

      <title>Anyonic analogue of optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anyonic interferometry is a direct probe of fractional statistics. We propose an interferometry geometry that parallels an optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer and offers several advantages over existing interferometry schemes. In contrast to the currently studied electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer, our setup has no drain inside the device so that the trapped topological charge is time-independent. In contrast to electronic Fabry-P\'erot interferometry, anyons cannot go around the device more than once. Thus, the interference signal has a straightforward interpretation in terms of anyonic statistical phases. The proposed geometry suppresses the undesirable effects of bulk-edge coupling. Moreover, the setup allows for simple exact solutions for the electric current and noise for an arbitrary quasiparticle tunneling strength in a broad range of conditions. The structure of the solutions is similar to that for non-interacting electrons but reflects fractional charge and statistics. We present results for electric current and noise in Jain states and address thermal interferometry at zero voltage bias.</description>

Abstract: We investigate qubits coupled to the boundary of a two dimensional photonic lattice that supports dispersionless edge modes, unlike conventional edge modes that sustain propagating photons. As a case study, we consider a honeycomb lattice (photonic graphene) of coupled resonators with a zigzag edge, where the edge modes form a flat band defined only over a restricted region of momentum space. We show that light matter interactions are effectively captured by a dissipative cavity QED model, wherein the emitter coherently couples to a fictitious cavity mode emerging as a superposition of edge modes. This mode has support on only one sublattice and, most notably, displays an unconventional power law localization around the qubit, yet remaining normalizable in the thermodynamic limit, with a spatial range that can be tuned by introducing lattice anisotropy We predict occurrence of vacuum Rabi oscillations and efficient state transfer between distant emitters. An experimental demonstration using superconducting circuits is proposed.</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature Surface Exciton Polaritons in Colloidal J-Aggregate Flakes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: J-aggregates are promising organic materials for nanophotonic applications due to their excitonic properties and ability to support surface exciton polaritons at room temperature, providing a robust platform for nanoscale light manipulation. While thin films composed of J-aggregates have demonstrated these advantages, colloidal J-aggregate nanoparticles remain underexplored. Herein, we report the synthesis of colloidal J-aggregate flakes by electrostatic interaction of cyanine molecules (TDBC) and oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride, PDDA). These flakes exhibit colloidal stability maintaining the J-aggregate conformation even in solvents that favoured their monomeric state. The characterization of the colloidal J-aggregate flakes reveals their capability to support surface exciton polaritons at room temperature. This was further confirmed at single-particle level by observing an angular-independent Reststrahlen band near the excitonic resonance. In addition, the colloidal flakes exhibit a strong scattering component that broadens the extinction band and redshifts the photoluminescence, indicating that the colloidal architecture influences the optical response. These findings introduce a versatile colloidal system for constructing excitonic nanostructures tailored for advanced photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Ex Situ Fabrication of Superconducting Nanostructures for Low-Temperature STM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanofabrication enables flexible experimental design but is often incompatible with scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) due to the latter's stringent surface quality requirements. Here, we present a fabrication strategy that combines ex situ nanolithography with in situ ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) cleaving to produce atomically clean, nanopatterned superconductor/topological insulator (TI) heterostructures suitable for high-resolution STM/STS. In our initial Design I, nanoribbons were defined by etching trenches into a TI film, followed by niobium capping and sample flipping before cleaving. This enabled STM/STS to be applied in large areas, although edge quality was limited by etch debris. To overcome this, we developed Design II, which avoids etching through the film by locally thinning it, leaving nanoscale ribbons raised above a continuous TI layer, followed again by Nb capping and sample flipping before cleaving. This method yields clean, reproducible nanostructures with well-defined superconducting gaps, demonstrating a reliable fabrication pathway for high-resolution STM/STS studies of nanoscale topological devices.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Order and Parametric Instabilities from First-Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shaping crystal structure with light is an enduring goal of physics and materials engineering. Here we present calculations in candidate materials selected by symmetry that allow light-induced spatiotemporal parametric instabilities. We demonstrate a theoretical framework that includes a complete symmetry analysis of phonon modes that contribute to parametric instabilities across all non-centrosymmetric point groups, a detailed survey of the materials landscape and finally the computation of nonlinear couplings from first principles. We then showcase detailed results for chiral crystals, ferroelectrics, and layered van der Waals materials. Our results pave the way towards realizing designer time-crystalline order in quantum materials, detectable with time-resolved diffractive probes.</description>

      <title>Design of superparamagnetic nanoparticle-materials for high-frequency inductor cores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13407v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The progress in the semiconductor industry has resulted in great demand for high-frequency magnetic materials applicable in microfabricated inductor cores. Nanocomposite materials, containing magnetic nanoparticles in a non-conducting matrix, may provide a solution for materials with high susceptibility or permeability and low power loss in the MHz regime, where traditional ferrites fail in performance. Here, we present a design guide for usage of magnetic nanoparticles in such materials. We use statistical mechanics methods to derive the magnetic susceptibility of nanoparticles in case of uniaxial or cubic anisotropy, as function of particle size and applied field direction, and investigate shape and interaction effects on the susceptibility. Using the derived susceptibilities, with inductor-core applications in mind, we show that close-to-spherical particles of materials with high saturation magnetization and low magnetic anisotropy, such as FeNi$_3$, are optimal. Additionally, the particle size shall be optimized to be as large as possible while maintaining superparamagnetic behaviour at the relevant frequency. Based on this, we predict that high particle susceptibilities of $&gt;$700 (/$&gt;$1500) are possible for randomly oriented (/uniaxially aligned) 20$\pm$1 nm diameter FeNi$_3$ particles, together with high-frequency stability, shown by low out-of-phase component at 2 MHz. This implies that materials containing nanoparticles have the potential to be tuned to outperform state-of-the-art ferrite inductor-core materials at MHz-frequencies.</description>

      <title>Quantitatively predicting angle-resolved polarized Raman intensity of anisotropic layered materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy provides insights into optical anisotropy and symmetry-related electron-photon/electron-phonon couplings of anisotropic layered materials (ALMs). However, since their discovery over ten years ago, ARPR responses in ALM flakes has exhibited a puzzling dependence on flake thickness, excitation wavelength, and dielectric environment, complicating their understanding and prediction. By taking black phosphorus (BP) (large than 20 nm) flakes and four-layer Td-WTe2 as examples, this study introduces intrinsic Raman tensors (Rint) and proposes strategies to predict the ARPR intensity profiles of thick and atomically-thin ALM flakes by considering birefringence, linear dichroism and multilayer interference inside multilayered structures with experimentally determined complex refractive indexes along in-plane axes and complex tensor elements of Rint for the corresponding phonon modes. The tensor elements of effective Raman tensors (Reff), which are directly linked to the polarization vectors of incident and scattered light outside the ALM surface, were derived to quantitatively predict ARPR intensity for these ALM flakes, showing intricate dependence on ALM thickness, dielectric substrates, and excitation wavelengths. This framework can be extended to other ALM flakes from atomically-thin layers to bulk limit, facilitating comprehensive prediction of their ARPR intensity regardless of layer-dependent electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Exchange Field of Surface Spin Impurities via DC Voltages</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in scanning probe microscopy have demonstrated the quantum-coherent manipulation of individual spins on surfaces using oscillating AC voltages. At the same time, the role of the static voltage in such control schemes remains unclear. Here, we show how the static contribution can be utilized to control the resonance of electronic transitions via an effective exchange field model based on a non-equilibrium transport formalism. We demonstrate that the magnitude and direction of the exchange field can be tuned and turned off by changing the applied bias voltage. Furthermore, our model can accurately reproduce the observed resonance frequency shifts at different magnetic field geometries for two different spin $S=1/2$ adsorbates. This work enables fast and precise control of the quantum states of surface spins at the atomic scale which will aid in developing spin-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Demagnetisation effects in single-domain particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the classical laws of magnetism, the shape of magnetically soft objects limits the effective susceptibility. For example, spherical soft magnets cannot display an effective susceptibility larger than 3. Although true for macroscopic multi-domain magnetic materials, we explain why magnetic nanoparticles in a single-domain state do not suffer from this limitation. We show that the differences between demagnetisation factors along principal axes are relevant and can influence susceptibility for single-domain particles, but do not limit the susceptibility as in the case for multi-domain particles. We validate this result experimentally on spherical nanoparticles with varying diameter (8 to 150 nm) and varying volume fraction (0.1 to 47 vol%). In agreement with our predictions, we measure susceptibilities largely above 3, in fact up to more than 250, for single-domain particles. Moreover, contrary to an existing model, we find that the susceptibility of non-interacting single-domain particles in a non-magnetic matrix scales simply linearly with the volume fraction of particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin waves in ferromagnetic materials are predominantly characterized by right-handed circular polarization due to symmetry breaking induced by net magnetization. However, magnetic interactions, including the external magnetic field, Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and dipole-dipole interaction, can modify this behavior, leading to elliptical polarization. This study provides a systematic analysis of these interactions and their influence on spin wave polarization, establishing principles to predict traits such as polarization degree and orientation based on equilibrium magnetization textures. The framework is applied to diverse magnetic configurations, including spin spirals, domain walls, and Skyrmions, offering a comprehensive yet simple approach to understanding polarization dynamics in ferromagnetic systems.</description>

Abstract: Crystal structure symmetry of Fe-deficient $\text{Fe}_{\text{2.9}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ at room temperature has been investigated by a combination of selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) and convergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED). By symmetry analysis of CBED patterns along different zone axis, the space group of $\text{Fe}_{\text{2.9}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ at room-temperature has been identified as $P6_3mc$ (No.186), which derives from the high-symmetry parent system $\text{Fe}_{\text{3}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ ($P6_3/mmc$) by breaking the mirror symmetry along the six-fold rotation axis. The $P3m1$ (No.156) space group previously reported for $\text{Fe}_{\text{2.9}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ is a subgroup of $P6_3mc$ suggesting further possible symmetry breaks in this non-stochiometric system.</description>

Abstract: Controlling electron's spin and orbital degrees of freedom has been a major research focus over the past two decades, as it underpins the electrical manipulation of magnetization. Leveraging a recently introduced quantum kinetic theory of multiband systems [T. Valet and R. Raimondi, Phys. Rev. B 111, L041118 (2025)], we outline how the intrinsic angular momenta linear response is partitioned into intraband and interband contributions. Focusing on time reversal and inversion symmetric metals, we show that the spin and orbital Hall currents are purely intraband. We also reveal that the edge densities originate partially, and in the orbital case mostly, from a new interband mechanism. We discuss how this profoundly impacts the interpretation of orbital edge accumulation observations, and has broader implications for our understanding of current induced torques.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast thermal boundary conductance under large temperature discontinuities of ultrathin epitaxial Pb films on Si(111)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat transfer is a critical aspect of modern electronics, and a deeper understanding of the underlying physics is essential for building faster, smaller, and more powerful devices with an improved performance and efficiency. In such nanoscale structures the heat transfer between two materials is limited by the finite thermal boundary conductance across their interface. Using ultrafast electron diffraction under grazing incidence we investigated the heat transfer from ultrathin epitaxial Pb films to an Si(111) substrate under strong non-equilibrium conditions. Applying an intense femtosecond laser pulse, the 5-7 ML thin Pb film experiences a strong heat up by 10-120 K while the Si substrate remains cold at $\approx$ 10 K. At such large temperature discontinuities we observe a significantly faster cooling for stronger excited Pb films. The decrease of the corresponding cooling time constant is explained through the thermal boundary conductance in the framework of the diffuse mismatch model. The thermal boundary conductance is reduced by more than a factor of three in comparison with Pb films grown on H-terminated substrates, pointing out the importance of the morphology of substrate, film and their interface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The digital version of adiabatic quantum computing enhanced by counterdiabatic driving, known as digitized counterdiabatic quantum computing, has emerged as a paradigm that opens the door to fast and low-depth algorithms. In this work, we explore the extension of this paradigm to high-dimensional systems. Specifically, we consider qutrits in the context of quadratic problems, obtaining the qutrit Hamiltonian codifications and the counterdiabatic drivings. Our findings show that qutrits can improve the solution quality up to 90 times compared to the qubit counterpart. We tested our proposal on 1000 random instances of the multiway number partitioning, max 3-cut, and portfolio optimization problems, demonstrating that, in general, without prior knowledge, it is better to use qutrits and, apparently, high-dimensional systems in general instead of qubits. Finally, considering the state-of-the-art quantum platforms, we show the experimental feasibility of our high-dimensional counterdiabatic quantum algorithms at least in a fully digital form. This work paves the way for the efficient codification of optimization problems in high-dimensional spaces and their efficient implementation using counterdiabatic quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: We report the formation of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex crystal in the tetrahedral antiferromagnetic order on a triangular lattice. The noncoplanar tetrahedral state consists of four sublattices with spins oriented along the faces of a tetrahedron in spin space. The long-range order characterized by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology arises due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and appears at zero temperature and without external fields. Each vortex carries a half-integer topological charge relative to the noncoplanar tetrahedral state, enabling the emergence of anyonic excitations. Its magnetic excitations include magnetically active gyrotropic and breathing modes, which -- under an external magnetic field -- carry nontrivial Chern numbers that stabilize chiral magnon edge states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron irradiation in structural alloys promotes defect clustering, which suppresses plasticity and triggers a ductile-to-brittle transition (DBT), a key degradation mechanism limiting fracture resistance in nuclear materials. This study investigates the fracture mechanisms underlying this transition in irradiated Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. Using Molecular Dynamics simulations, we examine how different defect types influence crack propagation and energy dissipation mechanisms. The results reveal distinct roles of these defects: voids facilitate crack growth by reducing local cohesive energy, while dislocation loops act as barriers that impede crack advancement and redirect crack paths, significantly altering crack morphology. Building on the classical approach of separating fracture energy into brittle cleavage and plastic components, this study adapts the decomposition to irradiated materials.

      <title>Particle deposit patterns from evaporation of a sessile colloidal droplet</title>

Abstract: The present work investigates numerically the transport of colloidal particles within an evaporating sessile droplet and their deposition on the substrate in unfavourable conditions. The coupled phenomena of fluid flow and heat and mass transfer with phase change are modelled by taking into account for the evaporative cooling effect, the surface tension gradient effect at liquid air interface and the particles-substrate interaction effect due to DLVO attractive forces.The results show that in presence of the particles-substrate interaction, the outward radial internal flow is the main responsible for the coffee ring effect giving rise a ring like pattern with inner traces, while the thermal Marangoni internal flow reduces this effect giving rise a uniform deposit with a dark periphery.</description>

      <title>Fibonacci Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics</title>

Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a powerful framework for engineering quantum interactions, traditionally relying on periodic photonic arrays with continuous energy bands. Here, we investigate waveguide QED in a fundamentally different environment: A one-dimensional photonic array whose hopping strengths are structured aperiodically according to the deterministic Fibonacci-Lucas substitution rule. These "Fibonacci waveguides" lack translational invariance and are characterized by a singular continuous energy spectrum and critical eigenstates, representing a deterministic intermediate between ordered and disordered systems. We demonstrate how to achieve decoherence-free, coherent interactions in this unique setting. We analyze two paradigmatic cases: (i) Giant emitters resonantly coupled to the simplest aperiodic version of a standard waveguide. For these, we show that atom photon bound states form only for specific coupling configurations dictated by the aperiodic sequence, leading to an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which itself inherits the Fibonacci structure; and (ii) emitters locally and off-resonantly coupled to the aperiodic version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide. In this case the mediating bound states feature aperiodically modulated profiles, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian with multifractal properties. Our work establishes Fibonacci waveguides as a versatile platform, which is experimentally feasible, demonstrating that the deterministic complexity of aperiodic structures can be directly engineered into the interactions between quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Triplet Exciton-driven Topological Mott insulator at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by experiments in which the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) charge gap greatly exceeds the Curie temperature, we apply determinantal quantum Monte Carlo to two complementary lattice models with different geometries: the checkerboard quantum-spin-Hall-Hubbard model and the generalized Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. In both cases an incompressible QAH phase with total Chern number $C=\pm 1$ emerges at quarter filling well above the Curie temperature. Each spin channel carries its own nonquantized Chern number while remaining only partly filled, revealing a topological Mott insulator where Mottness opens the charge gap before magnetic order appears. Charge excitations bind triplet excitons that suppress net magnetization, a many-body dynamical effect absent in mean-field theory. The concurrence of these results on two very different models shows that coupling Mottness with band topology generically yields a high-temperature QAH insulator whose charge excitations are dressed by triplet excitons.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Triple-q State in Antiferromagnetic Monolayer Interfaced with Bismuthene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have successfully fabricated the bismuthene covered Mn monolayer on Ag(111) by evaporating Mn atoms onto (p x root3)-Bi/Ag(111) at room temperature. By using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM), we have resolved the magnetic triple-q (3Q) state. In combination with density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, the 3Q3-like spin texture is the magnetic ground state for the bismuthene covered Mn monolayer/Ag(111). Interestingly, the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of 3Q3 state triggered by the bismuthene on top of Mn monolayer/Ag(111) has been revealed, which is consistent with the switching of 3Q3up and 3Q3down domains observed by SP-STM measurements with external magnetic fields.</description>
