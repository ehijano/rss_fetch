      <title>Jupiter Evolutionary Models Incorporating Stably Stratified Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the issue of which broad set of initial conditions for the planet Jupiter best matches the current presence of a ``fuzzy core" of heavy elements, while at the same time comporting with measured parameters such as its effective temperature, atmospheric helium abundance, radius, and atmospheric metallicity. Our focus is on the class of fuzzy cores that can survive convective mixing to the present day and on the unique challenges of an inhomogeneous Jupiter with stably-stratified regions now demanded by the \textit{Juno} gravity data. Hence, using the new code \texttt{APPLE}, we attempt to put a non-adiabatic Jupiter into an evolutionary context. This requires not only a mass density model, the major relevant byproduct of the \textit{Juno} data, but a thermal model that is subject to interior heat transport, a realistic atmospheric flux boundary, a helium rain algorithm, and the latest equation of state. The result is a good fit to most major thermal, compositional, and structural constraints that still preserve a fuzzy core and that should inform future more detailed models of the current Jupiter in the context of its evolution from birth.</description>

      <title>The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A transiting planet invites us to measure its size, mass, orbital parameters, atmospheric composition, and other characteristics. But the invitation can only be accepted if the host star is bright enough for precise measurements of its flux and spectrum. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is dedicated to finding such favorable systems. Operating from a 13.7-day elliptical orbit around the Earth, TESS uses four 10.5 cm telescopes to capture optical images of a 24 x 96 degree field of view. By shifting the field of view every 27 days, TESS can survey most of the sky every few years. In its first six years, TESS has identified approximately 7,000 planet candidates, with several hundred confirmed as planets. Mass measurements of these planets allow astronomers to differentiate between rocky "super-Earths" and gas-rich or volatile-rich "mini-Neptunes," while observations with the James Webb Space Telescope are revealing the secrets of their atmospheres. TESS has discovered planets orbiting a wide range of stars, including young stars, low-mass stars, binary stars, and even a white dwarf star. Beyond planet detection, TESS probes the optical variability of stars and a diverse array of other astronomical objects, including asteroids, comets, supernovae, and active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Applying Astronomical Solutions and Milankovi{\'c} Forcing in the Earth Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical solutions provide calculated orbital and rotational parameters of solar system bodies based on the dynamics and physics of the solar system. Application of astronomical solutions in the Earth sciences has revolutionized our understanding in at least two areas of active research. (i) The Astronomical (or Milankovic) forcing of climate on time scales &gt; ~10 kyr and (ii) the dating of geologic archives. The latter has permitted the development of the astronomical time scale, widely used today to reconstruct highly accurate geological dates and chronologies. The tasks of computing vs. applying astronomical solutions are usually performed by investigators from different backgrounds, which has led to confusion and recent inaccurate results on the side of the applications. Here we review astronomical solutions and Milankovic forcing in the Earth sciences, primarily aiming at clarifying the astronomical basis, applicability, and limitations of the solutions. We provide a summary of current up-to-date and outdated astronomical solutions and their valid time span. We discuss the fundamental limits imposed by dynamical solar system chaos on astronomical calculations and geological/astrochronological applications. We illustrate basic features of chaotic behavior using a simple mechanical system, i.e., the driven pendulum. Regarding so-called astronomical "metronomes", we point out that the current evidence does not support the notion of generally stable and prominent metronomes for universal use in astrochronology and cyclostratigraphy. We also describe amplitude and frequency modulation of astronomical forcing signals and the relation to their expression in cyclostratigraphic sequences. Furthermore, the various quantities and terminology associated with Earth's axial precession are discussed in detail. Finally, we provide some suggestions regarding practical considerations.</description>

      <title>Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). XIV. Finding terrestrial protoplanets in the galactic neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increased brightness temperature of young rocky protoplanets during their magma ocean epoch makes them potentially amenable to atmospheric characterization to distances from the solar system far greater than thermally equilibrated terrestrial exoplanets, offering observational opportunities for unique insights into the origin of secondary atmospheres and the near surface conditions of prebiotic environments. The Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) mission will employ a space-based mid-infrared nulling interferometer to directly measure the thermal emission of terrestrial exoplanets. Here, we seek to assess the capabilities of various instrumental design choices of the LIFE mission concept for the detection of cooling protoplanets with transient high-temperature magma ocean atmospheres, in young stellar associations in particular. Using the LIFE mission instrument simulator (LIFEsim) we assess how specific instrumental parameters and design choices, such as wavelength coverage, aperture diameter, and photon throughput, facilitate or disadvantage the detection of protoplanets. We focus on the observational sensitivities of distance to the observed planetary system, protoplanet brightness temperature using a blackbody assumption, and orbital distance of the potential protoplanets around both G- and M-dwarf stars. Our simulations suggest that LIFE will be able to detect (S/N $\geq$ 7) hot protoplanets in young stellar associations up to distances of $\approx$100 pc from the solar system for reasonable integration times (up to $\sim$hours). Detection of an Earth-sized protoplanet orbiting a solar-sized host star at 1 AU requires less than 30 minutes of integration time. M-dwarfs generally need shorter integration times. The contribution from wavelength regions $&lt;$6 $\mu$m is important for decreasing the detection threshold and discriminating emission temperatures.</description>

      <title>Analysing the Onset of Cometary Activity by the Jupiter-Family Comet 2023 RN3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize serendipitous observations from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in addition to targeted follow-up observations from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) and Liverpool Telescope to analyze the first observed instance of cometary activity by the newly-discovered Jupiter-family comet C/2023 RN3 (ATLAS), whose orbital dynamics place it close to residing on a Centaur-like orbit. Across our 7-month baseline, we observe an epoch of cometary activity commencing in August 2023 with an increase in brightness of &gt;5.4 mag. The lightcurve of 2023 RN3 indicates the presence of continuous cometary activity across our observations, suggesting the onset of a new period of sustained activity. We find no evidence of any outbursts on top of the observed brightening, nor do we find any significant color evolution across our observations. 2023 RN3 is visibly extended in LCO and Liverpool Telescope observations, indicating the presence of a spatially-extended coma. Numerical integration of 2023 RN3's orbit reveals the comet to have recently undergone a slight increase in semimajor axis due to a planetary encounter with Jupiter, however whether this orbital change could trigger 2023 RN3's cometary activity is unclear. Our estimate for the maximum dust production metric of Afrho ~400 cm is consistent with previous measurements for the Jupiter-family comet and Centaur populations.</description>

      <title>Investigation on upstream ion events from L1 point observation: New Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Origin of energetic upstream ions propagating towards the Sun from the Earth's bow shock is not understood clearly. In this letter, relationship between solar wind suprathermal and upstream ions has been investigated by analyzing fluxes of H, 4He, and CNO obtained from multidirectional in-situ measurements at the first Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth system during 2012-2014. 49 upstream events have been selected based on flux enhancements of the upstream ions in comparison with the solar wind suprathermal ions. An energy cut-off at less than 300 keV is observed for the upstream events. This is attributed to the efficacy of the particle acceleration process near the bow shock. Interestingly, spectra of upstream ions soften systematically as compared to the spectra of their solar wind counterpart with decreasing mass of elements. The degree of spectral softening increases with decreasing mass-to-charge ratio of the species. Since during most of the events the interplanetary magnetic field was radial, we argue that cross-field diffusion of upstream ions gives rise to the modulation (spectral softening) of upstream ions, which is dependent on the mass-to-charge ratio of species. Our work indicates towards a systematic change in solar wind suprathermal ions after interaction with the bow shock.</description>

      <title>TESS Hunt for Young and Maturing Exoplanets (THYME) XII: A Young Mini-Neptune on the Upper Edge of the Radius Valley in the Hyades Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery and characterization of TOI-4364\,b, a young mini-Neptune in the tidal tails of the Hyades cluster, identified through TESS transit observations and ground-based follow-up photometry. The planet orbits a bright M dwarf ($K=9.1$\,mag) at a distance of 44\,pc, with an orbital period of 5.42\,days and an equilibrium temperature of $488^{+4}_{-4}$\,K. The host star's well-constrained age of 710\,Myr makes TOI-4364\,b an exceptional target for studying early planetary evolution around low-mass stars. We determined a planetary radius of $2.01^{+0.1}_{-0.08}$\,Earth radii, indicating that this planet is situated near the upper edge of the radius valley. This suggests that the planet retains a modest H/He envelope. As a result, TOI-4364\,b provides a unique opportunity to explore the transition between rocky super-Earths and gas-rich mini-Neptunes at the early stages of evolution. Its radius, which may still evolve as a result of ongoing atmospheric cooling, contraction, and photoevaporation, further enhances its significance for understanding planetary development. Furthermore, TOI-4364\,b possesses a moderately high Transmission Spectroscopy Metric of 44.2, positioning it as a viable candidate for atmospheric characterization with instruments such as JWST. This target has the potential to offer crucial insights into atmospheric retention and loss in young planetary systems.</description>
