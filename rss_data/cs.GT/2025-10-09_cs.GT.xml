      <title>Constant Weighted Maximin Share Approximations for Chores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible chores among agents with asymmetric weights. Among the various fairness notions, weighted maximin share (WMMS) stands out as particularly compelling. However, whether WMMS admits a constant-factor approximation has remained unknown and is one of the important open problems in weighted fair division [ALMW22, Suk25]. So far, the best known approximation ratio is O(log n), where n is the number of agents. In this paper, we advance the state of the art and present the first constant-factor approximate WMMS algorithm. To this end, we introduce canonical instance reductions and different bounds of agents' valuations. We also prove that guaranteeing better than 2-approximation is not possible, which improves the best-known lower bound of 1.366.</description>

      <title>Data as Commodity: a Game-Theoretic Principle for Information Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data is the central commodity of the digital economy. Unlike physical goods, it is non-rival, replicable at near-zero cost, and traded under heterogeneous licensing rules. These properties defy standard supply--demand theory and call for new pricing principles. We propose a game-theoretic approach in which the value of a data string emerges from strategic competition among N players betting on an underlying stochastic process, each holding partial information about past outcomes. A better-informed player faces a choice: exploit their informational advantage, or sell part of their dataset to less-informed competitors. By analytically computing the Nash equilibrium of the game, we determine the price range where the trade is beneficial to both buyer and seller. We uncover a rich landscape of market effects that diverge from textbook economics: first, prospective sellers and buyers can compete or jointly exploit the less informed competitors depending on the quality of data they hold. In a symbiotic regime, the seller can even share data for free while still improving her payoffs, showing that losing exclusivity does not necessarily reduce profit. Moreover, rivalry between well-informed players can paradoxically benefit uninformed ones, demonstrating that information abundance does not always translate to higher payoffs. We also show that the number of players influences the competition between informed parties: trades impossible in small markets become feasible in larger ones. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for the pricing of intangible goods in dynamically interacting digital markets, which are in need of robust valuation principles.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Regret Bounds for Online Omniprediction with Long Term Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm guaranteeing dynamic regret bounds for online omniprediction with long term constraints. The goal in this recently introduced problem is for a learner to generate a sequence of predictions which are broadcast to a collection of downstream decision makers. Each decision maker has their own utility function, as well as a vector of constraint functions, each mapping their actions and an adversarially selected state to reward or constraint violation terms. The downstream decision makers select actions "as if" the state predictions are correct, and the goal of the learner is to produce predictions such that all downstream decision makers choose actions that give them worst-case utility guarantees while minimizing worst-case constraint violation. Within this framework, we give the first algorithm that obtains simultaneous \emph{dynamic regret} guarantees for all of the agents -- where regret for each agent is measured against a potentially changing sequence of actions across rounds of interaction, while also ensuring vanishing constraint violation for each agent. Our results do not require the agents themselves to maintain any state -- they only solve one-round constrained optimization problems defined by the prediction made at that round.</description>

      <title>Fair Division in a Variable Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the classic problem of fairly dividing a set of indivisible items among a set of agents and consider the popular fairness notion of envy-freeness up to one item (EF1). While in reality, the set of agents and items may vary, previous works have studied static settings, where no change can occur in the system. We initiate and develop a formal model to understand fair division under the variable input setting: here, there is an EF1 allocation that gets disrupted because of the loss/deletion of an item, or the arrival of a new agent, resulting in a near-EF1 allocation. The objective is to perform a sequence of transfers of items between agents to regain EF1 fairness by traversing only via near-EF1 allocations. We refer to this as the EF1-Restoration problem.
  In this work, we present algorithms for the above problem when agents have identical monotone valuations, and items are either all goods or all chores. Both of these algorithms achieve an optimal number of transfers (at most $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are the number of items and agents respectively) for identical additive valuations. Next, we consider a valuation class with graphical structure, introduced by Christodoulou et al. (EC'23), where each item is valued by at most two agents, and hence can be seen as an edge between these two agents in a graph. Here, we consider EF1 orientations on (multi)graphs - allocations in which each item is allocated to an agent who values it. While considering EF1 orientations on multi-graphs with additive binary valuations, we present an optimal algorithm for the EF1-Restoration problem. Finally, for monotone binary valuations, we show that the problem of deciding whether EF1-Restoration is possible is PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>From signaling to interviews in random matching markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many two-sided labor markets, interviews are conducted before matches are formed. The growing number of interviews in medical residency markets has increased demand for signaling mechanisms, where applicants send a limited number of signals to communicate interest. We study the role of signaling mechanisms to reduce interviews in centralized random matching markets where initial preferences are refined through interviews. Agents can only match with those they interview. For the market to clear, we focus on perfect interim stability: no pair of agents-even if they never interviewed each other-prefers each other to their assigned partners under their interim preferences. A matching is almost interim stable if it is perfect interim stable after removing a vanishingly small fraction of agents.
  We analyze signaling mechanisms in random matching markets with $n$ agents where agents on the short side, long side, or both sides signal their top $d$ preferred partners. The interview graph connects pairs where at least one party signaled the other. We reveal a fundamental trade-off between almost and perfect interim stability. For almost interim stability, $d=\omega(1)$ signals suffice: short-side signaling is always effective, whereas long-side signaling is effective only when the market is weakly imbalanced, i.e., when any size difference between the two sides becomes negligible as the market grows. For perfect interim stability, at least $d=\Omega(\log^2 n)$ signals are necessary, and short-side signaling becomes crucial in any imbalanced market. We establish that truthful signaling is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium and extend our analysis to markets with hierarchical structure. As a technical contribution, we develop a message-passing algorithm that efficiently determines interim stability by leveraging local neighborhood structures.</description>

      <title>Last-iterate Convergence for Symmetric, General-sum, $2 \times 2$ Games Under The Exponential Weights Dynamic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the discrete-time exponential-weights dynamic with a constant step size on all \emph{general-sum and symmetric} $2 \times 2$ normal-form games, i.e. games with $2$ pure strategies per player, and where the ensuing payoff tuple is of the form $(A,A^\top)$ (where $A$ is the $2 \times 2$ payoff matrix corresponding to the first player). Such symmetric games commonly arise in real-world interactions between "symmetric" agents who have identically defined utility functions -- such as Bertrand competition, multi-agent performative prediction, and certain congestion games -- and display a rich multiplicity of equilibria despite the seemingly simple setting. Somewhat surprisingly, we show through a first-principles analysis that the exponential weights dynamic, which is popular in online learning, converges in the last iterate for such games regardless of initialization with an appropriately chosen step size. For certain games and/or initializations, we further show that the convergence rate is in fact exponential and holds for any step size.
  We illustrate our theory with extensive simulations and applications to the aforementioned game-theoretic interactions. In the case of multi-agent performative prediction, we formulate a new "mortgage competition" game between lenders (i.e. banks) who interact with a population of customers, and show that it fits into our framework.</description>

      <title>Approximately Envy-free and Equitable Allocations of Indivisible Items for Non-monotone Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the setting of fair allocation of indivisible items among agents with heterogeneous, non-monotone valuations. We explore the existence and efficient computation of allocations that approximately satisfy either envy-freeness or equity constraints. Approximate envy-freeness ensures that each agent values her bundle at least as much as those given to the others, after some (or any) item removal, while approximate equity guarantees roughly equal valuations among agents, under similar adjustments. As a key technical contribution of this work, by leveraging fixed-point theorems (such as Sperner's Lemma and its variants), we establish the existence of {\em envy-free-up-to-one-good-and-one-chore} ($\text{EF1}^c_g$) and {\em equitable-up-to-one-good-and-one-chore} ($\text{EQ1}^c_g$) allocations, for non-monotone valuations that are always either non-negative or non-positive. These notions represent slight relaxations of the well-studied {\em envy-free-up-to-one-item} (EF1) and {\em equitable-up-to-one-item} (EQ1) guarantees, respectively. Our existential results hold even when items are arranged in a path and bundles must form connected sub-paths. The case of non-positive valuations, in particular, has been solved by proving a novel multi-coloring variant of Sperner's Lemma that constitutes a combinatorial result of independent interest. In addition, we also design a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm that computes an $\text{EQ1}^c_g$ allocation. For monotone non-increasing valuations and path-connected bundles, all the above results can be extended to EF1 and EQ1 guarantees as well. Finally, we provide existential and computational results for certain stronger {\em up-to-any-item} equity notions under objective valuations, where items are partitioned into goods and chores.</description>

      <title>Consistent Opponent Modeling of Static Opponents in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of agents in multi-agent environments is to maximize total reward against the opposing agents that are encountered. Following a game-theoretic solution concept, such as Nash equilibrium, may obtain a strong performance in some settings; however, such approaches fail to capitalize on historical and observed data from repeated interactions against our opponents. Opponent modeling algorithms integrate machine learning techniques to exploit suboptimal opponents utilizing available data; however, the effectiveness of such approaches in imperfect-information games to date is quite limited. We show that existing opponent modeling approaches fail to satisfy a simple desirable property even against static opponents drawn from a known prior distribution; namely, they do not guarantee that the model approaches the opponent's true strategy even in the limit as the number of game iterations approaches infinity. We develop a new algorithm that is able to achieve this property and runs efficiently by solving a convex minimization problem based on the sequence-form game representation using projected gradient descent. The algorithm is guaranteed to efficiently converge to the opponent's true strategy given observations from gameplay and possibly additional historical data if it is available.</description>

      <title>M\"obius transforms and Shapley values for vector-valued functions on weighted directed acyclic multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the concept of M\"obius inversion and Shapley values to directed acyclic multigraphs and weighted versions thereof. We further allow value functions (games) and thus their M\"obius transforms (synergy function) and Shapley values to have values in any abelian group that is a module over a ring that contains the graph weights, e.g. vector-valued functions. To achieve this and overcome the obstruction that the classical axioms (linearity, efficiency, null player, symmetry) are not strong enough to uniquely determine Shapley values in this more general setting, we analyze Shapley values from two novel points of view: 1) We introduce projection operators that allow us to interpret Shapley values as the recursive projection and re-attribution of higher-order synergies to lower-order ones; 2) we propose a strengthening of the null player axiom and a localized symmetry axiom, namely the weak elements and flat hierarchy axioms. The former allows us to remove coalitions with vanishing synergy while preserving the rest of the hierarchical structure. The latter treats player-coalition bonds uniformly in the corner case of hierarchically flat graphs. Together with linearity these axioms already imply a unique explicit formula for the Shapley values, as well as classical properties like efficiency, null player, symmetry, and novel ones like the projection property. This whole framework then specializes to finite inclusion algebras, lattices, partial orders and mereologies, and also recovers certain previously known cases as corner cases, and presents others from a new perspective. The admission of general weighted directed acyclic multigraph structured hierarchies and vector-valued functions and Shapley values opens up the possibility for new analytic tools and application areas, like machine learning, language processing, explainable artificial intelligence, and many more.</description>
