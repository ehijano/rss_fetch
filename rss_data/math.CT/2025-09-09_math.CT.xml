      <title>The compact double category $\mathbf{Int}(\mathbf{Poly}_*)$ models control flow and data transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hasegawa showed that control flow in programming languages -- while loops and if-then-else statements -- can be modeled using traced cocartesian categories, such as the category $\mathbf{Set}_*$ of pointed sets. In this paper we define an operad $\mathscr{W}$ of wiring diagrams that provides syntax for categories whose control flow moreover includes data transformations, including deleting, duplicating, permuting, and applying pre-specified functions to variables. In the most basic version, the operad underlies $\mathbf{Int}(\mathbf{Poly}_*)$, where $\mathbf{Int}(\mathscr{T})$ denotes the free compact category on a traced category $\mathscr{T}$, as defined by Joyal, Street, and Verity; to do so, we show that $\mathbf{Poly}_*$, as well as any multivariate version of it, is traced. We show moreover that whenever $\mathscr{T}$ is uniform -- a condition also defined by Hasegawa and satisfied by $\mathbf{Int}(\mathscr{T})$ -- the resulting $\mathbf{Int}$-construction extends to a double category $\mathbb{I}\mathbf{nt}(\mathscr{T})$, which is compact in the sense of Patterson. Finally, we define a universal property of the double category $\mathbb{I}\mathbf{nt}(\mathbf{Poly}_*)$ and $\mathbb{I}\mathbf{nt}(\mathbf{Set}_*)$ by which one can track trajectories as they move through the control flow associated to a wiring diagram.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems as enriched functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a general description of dynamical systems using the language of enriched functors and enriched natural transformations. This framework is essential to establish the equivalence of three descriptions of dynamics -- a semigroup action on the domain; a parameterized family of endomorphisms; and a transformation of time-space into the collection of endomorphisms. A collection of categorical axioms are presented that provides a complete categorical language to develop dynamical systems theory. None of the assumptions are rooted in specific contexts such as topology and measure spaces. The equivalence of the three descriptions is further used to construct other related notions,such as transfer operators, orbits and shift-spaces. All of these objects are defined by their structural role and universal properties, instead of their usual pointwise definitions.</description>

      <title>Simplicial Approach to Frobenius Algebras in the Category of Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frobenius algebras in the category of sets and relations ($\mathbf{Rel}$) serve as a unifying framework for various algebraic and combinatorial structures, including groupoids, effect algebras, and abstract circles. Recently, a nerve construction of simplicial sets for Frobenius algebras in $\mathbf{Rel}$ has been introduced. In this work, we investigate the lifting properties of these simplicial sets, linking them to the algebraic properties of Frobenius algebras. We introduce $\epsilon$-simplicial sets -- simplicial sets with marked edges -- that enable the representation of a broader class of structures, such as test spaces from quantum logic. Our main results focus on weakly saturated classes generated by cofibrations, corresponding to specific lifting problems. Furthermore, we provide a characterization of Frobenius algebras in $\mathbf{Rel}$ within the framework of $\epsilon$-simplicial sets. These findings lay the groundwork for the development of a convenient model structure in future research.</description>

      <title>Categorical Tiling Theory: Constructing Directed Planar Tilings via Edge Reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tilings of the plane resemble the simplicial and other complexes from algebraic topology, but have not been studied from this perspective. We construct finite categories corresponding to polygons with labeled directed edges, and introduce the problem of modeling tilings of the Euclidean or hyperbolic plane as presheaves over such a category. Combinatorially, this amounts to choosing an ``alignment'' for a tiling: a direction for every edge and consistent labels for the edges of each polygonal tile. We show that for a fixed tiling, given a single alignment we can characterize every other alignment of the same tiling by comparison of the edge directions. We then construct a ``reflective'' alignment for any tiling with an even number of polygons at each vertex, and from this generate a large family of alignments with elegant symmetry properties.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a bicategory $\mathbf{2TDX}$ whose 1-cells provide a categorification of transducers, computational devices extending finite-state automata with output capabilities. This bicategory is a mathematically interesting object: its objects are categories $\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B},\dots$ and its 1-cells $(\mathcal{Q}, t) : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ consist of a category $\mathcal{Q}$ of `states', and a profunctor $$ t : \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{Q}^\text{op}\times\mathcal{Q} \times (\mathcal{B}^*)^\text{op} \to \mathbf{Set} $$ where $\mathcal{B}^*$ denotes the free monoidal category over $\mathcal{B}$. Extending $t$ to $\mathcal{A}^*$ in a canonical way, to each `word' $\underline a$ in $\mathcal{A}^*$ one attaches an endoprofunctor over the category $\mathcal{Q}$ of states, enriched over presheaves on $\mathcal{B}^*$.
  We discuss a number of other characterizations of the hom-category $\mathbf{2TDX}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})$; we establish a Kleisli-like universal property for $\mathbf{2TDX}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})$ and explore the connection of $\mathbf{2TDX}$ to other bicategories of computational models, such as Bob Walters' bicategory of `circuits'; it is convenient to regard $\mathbf{2TDX}$ as the loose bicategory of a double category $\mathbb{D}\mathbf{TDX}$: the bicategory (resp., double category) of profunctors is naturally contained in the bicategory (resp., double category) $\mathbf{2TDX}$ (resp., $\mathbb{D}\mathbf{TDX}$); we study the completeness and cocompleteness properties of $\mathbb{D}\mathbf{TDX}$, the existence of companions and conjoints, and we sketch how monads, adjunctions, and other structures/properties that naturally arise from the definition work in $\mathbb{D}\mathbf{TDX}$.</description>

      <title>Classification of silted algebras for two quivers of Dynkin type $\mathbb{D}_{n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $Q$ be the Dynkin quiver of type $\mathbb{D}_{n}$ with linear orientation and let $Q'$ be the quiver formed by reversing the arrow at the unique source in $Q$. In this paper, we present a complete classification of both silted algebras and strictly shod algebras associated with these two quivers. Based on the classification, we derive formulas for counting the number of silted algebras and strictly shod algebras.
  Furthermore, we establish that all strictly shod algebras corresponding to $Q$ and $Q'$ are string algebras. As an application, we provide a way to construct examples such that the realization functor which is induced from the $t$-structure does not extend to a derived equivalence.</description>

      <title>Categorical semantics of compositional reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compositional knowledge representations in reinforcement learning (RL) facilitate modular, interpretable, and safe task specifications. However, generating compositional models requires the characterization of minimal assumptions for the robustness of the compositionality feature, especially in the case of functional decompositions. Using a categorical point of view, we develop a knowledge representation framework for a compositional theory of RL. Our approach relies on the theoretical study of the category MDP, whose objects are Markov decision processes (MDPs) acting as models of tasks. The categorical semantics models the compositionality of tasks through the application of pushout operations akin to combining puzzle pieces. As a practical application of these pushout operations, we introduce zig-zag diagrams that rely on the compositional guarantees engendered by the category MDP. We further prove that properties of the category MDP unify concepts, such as enforcing safety requirements and exploiting symmetries, generalizing previous abstraction theories for RL.</description>
