      <title>Cooperation as Black Box: Conceptual Fluctuation and Diagnostic Tools for Misalignment in MAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misalignment in multi-agent systems (MAS) is often treated as a technical failure; yet many such failures originate upstream, during the conceptual design phase, where semantic ambiguity and normative projection take place. This paper identifies a foundational source of interpretive misalignment in MAS: the systemic conflation of cooperation and coordination, and the moral overreading that follows. Using the Rabbit-Duck illusion, we illustrate how perspective-dependent readings of agent behavior can create epistemic instability. To address this, we introduce the Misalignment Mosaic, a diagnostic framework for diagnosing meaning-level misalignment in MAS. It comprises four components: 1. Terminological Inconsistency, 2. Concept-to-Code Decay, 3. Morality as Cooperation, and 4. Interpretive Ambiguity. The Mosaic enables researchers to examine how misalignment arises not only through policy or reward structures but also through language, framing, and design assumptions. While this paper focuses on the specific ambiguity between coordination and cooperation, the Mosaic generalizes to other overloaded concepts in MAS, such as alignment, autonomy, and trust. Rather than define cooperation once and for all, we offer a framework to diagnose meaning itself as a source of misalignment.</description>

      <title>From Model Design to Organizational Design: Complexity Redistribution and Trade-Offs in Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Generality-Accuracy-Simplicity (GAS) framework to analyze how large language models (LLMs) are reshaping organizations and competitive strategy. We argue that viewing AI as a simple reduction in input costs overlooks two critical dynamics: (a) the inherent trade-offs among generality, accuracy, and simplicity, and (b) the redistribution of complexity across stakeholders. While LLMs appear to defy the traditional trade-off by offering high generality and accuracy through simple interfaces, this user-facing simplicity masks a significant shift of complexity to infrastructure, compliance, and specialized personnel. The GAS trade-off, therefore, does not disappear but is relocated from the user to the organization, creating new managerial challenges, particularly around accuracy in high-stakes applications. We contend that competitive advantage no longer stems from mere AI adoption, but from mastering this redistributed complexity through the design of abstraction layers, workflow alignment, and complementary expertise. This study advances AI strategy by clarifying how scalable cognition relocates complexity and redefines the conditions for technology integration.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Adversarially-Resilient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Cyber-Physical Systems Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems play a critical role in the infrastructure of various sectors, including manufacturing, energy distribution, and autonomous transportation systems. However, their increasing connectivity renders them highly vulnerable to sophisticated cyber threats, such as adaptive and zero-day attacks, against which traditional security methods like rule-based intrusion detection and single-agent reinforcement learning prove insufficient. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Hierarchical Adversarially-Resilient Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HAMARL) framework. HAMARL employs a hierarchical structure consisting of local agents dedicated to subsystem security and a global coordinator that oversees and optimizes comprehensive, system-wide defense strategies. Furthermore, the framework incorporates an adversarial training loop designed to simulate and anticipate evolving cyber threats, enabling proactive defense adaptation. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted on a simulated industrial IoT testbed indicate that HAMARL substantially outperforms traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches, significantly improving attack detection accuracy, reducing response times, and ensuring operational continuity. The results underscore the effectiveness of combining hierarchical multi-agent coordination with adversarially-aware training to enhance the resilience and security of next-generation CPS.</description>

      <title>Integrated Multimodal Sensing and Communication: Challenges, Technologies, and Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution towards 6G networks requires the intelligent integration of communication and sensing capabilities to support diverse and complex applications, such as autonomous driving and immersive services. However, existing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems predominantly rely on single-modal sensors as primary participants, which leads to a limited representation of environmental features and significant performance bottlenecks under the emerging requirements of 6G applications. This limitation motivates a paradigm shift from single-modal to multimodal ISAC. In this article, we first analyze the key challenges in realizing multimodal ISAC, including the fusion of heterogeneous multimodal data, the high communication overhead among distributed sensors, and the design of efficient and scalable system architectures. We then introduce several enabling technologies, such as large AI models, semantic communication, and multi-agent systems, that hold promise for addressing these challenges. To operationalize these technologies, we zoom into three architectural paradigms: fusion-based multimodal ISAC (F-MAC), interaction-based multimodal ISAC (I-MAC), and relay-based multimodal ISAC (R-MAC), each tailored to organize devices and modalities for efficient collaboration in different scenarios. Thereafter, a case study is presented based on the F-MAC scheme, demonstrating that the scheme achieves more comprehensive sensing and improves sensing accuracy by approximately 80% compared to conventional single-modal ISAC systems. Finally, we discuss several open issues to be addressed in the future.</description>

      <title>Momentum-based Accelerated Algorithm for Distributed Optimization under Sector-Bound Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed optimization advances centralized machine learning methods by enabling parallel and decentralized learning processes over a network of computing nodes. This work provides an accelerated consensus-based distributed algorithm for locally non-convex optimization using the gradient-tracking technique. The proposed algorithm (i) improves the convergence rate by adding momentum towards the optimal state using the heavy-ball method, while (ii) addressing general sector-bound nonlinearities over the information-sharing network. The link nonlinearity includes any sign-preserving odd sector-bound mapping, for example, log-scale data quantization or clipping in practical applications. For admissible momentum and gradient-tracking parameters, using perturbation theory and eigen-spectrum analysis, we prove convergence even in the presence of sector-bound nonlinearity and for locally non-convex cost functions. Further, in contrast to most existing weight-stochastic algorithms, we adopt weight-balanced (WB) network design. This WB design and perturbation-based analysis allow to handle dynamic directed network of agents to address possible time-varying setups due to link failures or packet drops.</description>

      <title>Neural Cellular Automata: From Cells to Pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCAs) are bio-inspired systems in which identical cells self-organize to form complex and coherent patterns by repeatedly applying simple local rules. NCAs display striking emergent behaviors including self-regeneration, generalization and robustness to unseen situations, and spontaneous motion. Despite their success in texture synthesis and morphogenesis, NCAs remain largely confined to low-resolution grids. This limitation stems from (1) training time and memory requirements that grow quadratically with grid size, (2) the strictly local propagation of information which impedes long-range cell communication, and (3) the heavy compute demands of real-time inference at high resolution. In this work, we overcome this limitation by pairing NCA with a tiny, shared implicit decoder, inspired by recent advances in implicit neural representations. Following NCA evolution on a coarse grid, a lightweight decoder renders output images at arbitrary resolution. We also propose novel loss functions for both morphogenesis and texture synthesis tasks, specifically tailored for high-resolution output with minimal memory and computation overhead. Combining our proposed architecture and loss functions brings substantial improvement in quality, efficiency, and performance. NCAs equipped with our implicit decoder can generate full-HD outputs in real time while preserving their self-organizing, emergent properties. Moreover, because each MLP processes cell states independently, inference remains highly parallelizable and efficient. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach across multiple NCA variants (on 2D, 3D grids, and 3D meshes) and multiple tasks, including texture generation and morphogenesis (growing patterns from a seed), showing that with our proposed framework, NCAs seamlessly scale to high-resolution outputs with minimal computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Agent-to-Agent Theory of Mind: Testing Interlocutor Awareness among Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into multi-agent and human-AI systems, understanding their awareness of both self-context and conversational partners is essential for ensuring reliable performance and robust safety. While prior work has extensively studied situational awareness which refers to an LLM's ability to recognize its operating phase and constraints, it has largely overlooked the complementary capacity to identify and adapt to the identity and characteristics of a dialogue partner. In this paper, we formalize this latter capability as interlocutor awareness and present the first systematic evaluation of its emergence in contemporary LLMs. We examine interlocutor inference across three dimensions-reasoning patterns, linguistic style, and alignment preferences-and show that LLMs reliably identify same-family peers and certain prominent model families, such as GPT and Claude. To demonstrate its practical significance, we develop three case studies in which interlocutor awareness both enhances multi-LLM collaboration through prompt adaptation and introduces new alignment and safety vulnerabilities, including reward-hacking behaviors and increased jailbreak susceptibility. Our findings highlight the dual promise and peril of identity-sensitive behavior in LLMs, underscoring the need for further understanding of interlocutor awareness and new safeguards in multi-agent deployments.

      <title>Detection of coordinated fleet vehicles in route choice urban games. Part I. Inverse fleet assignment theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of collectively routing fleets of vehicles in future urban systems may become important for the management of traffic, as such routing may destabilize urban networks leading to deterioration of driving conditions. Accordingly, in this paper we discuss the question whether it is possible to determine the flow of fleet vehicles on all routes given the fleet size and behaviour as well as the combined total flow of fleet and non-fleet vehicles on every route. We prove that the answer to this Inverse Fleet Assignment Problem is 'yes' for myopic fleet strategies which are more 'selfish' than 'altruistic', and 'no' otherwise, under mild assumptions on route/link performance functions. To reach these conclusions we introduce the forward fleet assignment operator and study its properties, proving that it is invertible for 'bad' objectives of fleet controllers. We also discuss the challenges of implementing myopic fleet routing in the real world and compare it to Stackelberg and Nash routing. Finally, we show that optimal Stackelberg fleet routing could involve highly variable mixed strategies in some scenarios, which would likely cause chaos in the traffic network.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Decentralized Stochastic Control for Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22971v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a two-timescale hierarchical decentralized architecture for control of Cyber-Physical Systems. The architecture consists of $N$ independent sub-processes, a global controller, and $N$ local controllers, each formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The global controller, operating at a slower timescale optimizes the infinite-horizon discounted cumulative reward under budget constraints. For the local controllers, operating at a faster timescale, we propose two different optimization frameworks, namely the COpt and FOpt. In the COpt framework, the local controller also optimizes an infinite-horizon MDP, while in the FOpt framework, the local controller optimizes a finite-horizon MDP. The FOpt framework mimics a federal structure, where the local controllers have more autonomy in their decision making. First, the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for both these frameworks is established. Then, various relationships between the two frameworks are studied, including a bound on the difference between the two optimal value functions. Additionally, sufficiency conditions are provided such that the two frameworks lead to the same optimal values.</description>

      <title>Resilient-Native and Intelligent Next-Generation Wireless Systems: Key Enablers, Foundations, and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Just like power, water, and transportation systems, wireless networks are a crucial societal infrastructure. As natural and human-induced disruptions continue to grow, wireless networks must be resilient. This requires them to withstand and recover from unexpected adverse conditions, shocks, unmodeled disturbances and cascading failures. Unlike robustness and reliability, resilience is based on the understanding that disruptions will inevitably happen. Resilience, as elasticity, focuses on the ability to bounce back to favorable states, while resilience as plasticity involves agents and networks that can flexibly expand their states and hypotheses through real-time adaptation and reconfiguration. This situational awareness and active preparedness, adapting world models and counterfactually reasoning about potential system failures and the best responses, is a core aspect of resilience. This article will first disambiguate resilience from reliability and robustness, before delving into key mathematical foundations of resilience grounded in abstraction, compositionality and emergence. Subsequently, we focus our attention on a plethora of techniques and methodologies pertaining to the unique characteristics of resilience, as well as their applications through a comprehensive set of use cases. Ultimately, the goal of this paper is to establish a unified foundation for understanding, modeling, and engineering resilience in wireless communication systems, while laying a roadmap for the next-generation of resilient-native and intelligent wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Research on Comprehensive Classroom Evaluation System Based on Multiple AI Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The promotion of the national education digitalization strategy has facilitated the development of teaching quality evaluation towards all-round, process-oriented, precise, and intelligent directions, inspiring explorations into new methods and technologies for educational quality assurance. Classroom teaching evaluation methods dominated by teaching supervision and student teaching evaluation suffer from issues such as low efficiency, strong subjectivity, and limited evaluation dimensions. How to further advance intelligent and objective evaluation remains a topic to be explored. This paper, based on image recognition technology, speech recognition technology, and AI large language models, develops a comprehensive evaluation system that automatically generates evaluation reports and optimization suggestions from two dimensions: teacher teaching ability and classroom teaching effectiveness. This study establishes a closed-loop classroom evaluation model that comprehensively evaluates student and teaching conditions based on multi-dimensional data throughout the classroom teaching process, and further analyzes the data to guide teaching improvement. It meets the requirements of all-round and process-oriented classroom evaluation in the era of digital education, effectively solves the main problems of manual evaluation methods, and provides data collection and analysis methods as well as technologies for relevant research on educational teaching evaluation.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Generalizable Bimanual Manipulation: RoboTwin Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at CVPR 2025 MEIS Workshop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is an emerging frontier in robotics, driven by the need for autonomous systems that can perceive, reason, and act in complex physical environments. While single-arm systems have shown strong task performance, collaborative dual-arm systems are essential for handling more intricate tasks involving rigid, deformable, and tactile-sensitive objects. To advance this goal, we launched the RoboTwin Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at the 2nd MEIS Workshop, CVPR 2025. Built on the RoboTwin Simulation platform (1.0 and 2.0) and the AgileX COBOT-Magic Robot platform, the competition consisted of three stages: Simulation Round 1, Simulation Round 2, and a final Real-World Round. Participants totally tackled 17 dual-arm manipulation tasks, covering rigid, deformable, and tactile-based scenarios. The challenge attracted 64 global teams and over 400 participants, producing top-performing solutions like SEM and AnchorDP3 and generating valuable insights into generalizable bimanual policy learning. This report outlines the competition setup, task design, evaluation methodology, key findings and future direction, aiming to support future research on robust and generalizable bimanual manipulation policies. The Challenge Webpage is available at https://robotwin-benchmark.github.io/cvpr-2025-challenge/.</description>

      <title>MGPRL: Distributed Multi-Gaussian Processes for Wi-Fi-based Multi-Robot Relative Localization in Large Indoor Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative localization is a crucial capability for multi-robot systems operating in GPS-denied environments. Existing approaches for multi-robot relative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like cameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high computational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint environments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel distributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull of multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ co-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware multi-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based alignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI field of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are utilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative localization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations with that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with limited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi RSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or offline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed MGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments, comparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches. The results showcase that MGPRL outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we open source MGPRL as a ROS package https://github.com/herolab-uga/MGPRL.</description>

      <title>Pok\'eAI: A Goal-Generating, Battle-Optimizing Multi-agent System for Pokemon Red</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Pok\'eAI, the first text-based, multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework designed to autonomously play and progress through Pok\'emon Red. Our system consists of three specialized agents-Planning, Execution, and Critique-each with its own memory bank, role, and skill set. The Planning Agent functions as the central brain, generating tasks to progress through the game. These tasks are then delegated to the Execution Agent, which carries them out within the game environment. Upon task completion, the Critique Agent evaluates the outcome to determine whether the objective was successfully achieved. Once verification is complete, control returns to the Planning Agent, forming a closed-loop decision-making system.
  As a preliminary step, we developed a battle module within the Execution Agent. Our results show that the battle AI achieves an average win rate of 80.8% across 50 wild encounters, only 6% lower than the performance of an experienced human player. Furthermore, we find that a model's battle performance correlates strongly with its LLM Arena score on language-related tasks, indicating a meaningful link between linguistic ability and strategic reasoning. Finally, our analysis of gameplay logs reveals that each LLM exhibits a unique playstyle, suggesting that individual models develop distinct strategic behaviors.</description>

      <title>Advancing Learnable Multi-Agent Pathfinding Solvers with Active Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a common abstraction of multi-robot trajectory planning problems, where multiple homogeneous robots simultaneously move in the shared environment. While solving MAPF optimally has been proven to be NP-hard, scalable, and efficient, solvers are vital for real-world applications like logistics, search-and-rescue, etc. To this end, decentralized suboptimal MAPF solvers that leverage machine learning have come on stage. Building on the success of the recently introduced MAPF-GPT, a pure imitation learning solver, we introduce MAPF-GPT-DDG. This novel approach effectively fine-tunes the pre-trained MAPF model using centralized expert data. Leveraging a novel delta-data generation mechanism, MAPF-GPT-DDG accelerates training while significantly improving performance at test time. Our experiments demonstrate that MAPF-GPT-DDG surpasses all existing learning-based MAPF solvers, including the original MAPF-GPT, regarding solution quality across many testing scenarios. Remarkably, it can work with MAPF instances involving up to 1 million agents in a single environment, setting a new milestone for scalability in MAPF domains.</description>

      <title>Interaction Identification of a Heterogeneous NDS with Quadratic-Bilinear Subsystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper attacks time-domain identification for interaction parameters of a heterogeneous networked dynamic system (NDS), with each of its subsystems being described by a continuous-time descriptor quadratic-bilinear time-invariant (QBTI) model. The obtained results can also be applied to parameter estimations for a lumped QBTI system. No restrictions are put on the sampling rate. Explicit formulas are derived respectively for the transient and steady-state responses of the NDS, provided that the probing signal is generated by a linear time invariant (LTI) system. Some relations have been derived between the NDS steady-state response and its frequency domain input-output mappings. These relations reveal that the value of some NDS associated generalized TFMs can in principle be estimated at almost any interested point of the imaginary axis from time-domain input-output experimental data, as well as its derivatives and a right tangential interpolation along an arbitrary direction. Based on these relations, an estimation algorithm is suggested respectively for the parameters of the NDS and the values of these generalized TFMs. A numerical example is included to illustrate characteristics of the suggested estimation algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Large Language Model-Enabled Control Architecture for Dynamic Resource Capability Exploration in Multi-Agent Manufacturing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manufacturing environments are becoming more complex and unpredictable due to factors such as demand variations and shorter product lifespans. This complexity requires real-time decision-making and adaptation to disruptions. Traditional control approaches highlight the need for advanced control strategies capable of overcoming unforeseen challenges, as they demonstrate limitations in responsiveness within dynamic industrial settings. Multi-agent systems address these challenges through decentralization of decision-making, enabling systems to respond dynamically to operational changes. However, current multi-agent systems encounter challenges related to real-time adaptation, context-aware decision-making, and the dynamic exploration of resource capabilities. Large language models provide the possibility to overcome these limitations through context-aware decision-making capabilities. This paper introduces a large language model-enabled control architecture for multi-agent manufacturing systems to dynamically explore resource capabilities in response to real-time disruptions. A simulation-based case study demonstrates that the proposed architecture improves system resilience and flexibility. The case study findings show improved throughput and efficient resource utilization compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Agents using Social Choice Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03121v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that many general evaluation problems can be viewed through the lens of voting theory. Each task is interpreted as a separate voter, which requires only ordinal rankings or pairwise comparisons of agents to produce an overall evaluation. By viewing the aggregator as a social welfare function, we are able to leverage centuries of research in social choice theory to derive principled evaluation frameworks with axiomatic foundations. These evaluations are interpretable and flexible, while avoiding many of the problems currently facing cross-task evaluation. We apply this Voting-as-Evaluation (VasE) framework across multiple settings, including reinforcement learning, large language models, and humans. In practice, we observe that VasE can be more robust than popular evaluation frameworks (Elo and Nash averaging), discovers properties in the evaluation data not evident from scores alone, and can predict outcomes better than Elo in a complex seven-player game. We identify one particular approach, maximal lotteries, that satisfies important consistency properties relevant to evaluation, is computationally efficient (polynomial in the size of the evaluation data), and identifies game-theoretic cycles.</description>

      <title>Consensus seeking in diffusive multidimensional networks with a repeated interaction pattern and time-delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a consensus problem in multidimensional networks having the same agent-to-agent interaction pattern under both intra- and cross-layer time delays. Several conditions for the agents to asymptotically reach a consensus are derived, which involve the overall network's structure, the local interacting pattern, and the assumptions specified on the time delays. The validity of these conditions is proved by direct eigenvalue evaluation and supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Agentic Medical Knowledge Graphs Enhance Medical Question Answering: Bridging the Gap Between LLMs and Evolving Medical Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced medical question-answering by leveraging extensive clinical data and medical literature. However, the rapid evolution of medical knowledge and the labor-intensive process of manually updating domain-specific resources pose challenges to the reliability of these systems. To address this, we introduce Agentic Medical Graph-RAG (AMG-RAG), a comprehensive framework that automates the construction and continuous updating of medical knowledge graphs, integrates reasoning, and retrieves current external evidence, such as PubMed and WikiSearch. By dynamically linking new findings and complex medical concepts, AMG-RAG not only improves accuracy but also enhances interpretability in medical queries.
  Evaluations on the MEDQA and MEDMCQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AMG-RAG, achieving an F1 score of 74.1 percent on MEDQA and an accuracy of 66.34 percent on MEDMCQA, outperforming both comparable models and those 10 to 100 times larger. Notably, these improvements are achieved without increasing computational overhead, highlighting the critical role of automated knowledge graph generation and external evidence retrieval in delivering up-to-date, trustworthy medical insights.</description>

      <title>Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination between AI agents and humans is crucial for real-world applications, yet it remains a significant open challenge. Hanabi is a cooperative card game featuring imperfect information, constrained communication, theory of mind requirements, and coordinated action -- making it an ideal testbed for human-AI coordination. However, its use for human-AI interaction has been limited by the challenges of human evaluation. In this work, we introduce the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) to overcome the constraints of costly and difficult-to-reproduce human evaluations. We develop \textit{human proxy agents} on a large-scale human dataset that serve as robust, cheap, and reproducible human-like evaluation partners in AH2AC2. To encourage the development of data-efficient methods, we open-source a dataset of 3,079 games, deliberately limiting the amount of available human gameplay data. We present baseline results for both two- and three- player Hanabi scenarios. To ensure fair evaluation, we host the proxy agents through a controlled evaluation system rather than releasing them publicly. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/FLAIROx/ah2ac2}{https://github.com/FLAIROx/ah2ac2}.</description>
