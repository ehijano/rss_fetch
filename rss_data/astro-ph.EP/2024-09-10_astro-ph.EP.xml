      <title>Primordial Black Holes in the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If primordial black holes (PBHs) of asteroidal mass ($M_{\rm PBH}\in[10^{17},10^{23}]$ g) make up the entire dark matter they could be detectable through their gravitational influence in the solar system. In this work we study the perturbations that PBHs induce on the orbits of planets. Detailed numerical simulations of the solar system, embedded in a halo of primordial black holes are performed. We show that the perturbations are too small to be directly detectable with current data, challenging recent results that have ruled out PBHs as a dark matter candidate. Using the Earth-Mars system as an observational probe, we estimate that an improvement in the measurement accuracy by more than an order of magnitude is required to detect the gravitational influence of PBHs in the solar system in the foreseeable future.</description>

      <title>A new atmospheric characterization of the sub-stellar companion HR\,2562\,B with JWST/MIRI observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: HR2562B is a planetary-mass companion located 0.56arcsec (19au) from its host star. It is one of a few L/T transitional objects orbiting a young star. This companion provides insight into the evolution of young objects in the L/T transition. However, its key physical properties, such as Teff and mass, remain poorly constrained, with large uncertainties (34% for Teff, 22% for log(g)) based on near-infrared observations alone. Aims: We aim to refine these uncertainties, especially for Teff (1200-1700K) and log(g) (4-5), using new MIR data from the JWST/MIRI filters (10.65, 11.40, and 15.50 microns), and better understand the companion's chemical composition and its role in the L/T transition. Methods: MIRI data were processed using reference star differential imaging, revealing HR2562B at high S/N (16) in all 3 filters. We used 2 atmospheric models, ATMO and ExoREM, to fit the SED, combining MIR and NIR datasets. Additionally, we used CMD with brown dwarfs to explore the chemical composition of HR2562B's atmosphere and compare it to another L/T transition object, VHS1256b. Results: Our analysis improved the temperature precision (Teff=1255+-15K) by 6x compared to previous estimates. We also narrowed its luminosity to -4.69+-0.01 dex. Surface gravity remains uncertain (4.4-4.8), and its mass is estimated between 8 and 18.5Mj, depending on modeling and astrometry. Sensitivity analysis revealed the ability to detect objects between 2-5Mj at 100au. Conclusions: HR2562B likely has a near cloud-free atmosphere, with the ATMO model fitting better than ExoREM. Silicate absorption features are weak, requiring further spectroscopic observations. While HR2562B and VHS1256b share similarities, they are in different evolutionary stages, making HR2562B key to understanding young objects in the L/T transition. It is likely a planetary-mass companion, suggesting a reclassification as HR2562b.</description>

      <title>DeepTTV: Deep Learning Prediction of Hidden Exoplanet From Transit Timing Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transit timing variation (TTV) provides rich information about the mass and orbital properties of exoplanets, which are often obtained by solving an inverse problem via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In this paper, we design a new data-driven approach, which potentially can be applied to problems that are hard to traditional MCMC methods, such as the case with only one planet transiting. Specifically, we use a deep learning approach to predict the parameters of non-transit companion for the single transit system with transit information (i.e., TTV, and Transit Duration Variation (TDV)) as input. Thanks to a newly constructed \textit{Transformer}-based architecture that can extract long-range interactions from TTV sequential data, this previously difficult task can now be accomplished with high accuracy, with an overall fractional error of $\sim$2\% on mass and eccentricity.</description>

      <title>Searching for Tidal Orbital Decay in Hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study transits of several ``hot Jupiter'' systems - including WASP-12 b, WASP-43 b, WASP-103 b, HAT-P-23 b, KELT-16 b, WD 1856+534 b, and WTS-2 b - with the goal of detecting tidal orbital decay and extending the baselines of transit times. We find no evidence of orbital decay in any of the observed systems except for that of the extensively studied WASP-12 b. Although the orbit of WASP-12 b is unequivocally decaying, we find no evidence for acceleration of said orbital decay, with measured $\ddot{P} = (-7 \pm 8) \times 10^{-14} \rm ~s^{-1}$, against the expected acceleration decay of $\ddot{P} \approx -10^{-23} \rm ~s^{-1}$. In the case of WD 1856+534 b, there is a tentative detection of orbital growth with $\dot{P} = (5.0 \pm 1.5) \times 10^{-10}$. While statistically significant, we err on the side of caution and wait for longer follow-up observations to consider the measured $\dot{P}$ real. For most systems, we provide a 95\%-confidence lower limit on the tidal quality factor, $Q_\star'$. The possibility of detecting orbital decay in hot Jupiters via long-term radial velocity (RV) measurements is also explored. We find that $\sim 1 \rm ~m~s^{-1}$ precision in RVs will be required to detect orbital decay of WASP-12 b with only 3 yr of observations. Currently available RV measurements and precision are unable to detect orbital decay in any of the systems studied here.</description>

      <title>Stability of Hilda asteroids at 3:2 resonance point in restricted three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability of Hilda Asteroids in the solar system around the 3:2 resonance point is analyzed in terms of the Sun-Jupiter-asteroid elliptic restricted three-body problem. We show that the Hamiltonian of the system is well-approximated by a single-resonance Hamiltonian around the 3:2 resonance. This implies that orbits of the Hilda asteroids are approximately integrable, thus their motion is stable. This is in contrast to other resonances such as the 3:1 and the 2:1 resonances at which Kirkwood gaps occur. Indeed, around the 3:1 and the 2:1 resonances, the Hamiltonians are approximated by double-resonance Hamiltonians that are nonintegrable and thus indicate chaotic motions. By a suitable canonical transformation, we reduce the number of degrees of freedom for the system and derive a Hamiltonian which has two degrees of freedom. As a result, we can analyze the stability of the motion by constructing Poincare surface of section.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of spatial perturbed elliptic restricted 3-body problem with double-averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the secular motion of a massless asteroid within the framework of the double-averaged elliptic restricted three-body problem. By employing Poincar\'e variables, we analyze the stability properties of asteroid orbits in the presence of planetary perturbations. Our study reveals that periodic orbits identified in the planar configuration maintain stability in the spatial perturbed problem across a wide range of parameter values. These findings, supported by numerical simulations, contribute to a deeper understanding of asteroid dynamics and have implications for studying exoplanetary systems with highly eccentric host stars.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Surprising Heavy Nitrogen Isotopic Enrichment in Comet 46P/Wirtanen's Hydrogen Cyanide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 46P/Wirtanen is a Jupiter-family comet, probably originating from the Solar System's Kuiper belt, that now resides on a 5.4 year elliptical orbit. During its 2018 apparition, comet 46P passed unusually close to the Earth (within 0.08 au), presenting an outstanding opportunity for close-up observations of its inner coma. Here we present observations of HCN, H$^{13}$CN and HC$^{15}$N emission from 46P using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA). The data were analyzed using the SUBLIME non-LTE radiative transfer code to derive $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratios. The HCN/H$^{13}$CN ratio is found to be consistent with a lack of significant $^{13}$C fractionation, whereas the HCN/HC$^{15}$N ratio of $68\pm27$ (using our most conservative $1\sigma$ uncertainties), indicates a strong enhancement in $^{15}$N compared with the solar and terrestrial values. The observed $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio is also significantly lower than the values of $\sim140$ found in previous comets, implying a strong $^{15}$N enrichment in 46P's HCN. This indicates that the nitrogen in Jupiter-family comets could reach larger isotopic enrichments than previously thought, with implications for the diversity of $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratios imprinted into icy bodies at the birth of the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Formation of Close-in Neptunes Around Low-Mass Stars Through Breaking Resonant Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional planet formation theories predict a paucity of massive planets around small stars, especially very low-mass ($0.1 - 0.3 \ M_{\odot}$) mid-to-late M dwarfs. Such tiny stars are expected to form planets of terrestrial sizes, but not much bigger. However, this expectation is challenged by the recent discovery of LHS 3154 b, a planet with period of 3.7 days and minimum mass of $13.2 \ M_{\oplus}$ orbiting a $0.11 \ M_{\odot}$ star. Here, we propose that close-in Neptune-mass planets like LHS 3154 b formed through an anomalous series of mergers from a primordial compact system of super-Earths. We perform simulations within the context of the "breaking the chains" scenario, in which super-Earths initially form in tightly-spaced chains of mean-motion resonances before experiencing dynamical instabilities and collisions. Planets as massive and close-in as LHS 3154 b ($M_p \sim 12 - 20 \ M_{\oplus}$, $P &lt; 7$ days) are produced in $\sim$1% of simulated systems, in broad agreement with their low observed occurrence. These results suggest that such planets do not require particularly unusual formation conditions but rather are an occasional byproduct of a process that is already theorized to explain compact multi-planet systems. Interestingly, our simulated systems with LHS 3154 b-like planets also contain smaller planets at around $\sim 30$ days, offering a possible test of this hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Visual-band brightnesses of Near Earth Objects that will be discovered in the infrared by NEO Surveyor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NEO Surveyor will detect asteroids and comets using mid-infrared thermal emission, however ground-based followup resources will require knowledge of the expected visible light brightness in order to plan characterization observations. Here we describe the range of visual-to-infrared colors that the NEOs detected by Surveyor will span, and demonstrate that for objects that have no previously reported Visual band observations, estimates of the Johnson Visual-band brightness based on infrared flux alone will have significant uncertainty. Incidental or targeted photometric followup of objects discovered by Surveyor enables predictions of the fraction of reflected light visible and near-infrared wavelengths, supporting additional detailed characterization.</description>

      <title>A discussion on estimating small bodies taxonomies using phase curves results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming large multiwavelength photometric surveys will provide a leap in our understanding of small body populations, among other fields of modern astrophysics. Serendipitous observations of small bodies in different orbital locations allow us to study diverse phenomena related to how their surfaces scatter solar light.
  In particular, multiple observations of the same object in different epochs permit us to construct their phase curves to obtain absolute magnitudes and phase coefficients. In this work, we tackle a series of long-used relationships associating these phase coefficients with the taxa of small bodies and suggest that some may need to be revised in the light of large-number statistics.</description>

      <title>Infrared Compositional Measurements in Comet C/2017 K2 (Pan-STARRS) at Heliocentric Distances Beyond 2.3 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comet C/2017 K2 (Pan-STARRS) provided a rare opportunity to investigate the evolution of coma composition and outgassing patterns over a transitional heliocentric distance (Rh) range where activity drivers in comets are thought to change from "hypervolatile" (CO, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, and/or CO$_2$)-dominated to H2O-dominated. We performed high-resolution, cross-dispersed, near-infrared spectroscopy of C/2017 K2 with iSHELL at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) and NIRSPEC at the W. M. Keck 2 Observatory. We report gas rotational temperatures (Trot) and molecular production rates (Q; mol/s) or upper limits for the hypervolatile species CH$_4$, CO, and C$_2$H$_6$, together with less volatile ices (CH$_3$OH, H$_2$O, HCN, C$_2$H$_2$, NH$_3$, and OCS) over a range of pre-perihelion distances, Rh= 3.15 - 2.35 au. We also report (or stringently constrain) abundance ratios (mixing ratios) of the targeted species with respect to CO, C$_2$H$_6$, and (when detected) H$_2$O. All volatiles were enriched relative to water in C/2017 K2 when compared to their mean values among Oort Cloud comets, whereas abundances relative to C2H6 were consistent with their average values from other long-period comets.</description>

      <title>High Mass Inner Regions Found in Five Outbursting Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young stellar objects are thought to commonly undergo sudden accretion events that result in a rise in bolometric luminosity. These outbursts likely coincide with the onset of planet formation, and could impact the formation of planets. The reason behind this dramatic enhancement of accretion is an active area of research, and the mass of the system is a critical parameter. Using Northern Extended Millimeter Array, we survey five outbursting sources (three FU Ori, one EX Or, one 'peculiar' source) with the primary goal of determining the system's mass using an optically thin line of CO. We estimate the mass of a central region for each object that using both continuum emission and C17O J=2-1. The C17O emission likely includes both disk and inner envelope material, thus acts as an upper limit on the disk mass, ranging from 0.33-3.4 Msun for our sources. These derived masses suggest that the inner approx. 1000 au contains enough mass along the line of sight for these sources to be gravitationally unstable.</description>

      <title>Complex Organics Surrounding the FU Ori-Type Object V1057 Cyg Indicative of Sublimated Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FU Ori and EX Lup type objects present natural experiments for understanding a critical stage in the star and planet formation process. These objects offer insight into the diversity of molecules available to forming planetary systems due to a sudden increase in accretion and central luminosity causes the disk and surrounding material to increase in temperature. This allows for volatiles to sublimate off of grains and exist in the gas-phase for tens to hundreds of years post initial outburst. While this dynamic stage may be common for solar-type protostars, observations of the chemical impact of these bursts are rare. In this article, we present observations from the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) of five Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) that have undergone outbursts within the past 100 years and catalog the volatile chemistry found within approx 1000 au of the YSO. Only one source clearly shows a line rich spectra with &gt;11 molecules detected including complex organics and water, as is an expected spectra signature for a post-outburst source. This source is V1057 Cyg, and we present it as the northern analog to the well studied and molecule-rich FU Ori source, V883 Ori. Our conclusions on the chemical inventory of the other four sources in our sample are sensitivity limited, as V1057 Cyg contains the highest disk/envelope gas mass.</description>

Abstract: A successful theory of star formation should predict the number of objects as a function of their mass produced through star-forming events. Previous studies in star-forming regions and the solar neighborhood identify a mass function increasing from the hydrogen-burning limit down to about 10 M$_{J}$. Theory predicts a limit to the fragmentation process, providing a natural turnover in the mass function down to the opacity limit of turbulent fragmentation thought to be 2-10 M$_{J}$. Programs to date have not been sensitive enough to probe the hypothesized opacity limit of fragmentation. Here we present the first identification of a turnover in the initial mass function below 12 M$_{J}$ within NGC 2024, a young star-forming region. With JWST/NIRCam deep exposures across 0.7-5 {\mu}m, we identified several free floating objects down to ~ 3 M$_{J}$ with sensitivity to 0.5 M$_{J}$. We present evidence for a double power law model increasing from about 60 M$_{J}$ to roughly 12 M$_{J}$, consistent with previous studies, followed by a decrease down to 0.5 M$_{J}$. Our results support the predictions of star and brown dwarf formation theory, identifying the theoretical turnover in the mass function and suggest the fundamental limit of turbulent fragmentation near 3 M$_{J}$.</description>

      <title>Seven decades of exploring planetary interiors with rotating convection experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interiors of many planets consist mostly of fluid layers. When these layers are subject to superadiabatic temperature or compositional gradients, turbulent convection transports heat and momentum. In addition, planets are fast rotators. Thus, the key process that underpins planetary evolution, the dynamo action, flow patterns and more, is rotating convection. Because planetary interiors are inaccessible to direct observation, experiments offer physically consistent models that are crucial to guide our understanding. If we can fully understand the laboratory model, we may eventually fully understand the original. Experimentally reproducing rotating thermal convection relevant to planetary interiors comes with specific challenges, e.g. modelling the central gravity field of a planet that is parallel to the temperature gradient. Three classes of experiments tackle this challenge. One approach consists of using an alternative central force field, such as the electric force. These are, however, weaker than gravity and require going to space. Another method entails rotating the device fast enough so that the centrifugal force supersedes Earth's gravity. This mimics the equatorial regions of a planet. Lastly, by using the actual lab gravity aligned with the rotation axis, insight into the polar regions is gained. These experiments have been continuously refined during the past seven decades. We review their evolution, from the early days of visualising the onset patterns of convection, over central force field experiments in spacecrafts, liquid metal experiments, to the latest optical velocity mapping of rotating magnetoconvection in sulfuric acid inside high-field magnets. We show how innovative experimental design and emerging experimental techniques advanced our understanding and painted a more realistic picture of planetary interiors, including Earth's liquid metal outer core.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of the magnetopause and its boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetopause is the key region in space for the transfer of solar wind mass, momentum, and energy into the magnetosphere. During the last decade, our understanding of the structure and dynamics of Earth's magnetopause and its boundary layers has advanced considerably; thanks largely to the advent of multi-spacecraft missions such as Cluster and THEMIS. Moreover, various types of physics-based techniques have been developed for visualizing two- or three-dimensional plasma and field structures from data taken by one or more spacecraft, providing a new approach to the analysis of the spatiotemporal properties of magnetopause processes, such as magnetic reconnection and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). Information on the size, shape, orientation, and evolution of magnetic flux ropes or flow vortices generated by those processes can be extracted from in situ measurements. Observations show that magnetopause reconnection can be globally continuous for both southward and northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions, but even under such circumstances, more than one X-line may exist within a certain (low-latitude or high-latitude) portion on the magnetopause and some X-lines may retreat anti-sunward. The potential global effects of such behavior are discussed. An overview is also given of the identification, excitation, evolution, and possible consequences of the magnetopause KHI: there is evidence for nonlinear KHI growth and associated vortex-induced reconnection under northward IMF. Observation-based estimates indicate that reconnection tailward of both polar cusps can be the dominant mechanism for solar wind plasma entry into the dayside magnetosphere under northward IMF. However, the mechanism by which the transferred plasma is transported into the central portion of the magnetotail, and the role of magnetopause processes in this transport remain unclear.</description>

      <title>Advancing Machine Learning for Stellar Activity and Exoplanet Period Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study applied machine learning models to estimate stellar rotation periods from corrected light curve data obtained by the NASA Kepler mission. Traditional methods often struggle to estimate rotation periods accurately due to noise and variability in the light curve data. The workflow involved using initial period estimates from the LS-Periodogram and Transit Least Squares techniques, followed by splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets. We employed several machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gradient Boosting, and also utilized a Voting Ensemble approach to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.
  The analysis included data from multiple Kepler IDs, providing detailed metrics on orbital periods and planet radii. Performance evaluation showed that the Voting Ensemble model yielded the most accurate results, with an RMSE approximately 50\% lower than the Decision Tree model and 17\% better than the K-Nearest Neighbors model. The Random Forest model performed comparably to the Voting Ensemble, indicating high accuracy. In contrast, the Gradient Boosting model exhibited a worse RMSE compared to the other approaches. Comparisons of the predicted rotation periods to the photometric reference periods showed close alignment, suggesting the machine learning models achieved high prediction accuracy. The results indicate that machine learning, particularly ensemble methods, can effectively solve the problem of accurately estimating stellar rotation periods, with significant implications for advancing the study of exoplanets and stellar astrophysics.</description>

      <title>ESCAPE project. CAPyBARA: a Roman Coronagraph simulator for post-processing methods development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Roman Coronagraph Instrument will be the first space facility equipped with deformable mirrors (DMs). These will lead to reach a contrast of $10^{-8}$ or better in a dark hole between $3-9 \lambda/D$. Post-processing techniques play an important role in increasing the contrast limits. Our work investigates how DMs can be used to calibrate the instrument response to controlled wavefront error maps and to improve the post-processing performance. To this goal, we are developing a simulation pipeline, CAPyBARA, that includes both a propagation model of the Coronagraph and a post-processing module and produces starlight subtracted images of a science target. This pipeline will allow us to investigate alternative observing strategies and test their performance for the Roman Coronagraph. Here we present the first version of the simulator: it currently reproduces the optical propagation, which consists in the hybrid Lyot coronagraph optical structure and dark-hole digging technique (Electric Field Conjugation coupled with $\beta$-bumping), the environment (quasi-static aberration) and the post-processing. With it, we mimic a Coronagraph Instrument observing sequence, which consists in first acquiring reference star data before slewing to the scientific target, and we investigate how the evolution of quasi-static aberrations deteriorate the contrast limit in the dark hole. We simulate a science target with planets at high contrast with their star and we perform a first post-processing analysis with classical subtraction techniques. Here we present the CAPyBARA simulator, as well as some first results. The next step will be to generate PSF libraries by injecting pre-calibrated probes on the DMs (in open loop) during the reference star acquisition and compute a PCA model. Later, we will compare the performance gain obtained with the modulated-DM reference library over standard approaches (RDI).</description>

      <title>Unveiling habitable planets: Toy coronagraph tackles the exozodiacal dust challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directly imaging Earth-like exoplanets within habitable zones is challenging because faint signals can be obscured by exozodiacal dust, analogous to our solar system's zodiacal dust. This dust scatters starlight, creating a bright background noise. This paper introduces Toy Coronagraph, a Python package designed to quantify the impact of this dust on exoplanet detection. It takes circularly symmetric disk images point spread functions (PSFs), and exoplanet orbital parameters as input, generating key metrics like contrast curves, signal-to-noise ratios, and dynamic visualizations of exoplanet motion under the dust background. The package also provides tools for generating vortex coronagraph PSFs and includes example disk images. Toy Coronagraph empowers researchers to understand exozodiacal dust, develop mitigation strategies, and optimize future telescope designs and mission time, ultimately advancing the search for potentially habitable worlds. Future work will focus on handling non-circularly symmetric inputs, incorporating realistic noise models, and estimating exoplanet yield rates for future space telescope missions.</description>

Abstract: The preparation of a telescope observation time proposal is a recurring activity in observational astronomy. It is a necessary investment of time and effort to obtain data to advance a research topic. Therefore, the success of an observation proposal is a condition for progress in observational research. This guide was created to offer a straightforward, practical, and comprehensive resource for applicants who are preparing a Gemini Observatory proposal. It reviews the fundamentals of an observation proposal, including its content and evaluation criteria, to help applicants organize their submissions effectively and improve specific aspects of their presentations. This manuscript is inspired by the recommendations of the User Advisory Council established in the documents ''Criterios de evaluaci\'on de propuestas por parte del NTAC'' (National Time Allocation Committee), ''Consideraciones b\'asicas para la presentaci\'on de propuestas Gemini'', and in experiences of members of the NTAC.</description>

      <title>A synchronous moon as a possible cause of Mars' initial triaxiality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper addresses the possibility of a young Mars having had a massive moon, which synchronised the rotation of Mars, and gave Mars an initial asymmetric triaxiality to be later boosted by geological processes. It turns out that a moon of less than a third of the lunar mass was capable of producing a sufficient initial triaxiality. The asymmetry of the initial tidal shape of the equator depends on timing: the initial asymmetry is much stronger if the synchronous moon shows up already at the magma-ocean stage. From the moment of synchronisation of Mars' rotation with the moon's orbital motion, and until the moon was eliminated (as one possibility, by an impact in the beginning of the LHB), the moon was sustaining an early value of Mars' rotation rate.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic Modelling of Fast Rotators and its Opportunities for Astrophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08453v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotation matters for the life of a star. It causes a multitude of dynamical phenomena in the stellar interior during a star's evolution and its effects accumulate until the star dies. All stars rotate at some level but those born with a mass above about 1.3 times the mass of the Sun rotate rapidly during more than 90% of their nuclear lifetime. Internal rotation guides the angular momentum and chemical element transport throughout the stellar interior. These transport processes change over time as the star evolves. The cumulative effects of stellar rotation and its induced transport processes determine the helium content of the core by the time it exhausts its hydrogen isotopes. The amount of helium at that stage also guides the heavy element yields by the end of the star's life. A proper theory of stellar evolution and any realistic models for the chemical enrichment of galaxies, must be based on observational calibrations of stellar rotation and of the induced transport processes. Since a few years, asteroseismology offers such calibrations, for single and binary stars. We review the current status of asteroseismic modelling of rotating stars for different stellar mass regimes, in an accessible way for the non-expert. While doing so, we describe exciting opportunities sparked by asteroseismology for various domains in astrophysics, touching upon topics from exoplanetary science to galactic structure and evolution towards gravitational wave physics. Along the way, we provide ample sneak-previews for future 'industrialised' applications of asteroseismology to slow and rapid rotators, from exploitation of combined Kepler, TESS, PLATO, Gaia, and spectroscopy surveys. We end the review with a list of take away messages and achievements of asteroseismology, which are of relevance for many fields of astrophysics.</description>

      <title>NSVS 14256825: period variation and orbital stability analysis of two possible substellar companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent period investigations of the Post-Common Envelop Binary (PCEB) NSVS 14256825 suggested that two circumbinary companions were necessary to explain the observed Eclipse Timing Variations (ETVs). Our objective was to search for the best-fitting curve of two LTTE terms in the ETV diagram, implementing a grid search optimization scheme of Keplerian (kinematic) and Newtonian (N-body) fits, alongside a dynamical stability analysis of N-body simulations. We compiled two datasets of archival photometric data covering a different timeline and updated them with new observations and with three new times of minima (TOMs) calculated from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (\textit{TESS}). A grid search optimization process was implemented and the resulted solutions, that fell within the $90\%$ confidence interval of the best-fitting curve of the ETV diagram, were tested for orbital stability using N-body simulations and the MEGNO chaos indicator. The Keplerian and Netwonian fits are in close agreement and hundreds of stable configurations were identified for both datasets reaching a lifetime of 1 Myr. Our results suggest that the ETV data can be explained by the presence of a circumbinary planet with mass $m_b=11 M_{Jup.}$ in a nearly circular inner orbit of period $P_b = 7$ yr. The outer orbit is unconstrained with a period range $P_c=20-50$ yr (from 3:1 to 7:1 MMR) for a circumbinary body of substellar mass ($m_c=11-70 M_{Jup.}$). The stable solutions of the minimum and maximum reduced chi-square value were integrated for 100 Myr and confirmed a non-chaotic behavior. Their residuals in the ETV data could be explained by a spin-orbit-coupling model (Applegate-Lanza). Continuous monitoring of the system is required in order to refine and constrain the proposed solutions.</description>

Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) receivers and technical papers are cited fewer than once in every six publications. This citation shortage is impeding the development of future (sub)millimetre instruments. In an effort to facilitate the correct citations of ALMA receivers and technical papers, this memo provides a comprehensive list of papers for the scientific community. This list was produced in discussion with the scientific and instrumentalist community, based on a June 2024 survey at the European Southern Observatory workshop on the ALMA Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade, as well as with the ALMA technical staff. The authors now encourage the community to enhance their already-excellent ALMA science with the appropriate references to ensure future (sub)millimetre instrumentation can keep addressing the key questions about our Universe.</description>
