      <title>Charge density waves and soft phonon evolution in the superconductor BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconductor BaNi$_2$As$_2$ exhibits a soft-phonon-driven, incommensurate charge density wave (I-CDW) which is accompanied by a small orthorhombic structural phase transition. Upon further cooling, BaNi$_2$As$_2$ undergoes a first-order structural transition to a triclinic phase in which a commensurate CDW (C-CDW) appears. The relationship and interplay between the I-CDW, C-CDW and structural phase transitions has remained elusive. To investigate this issue, we present a complementary study of thermal diffuse X-Ray scattering and inelastic X-Ray scattering for phosphorus substituted BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ $(x\lessapprox0.12)$ and down to 2.2 K. We show that most of the diffuse scattering signal can be well described by first-principles lattice dynamics calculations. Furthermore, we find that although phosphorus substitution rapidly suppresses the structural transition temperatures, the temperature dependence of the correlation length of the I-CDW fluctuations and the formation of Bragg-like superstructure peaks associated with long-range ordering of this order depends only weakly on the substitution level. Finally, we present the absence of signatures of the I-CDW to C-CDW or triclinic transition in the lattice dynamics, indicating that these instabilities are not (soft) phonon driven.</description>

      <title>Unconventional polaronic ground state in superconducting LiTi$_2$O$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometrically frustrated lattices can display a range of correlated phenomena, ranging from spin frustration and charge order to dispersionless flat bands due to quantum interference. One particularly compelling family of such materials is the half-valence spinel Li$B_2$O$_4$ materials. On the $B$-site frustrated pyrochlore sublattice, the interplay of correlated metallic behavior and charge frustration leads to a superconducting state in LiTi$_2$O$_4$ and heavy fermion behavior in LiV$_2$O$_4$. To date, however, LiTi$_2$O$_4$ has primarily been understood as a conventional BCS superconductor despite a lattice structure that could host more exotic groundstates. Here, we present a multimodal investigation of LiTi$_2$O$_4$, combining ARPES, RIXS, proximate magnetic probes, and ab-initio many-body theoretical calculations. Our data reveals a novel mobile polaronic ground state with spectroscopic signatures that underlie co-dominant electron-phonon coupling and electron-electron correlations also found in the lightly doped cuprates. The cooperation between the two interaction scales distinguishes LiTi$_2$O$_4$ from other superconducting titanates, suggesting an unconventional origin to superconductivity in LiTi$_2$O$_4$. Our work deepens our understanding of the rare interplay of electron-electron correlations and electron-phonon coupling in unconventional superconducting systems. In particular, our work identifies the geometrically frustrated, mixed-valence spinel family as an under-explored platform for discovering unconventional, correlated ground states.</description>

      <title>Microwave resonator for measuring time-reversal symmetry breaking at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a microwave-frequency method for measuring polar Kerr effect and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) in unconventional superconductors. While this experiment is motivated by work performed in the near infrared using zero-loop-area Sagnac interferometers, the microwave implementation is quite different, and is based on the doubly degenerate modes of a TE$_{111}$ cavity resonator, which act as polarization states analogous to those of light. The resonator system has in-situ actuators that allow quadrupolar distortions of the resonator shape to be controllably tuned, as these compete with the much smaller perturbations that arise from TRSB. The most reliable way to the detect the TRSB signal is by interrogating the two-mode resonator system with circularly polarized microwaves, in which case the presence of TRSB shows up unambiguously as a difference between the forward and reverse transmission response of the resonator - i.e., as a breaking of reciprocity. We illustrate and characterize a coupler system that generates and detects circularly polarized microwaves, and then show how these are integrated with the TE$_{111}$ resonator, resulting in a dilution refrigerator implementation with a base temperature of 20 mK. We show test data on yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) ferrite as an illustration of how the system operates, then present data showing system performance under realistic conditions at millikelvin temperatures.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity of an altermagnetic metal: Polarized BCS and inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the superconductivity of two-dimensional spin-1/2 Fermi systems with $d$-wave altermagnetism under external magnetic field near zero temperature. At large altermagnetic coupling without magnetic field, we show that altermagnetism drives a second-order phase transition from the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state to an inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. The inclusion of magnetic field turns the BCS state into a long-sought polarized BCS superconductor with spin-population imbalance. It also shrinks the parameter window of the FFLO state and eventually leads to a nontrivial quantum tri-critical Lifshitz point, where two second-order phase transition lines between the polarized BCS, FFLO and normal states intersect. At small altermagnetic coupling, we find the usual route to the FFLO state driven by magnetic field. The presence of the altermagnetic coupling narrows the phase window of the FFLO state and creates another quantum Lifshitz point, where a first-order transition curve meets a second-order transition line. Between the two Lifshitz points, the transition from the polarized BCS state to the normal state is smooth. Our predicted rich phase diagram is relevant to some recently discovered unconventional magnets, including RuO$_{2}$ that exhibits a relatively high superconducting temperature in the thin film limit under applied strain. Our results of unconventional superfluidity are also testable in ultracold atom laboratories, where a spin-1/2 altermagnetic Fermi gas might be realizable upon loading into two-dimensional Hubbard lattices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Lifshitz points in an altermagnetic metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict the existence of two tri-critical quantum Lifshitz points in recently discovered $d$-wave altermagnetic metals subjected to an external magnetic field. These points connect a spatially modulated Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, a uniform polarized Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) superconducting phase, and the normal metallic phase in a nontrivial manner. Depending on whether the FFLO state is primarily induced by the magnetic field or by $d$-wave altermagnetism, we classify the corresponding Lifshitz points as field-driven or altermagnetism-driven, respectively. Notably, the two types exhibit distinct behaviors: the transition from the FFLO phase to the polarized BCS phase is first-order near the field-driven Lifshitz point, as might be expected, whereas it becomes continuous near the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point. We further explore the effects of finite temperature and find that the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point is significantly more sensitive to thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering triplet superconductivity in superconductors with spin-orbit coupling or altermagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study superconductivitiy under light irradiation based on the Floquet-Magnus expansion in the high-frequency regime. We find that, in spin-singlet superconductors with spin-orbit coupling, triplet superconductivity can be induced in the first-order perturbation for dynamical gap functions and the second-order perturbation for static gap functions. We also show that, in unitary triplet superconductors with altermagnetism, nonunitary triplet superconductivity can emerge in the firstorder perturbation for dynamical gap function and in the second-order perturbation for static gap functions. These results indicate optical generation and control of triplet superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Hamiltonian for mixed parity superconductivity can be recast into that for magnetism with spin-orbit coupling by the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, indicating that mixed parity superconductivity and magnetism with spin-orbit coupling can share the same physics. As demonstrations, we discuss the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type interactions, magnetoelectric effect, supercurrent-induced spin current, and altermagnetism in mixed parity superconductors. All these effects originate purely from mixed parity superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Hidden Bose-Einstein Singularities in Correlated Electron Systems: II. Pseudogap Phase in the Weakly Attractive Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hidden Bose-Einstein singularities of correlated electron systems, whose possible existence has been pointed out in a previous paper based on quantum field theory of ordered phases [T. Kita, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 93}, 124704 (2024)], are studied in more detail in terms of the attractive Hubbard model, for which the mean-field theory predicts that spin-singlet superconductivity is realized at low enough temperatures for any band structure and interaction strength. It is shown that incorporating correlation effects should change the mean-field superconducting solution substantially and qualitatively even in the weak coupling, implying that the system lies in the strong-coupling region perturbatively. The hidden singularity is found to be present around the mean-field superconducting temperature $T_{{\rm c}0}$, below which the standard self-consistent treatment by quantum field theory cannot be used due to divergences in the zero Matsubara frequency branch obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. Our method to recover the applicability with a Lagrange multiplier predicts that the singularity is a physical entity signaling the threshold of a pseudogap phase with a characteristic V-shape structure in the density of states near zero energy, which lies above the superconducting phase and originates from the emerging one-particle-reducible structure in the self-energy.</description>

      <title>Magnetic correlations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore magnetic correlations and superconducting pairing near higher-order Van Hove singularities in an extended Hubbard model on honecycomb lattice incorporating third-nearest-neighbor hopping \( t'' \). Using quantum Monte Carlo methods, we identify a crossover between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations near higher-order Van Hove singularities filling, where \( t'' \) enhances ferromagnetic correlations below while suppressing antiferromagnetic fluctuations toward half-filling. At low doping, \( f_n \)-wave pairing dominates, amplified by higher-order Van Hove singularities-induced divergent density of states. Remarkably, despite general suppression of \( f_n \)-wave pairing by increasing next-nearest neighbor hopping \( t' \) and \( t'' \), a critical \( t'' = 0.15 \) triggers anomalous enhancement via higher-order Van Hove singularities renormalization at a fix $t'$. The nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions \( V \) suppress superconducting correlation, which exhibiting sign-independent suppression proportional to \( |V| \). These results highlight the interplay of higher-order Van Hove singularities-driven electronic structure, magnetic fluctuations, and pairing symmetry competition in electron correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Dimensional crossover of class D real-space topological invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological properties of a material depend on its symmetries, parameters, and spatial dimension. Changes in these properties due to parameter and symmetry variations can be understood by computing the corresponding topological invariant. Since topological invariants are typically defined for a fixed spatial dimension, there is no existing framework to understand the effects of changing spatial dimensions via invariants. Here, we introduce a framework to study topological phase transitions as a system's dimensionality is altered using real-space topological markers. Specifically, we consider Shiba lattices, which are class D materials formed by magnetic atoms on the surface of a conventional superconductor, and characterize the evolution of their topology when an initial circular adatom island is deformed into a chain. We also provide a measure of the corresponding protection against disorder. Our framework is generalizable to any symmetry class and spatial dimension, potentially guiding the design of materials by identifying, for example, the minimum thickness of a slab required to maintain three-dimensional topological properties.</description>

      <title>Evidence of surface $p$-wave superconductivity and higher-order topology in MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploration of nontrivial superconductivity and electronic band topology is at the core of condensed matter physics and applications to quantum information. The transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) MoTe$_2$ has been proposed as an ideal candidate to explore the interplay between topology and superconductivity, but their studies remain limited regarding the required high-pressure environments. Here, we observe proximity-induced surface $p$-wave superconductivity, and investigate the higher-order topological nature of MoTe$_2$ in its 1T$'$ phase, which emerges from the T$_d$ phase through a high-pressure-induced topological phase transition. Using surface-sensitive soft-point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy, we confirm the emergence of surface $s+p$-wave superconductivity via the BTK model as well as a zero-bias conductance peak. Such surface $p$-wave superconductivity emerges via the proximity effect between an $s$-wave superconducting band and a second-order topological band, which is protected by the time-reversal and inversion symmetries. The temperature dependence of the surface $p$-wave superconducting gap shows a correlation with that of the bulk $s$-wave gap, as well as its suppression by an external magnetic field or a reduction in pressure, implying its proximity-induced origin. Moreover, we suggest that the topological hinge states, derived from second-order topological bands, evolve into zero-energy Majorana corner states in this proximity-effect-induced third-order topological superconducting phase. These results demonstrate the potential realization of topological superconductivity in MoTe$_2$, thus opening a pathway for studying various topological natures of TMDC materials.</description>

      <title>Enhancing superconductivity via engineered polaronic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03288v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A vanishing dielectric function is required for longitudinal plasmonic or polaronic modes in a polarizable uniform medium and, in general, heralds the presence of singular charge fluctuations. It is also known that a vanishing dielectric function of an environment strengthens Cooper pairing in a superconductor via resonant anti-shielding (RAS), regardless of pairing origin. We combine these ideas in a strategy to strongly enhance superconductivity. Specifically, we propose a superlattice in which a unit cell consists of an ultrathin superconductor film in direct contact with a monolayer of a metal-organic framework material. This structure possesses a momentum-independent and resonant effective dielectric function, a key feature for RAS-enhanced superconductivity. We show that the superlattice facilitates near perfect volumetric intermixing between the superconductor and the engineered dielectric environment. To estimate the critical temperature $T_c$ enhancement, we use the unrestricted Leuven's scaling method, which relates the spectral integral of the RAS-renormalized Eliashberg function $\alpha^2$F to $T_c$, which we showed previously to be in excellent agreement with ab initio simulations, and which we posit may underlie recent observations of enhanced $T_c$ in FeSe on SrTiO$_3$. We carried out a renormalization of the bare $\alpha^2$F, dividing it directly by |$\epsilon_{DE} (\omega)|^2$, where $\epsilon_{DE} (\omega)$ is the q-independent dielectric function of the dielectric environment. Our estimates show that ambient temperature and pressure operation could be achievable in the RAS scheme. We also calculated the quantum Fisher information from the dynamic charge susceptibility in the normal state (for vanishing losses) in our proposed superlattice, and our estimate suggests the presence of superconductivity signatures well above $T_c$ due to quantum charge entanglement buildup.</description>

      <title>Josephson diodes induced by the loop current states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the diode effect of the supercurrent in the Josephson junctions with the loop current states as the tunneling barrier. The loop current states are realized by the Haldane model which preserves the inversion symmetry and thus forbids the diode effect. We demonstrate how the inversion symmetry can be broken in the monolayer and bilayer systems. In the monolayer system, inversion symmetry can be broken by either introducing a sublattice staggered potential for the Haldane model or introducing a modified Haldane model, and in the bilayer system, it can be broken by either staking the two layers with opposite current directions or by directly applying an electric field perpendicular to the layers. We further show that the diode efficiency can be tuned by the interlayer coupling and the strength of the electric field or interlayer voltage. Our results provide another route to realize the Josephson diode effect by breaking the time-reversal symmetry through the loop-current states.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has sparked significant research interest. This interest has been further fueled by the recent achievement of superconductivity in compressed thin films at ambient pressure, although the origin and underlying mechanism remain elusive. In this work, we explore the electronic structures and instabilities of strained thin films on substrates to identify the key factors for achieving superconductivity, using first-principles and functional renormalization group (FRG) calculations. Our findings suggest that the compressed NiO$_2$ bilayer at the interface is unlikely to exhibit superconductivity due to the elongation of outer apical Ni-O bond length and electron-doping effect. In contrast, the NiO$_2$ bilayer slightly away from the interface shows density-wave instability when undoped or slightly hole-doped. However, when this bilayer is moderately hole-doped, leading to the emergence of a hole pocket around the M point, density-wave instability is suppressed and the system exhibits robust $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity, which may account for superconductivity observed in thin films. For the stretched NiO$_2$ bilayer, robust spin-density-wave instability is observed due to enhanced Fermi surface nesting, despite the presence of a hole pocket around the M point. Potential experimental implications are discussed. Our study highlights the crucial role of fermiology in determining electronic instability and establishes a unified scenario for superconductivity in both pressurized bulk and strained thin films of bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group approach to the Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity: Amplification of the pairing gap from $\ell^4$ to $\ell$</title>

Abstract: We revisit the renormalization group (RG) analysis of the Kohn-Luttinger (KL) mechanism for superconductivity. The KL mechanism leads to superconductivity in a system with a repulsive bare interaction. The key ingredient is the screening effect that renders the induced interaction attractive in channels with nonzero angular momentum $\ell \neq 0$, thereby triggering the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) instability. According to the original argument, the resulting gap is exponentially small, with its exponent scaling as $-\ell^4$. However, the KL mechanism was originally formulated within perturbation theory, where the series is known to converge poorly in certain cases -- most notably, for the p-wave paring gap induced by a repulsive s-wave contact interaction. This poor convergence may be attributed to a divergent integrand in a specific class of diagrams containing both the BCS logarithm and the Kohn anomaly, suggesting that one must resum the Kohn anomaly contributions separately from the BCS logarithm. In this work, we incorporate the Kohn anomaly contribution into the beta function of the RG equation governing the BCS instability near the Fermi surface. Our solution shows that the KL gap exponent is then proportional to $-\ell$, indicating a significant enhancement of the KL mechanism beyond the previously known result. To illustrate this, we study the spin-triplet p-wave pairing gap arising from a repulsive s-wave contact interaction and compare our RG-based results with those obtained from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>DC-driven separation of fractional flux quanta in two-band superconductors</title>

Abstract: Two-band superconductors host vortices from superfluid condensates of different electron bands. These vortices carry a fractional flux quantum and attract each other, coalescing to form a composite vortex with the whole flux quantum $\phi_0$. However, due to the differences in viscosity and flux of the vortices across different bands, composite vortices may dissociate into fractional components. Here, we theoretically explore an approach to control the dissociation of composite vortices into fractional components and their separation into stationary and fast-moving ones through dc current and pinning strength variation. To this end, we numerically solve the dynamic equation of motion for a single dc-driven composite vortex in a periodic pinning potential. As the pinning strength increases, we observe a transition from depinning followed by dissociation in the weak-pinning regime to dissociation from the pinned state in the strong-pinning regime. Under moderately strong pinning, fractional vortices from one condensate may become immobile while those from the other may even move faster than the original composite vortex just before the dissociation. The predicted pinning- and dc-controlled separation of fractional flux quanta appeals for experimental investigation and potential application in fluxonic devices.</description>

      <title>The possible frustrated superconductivity in the kagome superconductors</title>

Abstract: Geometric frustration has long been a subject of enduring interest in condensed matter physics. While geometric frustration traditionally focuses on magnetic systems, little attention is paid to the "frustrated superconductivity" which could arise when the superconducting interaction conflicts with the crystal symmetry. The recently discovered kagome superconductors provide a particular opportunity for studying this due to the fact that the frustrated lattice structure and the interference effect between the three sublattices can facilitate the frustrated superconducting interaction. Here, we propose a theory that supports the frustrated superconducting state, derived from the on-site $s$-wave superconducting pairing in conjunction with the nearest-neighbor pairings hoping and the unique geometrical frustrated lattice structure. In this state, whereas the mutual $2\pi/3$ difference of the superconducting pairing phase causes the six-fold modulation of the amplitude and breaks the time-reversal symmetry with $4\pi$ phase changes of the superconducting pairing as one following it around the Fermi surface, it is immune to the impurities without the impurity-induced in-gap states and produces the pronounced Hebel-Slichter peak of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate below $T_{c}$. Notably, the theory also reveals a disorder-induced superconducting pairing transition from the frustrated superconducting state to an isotropic $s$-wave superconducting state without traversing the nodal points, recovering and explaining the behavior found in experiment. This study not only serves as a promising proposal to mediate the divergent or seemingly contradictory experimental outcomes regarding superconducting pairing symmetry, but may also pave the way for advancing investigations into the frustrated superconducting state.</description>
