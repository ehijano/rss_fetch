      <title>Chiral interactions and superfluidity in the calcium isotopic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform ab initio calculations of three-point mass differences in the odd- and even-mass $^{39-49}$Ca isotopes to probe nuclear superfluidity via empirical neutron pairing gaps. We also quantify the sensitivity of those gaps to the parameters of the interaction at mean-field level. Recent studies employing accurate chiral nuclear interactions have found these gaps to be too small. We show that experimental values can be reproduced at mean-field level by substantially increasing the attraction of the singlet $S$-wave two-nucleon contact interaction, but doing so induces an unphysical bound state of the di-neutron. The sensitivity of these predictions to the full calibration of the nuclear interaction is then studied by performing Bayesian posterior sampling in a delta-full chiral effective field theory at third chiral order. We find that pairing gaps remain largely unaffected, leaving the explanation of nuclear superfluidity as a future task for improved many-body modeling and refined interactions at higher chiral orders.</description>

      <title>The Silver Blaze Problem in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a pedagogical introduction to the Silver Blaze problem. This problem refers to the difficulty of reconciling to perspectives on QCD with a chemical potential. The first is the phenomenological fact that at $T=0$ QCD remains in its ground state -- the vacuum -- with all physical observables unchanged whenever the magnitude of a chemical potential is less than some critical value. The second is the fact that in functional integral treatments, the inclusion of any nonzero chemical potential changes all eigenvalues of the Dirac operator for every gauge configuration, leading to a natural expectation that the functional determinants also changes, which leads to the expectation that physical observables should be altered. The problem amounts to explaining why nothing happens below the critical chemical potential. By focusing on the eigenvalues of $\gamma_0$ times the Dirac operator rather than the Dirac operator itself, it is possible to show that for QCD with two flavors and identical quark masses, an isospin chemical potential with a magnitude less than $m_\pi$ (and no baryon chemical potential), or a baryon chemical potential of less than $\frac{3}{2} m_\pi$ (and no isospin chemical potential), the functional integerals at $T=0$ themselves remain unchanged in all configurations that contribute to the functional integral with non-vanishing weight. However, for $\mu_{\rm crit}\mu_B &gt; \frac{3}{2} m_\pi$, the Silver Blaze phenomenon arises due to functional determinants having nontrivial phases that lead to cancellations between different gauge configurations. The mechanism leading to such cancellations remains unknown.</description>

      <title>Chemical potential differentials in the QCD phase diagram from heavy-ion isobar collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature and baryon, charge, and strangeness chemical potentials characterize QCD matter under extreme conditions. Differences between these chemical potentials and their ratios probe conserved-charge correlations and the system's response in the multidimensional QCD phase diagram. We extract these quantities from STAR Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr isobar collisions using a Bayesian thermal analysis of hadron yields, which substantially reduces systematic uncertainties, and compare them with Taylor-expanded lattice-QCD and Chiral Mean Field model predictions. Isobar collisions thus emerge as a precision probe of four-dimensional QCD thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Competing decay modes and stability analysis of superheavy nuclei with Z = 120 using relativistic mean-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically study the competition between {\alpha}-decay and spontaneous fission in even-even superheavy nuclei with (Z=120) and 256 \leq A \leq 304 within the preformed cluster-decay model using microscopic inputs from relativistic mean-field calculations with the NL3 parameter set. The {\alpha}-decay half-lives are obtained from WKB barrier penetration with empirically determined preformation factors, self-consistent Q_{\alpha} values from RMF, and nuclear interaction potentials constructed using both M3Y and relativistic R3Y nucleon-nucleon forces, and are benchmarked against standard semi-empirical formulas. Our results predict reduced spontaneous fission probabilities and extended {\alpha}-decay chains toward the fermium region for isotopes with 296 \leq A \leq 304, with enhanced stability reflected in maxima of log_{10} T_{1/2} around neutron numbers N \approx 166-182. In particular, the nuclei 296,298,300,302,304_{120} are identified as the most favorable candidates for survival against fission, demonstrating the crucial role of shell effects, deformation, and pairing correlations and providing quantitative guidance for future experimental searches of Z=120 nuclei.</description>

      <title>Cone-Dependent Jet Collisional Energy Loss in Finite QCD Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a compact HTL-resummed expression for the leading-order jet collisional energy loss in a finite-size, finite-temperature QCD medium. Defining the jet energy inside a cone of radius $R$, we obtain the out-of-cone elastic energy loss with an explicit separation between contributions from the primary jet parton and recoiling medium partons. The result reproduces the known partonic limit as $R\!\to\!0$, vanishes for $R\!\to\!\pi$, and applies to both light- and heavy-flavor jets. Numerically, the elastic component shows a pronounced non-linear $R$ dependence relative to the radiative baseline, and its importance increases with $R$, becoming comparable to or exceeding the radiative contribution for sufficiently large jet radii. The path-length dependence remains close to linear for all $R$, while the medium-response contribution can exceed $10\%$ for realistic jet radii.</description>

      <title>Medium separation scheme effects on the magnetized and cold two-flavor superconducting quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the impact of the Medium Separation Scheme (MSS) on two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) dense quark matter under the influence of a constant external magnetic field. The effects of the proper treatment of the model divergences are examined through a comparison of different approaches, including the combined implementation of the Magnetic Field Independent Regularization (MFIR) and the MSS, as well as the standard use of smooth form factors. Our findings for the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model emphasize the critical role of properly separating medium effects from vacuum contributions in the model. The combined MFIR-MSS scheme suppresses spurious unphysical oscillations, often misinterpreted in the literature as de Haas--van Alphen oscillations, and ensures the correct high-density behavior of the diquark condensate. Furthermore, within the MSS framework, the magnetization remains positive across the explored parameter space, in sharp contrast with the behavior obtained in the traditional approach.</description>

      <title>Nucleon axial-vector form factor and radius from radiatively-corrected antineutrino scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nucleon axial-vector form factor, $G_A$, is critical to determine the electroweak interactions of leptons with nucleons. Important examples of processes influenced by $G_A$ are elastic (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering and muon capture by the proton. Sparse experimental data results in a large uncertainty on the momentum dependence of $G_A$ and has motivated the consideration of new experimental probes and first-principles lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) evaluations. The comparison of new and precise theoretical predictions for $G_A$ with future experimental data necessitates the application of radiative corrections to experimentally-observable processes. We apply these corrections in the extraction of $G_A$ and the associated axial-vector radius from the recent MINERvA antineutrino-hydrogen data, compare the effects from radiative corrections to other uncertainties in neutrino scattering experiments, and discuss the comparison of lattice QCD evaluations to experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Scaling Properties of Two-Particle-Two-Hole Responses in Asymmetric Nuclei for Neutrino Scattering within the Relativistic Mean-Field Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematic analysis of the nuclear dependence of two-particle-two-hole meson-exchange current contributions to inclusive lepton-nucleus scattering within the relativistic mean-field framework. We present microscopic calculations of nuclear responses for a set of 17 nuclei, ranging from helium to uranium, using a model with different Fermi momenta for protons and neutrons. We propose a novel scaling prescription based on the two-particle phase space and key nuclear parameters. The resulting description is accurate over a wide range of nuclear targets, with typical deviations below 10\%, and allows for a separate treatment of the different emission channels. In addition, a consistent benchmark against electron-scattering data is provided. The parametrization presented provides a practical framework for extending the responses to different nuclear targets in neutrino event generators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the $\Omega(2380)$ resonance and show that it is consistent with a dynamically generated state arising from the $\bar{K}^*\Xi^*$, $\omega\Omega$, and $\phi\Omega$ interactions. In this picture, the $\Omega(2380)$ is analogous to the $\Omega(2012)$, which is generated from the $\bar{K}\Xi^*$ and $\eta\Omega$ channels. The resulting mass, total width, and partial decay widths into the $\bar{K}\Xi^*$ and $\bar{K}^*\Xi$ channels are compatible with the available experimental data. We also discuss possible experimental observables that could provide further insight into the nature of this state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential manifestation of a hexaquark, the H particle, as a constituent within neutron stars. The H particle, characterized by a quark composition of $uuddss$, is constructed using the framework of Chromomagnetic Interaction (CMI). Specifically, we contemplate the flavor-singlet state H with $J^P=0^+$. Our computations indicate that the three-flavor hexaquark state, the H particle, possesses a lower mass of $2212.7~\rm{MeV}$ in comparison to the $d^*(2380)$, implying greater stability than the two-flavor $d^*(2380)$. The analysis involving the H particle is carried out using the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. We investigate the influence of H particle couplings, a key factor in determining the system stability, and focus on the potential existence of H particle within neutron stars. We find that H particle could potentially endure as a stable constituent within neutron stars, and lead to a reduction of the maximum mass.</description>

      <title>Finite Gaussian assistance protocols and a conic metric for extremizing spacelike vacuum entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a pure Gaussian tripartition, a range of entanglement between two parties ($AB$) can be purified through classical communication of Gaussian measurements performed within the third ($C$). To begin, this work introduces a direct method to calculate a hierarchic series of projective $C$ measurements for the removal of any $AB$ Gaussian noise, circumventing divergences in prior protocols. Next, a multimode conic framework is developed for pursuing the maximum (Gaussian entanglement of assistance, GEOA) or minimum (Gaussian entanglement of formation, GEOF) pure entanglement that may be revealed or required between $AB$. Within this framework, a geometric necessary and sufficient entanglement condition emerges as a doubly-enclosed conic volume, defining a novel distance metric for conic optimization. Extremizing this distance for spacelike vacuum entanglement in the massless and massive free scalar fields yields (1) the highest known lower bound to GEOA, the first that decays slower than the two-point correlation functions and (2) the lowest known upper bound to GEOF, the first that decays exponentially mirroring the mixed $AB$ negativity. Furthermore, combination of the above with a generalization of previous partially-transposed noise filtering techniques allows calculation of a single $C$ measurement that maximizes the purified $AB$ entanglement. Beyond expectation that these behaviors of spacelike GEOA and GEOF persist in interacting theories, the present measurement and optimization techniques are applicable to physical many-body Gaussian states beyond quantum fields.</description>

      <title>Nonradial oscillations of stratified neutron stars with solid crusts: Mode characterization and tidal resonances in coalescing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical tides of neutron stars in the late stages of binary inspirals provide a viable probe into dense matter through gravitational waves, and potentially trigger electromagnetic precursors. We model the tidal response as a set of driven harmonic oscillators, where the natural frequencies are given by the quasinormal modes of a nonrotating neutron star. These modes are calculated in general relativity by applying linear perturbation theory to stellar models that include a solid crust and compositional stratification. For the mode spectrum, we find that the canonical interface mode associated with the crust-core boundary vanishes in stratified neutron stars and is replaced by compositional gravity modes with mixed gravity-interfacial character, driven primarily by strong buoyancy in the outer core. We also find that fluid modes such as the core gravity mode and the fundamental mode can penetrate the crust, and we establish a criterion for such penetration. Regarding the tidal interaction, we find that transfer of binding energy to oscillations is dominated by the fundamental mode despite its frequency being too high to resonate with the tidal forcing. In general, we find that lower-frequency modes induce gravitational-wave phase shifts smaller than $\sim 10^{-3},\rm rad$ for the equation of state we consider. We discover that nonresonant fundamental and crustal shear modes can trigger crust breaking already near the first gravity-mode resonance, while gravity-mode resonance concentrates strain at the base of the crust and may marginally crack it. These results suggest that both resonant and nonresonant excitations can overstress the crust and may channel energy into the magnetosphere prior to merger, potentially powering electromagnetic precursors. Our work represents an important step toward realistic modeling of dynamical tides of neutron stars in multimessenger observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first evaluation of virtual resonance contributions to the charged-current (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering at GeV energies, focusing on the dominant $\Delta(1232)$ resonance. We approximate the vector part of the $N \to \Delta$ transition by the leading magnetic dipole term. Our results for the cross-section corrections at fixed neutrino energy indicate the permille-level contribution of resonance intermediate states to the elastic and radiative scattering cross sections. This calculation exhibits the expected infrared behavior of the invariant amplitudes and unpolarized cross sections. Our findings provide important insights into inelastic excitations in the charged-current (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering at GeV energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rich analytic structure of hadronic form factors makes a theoretically consistent yet easily applicable parametrisation cumbersome. Consequently, most parametrisations are limited to reproducing the simplest analytic features sufficient to describe form factors on their first Riemann sheet. Here, we introduce two novel form factor parametrisations that allow resonance poles and left-hand cuts on the second Riemann sheet to be studied, while also making the connection to partial-wave amplitudes manifest.</description>

Abstract: A size-extensive, converging, black-box, ab initio coupled-cluster ($\Delta$CC) ansatz is introduced that computes the energies and wave functions of stationary states from any degenerate or nondegenerate Slater-determinant references with any numbers of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-spin electrons, and any patterns of orbital occupancy. For a nondegenerate reference, it is identical to the single-reference coupled-cluster ansatz. For a degenerate multireference, it is a natural coupled-cluster extension of degenerate perturbation ($\Delta$MP) theory. For ionized and electron-attached references, it can be viewed as a coupled-cluster Green's function, although the present theory is convergent toward the full-configuration-interaction (FCI) limits, while many-body Green's function (MBGF) theory generally is not. Its single-excitation instance is a projection Hartree-Fock theory for a degenerate or nondegenerate reference as per the Thouless theorem, which may be useful for core ionizations, high-spin states, and possibly electron affinities. A new, size-extensive, converging, general-model-space state-universal multireference coupled-cluster (SUMRCC) theory is also proposed, to which $\Delta$CC theory is directly related. Determinant-based, general-order algorithms of $\Delta$CC and SUMRCC theories are implemented, which are compared with configuration-interaction (CI) and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) theories through octuple excitations and with $\Delta$MP and MBGF theories up to the 19th order. An algebraic, optimal-scaling, order-by-order algorithm of $\Delta$CC theory is also computer-synthesized at the levels of single excitation ($\Delta$CCS) and of single and double excitations ($\Delta$CCSD). The order of performance is: SUMRCC $\approx$ $\Delta$CC $&gt;$ EOM-CC $&gt;$ CI at the same order or SUMRCC $\approx$ $\Delta$CC $&gt;$ $\Delta$MP $&gt;$ MBGF at the same cost scaling.</description>
