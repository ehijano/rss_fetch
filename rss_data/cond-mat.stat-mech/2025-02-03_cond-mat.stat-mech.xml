      <title>Entropy of small subsystems in thermalizing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entropy of small subsystems in thermalizing quantum many-body systems governed by local Hamiltonians. Assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, we derive an analytical formula for the von Neumann entropy of equilibrated subsystems. This formula reveals how subsystem entropy depends on the microscopic parameters of the Hamiltonian and the macroscopic properties of the initial state. Furthermore, our results provide a theoretical explanation for recent numerical findings by Maceira and L\"auchli, obtained via exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Active particles in moving traps: minimum work protocols and information efficiency of work extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the fundamental problem of moving a particle in a harmonic trap in finite time with minimal work cost, and extend it to the case of an active particle. By comparing the Gaussian case of an Active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle and the non-Gaussian run-and-tumble particle, we establish general principles for thermodynamically optimal control of active matter beyond specific models. We show that the open-loop optimal protocols, which do not incorporate system-state information, are identical to those of passive particles but result in larger work fluctuations due to activity. In contrast, closed-loop (or feedback) control with a single (initial) measurement changes the optimal protocol and reduces the average work relative to the open-loop control for small enough measurement errors. Minimum work is achieved by particles with finite persistence time. As an application, we propose an active information engine which extracts work from self-propulsion. This periodic engine achieves higher information efficiency with run-and-tumble particles than with active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles. Complementing a companion paper that gives only the main results [arXiv:2407.18542], here we provide a full account of our theoretical calculations and simulation results. We include derivations of optimal protocols, work variance, impact of measurement uncertainty, and information-acquisition costs.</description>

      <title>Probability Distributions of the order parameter of the Ising Model at two loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exists an entire family of universal PDFs of the magnetization mode of the three dimensional Ising model parameterized by $\zeta = \lim_{L,\xi_{\infty}}L/\xi_{\infty}$ which is the ratio of the system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$ with both the thermodynamic limit and the critical limit being taken simultaneously at fixed $\zeta$. Recently, the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the magnetization mode of the three-dimensional Ising model has been computed at one-loop in the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion [arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.12603 (2024)]. We show how these PDFs or, equivalently, the rate functions which are their logarithm, can be systematically computed at second order of the perturbative expansion. We compute the whole family of universal rate-functions and show that their agreement with the Monte Carlo data improves significantly at this order when compared to their one-loop counterpart.</description>

      <title>Classical Information Exchange Between Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow of information within many-body systems is a fundamental feature of physical interaction. Given an underlying classical physics model for the interaction between a particle and its environment, we give meaning to and quantify the information passed between them over time. We show that the maximum information exchange rate is proportional to the ratio of inter-particle energy flow and initial particle energy -- a sort of signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, a single time-point (as opposed to trajectory) observability relation emerges.</description>

      <title>Subharmonic spin correlations and spectral pairing in Floquet time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet time crystals are characterized by subharmonic behavior of temporal correlation functions. Studying the paradigmatic time crystal based on the disordered Floquet quantum Ising model, we show that its temporal spin correlations are directly related to spectral characteristics and that this relation provides analytical expressions for the correlation function of finite chains, which compare favorably with numerical simulations. Specifically, we show that the disorder-averaged temporal spin correlations are proportional to the Fourier transform of the splitting distribution of the pairs of eigenvalues of the Floquet operator, which differ by $\pi$ to exponential accuracy in the chain length. We find that the splittings are well described by a log-normal distribution, implying that the temporal spin correlations are characterized by two parameters. We discuss possible implications for the phase diagram of the Floquet time crystals.</description>

      <title>Optimal constrained control for generally damped Brownian heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate maximum power and efficiency protocols for cyclic heat engines based on a generally damped Brownian particle confined in a harmonic potential, subject to experimentally motivated constraints on the potential stiffness and bath temperature. These constraints render traditional geometric and mass transport methods inapplicable, as they rely on fixed control or response parameters at specific points in the cycle. Instead, we develop an iterative algorithm grounded in optimal control theory, enabling simultaneous optimization of cycle time and the time-dependent variations of stiffness and temperature. We validate the algorithm against analytical results in the deeply overdamped regime and extend its application to systems with general damping rates. As the damping rate decreases from a deeply overdamped to a deeply underdamped regime, the maximum power diminishes to zero, and the corresponding cycle time diverges. For a fixed cycle time, the maximum efficiency exhibits a comparable trend. In the generally damped regime, the stiffness and temperature protocols display intricate, non-monotonic features, in stark contrast to the simpler patterns observed in extreme damping limits. Furthermore, optimizing the temperature profile significantly enhances efficiency, particularly in intermediate damping regimes. Our findings demonstrate how experimental constraints fundamentally influence optimal control protocols.</description>

      <title>Top eigenvalue statistics of diluted Wishart matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the replica method, we compute analytically the average largest eigenvalue of diluted covariance matrices of the form $\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is a $N\times M$ sparse data matrix, in the limit of large $N,M$ with fixed ratio. We allow for random non-zero weights, provided they lead to an isolated largest eigenvalue. By formulating the problem as the optimisation of a quadratic Hamiltonian constrained to the $N$-sphere at low temperatures, we derive a set of recursive distributional equations for auxiliary probability density functions, which can be efficiently solved using a population dynamics algorithm. The average largest eigenvalue is identified with a Lagrange parameter that governs the convergence of the algorithm. We find excellent agreement between our analytical results and numerical results obtained from direct diagonalisation.</description>

      <title>Turbulence: A Nonequilibrium Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tools of quantum and statistical field theories have ben successfully ported to turbulence. Here, we review the key results of turbulence field theory. Thermalized spectrally-truncated Euler equation is described by \textit{equilibrium field theory}, in which the equipartitioned Fourier modes generate zero energy flux. In contrast, modelling of hydrodynamic turbulence (HDT), which has small viscosity, requires \textit{nonequilibrium field theory}. In HDT, the viscosity is renormalized using field theory that leads to wavenumber-dependent viscosity and energy spectrum. Field theory calculations also yields nonzero energy flux for HDT. These field theory computations have been generalized to other systems, e.g., passive scalar and magnetohydrodynamics. In this review, we cover these aspects, along with a brief coverage of weak turbulence and intermittency.</description>

      <title>The tricritical Ising CFT and conformal bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tricritical Ising CFT is the IR fixed-point of $\lambda\phi^6$ theory. It can be seen as a one-parameter family of CFTs connecting between an $\varepsilon$-expansion near the upper critical dimension 3 and the exactly solved minimal model in $d=2$. We review what is known about the tricritical Ising CFT, and study it with the numerical conformal bootstrap for various dimensions. Using a mixed system with three external operators $\{\phi\sim\sigma,\phi^2\sim \epsilon,\phi^3\sim\sigma'\}$, we find three-dimensional "bootstrap islands" in $d=2.75$ and $d=2.5$ dimensions consistent with interpolations between the perturbative estimates and the 2d exact values. In $d=2$ and $d=2.25$ the setup is not strong enough to isolate the theory. This paper also contains a survey of the perturbative spectrum and a review of results from the literature.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable Picosecond-scale Octupole Fluctuations in Chiral Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theory for the relaxation time of the octupole order parameter in nanoscale chiral antiferromagnets (AFMs) coupled to thermal baths and spin injection sources. Using stochastic spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the octupole moment relaxes through two distinct mechanisms$-$escape over a barrier and precessional dephasing$-$as the barrier for octupole fluctuations is lowered relative to the thermal energy. Notably, the octupole moment relaxes orders of magnitude faster than the typical dipolar order parameters, reaching picosecond timescales. By combining Langer's theory with an effective low-energy description of octupole dynamics in chiral AFMs, we derive analytical expressions for the relaxation times. We find that relaxation in chiral AFMs parallels dipole relaxation in XY magnets, with exchange fields serving the role of the dipole fields. Further, by drawing on the analogy between order parameter dynamics in XY magnets under spin injection and current-biased Josephson junctions, we propose a new scheme for electrically tuning the octupole relaxation times. Our work offers fundamental insights for the development of next-generation spintronic devices that harness octupole order parameters for information encoding, especially in octupole-based probabilistic computing.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for overfitting in energy-based modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of limited data on training pairwise energy-based models for inverse problems aimed at identifying interaction networks. Utilizing the Gaussian model as testbed, we dissect training trajectories across the eigenbasis of the coupling matrix, exploiting the independent evolution of eigenmodes and revealing that the learning timescales are tied to the spectral decomposition of the empirical covariance matrix. We see that optimal points for early stopping arise from the interplay between these timescales and the initial conditions of training. Moreover, we show that finite data corrections can be accurately modeled through asymptotic random matrix theory calculations and provide the counterpart of generalized cross-validation in the energy based model context. Our analytical framework extends to binary-variable maximum-entropy pairwise models with minimal variations. These findings offer strategies to control overfitting in discrete-variable models through empirical shrinkage corrections, improving the management of overfitting in energy-based generative models.</description>

      <title>Grassmann tensor approach for two-dimensional QCD in the strong-coupling expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a tensor-network approach for the strong-coupling expansion of two-dimensional QCD with staggered quarks at non-zero chemical potential. After expanding the Boltzmann factor in the gauge and fermion actions, all gauge fields can be integrated out exactly and the partition function can be evaluated using the Grassmann higher-order tensor renormalization group approach. The method is modified to compute the $\mu$ dependence of the quark number density and the chiral condensate up to order $\beta^3$ with complete absence of higher-order terms infiltrating the result. Although the expansion itself is only a good approximation to the full theory at small $\beta&lt;0.1$, the range can be extended, by using judiciously chosen fits. Moreover, these fits also yield a valuable expansion in $\beta$ for the critical chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Aging Dynamics and Velocity Field Correlations in Three-Dimensional Uniformly Heated Granular Gases: A Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a molecular dynamics simulation of an inelastic gas system utilizing an event-driven algorithm combined with a thermostat mechanism. Initially, the kinetic energy of the system experiences a decay before settling into a non-equilibrium steady state. To explore the aging characteristics, we analyze the velocity autocorrelation function, denoted as \( C(t_w, t) \). Our findings indicate that \( C(t_w, t) \) exhibits a dependence on both waiting time \( t_w \) and correlation time \( t \) in an independent manner. At the outset, \( C(t_w, t) \) demonstrates an exponential decay pattern. With increasing \( t_w \), a slower decay is observed, which can be attributed to the development of correlations in the velocity field. The explicit relationship of \( C(t_w, t) \) with respect to \( t_w \) serves as compelling evidence of the aging properties present in the system. These results deepen our comprehension of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and the dynamics of dissipative systems. Our research has significant implications for a range of applications involving inelastic collisions, extending from granular materials to phenomena observed in astrophysics. The simulation methodology and the insights gained contribute to the wider field of complex systems, shedding light on the behavior of systems that are far from equilibrium, particularly those characterized by energy dissipation due to inelastic interactions.</description>

      <title>Reactive path ensembles within nonequilibrium steady-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modern theory of rare events is grounded in near equilibrium ideas, however many systems of modern interest are sufficiently far from equilibrium that traditional approaches do not apply. Using the recently developed variational path sampling methodology, we study systems evolving within nonequilibrium steady states to elucidate how reactive processes are altered away from equilibrium. Variational path sampling provides access to ensembles of reactive events, and a means of quantifying the relative importance of each dynamical degree of freedom in such processes. With it, we have studied the conformational change of a solute in an active bath. We illustrate how energy injection generically enhances the rates of rare events, even when energy is not directed into specific reactive modes. By studying the folding and unfolding transitions of a grafted polymer under shear, we illustrate how nonequilibrium reactive processes do not follow gradient paths due to the emergence of persistent currents. The breaking of detailed balance allows for the mechanisms of forward and backward reactions to be distinct, enabling novel pathways to be explored and designed, and states unstable in equilibrium to become stabilized kinetically away from it. The analysis presented in this work establishes some basic principles for nonequilibrium reactive events, and is made possible by the use of a numerical method that does not invoke proximity to equilibrium or requires strong prior assumptions about the mechanism of reaction.</description>

      <title>Modular covariant torus partition functions of dense $A_1^{(1)}$ and dilute $A_2^{(2)}$ loop models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Yang-Baxter integrable dense $A_1^{(1)}$ and dilute $A_2^{(2)}$ loop models are considered on the torus in their simplest physical regimes. A combination of boundary conditions $(h,v)$ is applied in the horizontal and vertical directions with $h,v=0$ and $1$ for periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions respectively. The fugacities of non-contractible and contractible loops are denoted by $\alpha$ and $\beta$ respectively where $\beta$ is simply related to the crossing parameter $\lambda$. At roots of unity, when $\lambda/\pi\in\mathbb Q$, these models are the dense ${\cal LM}(p,p')$ and dilute ${\cal DLM}(p,p')$ logarithmic minimal models with $p,p'$ coprime integers. We conjecture the scaling limits of the transfer matrix traces in the standard modules with $d$ defects and deduce the conformal partition functions ${\cal Z}_{\textrm{dense}}^{(h,v)}(\alpha)$ and ${\cal Z}_{\textrm{dilute}}^{(h,v)}(\alpha)$ using Markov traces. These are expressed in terms of functions ${\cal Z}_{m,m'}(g)$ known from the Coulomb gas arguments of Di Francesco, Saleur and Zuber and subsequently as sesquilinear forms in Verma characters. Crucially, we find that the partition functions are identical for the dense and dilute models. The coincidence of these conformal partition functions provides compelling evidence that, for given $(p,p')$, these dense and dilute theories lie in the same universality class. In root of unity cases with $\alpha=2$, the $(h,v)$ modular covariant partition functions are also expressed as sesquilinear forms in affine $u(1)$ characters involving generalized Bezout conjugates. These also give the modular covariant partition functions for the 6-vertex and Izergin-Korepin 19-vertex models in the corresponding regimes.</description>

      <title>On the optimal relaxation rate for the Metropolis algorithm in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relaxation of the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm corresponding to a single particle trapped in a one-dimensional confining potential, with even jump distributions that ensure that the dynamics verifies detailed balance. Previous work suggested that, for smooth jump distributions, the fastest relaxation rate is obtained as a result of the competition between diffusive and rejection-dominated dynamics. In this work, we show that a new regime comes into play for two-peaked jump distributions, where the relaxation dynamics is neither dominated by diffusion nor rejection: the eigenmodes adopt an oscillatory form, reminiscent of charge density waves (CDW) -- thus we term this new regime the CDW regime. Using a combination of numerical and analytical techniques, the parameter regions corresponding to diffusion, rejection, and CDW are characterised, as well as the transition lines between them -- i.e. a phase diagram is built. The optimal relaxation rate is located at the triple point of phase coexistence, where the transition lines (diffusive-rejection, diffusive-CDW, and CDW-rejection) intersect. Our theoretical framework is checked versus the numerical diagonalisation of the master equation. We also briefly discuss more sophisticated attempts at optimising the relaxation rate to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Hidden zero modes and topology of multiband non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a finite one-dimensional non-Hermitian system, the number of zero modes does not necessarily reflect the topology of the system. This is known as the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence and has led to misconceptions about the topological protection of edge modes in such systems. Here we show why this breakdown does occur and that it typically results in hidden zero modes, extremely long-lived zero energy excitations, which are only revealed when considering the singular value instead of the eigenvalue spectrum. We point out, furthermore, that in a finite multiband non-Hermitian system with Hamiltonian $H$, one needs to consider also the reflected Hamiltonian $\tilde H$, which is in general distinct from the adjoint $H^\dagger$, to properly relate the number of protected zeroes to the winding number of $H$.</description>

      <title>The phase transition in bounded-size Achlioptas processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:1704.08714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perhaps the best understood phase transition is that in the component structure of the uniform random graph process introduced by Erd\H{o}s and R\'enyi around 1960. Since the model is so fundamental, it is very interesting to know which features of this phase transition are specific to the model, and which are `universal', at least within some larger class of processes (a `universality class'). Achlioptas process, a class of variants of the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi process that are easy to define but difficult to analyze, have been extensively studied from this point of view. Here, settling a number of conjectures and open problems, we show that all `bounded-size' Achlioptas processes share (in a strong sense) all the key features of the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi phase transition. We do not expect this to hold for Achlioptas processes in general.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Approach to Logical Qubit Fidelities of Neutral Atom CSS Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Encoding quantum information in a quantum error correction (QEC) code enhances protection against errors. Imperfection of quantum devices due to decoherence effects will limit the fidelity of quantum gate operations. In particular, neutral atom quantum computers will suffer from correlated errors because of the finite lifetime of the Rydberg states that facilitate entanglement. Predicting the impact of such errors on the performance of topological QEC codes is important in understanding and characterising the fidelity limitations of a real quantum device. Mapping a QEC code to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with disorder allows us to use Monte Carlo techniques to calculate upper bounds on error rates without resorting to an optimal decoder. In this Article, we adopt this statistical mapping to predict error rate thresholds for neutral atom architecture, assuming radiative decay to the computational basis, leakage and atom loss as the sole error sources. We quantify this error rate threshold $p_\text{th}$ and bounds on experimental constraints, given any set of experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Duality defect in a deformed transverse-field Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical quantities with long lifetimes have both theoretical significance in the study of quantum many-body systems and practical implications for quantum technologies. In this manuscript, we investigate the roles played by topological defects in the construction of quasi-conserved quantities, using as a prototypical example the Kramers-Wannier duality defect in a deformed 1d quantum transverse field Ising model. We construct the duality defect Hamiltonian in three different ways: half-chain Kramers-Wannier transformation, utilization of techniques in the Ising fusion category, and defect-modified weak integrability breaking deformation. The third method is also applicable for the study of generic integrable defects under weak integrability breaking deformations. We also work out the deformation of defect-modified higher charges in the model and study their slower decay behavior. Furthermore, we consider the corresponding duality defect twisted deformed Floquet transverse field Ising model, and investigate the stability of the isolated zero mode associated with the duality defect in the integrable Floquet Ising model, under such weak integrability breaking deformation.</description>

      <title>Crosscap Quenches and Entanglement Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms by which complex correlations emerge through the dynamics of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. To address this, quench dynamics starting from nonthermal states have been extensively studied, leading to significant progress. In this paper, we propose a novel quench protocol, termed the "crosscap quench", to investigate how highly structured thermal pure states relax into typical ones. We begin by analyzing conformal field theories (CFTs) and derive universal features in the time evolution of the entanglement entropy. Furthermore, leveraging the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study holographic CFTs, providing an analytically tractable example in chaotic CFTs. Finally, we validate these findings through numerical simulations in both nonintegrable and integrable quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Quantitative low-temperature spectral asymptotics for reversible diffusions in temperature-dependent domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive novel low-temperature asymptotics for the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. The novelty is that this operator is endowed with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions at the boundary of a domain which depends on the temperature. From the point of view of stochastic processes, this gives information on the long-time behavior of the diffusion conditioned on non-absorption at the boundary, in the so-called quasistationary regime. Our results provide precise estimates of the spectral gap and principal eigenvalue, extending the Eyring-Kramers formula. The phenomenology is richer than in the case of a fixed boundary and gives new insight into the sensitivity of the spectrum with respect to the shape of the domain near critical points of the energy function. Our work is motivated by--and is relevant to--the problem of finding optimal hyperparameters for accelerated molecular dynamics algorithms.</description>
