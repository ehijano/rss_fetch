      <title>Magnetic fields on sub-Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a classical correspondence between magnetic flows and sub-Riemannian geometry, first established by Montgomery, we undertake a systematic study of magnetic flows on sub-Riemannian manifolds.
  We focus on three-dimensional contact manifolds, and we show that magnetic fields are naturally defined through Rumin differential forms. We provide a geometric interpretation of the sub-Riemannian magnetic geodesic flow, demonstrating that it can be understood as a geodesic flow on a suitably defined lifted sub-Riemannian structure, which is of Engel type when the magnetic field is non-vanishing.
  In the general case, when the magnetic field might be vanishing, we investigate the geometry of this lifted structure, characterizing properties such as its step and the abnormal trajectories in terms of the analytical features of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Capillary Christoffel-Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The result of Guan and Ma (Invent. Math. 151 (2003)) states that if $\phi^{-1/k} : \mathbb{S}^n \to (0,\infty)$ is spherically convex, then $\phi$ arises as the $\sigma_k$ curvature (the $k$-th elementary symmetric function of the principal radii of curvature) of a strictly convex hypersurface. In this paper, we establish an analogous result in the capillary setting in the half-space for $\theta\in(0,\pi/2)$: if $\phi^{-1/k} : \mathcal{C}_{\theta} \to (0,\infty)$ is a capillary function and spherically convex, then $\phi$ is the $\sigma_k$ curvature of a strictly convex capillary hypersurface.</description>

      <title>Chern-Ricci flow and t-Gauduchon Ricci-flat condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $t$-Gauduchon Ricci-flat condition under the Chern-Ricci flow. In this setting, we provide examples of Chern-Ricci flow on compact non-K\"ahler Calabi-Yau manifolds which do not preserve the $t$-Gauduchon Ricci-flat condition for $t&lt;1$. The approach presented generalizes some previous constructions on Hopf manifolds. Also, we provide non-trivial new examples of balanced non-pluriclosed solution to the pluriclosed flow on non-K\"ahler manifolds. Further, we describe the limiting behavior, in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense, of geometric flows of Hermitian metrics (including the Chern-Ricci flow and the pluriclosed flow) on certain principal torus bundles over flag manifolds. In this last setting, we describe explicitly the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the pluriclosed flow on principal $T^{2}$-bundles over the Fano threefold ${\mathbb{P}}(T_{{\mathbb{P}^{2}}})$.</description>

      <title>The moduli space of Hermitian-Yang-Mills connections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Hermitian-Yang-Mills connections (HYM) on a smooth Hermitian vector bundle over compact K\"{a}hler manifold. We prove that (1) The moduli space of irreducible HYM connections is a complex manifold in a neighbourhood of points satisfying suitable condition. (2) There is an open injection from the moduli space of irreducible HYM connections into the moduli space of simple Higgs structures. We use a similar method as the one used in studying the moduli spaces of Hermitian-Eisntein connections on a smooth Hermitian vector bundle over compact K\"{a}hler manifold.</description>

      <title>Compact Manifolds with Unbounded Nilpotent Fundamental Groups and Positive Ricci Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It follows from the work of Kapovitch and Wilking that a closed manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature has an almost nilpotent fundamental group. Leftover questions and conjectures have asked if in this context the fundamental group is actually uniformly almost abelian. The main goal of this work is to construct examples $(M^{10}_k, g_k)$ with uniformly positive Ricci curvature ${\rm Ric}_{g_k}\geq 9$ whose fundamental groups cannot be uniformly virtually abelian.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of ancient ovals in higher dimensional mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the classification of compact ancient noncollapsed mean curvature flows of hypersurfaces in arbitrary dimensions. More precisely, we study $k$-ovals in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, defined as ancient noncollapsed solutions whose tangent flow at $-\infty$ is given by $\mathbb{R}^k \times S^{n-k}((2(n-k)|t|)^{\frac{1}{2}})$ for some $k \in \{1,\dots,n-1\}$, and whose fine cylindrical matrix has full rank. A significant advance achieved recently by Choi and Haslhofer suggests that the shrinking $n$-sphere and $k$-ovals together account for all compact ancient noncollapsed solutions in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. We prove that $k$-ovals are $\mathbb{Z}^{k}_2 \times \mathrm{O}(n+1-k)$-symmetric and are uniquely determined by $(k-1)$-dimensional spectral ratio parameters. This result is sharp in view of the $(k-1)$-parameter family of $\mathbb{Z}^{k}_2 \times \mathrm{O}(n+1-k)$-symmetric ancient ovals constructed by Du and Haslhofer, as well as the conjecture of Angenent, Daskalopoulos and Sesum concerning the moduli space of ancient solutions. We also establish a new spectral stability theorem, which suggests the local $(k-1)$-rectifiability of the moduli space of $k$-ovals modulo space-time rigid motion and parabolic rescaling. In contrast to the case of $2$-ovals in $\mathbb{R}^4$, resolved by Choi, Daskalopoulos, Du, Haslhofer and Sesum, the general case for arbitrary $k$ and $n$ presents new challenges beyond increased algebraic complexity. In particular, the quadratic concavity estimates in the collar region and the absence of a global parametrization with regularity information pose major obstacles. To address these difficulties, we introduce a novel test tensor that produces essential gradient terms for the tensor maximum principle, and we derive a local Lipschitz continuity result by parameterizing $k$-ovals with nearly matching spectral ratio parameters.</description>

      <title>Links between the integrable systems of CMC surfaces, isothermic surfaces and constrained Willmore surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since constant mean curvature surfaces in 3-space are special cases of isothermic and constrained Willmore surfaces, they give rise to three, apriori distinct, integrable systems. We provide a comprehensive and unified view of these integrable systems in terms of the associated families of flat connections and their parallel sections: in case of a CMC surface, parallel sections of all three associated families of flat connections are given algebraically by parallel sections of either one of the families. As a consequence, we provide a complete description of the links between the simple factor dressing given by the conformal Gauss map, the simple factor dressing given by isothermicity, the simple factor dressing given by the harmonic Gauss map, as well as the relationship to the classical, the $\mu$- and the $\varrho$-Darboux transforms of a CMC surface. Moreover, we establish the associated family of the CMC surfaces as limits of the associated family of isothermic surfaces and constrained Willmore surfaces.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we use the warped \( \mu \)-bubble method to study the consequences of a spectral curvature bound. In particular, with a lower spectral Ricci curvature bound and lower spectral scalar curvature bound, we show that the band width of a torical band is bounded above.

      <title>Geodesic interpretation of the global quasi-geostrophic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an interpretation of the global shallow water quasi-geostrophic equations on the sphere $\Sph^2$ as a geodesic equation on the central extension of the quantomorphism group on $\Sph^3$. The study includes deriving the model as a geodesic equation for a weak Riemannian metric, demonstrating smooth dependence on the initial data, and establishing global-in-time existence and uniqueness of solutions. We also prove that the Lamb parameter in the model has a stabilizing effect on the dynamics: if it is large enough, the sectional curvature along the trade-wind current is positive, implying conjugate points.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and pre-compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To goal of the paper is to introduce a convergence \`a la Gromov-Hausdorff for Lorentzian spaces, building on $\epsilon$-nets consisting of causal diamonds and relying only on the time separation function. This yields a geometric notion of convergence, which can be applied to synthetic Lorentzian spaces (Lorentzian pre-length spaces) or smooth spacetimes. Among the main results, we prove a Lorentzian counterpart of the celebrated Gromov's pre-compactness theorem for metric spaces, where controlled covers by balls are replaced by controlled covers by diamonds. This yields a geometric pre-compactness result for classes of globally hyperbolic spacetimes, satisfying a uniform doubling property on Cauchy hypersurfaces and a suitable control on the causality. The final part of the paper establishes several applications: we show that Chru\'sciel-Grant approximations are an instance of the Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff convergence here introduced, we prove that timelike sectional curvature bounds are stable under such a convergence, we introduce timelike blow-up tangents and discuss connections with the main conjecture of causal set theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies whether the presence of a perimeter minimizing set in a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ forces an isometric splitting. We show that this is the case when $M$ has non-negative sectional curvature and quadratic volume growth at infinity. Moreover, we obtain that the boundary of the perimeter minimizing set is identified with a slice in the product structure of $M$.</description>

Abstract: We present numerical polyhedron data for the image of a piecewise-linear map from a zero-curvature Klein bottle into Euclidean 3-space such that every point in the domain has a neighborhood which is isometrically embedded. To the author's knowledge, this is the first explicit piecewise-smooth isometric immersion of a flat Klein bottle. Intuitively, the surface can be locally made from origami and but for the self-intersections has the global topology of a Klein bottle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Hintz's cosmological black hole gluing result to the Einstein-Maxwell system with positive cosmological constant by gluing multiple Reissner-Nordstr\"om or Kerr--Newman--de Sitter black holes into neighbourhoods of points in the conformal boundary of de Sitter space. We determine necessary and sufficient conditions on the black hole parameters -- related to Friedrich's conformal constraint equations -- for this gluing to be possible. We also improve the original gluing method slightly by showing that the construction of a solution in Taylor series may be accomplished using an exactness argument, eliminating the need for an early gauge-fixing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double Bruhat cells in a complex semisimple Lie group $G$ emerged as a crucial concept in the work of S. Fomin and A. Zelevinsky on total positivity and cluster algebras. Double Bruhat cells are special instances of a broader class of cluster varieties known as generalized double Bruhat cells. These can be studied collectively as Poisson subvarieties of $\widetilde{F}_{2n} = G \times \mathcal{B}^{2n-1}$, where $\mathcal{B}$ is the flag variety of $G$. The spaces $\widetilde{F}_{2n}$ are Poisson groupoids over $\mathcal{B}^n$, and they were introduced in the study of configuration Poisson groupoids of flags by J.-H. Lu, V. Mouquin, and S. Yu.
  In this work, we describe the spaces $\widetilde{F}_{2n}$ as decorated moduli spaces of flat $G$-bundles over a disc. As a consequence, we obtain the following results. (1) We explicitly integrate the Poisson groupoids $\widetilde{F}_{2n}$ to double symplectic groupoids, which are complex algebraic varieties. Moreover, we show that these integrations are symplectically Morita equivalent for all $n$, thereby recovering the Poisson bimodule structures on double Bruhat cells via restriction. (2) Using the previous construction, we integrate the Poisson subgroupoids of $\widetilde{F}_{2n}$ given by unions of generalized double Bruhat cells to explicit double symplectic groupoids. As a corollary, we obtain integrations of the top-dimensional generalized double Bruhat cells inside them. (3) Finally, we relate our integration with the work of P. Boalch on meromorphic connections. We lift to the groupoids the torus actions that give rise to such cluster varieties and show that they correspond to the quasi-Hamiltonian actions on the fission spaces of irregular singularities.</description>

      <title>Gradient modelling of memristive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a gradient modeling framework for memristive systems. Our focus is on memristive systems as they appear in neurophysiology and neuromorphic systems. Revisiting the original definition of Chua, we regard memristive elements as gradient operators of quadratic functionals with respect to a metric determined by the memristance. We explore the consequences of gradient properties for the analysis and design of neuromorphic circuits.</description>

      <title>Positive intermediate curvatures and Ricci flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, for any $n\geq 2$, there exists a homogeneous space of dimension $d=8n-4$ with metrics of $\mathrm{Ric}_{\frac{d}{2}-5}&gt;0$ if $n\neq 3$ and $\mathrm{Ric}_6&gt;0$ if $n=3$ which evolve under the Ricci flow to metrics whose Ricci tensor is not $(d-4)$-positive. Consequently, Ricci flow does not preserve a range of curvature conditions that interpolate between positive sectional and positive scalar curvature. This extends a theorem of B\"ohm and Wilking in the case of $n=2$.</description>

      <title>A family of higher genus complete minimal surfaces that includes the Costa-Hoffman-Meeks one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a one-parameter family of minimal surfaces in the Euclidean $3$-space of arbitrarily high genus and with three ends. Each member of this family is immersed, complete and with finite total curvature. Another interesting property is that the symmetry group of the genus $k$ surfaces $\Sigma_{k,x}$ is the dihedral group with $4(k+1)$ elements. Moreover, in particular, for $|x|=1$ we find the family of the Costa-Hoffman-Meeks embedded minimal surfaces, which have two catenoidal ends and a middle flat end.</description>

      <title>Hypercomplex structures on special linear groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is twofold. First, we prove that the $8$-dimensional Lie group $\operatorname{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})$ does not admit a left-invariant hypercomplex structure. To accomplish this we revise the classification of left-invariant complex structures on $\operatorname{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})$ due to Sasaki. Second, we exhibit a left-invariant hypercomplex structure on $\operatorname{SL}(2n+1,\mathbb{C})$, which arises from a complex product structure on $\operatorname{SL}(2n+1,\mathbb{R})$, for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$. We then show that there are no HKT metrics compatible with this hypercomplex structure. Additionally, we determine the associated Obata connection and we compute explicitly its holonomy group, providing thus a new example of an Obata holonomy group properly contained in $\operatorname{GL}(m,\mathbb{H})$ and not contained in $\operatorname{SL}(m,\mathbb{H})$, where $4m=\dim_\mathbb{R} \operatorname{SL}(2n+1,\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <title>Spectrally distinguishing symmetric spaces II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The action of the subgroup $\operatorname{G}_2$ of $\operatorname{SO}(7)$ (resp.\ $\operatorname{Spin}(7)$ of $\operatorname{SO}(8)$) on the Grassmannian space $M=\frac{\operatorname{SO}(7)}{\operatorname{SO}(5)\times\operatorname{SO}(2)}$ (resp.\ $M=\frac{\operatorname{SO}(8)}{\operatorname{SO}(5)\times\operatorname{SO}(3)}$) is still transitive. We prove that the spectrum (i.e.\ the collection of eigenvalues of its Laplace-Beltrami operator) of a symmetric metric $g_0$ on $M$ coincides with the spectrum of a $\operatorname{G}_2$-invariant (resp.\ $\operatorname{Spin}(7)$-invariant) metric $g$ on $M$ only if $g_0$ and $g$ are isometric. As a consequence, each non-flat compact irreducible symmetric space of non-group type is spectrally unique among the family of all currently known homogeneous metrics on its underlying differentiable manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study diagonal maps between spheres given by two homogeneous polynomial maps between spheres, defined on the same domain sphere. First we find their bitension field, then we give a method for generating proper biharmonic maps between spheres, relying on harmonic homogeneous polynomial maps of different degrees. Further, we establish a result for constructing proper biharmonic product maps using harmonic homogeneous polynomial maps between spheres.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to show that the fundamental group of any smooth complex algebraic variety cannot be realized as a lattice of any simply connected nilpotent Lie group whose Lie algebra is $p$-filiform Lie algebra such that neither abelian nor $2$-step nilpotent. Moreover, we provide a sufficient condition for a lattice in a simply connected nilpotent Lie group of dimension up to $6$ not to be isomorphic to the fundamental group of any smooth complex algebraic variety.</description>

      <title>Integrating Lie algebroids via stacks and applications to Jacobi manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0505158</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/0505158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lie algebroids can not always be integrated into Lie groupoids. We introduce a new object--``Weinstein groupoid'', which is a differentiable stack with groupoid-like axioms. With it, we have solved the integration problem of Lie algebroids. It turns out that every Weinstein groupoid has a Lie algebroid, and every Lie algebroid can be integrated into a Weinstein groupoid.
  Furthermore, we apply this general result to Jacobi manifolds and construct contact groupoids for Jacobi manifolds. There are further applications in prequantization and integrability of Poisson bivectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.08753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct two-dimensional families of complex hyperbolic structures on disc orbibundles over the sphere with three cone points. This contrasts with the previously known examples of the same type, which are locally rigid. In particular, we obtain examples of complex hyperbolic structures on trivial and cotangent disc bundles over closed Riemann surfaces.</description>

      <title>Statistical Bergman geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the Bergman geometry of bounded domains $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{C}^n$ through the lens of Information geometry by introducing an embedding $\Phi: \Omega \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\Omega)$, where $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ denotes a space of probability distributions on $\Omega$. A result by J.Burbea and C. Rao establishes that the pullback of the Fisher information metric, the fundamental Riemannian metric in Information geometry, via $\Phi$ coincides with the Bergman metric of $\Omega$. Building on this idea, we consider $\Omega$ as a statistical model in $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ and present several interesting results within this framework.
  First, we drive a new statistical curvature formula for the Bergman metric by expressing it in terms of covariance. Second, given a proper holomorphic map $f: \Omega_1 \rightarrow \Omega_2$, we prove that if the measure push-forward $\kappa: \mathcal{P}(\Omega_1) \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\Omega_2)$ of $f$ preserves the Fisher information metrics, then $f$ must be a biholomorphism. Finally, we establish consistency and the central limit theorem of the Fr\'echet sample mean for the Calabi's diastasis function.</description>

      <title>Calder\'on problem for systems via complex parallel transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Calder\'on problem for systems with unknown zeroth and first order terms, and improve on previously known results. More precisely, let $(M, g)$ be a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary, let $A$ be a connection matrix on $E = M \times \mathbb{C}^r$ and let $Q$ be a matrix potential. Let $\Lambda_{A, Q}$ be the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of the associated connection Laplacian with a potential. Under the assumption that $(M, g)$ is isometrically contained in the interior of $(\mathbb{R}^2 \times M_0, c(e \oplus g_0))$, where $(M_0, g_0)$ is an arbitrary compact Riemannian manifold with boundary, $e$ is the Euclidean metric on $\mathbb{R}^2$, and $c &gt; 0$, we show that $\Lambda_{A, Q}$ uniquely determines $(A, Q)$ up to natural gauge invariances. Moreover, we introduce new concepts of complex ray transform and complex parallel transport problem, and study their fundamental properties and relations to the Calder\'on problem.</description>

Abstract: For the purposes of abstract theory of signal propagation, a signal is a submanifold of a Riemannian manifold. We obtain energy inequalities, or upper bounds, lower bounds on energy in a number of specific cases, including parameter spaces of Gaussians and spaces of configurations of points. We discuss the role of time as well as graph embeddings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Euler derived the differential equations of elastica by the variational method in 1744, but his original derivation has never been properly interpreted or explained in terms of modern mathematics. We elaborate Euler's original derivation of elastica and show that Euler used Noether's theorem concerning the translational symmetry of elastica, although Noether published her theorem in 1918. It is also shown that his equation is essentially the static modified KdV equation which is obtained by the isometric and isoenergy conditions, known as the Goldstein-Petrich scheme.</description>

      <title>On Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes and Lorentzian to Riemannian metric transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent papers on spacetimes with a signature-changing metric, the concept of a Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole and new elements for Lorentzian-Riemannian signature change have been introduced. A Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole is a signature-changing modification of the Schwarzschild spacetime satisfying the vacuum Einstein equations in a weak sense. Here the event horizon serves as a boundary beyond which time becomes imaginary. We demonstrate that the proper time needed to reach the horizon remains finite, consistently with the classical Schwarzschild solution. About Lorentzian to Riemannian metric transitions, we stress that the hypersurface where the metric signature changes is naturally a spacelike hypersurface which can be identified with the future or past causal boundary of the Lorentzian sector. Moreover, a number of geometric interpretations appear, as the degeneracy of the metric corresponds to the collapse of the causal cones into a line, the degeneracy of the dual metric corresponds to collapsing into a hyperplane, and additional geometric structures on the transition hypersurface (Galilean and dual Galilean) might be explored.</description>
