      <title>A spectral library and census of near-infrared stellar large-amplitude variables from Palomar Gattini-IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a near-infrared census of stellar large-amplitude variables (LAVs) observed by the Palomar Gattini-IR (PGIR) surveyor from 2019-2021. Over the three-year time period, PGIR performed a brightness-limited survey of the Northern sky (18,000 sq. deg) to J-band AB magnitudes of $\sim 13$ within and $\sim 15$ outside the Galactic plane. From 70 million stars detected in PGIR reference images, we provide a spectral and photometric library of the 128 largest amplitude stellar variables detected to median SNR &gt; 10 for more than 50 epochs with more than 5 high-amplitude detections, peak-to-peak magnitudes $\geq$ 2, and von Neumann ratios $\leq$ 0.2. We obtained medium-resolution near-infrared spectra with TripleSpec on the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory and SpeX at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility. The spectral census consists of 82 evolved and dust-obscured Asymptotic Giant Branch stars, 16 R Coronae Borealis stars, 13 young-stellar or pre-main-sequence objects, 8 symbiotic binaries, 7 erratic carbon- and oxygen-rich giants, and 2 RV Tauri supergiants. The spectral and photometric dataset serves as an atlas of near-infrared LAVs and a repository of evolved stars, eruptive variables, and binary systems for future deeper infrared surveys.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-Mass Stripped Stars in the Magellanic Clouds: Forward Modeling the Observed Population Discovered Via UV Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stripped stars are hot, helium-rich stars formed when binary interactions remove a star's hydrogen envelope. While low-mass ($\lesssim 1\,M_\odot$) and high-mass ($\gtrsim 8\,M_\odot$) stripped stars are well studied as hot subdwarfs and Wolf-Rayet stars, their intermediate-mass counterparts ($1-8 \,M_\odot$) have only recently been discovered. The Stripped-Star Ultraviolet Magellanic Cloud Survey (SUMS) identified UV-excess sources in the Magellanic Clouds using Swift-UVOT photometry and selected 820 photometric stripped-star candidates. However, the selection function, completeness, and purity of this sample remain poorly understood. We forward model the population of stripped stars in the Magellanic Clouds using a binary population synthesis model combined with spatially resolved star formation histories and simulated UV photometry. To assess survey sensitivity, we inject simulated sources into real Swift-UVOT images and reproduce the SUMS selection process, including crowding, extinction, and photometric quality cuts. We recover $\sim 250$ simulated stripped stars with masses $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$, which corresponds to a recover rate of $9-13\,\%$. The rest are missed due to dilution by luminous companions, crowding, and high extinction. The observed population is biased toward systems with low-mass companions formed by common envelope evolution and toward systems with compact object companions. Of the stripped stars which show UV excess, $25-45\,\%$ are identifiable by SUMS; higher-resolution data or improved reddening corrections are needed to detect the rest. We predict contamination of the observed stripped star candidates by main-sequence stars with spurious UV excess due to crowding and provide guidelines for selecting higher-purity subsamples. These results enable tests of binary evolution models and realistic comparison of observed and simulated stripped-star populations.</description>

      <title>A very young and fast rotating shell star discovered in the eclipsing binary ZTF J200347.63+394429.8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A photometric study in combination with existing stellar models has revealed details of this eclipsing post-mass-transfer binary. The shell star has an equatorial/ polar radius of ~2.60/1.90 Rsun at an equatorial rotational velocity of ~430 km s-1, an effective mean temperature Teff of ~13300 K and a mass of ~3.42 Msun. This former accretor star is surrounded by a large decretion disk of ~47 Rsun. The secondary star is a helium white dwarf precursor with a radius of 0.98 Rsun, a Teff of ~17100 K and a mass of 0.29 Msun. The parameters of this former donor star indicate an age of the binary system of only ~1.8 Myr after the end of mass transfer. The results fit to a sub-solar metallicity of Z = 0.007.</description>

      <title>Linking Magnetic Field Diagnostics with 3D CME Speeds in Solar Active Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how active-region properties influence coronal mass ejection (CME) dynamics is essential for constraining eruption models and improving space-weather prediction. Magnetic diagnostics derived above polarity inversion lines (PILs), including the critical height ($h_{\rm crit}$) of torus instability onset, the overlying field strength ($B_{\rm t}$), and ribbon flux ($R_{\rm f}$), provide physically motivated measures of eruption onset. The two main aims of this work are to (i) show that $h_{\rm crit}$ and $B_{\rm t}$ can equally well predict CME speeds when evaluated over the region of interest (ROI) not directly above the PIL, and (ii) assess the value of $h_{\rm crit}$, $B_{\rm t}$ and $R_{\rm f}$ in predicting CME speed. Photospheric magnetograms are modeled with potential-field extrapolations to obtain decay index profiles. Critical heights above PILs correlate strongly with 3D CME speed ($r = 0.71$). Using ROIs of $\approx$ 1.8, 3.7, and 7.3 Mm), centered on the PIL, weighted $h_{\rm crit}$ from the 7.3x7.3 ROI provides the strongest correlation ($r = 0.73$), while mean $B_{\rm t}$ at 150 Mm is weaker ($r = 0.33$). Combining both offers little improvement ($r = 0.74$), confirming $h_{\rm crit}$ as the dominant predictor. CME speed correlates moderately with $B_{\rm t} \times R_{\rm f}$ ($r = 0.44$), and highest when combined with $h_{\rm crit}$ ($r = 0.76$). Thus, in potential field models, ROI-based critical heights are as predictive as those above the PIL, indicating that the broader active-region field structure is equally valid as a diagnostic. When all parameters are considered together, $h_{\rm crit}$ alone consistently shows the highest predictive power for CME speed.</description>

      <title>FAUST. XXVIII. High-Resolution ALMA Observations of Class 0/I Disks: Structure, Optical Depths, and Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution (~7.5 au) ALMA observations at 1.3 and 3 mm of 16 disks around Class 0/I protostars across multiple star-forming regions and a variety of multiplicities, showing a range of disk sizes (~2-100 au) and including circumbinary disks (CBDs) in binaries with separations &lt;100 au. The disk properties show similarities to Class II disks, including (a) low spectral index (SI) values (alpha=2.1) that increase with disk radius, (b) 3 mm disk sizes only marginally smaller than at 1.3 mm (&lt;10%), and (c) radial intensity profiles well described by modified self-similar profiles. We also find key differences: (i) SI values increasing with radius, but exceeding 2 only at the disk edge (ii) higher brightness temperatures Tb, in some cases higher than the predicted temperatures due to irradiation, and (iii) ~10x higher luminosity at a given size compared to the Class II disks. These results confirm significant optical depth in the observed Class 0/I disks, at both 1.3 and 3 mm, helping to explain their higher luminosities, but higher temperatures are also required for the most compact (&lt; 40 au) disks, suggesting additional viscous heating. Considering optical depth, most disk dust masses are estimated in the range 30-900 Mearth (0.01-0.3 Msun in gas), resulting in some disks reaching marginal gravitational instability. The median location of the water iceline is ~3 au, but it can extend beyond 10-20 au for the hottest disks. CBDs exhibit lower optical depths at both wavelengths and hence higher SI values (alpha=3.0), dust masses of 100 Mearth, and beta~1.5 (2 Class 0 CBDs) and beta~1 (1 Class I CBD), suggesting substantial grain growth only in the more evolved CBD. The inferred high optical depths provide a compelling explanation for the apparent scarcity of dust substructures in the younger disks at ~ 1 mm, despite mounting evidence for early planet formation (ABRIDGED).</description>

      <title>Collisional Excitation in Space: Recent Advances and Future Challenges in the JWST Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This perspective offers a viewpoint on how the challenges of molecular scattering investigations of astrophysical interest have evolved in recent years. Computational progress has steadily expanded collisional databases and provided essential tools for modeling non-LTE astronomical regions. However, the observational leap enabled by the JWST and new observational facilities has revealed critical gaps in these databases. In this framework, two major frontiers emerge: the characterization of collisional processes involving heavy projectiles, and the treatment of ro-vibrational excitation. The significant computational effort of these investigations emphasizes the need to test and develop robust theoretical methods and approximations, capable of extending the census of collisional coefficients required for reliable astrophysical modeling. Recent developments in these directions are outlined, with particular attention to their application and their potential to broaden the coverage of molecular systems and physical environments.</description>

      <title>The magnetic sensitivity of the Ca II resonance and subordinate lines in the solar atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: The polarization of the Ca II resonant doublet (H and K lines) and the subordinate infrared triplet lines are key observables for diagnosing solar chromospheric magnetism. It is thus necessary to understand the physical mechanisms that shape their Stokes profiles in magnetic environments.
  Methods: Using the spectral synthesis module of the HanleRT-TIC code, we study the effects of anisotropic radiation pumping with partial frequency redistribution (PRD) and J-state interference (JSI) in a plane-parallel semi-empirical static solar atmospheric model. We also analyze the sensitivity of these lines to magnetic fields of varying strengths and orientations, accounting for the combined action of the Hanle and Zeeman effects.
  Results: Including PRD is crucial to model the polarization in the core regions of the resonant lines, while JSI strongly affects their far wings. The metastable lower levels of the subordinate lines also influence the scattering polarization of the K line. With horizontal magnetic fields, the resonant lines respond to field strengths from sub-gauss to tens of gauss, whereas the infrared triplet scattering polarization is mainly sensitive to milligauss fields. At a near-limb line of sight (LOS) with $\mu = 0.1$, the Hanle effect modifies the scattering polarization via a depolarization and a rotation in the plane of linear polarization. At disk center, horizontal fields generate linear polarization in the 1D model: for the K line, the Hanle effect dominates from sub-gauss to a few tens of gauss, and the Zeeman effect dominates in stronger fields. For vertical fields, the Hanle effect vanishes, but magneto-optical effects affect the linear polarization wings. Finally, atomic level polarization impacts the outer circular polarization lobes of the resonant lines, and the weak-field approximation overestimates the LOS magnetic component in this frequency range.</description>

      <title>Chromospherically active stars: Lithium and CNO abundances in northern RS CVn stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: We carried out a detailed investigation of Lithium and CNO abundances, including carbon isotope ratios, in RS CVn stars to assess the role of magnetic activity in the mixing of stellar atmospheres. Methods: We obtained high-resolution spectra at the Moletai Astronomical Observatory. Lithium abundances were determined by spectral synthesis of the 6707 A line and the CNO abundances using the C2 band heads at 5135 and 5635.5 A CN bands at 6470- 6490 A and 7980 to 8005 A, and the [O I] line at 6300 A. By fitting the 13CN band at 8004.7 A, we determined the carbon isotope ratios.Results. We determined the main atmospheric parameters and investigated the chemical composition of 32 RS CVn stars. Lithium abundances were determined for 13 additional stars using archival spectra. We report that *iot Gem and HD 179094 have carbon isotope ratios already affected by extra-mixing, even though they are in the evolutionary stage below the red giant branch luminosity bump. About half of the low-mass giants, for which the lithium abundance was determined, follow the first dredge-up predictions; however, other stars show reduced Lithium abundances, as predicted by thermohaline-induced mixing. The intermediate-mass stars show reduced Lithium abundances reduced, as predicted by rotation-induced mixing. Conclusions. In low-mass, chromospherically active RS CVn stars, extra-mixing of lithium and carbon isotopes may begin earlier than in normal giants. The Li-rich RS CVn giant V*OP And has large C/N and carbon isotope ratios and raises questions about the origin of its lithium enhancement.</description>

      <title>A Census of Chemically Peculiar Stars in Stellar Associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pre-main-sequence evolution of the chemically peculiar (CP) stars on the upper main sequence is still a vast mystery and not well understood. Our analysis of young associations and open clusters aims to find (very) young CP stars to try to put a lower boundary on the age of such objects. Using three catalogues of open clusters and associations, we determined membership probabilities using HDBSCAN. The hot stars from this selection were submitted to synthetic $\Delta a$ photometry, spectral, and light curve classification to determine which ones are CP stars and candidates. Subsequently, we used spectral energy distribution fitting and emission line analysis to check for possible PMS CP stars. The results were compared to the literature. We detected 971 CP stars and candidates {in 217 clusters and associations}. A relatively large fraction, $\sim$10\% of those, show characteristics of PMS CP stars. This significantly expands the known list of candidate PMS CP stars, bringing us closer to solving the mystery of their origin.</description>

      <title>MESA-QUEST: Tracing the formation of direct collapse black hole seeds via quasi-stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11772v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts $z\geq 9$ remains one of the most challenging open questions in astrophysics. Their rapid emergence suggests that massive ``heavy seeds'' must have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model the structure and evolution of quasi-stars -- massive, radiation-supported envelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores -- believed to be the progenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and saturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes to $\geq 10^3\,M_{\odot}$ under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection models yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55$M_*$ -- five times higher than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra. Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Tracks and Spectral Properties of Quasi-stars and Their Correlation with Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a population of red, compact, high-redshift (${z\sim3-10}$) objects referred to as ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs). These objects exhibit unusual spectral features reminiscent of stellar spectra with blackbody-like SEDs, large hydrogen Balmer breaks, Balmer line absorption, and classical stellar absorption features such as calcium H&amp;K and the calcium triplet. Following the recent suggestion that these may be actively accreting direct-collapse black holes in the process of assembly, i.e. quasi-stars, we present evolutionary models of quasi-stars using our recently released, publicly available MESA-QUEST modeling framework. We compute a grid of models spanning a range of black hole masses and predict the luminosities, temperatures, surface gravities, and lifetimes of these objects. We find that these models lie along a Hayashi track once they hit their ``late-stage'' which constitutes the majority of their lives ($\sim 20$~Myr). We present scaling relations for estimating the mass of a quasi-star as a function of the bolometric luminosity, as well as the bolometric luminosity as a function of the effective temperature for the Hayashi track. The short lifetimes in tandem with the observed number density of LRDs imply the possibility that every supermassive black hole was once a quasi-star. We compare synthetic spectra of our quasi-star models to observations of LRDs, and show that these models are broadly capable of reproducing the continuum spectra of observed LRDs. These results indicate that quasi-stars are promising candidates for the origin of supermassive black holes via direct collapse in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Very High Precision Astrometry for Exoplanets and Dark Matter with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometry, one of the oldest branches of astronomy, has been revolutionized by missions like Hipparcos and especially Gaia, which mapped billions of stars with extraordinary precision. However, challenges such as detecting Earth-like exoplanets in nearby habitable zones and probing the influence of dark matter in galactic environments require sub-microarcsecond accuracy. With a 6--8 meter large-aperture telescope operating across at visible wavelengths, the Habitable Worlds Observatory by NASA can combine astrometry and direct imaging to detect rocky exoplanets within 10 parsecs and study their atmospheres. We consider here the scientific requirements and present a concept for a dedicated astrometric instrument on HWO. It is capable to produce diffraction-limited images of large fields, achieving a point-spread function (PSF) precision of 20 milliarcseconds. Equipped with a detector calibration system, HWO can perform high precision astrometry, and, detect and measure the orbit of Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone of Nearby Solar-type stars. HWO can dramatically improve current constraints on the self- interaction cross-section of heavy dark matter particles (WIMPs) and on the masses of ultra-high dark matter particles, through the study of stellar motions in galactic environments. The visible channel of the instrument features a large CMOS-based focal plane with stitched pixel arrays, enabling a large field of view. The ``Detector Calibration Unit'' system uses interferometric laser fringes to calibrate pixel positions. Using differential astrometry and pointed observations with a stable telescope design enables extended integration times, enhancing sensitivity to sub-microarcsecond precision for detecting exoplanets and studying dark matter through stellar motion.</description>

      <title>A Compact Multi-Planet System of Three Transiting Giant Planets Around TIC118798035</title>

Abstract: We report the discovery and characterization of three transiting giant planets in the TIC118798035 system. The three planets were identified as transiting candidates from data of the TESS mission, and confirmed with ground-based photometric transit observations along with radial velocity variations obtained with FEROS, HARPS and ESPRESSO. The three planets present transit timing variations (TTVs). We performed a N-body orbital fitting to the TTVs and radial velocities finding that TIC118798035 b is as warm low-density Neptune with a mass of 0.0250$\pm$0.0023 $M_J$, a radius of 0.655$\pm$0.018 $R_J$, and an orbital period of 11.507 d; TIC118798035 c is a warm Saturn with a mass of 0.403$\pm$0.024 $M_J$, a radius of 0.973$\pm$0.023 $R_J$, and an orbital period of 22.564 d; and TIC118798035 d is a warm Jupiter with a mass of 0.773$\pm$0.052 $M_J$, a radius of 0.923$\pm$0.044 $R_J$, and an orbital period of 48.925 d. The bulk metallicities of the three planets don't fully follow the mass-metallicity correlation found for the giant planets of the solar system, which hints at a somewhat different formation history for the planets of the TIC118798035 system. TIC118798035 is the only system having more than two transiting planets larger than 0.5 $R_J$ with a precise orbital and physical characterization, amenable for future atmospheric studies.</description>

      <title>FIP Bias Evolution in an Emerging Active Region as observed in SPICE Synoptic Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the time evolution of relative elemental abundances in the context of the first ionization potential effect focusing on an active region. Our aim is to characterize this evolution in different types of solar active region structures as well as in different atmospheric layers. We wish to assert how the measured changes relate to different magnetic topologies by computing abundance enhancement in different conditions using the ponderomotive force model.
  Leveraging spectroscopic observations from the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment instrument on board Solar Orbiter, we use extreme ultraviolet lines from ions formed across a broad temperature range--from the upper chromosphere to the low corona--and we perform relative abundance ratios following differential emission measure analysis. This methodology yields relative abundance maps from low, intermediate, and high first ionization potential elements. We obtain the temporal evolution of a number of abundance ratios for different structures on the Sun. We compare these results with the outcomes of the ponderomotive force model.
  We find good correlation between the model and our results, suggesting an Alfv\'en-wave driven fractionation of the plasma. Fan loops, loop footpoints and active region boundaries exhibit coronal abundances, while the active region core shows more photospheric-like composition. A slow and steady increase in the magnesium to neon relative first ionization potential bias values is observed, starting around 1.5 and increasing by about 50\% after two days. The sulfur to oxygen evolution coupled with the model brings evidence of resonant waves fractionating the plasma in transition region structures.</description>

      <title>M3DIS -- A grid of 3D radiation-hydrodynamics stellar atmosphere models for stellar surveys. II. Carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the origin and evolution of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars is key to tracing the Galaxy's early chemical enrichment. We investigate how realistic 3D radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) model atmospheres affect carbon abundances in CEMP stars and implications for their classification and Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We focus on biases from traditional 1D hydrostatic models. We use the M3DIS code to compute 3D RHD model atmospheres for main-sequence and sub-giant stars over a wide range of metallicities and carbon enhancements. Synthetic spectra of the CH G-band are calculated with 3D radiative transfer and compared to spectra from classical 1D MARCS models. We derive abundance corrections and apply them to a large SAGA database sample to quantify effects on the carbon abundance distribution and CEMP classification. Our new 3D CEMP models predict cooler upper atmospheric layers than in 1D models, resulting in stronger CH absorption and lower inferred carbon abundances by up to -0.9 dex at the lowest metallicities. Carbon enhancement in the atmosphere itself increases molecular opacities and leads to radiative re-heating, partly offsetting adiabatic cooling in 3D models and reducing 3D-1D abundance corrections. Applying these corrections lowers the CEMP fraction by up to 20% below [Fe/H]=-3 and alters the relative contribution of CEMP sub-classes. The fraction of CEMP-no stars increases while the number of CEMP-r/s stars decreases, due to the downward revision of absolute carbon abundances. These changes bring the Galactic carbon distribution into better agreement with GCE models assuming a 20% contribution from faint supernovae. Realistic model atmospheres are essential to reliably reconstruct the Galaxy's early chemical enrichment history.</description>

      <title>84 Second and 169 Second Rotation of Two Isolated, Ultramassive, Strongly Magnetic White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photometric variability in massive, magnetic white dwarfs (WDs) on the timescales of less than a few hours is oft interpreted as being due to magnetic spots on the surface of a rotating star. Increasingly, numbers of these short period variables are being discovered with the continued growth of time-domain astronomy, testing theories of magnetic white dwarf formation and angular momentum evolution. We present the detection of extremely rapid rotation in the WDs SDSS J1557+0411 and PG 1312+099, with periods of 168.94 s and 83.72 s, respectively. We consider other possible causes of the monoperiodic photometric variability, including binarity (eclipses and ellipsoidal variations) and asteroseismic pulsations. Though these cannot be ruled out with the existing data, these alternative explanations seem unlikely. SDSS J1557+0411 was predicted to be a rapidly rotating oxygen-neon core WD by Camisassa et al. (2022), a prediction borne out at least in part by our observations. PG 1312+099 was previously observed via polarimetry to be rotating with a period of ~5.4 h; we propose that this object may be an unresolved double degenerate system.</description>

      <title>Search for high energy 5.5 MeV solar axions with the complete Borexino dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A search for solar axions and axion-like particles produced in the $p+d\rightarrow\rm{^3He}+A~(5.5\rm{ ~MeV})$ reaction was performed using the complete dataset of the Borexino detector (3995 days of measurement live-time). The following interaction processes have been considered: axion decay into two photons $({\rm A}\rightarrow2\gamma)$, inverse Primakoff conversion on nuclei $({\rm A}+Z\rightarrow\gamma+Z$), the Compton conversion of axions to photons $({\rm A}+e\rightarrow e+\gamma)$ and the axio-electric effect $({\rm A}+e+Z\rightarrow e+Z$). Model-independent limits on axion-photon ($g_{A\gamma}$), axion-electron ($g_{Ae}$), and isovector axion-nucleon ($g_{3AN}$) couplings are obtained: $|g_{A\gamma}\times g_{3AN}| \leq 2.3\times 10^{-11} \rm{GeV}^{-1}$ and $|g_{Ae}\times g_{3AN}| \leq 1.9\times 10^{-13}$ at $m_A &lt;$ 1 MeV (90\% c.l.). The Borexino results exclude new large regions of $g_{A\gamma}$, and $g_{Ae}$ coupling constants and axion masses $m_A$, and leads to constraints on the products $|g_{A\gamma}\times m_A|$ and $|g_{Ae}\times m_A|$ for the KSVZ- and the DFSZ-axion models.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Jupiter and Saturn as a function of the Parameter R$_{\rho}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computed using the APPLE planetary evolution code, we present updated evolutionary models for Jupiter and Saturn that incorporate helium rain, non-adiabatic thermal structures, and "fuzzy" extended heavy-element cores. Building on our previous Ledoux-stable models, we implement improved atmospheric boundary conditions that account for composition-dependent effective temperatures and systematically explore the impact of varying the parameter $R_{\rho}$, which allows one to explore in an approximate way the efficiency of semiconvection. For both Jupiter and Saturn, we construct models spanning from $R_{\rho}=1$ (Ledoux) to $R_{\rho}=0$ (Schwarzschild), and identify best-fit solutions that match each planet's effective temperature, equatorial radius, lower-order gravitational moments, and atmospheric composition at 4.56 Gyr. We find that lower $R_{\rho}$ values lead to stronger convective mixing, resulting in higher surface metallicities and lower deep interior temperatures, while requiring reduced heavy-element masses and lower initial entropies to stabilize the dilute inner cores. Our Saturn models also broadly agree with the observed brunt frequency profile inferred from Cassini ring seismology, with stable layers arising from both the helium rain region and the dilute core. These findings support the presence of complex, compositionally stratified interiors in both gas giants.</description>
