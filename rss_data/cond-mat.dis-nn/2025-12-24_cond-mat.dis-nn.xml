      <title>Spin Glasses: Disorder, Frustration, and Nonequilibrium Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin glasses occupy a unique place in condensed matter: they freeze collectively while remaining struc-turally disordered, and they exhibit slow, history-dependent dynamics that reflect an exceptionally rug-ged free-energy landscape. This review provides an integrated account of spin-glass physics, emphasiz-ing how microscopic ingredients (quenched randomness, frustration, competing exchange interactions, and random fields) conspire to produce macroscopic glassiness. We begin with the canonical Edwards-Anderson and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick formulations to introduce the central theoretical ideas that recur across the literature: extensive degeneracy, metastability, and the emergence of long relaxation times that manifest as aging, memory, and rejuvenation under standard experimental protocols. We then summarize the principal routes used to characterize spin-glass freezing, combining thermodynamic signatures with dynamical probes that reveal the separation of timescales and the sensitivity to thermal and magnetic histories. Building on these foundations, we draw connections across experimental material classes (me-tallic alloys, insulating oxides, and geometrically frustrated systems) by emphasizing how intrinsic ver-sus induced disorder and competing interaction networks shape the observed phenomenology. Recent advances in reentrant and room-temperature spin-glass materials are highlighted as a rapidly developing direction that tests the limits of established paradigms and motivates new materials-driven questions. The review concludes by connecting modern computational developments, including machine-learning phase identification and neural-network analogies, to longstanding challenges in classification, univer-sality, and out-of-equilibrium behavior, and by outlining emerging opportunities at the boundary between classical and quantum spin glasses.</description>

      <title>Isotropic conductivity of two-dimensional three- and four-phase symmetric composites: duality and universal bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of isotropic effective conductivity $\sigma_e(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n)$ in two-dimensional three- and four-phase symmetric composites with a partial isotropic conductivity $\sigma_j$ of the $j$-th phase. The upper $\Omega(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n)$ and lower $\omega(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n)$, $n=3,4$, bounds for effective conductivity, found by the algebraic approach, are universal (independent of the composite micro-structure) and possess all algebraic properties of $\sigma_e(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n)$ that follow from physics: first-order homogeneity, full permutation invariance, Keller's self-duality, positivity, and monotony. The bounds are compatible with the trivial solution $\sigma_e(\sigma,\ldots,\sigma)=\sigma$ and satisfy Dykhne's ansatz. Their comparison with previously known numerical calculations, asymptotic analysis, and exact results for isotropic effective conductivity $\sigma_e(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n)$ of two-dimensional three- and four-phase composites showed complete agreement. The bounds $\Omega(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n)$ and $\omega(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n)$ in both cases $n=3,4$ are stronger than the currently known variational bounds.</description>

      <title>Theory of Scalable Spin Squeezing with Disordered Quantum Dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin squeezed entanglement enables metrological precision beyond the classical limit. Understood through the lens of continuous symmetry breaking, dipolar spin systems exhibit the remarkable ability to generate spin squeezing via their intrinsic quench dynamics. To date, this understanding has primarily focused on lattice spin systems; in practice however, dipolar spin systems$\unicode{x2014}$ranging from ultracold molecules to nuclear spin ensembles and solid-state color centers$\unicode{x2014}$often exhibit significant amounts of positional disorder. Here, we develop a theory for scalable spin squeezing in a two-dimensional randomly diluted lattice of quantum dipoles, which naturally realize a dipolar XXZ model. Via extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram for finite-temperature XY order, and by extension scalable spin squeezing, as a function of both disorder and Ising anisotropy. As the disorder increases, we find that scalable spin squeezing survives only near the Heisenberg point. We show that this behavior is due to the presence of rare tightly-coupled dimers, which effectively heat the system post-quench. In the case of strongly-interacting nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we demonstrate that an experimentally feasible strategy to decouple the problematic dimers from the dynamics is sufficient to enable scalable spin squeezing.</description>

      <title>Learning transitions of topological surface codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the surface code, topological quantum order allows one to encode logical quantum information in a robust, long-range entangled many-body quantum state. However, if an observer probes this quantum state by performing measurements on the underlying qubits, thereby collecting an ensemble of highly correlated classical snapshots, two closely related questions arise: (i) do measurements decohere the topological order of the quantum state; and (ii) how much of the logical information can one learn from the snapshots? Here we address these questions for measurements in a uniform basis on all qubits. We find that for generic measurement angles, sufficiently far away from the Clifford X, Y, and Z directions (such as the X+Y+Z basis) the logical information is never lost in one of the following two ways: (i) for weak measurement, the topological order is absolutely robust; (ii) for projective measurement, the quantum state inevitably collapses, but the logical quantum information is faithfully transferred from the quantum system to the observer in the form of a tomographically complete classical shadow. At these generic measurement angles and in the projective-measurement limit, the measurement ensemble enforced by Born probabilities can be represented by a 2D tensor network that can be fermionized into a disordered, free-fermion network model in symmetry class DIII, which gives rise to a Majorana "metal" phase. When the measurement angle is biased towards the X or Z limits, a critical angle indicates the threshold of a learning transition beyond which the classical shadow no longer reveals full tomographic information (but reduces to a measurement of the logical X or Z state). This learning transition can be described in the language of the network model as a "metal to insulator" transition...</description>

      <title>Quantum information scrambling in strongly disordered Rydberg spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the fact that power-law interactions occur in a plethora of physical systems, their many-body dynamics is far less understood than that of nearest-neighbor interacting systems. Here, we study information scrambling in strongly disordered spin systems with power-law interactions via out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs). Numerically, we find pronounced differences in the dynamical spreading of OTOCs between nearest-neighbor and power-law interacting systems. This deviation persists even for short-range interactions, opposing the common view that these interactions produce dynamics equivalent to the nearest-neighbor case. In a detailed experimental proposal, tailored but not limited to Rydberg tweezer setups, we present a protocol to extract OTOCs in XXZ Heisenberg spin systems with tunable anisotropy and programmable disorder based on currently available techniques.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic fields in fluctuating environment: a model for isochoric heat capacity of simple liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16252v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using functional methods, we investigate the sound quanta arising from quantized hydrodynamic fields in simple liquids at low temperatures, under the influence of high-energy processes, coming from non-hydrodynamic degrees of freedom. To model these effects on the hydrodynamic fields, we assume that the quantum fields are coupled to an additive, delta-correlated (in space and time) quantum noise field. Thus, the hydrodynamic fields are defined in a fluctuating environment. After defining the generating functional of connected correlation functions in the presence of the noise field, we perform a functional integral over all noise field configurations. This is done using a formal object inspired by the distributional zeta-function method, called the configurational zeta-function. We obtain a new generating functional written in terms of an analytically tractable functional series. This formalism allow us to obtain the excitation spectra of liquids. In the liquid, each term of the series describes the emergent non-interacting elementary excitations with the usual phonon-like dispersion relation and additional excitations with dispersion relations with gaps in pseudo-momentum space. Finally, the behavior of the constant volume specific heat as a function of temperature is obtained for different simple liquids.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Local Optimization in Complex Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Limited resources motivate decomposing large-scale problems into smaller,``local" subsystems and stitching together the so-found solutions. We explore the physics underlying this approach and discuss the concept of ``local hardness", i.e., the complexity of predicting local properties of the solution from local information, for the ground-state problem of both P- and NP-hard spin-glasses and related frustrated spin systems. Depending on the model considered, we observe varying scaling behaviors in how errors associated with local predictions decay as a function of the size of the solved subsystem. These errors are intimately connected to global critical threshold instabilities, characterized by gapless, avalanche-like excitations that follow scale-invariant size distributions. Away from criticality, local solvers quickly achieve high accuracy, aligning closely with the results of the computationally much more expensive global minimization. We leverage these findings to introduce a heuristic contraction-based algorithm for globally studying spin-glass ground states. The local solvers further display sharp imprints of the phase transition from the spin-glass to the ferromagnetic phase as the distribution of spin-glass couplings is shifted, as well as characteristic differences for the infinite-range model, implying the existence of specific classes of local hardness. Our findings shed light on how Nature may operate solely through local actions at her disposal.</description>

      <title>Beyond-mean-field fluctuations for the solution of constraint satisfaction problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) lie at the heart of complexity theory and find application in a plethora of prominent tasks ranging from cryptography to genetics. Classical approaches use Hopfield networks to find approximate solutions while recently, modern machine-learning techniques like graph neural networks have become popular for this task. In this study, we employ the known mapping of MAX-2-SAT, a class of CSPs, to a spin-glass system from statistical physics, and use Glauber dynamics to approximately find its ground state, which corresponds to the optimal solution of the underlying problem. We show that Glauber dynamics outperforms the traditional Hopfield-network approach and can compete with state-of-the-art solvers. A systematic theoretical analysis uncovers the role of stochastic fluctuations in finding CSP solutions: even in the absence of thermal fluctuations at $T=0$ a significant portion of spins, which correspond to the CSP variables, attains an effective spin-dependent non-zero temperature. These spins form a subspace in which the stochastic Glauber dynamics continuously performs flips to eventually find better solutions. This is possible since the energy is degenerate, such that spin flips in this free-spin space do not require energy. Our theoretical analysis leads to deterministic solvers that effectively account for such fluctuations, thereby reaching state-of-the-art performance.</description>

Abstract: Within the framework of non-Hermitian photonics, we investigate the spectral and dynamical properties of one- and two-dimensional non-Hermitian off-diagonal disordered optical lattices, where randomness is applied to the couplings rather than to the on-site potential terms. We analyze eigenvalue distributions and the localization properties of the eigenmodes, comparing them with those of the corresponding Hermitian lattices. Furthermore, we study their transport behavior under single-channel excitation and identify unconventional phenomena such as jumps between distant lattice regions in systems with a purely real spectrum, as well as complex spectrum-induced Anderson jumps, reported here for the first time in two dimensions. Our results establish a reference framework for non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder and open new directions for future studies of localization phenomena.</description>

      <title>Surprisingly High Redundancy in Electronic Structure Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic structure underpins advances in chemistry, materials science, and condensed matter physics. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has enabled the development of powerful surrogate models that can enable the prediction of the ground state electron density and related properties at a fraction of the computational cost of conventional first principles simulations. Such ML models typically rely on massive datasets generated through expensive Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory calculations. A key reason for relying on such large datasets is the lack of prior knowledge about which portions of the data are essential, and which are redundant. This study reveals significant redundancies in electronic structure datasets across various material systems, including molecules, simple metals, and chemically complex alloys -- challenging the notion that extensive datasets are essential for accurate ML-based electronic structure predictions. We demonstrate that even random pruning can substantially reduce dataset size with minimal loss in predictive accuracy. Furthermore, a state-of-the-art coverage-based pruning strategy that selects data across all learning difficulties, retains chemical accuracy and model generalizability using up to 100-fold less data, while reducing training time by threefold or greater. By contrast, widely used importance-based pruning methods, which eliminate easy-to-learn data, can catastrophically fail at higher pruning factors due to significant reduction in data coverage. This heretofore unexplored high redundancy in electronic structure data holds the potential to identify a minimal, essential dataset representative of each material class.</description>
