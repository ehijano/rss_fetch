      <title>Solitary states in spiking oscillators with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of globally coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators, showing that the presence of higher-order interactions affects the character of the transition between synchronous and asynchronous states. In particular, we demonstrate that, around the synchronization transition, solitary states emerge due to the presence of second-order interactions. In difference to the phenomenology observed in systems of phase oscillators, we show that, at low coupling strengths, solitary states appear for both transition directions, whereas for higher couplings they only occur in the forward direction, with the backwards one characterized by explosive desynchronization.</description>

      <title>Learning Stochastic Thermodynamics Directly from Correlation and Trajectory-Fluctuation Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markedly increased computational power and data acquisition have led to growing interest in data-driven inverse dynamics problems. These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>The impact of COVID-19 on building energetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Buildings are responsible for a significant portion of global energy demand and GHG emissions. Using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus as a case study, we find that, similar to the baseline metabolism of biological organisms, large buildings are on average $25\%$ more energetically efficient per unit size than smaller buildings. This suggests that institutions can be perceived as super populations with buildings as units (organisms) following standard metabolic relationships. Importantly, the relative efficiency of larger buildings progressively increased to $34\%$ until 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic acted as a major shock, disrupting this trend and leading to a reversal to the expected $25\%$ baseline level. This suggests that energetic adaptations are contingent on relatively stable conditions.</description>

      <title>Weighted Point Configurations with Hyperuniformity: An Ecological Example and Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random point configurations are said to be in hyperuniform states, if density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed in large-scale. Typical examples are found in Coulomb gas systems in two dimensions especially called log-gases in random matrix theory, in which points are repulsively correlated by long-range potentials. In infertile lands like deserts continuous survival competitions for water and nutrition will cause long-ranged repulsive interactions among plants. We have prepared digital data of spatial configurations of center-of-mass for bushes weighted by bush sizes which we call masses. Data analysis shows that such ecological point configurations do not show hyperuniformity as unmarked point processes, but are in hyperuniform states as marked point processes in which mass distributions are taken into account. We propose the non-equilibrium statistical-mechanics models to generate marked point processes having hyperuniformity, in which iterations of random thinning of points and coalescing of masses transform initial uncorrelated point processes into non-trivial point processes with hyperuniformity. Combination of real data-analysis and computer simulations shows the importance of strong correlations in probability law between spatial point configurations and mass distributions of individual points to realize hyperuniform marked point processes.</description>
