      <title>Lithium Faraday Filter: Some Like It Hot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetically induced rotation of linearly polarized light near an atomic resonance, combined with Doppler-broadened absorption windows, enables narrowband transmission of optical frequencies. An ultra-narrowband lithium vapor Faraday filter at about 671 nm is investigated experimentally and theoretically. The resulting Faraday filter transmittance is demonstrated using a lithium heat pipe oven under longitudinal magnetic fields ranging from 0 to 300 G. Optimization of the lithium Faraday filter performance reveals an optimal operating point at 264 {\deg}C and an external magnetic field of 269 G, yielding a peak transmission of approx. 82%. The lithium D$_1$- and D$_2$-transitions are only 10 GHz apart and temperature broadening leads to an overlap of the isotopes D-lines. Thus, the applied theoretical model needs to consider both transitions simultaneously. For this purpose, we extended an existing Python library (ElecSus), which now allows for the calculation of the atomic susceptibilities of lithium.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of an atom chip for Rydberg atom-metal surface interaction studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An atom chip has been fabricated for the study of interactions between $^{87}$Rb Rydberg atoms and a Au surface. The chip tightly confines cold atoms by generating high magnetic field gradients using microfabricated current-carrying wires. These trapped atoms may be excited to Rydberg states at well-defined atom-surface distances. For the purpose of Rydberg atom-surface interaction studies, the chip has a thermally evaporated Au surface layer, separated from the underlying trapping wires by a planarizing polyimide dielectric. Special attention was paid to the edge roughness of the trapping wires, the planarization of the polyimide, and the grain structure of the Au surface.</description>

      <title>Millimeter Wave Imaging using Autler-Townes Splitting Induced Fluorescence from Rydberg Atoms in Rubidium Vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate millimeter wave (mmWave) imaging using Autler-Townes (AT) splitting-induced fluorescence in rubidium vapor. By employing counter-propagating probe and coupling beams, we create a plane of atoms in a dark state that is sensitive to incident mmWave and demonstrate the method with mmWaves resonant with the transition between two neighboring Rydberg states at 91.4 giga hertz. Objects in the mmWave beam path affect the spatial profile of the mmWave field, which, in turn, leads to spatial variation of optical fluorescence at 780 nm. This results in a transduction of the mmWave spatial profile to an optical image that can be acquired by a CCD camera. We demonstrate real-time, diffraction-limited mmWave imaging in transmission geometry, over an effective sensing area of 6.5 cm square with a minimum 600 micro-volt per cm detectable electric field and a rapid 16.4 micro-second response time. In addition, we demonstrate this method with a variety of imaging masks, including 3D-printed vortex phase plates. Our study provides a pathway for high-speed and high-resolution mmWave imaging with potential applications in security, communications, and scientific research.</description>

      <title>First GNSS-deployed optical clock for local time scale upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise time scale is the universal base for all measurements. Here we report the deployment of a compact and transportable optical clock to a timekeeping institution and steering an active hydrogen maser to generate an optical time scale, realizing the upgrade of the local time scale in the Global Navigation Satellite System. The optical clock was transported over 1200 km by express delivery and resume work as normal promptly, and its extremely high uptime of 93.6% in the half-year enabled us to precisely correct the frequency drift of hydrogen maser, ultimately achieving an unprecedented monthly instability of 4E-17. This steering experiment with a deployable optical clock marks a significant advancement, demonstrating that a timing accuracy below 100 ps per month can be achieved feasibly in various timekeeping institutions where hydrogen masers are typically employed as the primary contributor to timekeeping. In the future, mobile optical time scale based on such transportable optical clock can be deployed flexibly and rapidly, which is particularly important in scenarios lacking International Atomic Time reference.</description>

      <title>Magnetometry with Broadband Microwave Fields in Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are optically addressable and versatile light-matter interfaces with practical application in magnetic field sensing, offering the ability to operate at room temperature and reach sensitivities below pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}.$ We propose an approach to simultaneously probe all of the magnetically sensitive states using a broadband microwave field and demonstrate that it can be used to measure the external DC magnetic field strength with sensitivities below 1~nT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}.$ We develop tools for analyzing the temporal signatures in the transmitted broadband microwaves to estimate the magnetic field, comparing maximum likelihood estimation based on minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence to various neural network models, and both methods independently reach practical sensitivities. These results are achieved without optimizing parameters such as the bandwidth, power, and shape of the probing microwave field such that, with further improvements, sensitivities down to $\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ can be envisioned. Our results motivate novel implementations of NV-based magnetic sensors with the potential for vectorial magnetic field detection at 1-10 kHz update rates and improved sensitivities without requiring a bias magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Optimal and efficient inference tools for field tracking with precessing spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise, real-time monitoring of magnetic field evolution is important in applications including magnetic navigation and searches for physics beyond the standard model. One main field-monitoring technique, the spin-precession magnetometer (SPM), observes electron, nucleus, color center, or muon spins as they precess in response to their local magnetic field. Here, we study Bayesian signal-recovery methods for SPMs in the free-induction decay (FID) mode. In particular, we study tracking of field changes well within the coherence time of the spin system, and thus well beyond the response bandwidth, as in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 040503 (2018)]. We derive the Bayesian Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound that dictates the ultimate precision in estimating the Larmor frequency, which we show to be attained by the computationally-expensive prediction error method (PEM). Relative to this benchmark, we show that the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and cubature Kalman filter (CKF) offer near-optimal tracking that is also computationally efficient, with the use of the latter giving better results only for large spin number. Focusing thus on the EKF, we show that it is sufficient to accurately track fluctuating and unknown transient signals. Our methods can be easily adapted to other types of sensors undergoing non-linear dissipative dynamics and experiencing intrinsic Gaussian-like stochastic noises.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of Sm$^{3+}$ Ions in the C$_{\rm s}$ Symmetry Centres of Hydrothermally Prepared K$_2$YF$_5$ Microcrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of Sm$^{3+}$-doped K$_2$YF$_5$ microparticles. The particles were synthesized via the hydrothermal technique, yielding a particle size of approximately 20 $\mu$m in length. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses confirmed their orthorhombic crystal structure. A combination of absorption and laser excited fluorescence performed on samples cooled to 10~K, allow for the determination of {56} experimental crystal-field levels. A parametrised crystal-field analysis for Sm$^{3+}$ in the C$_{\rm s}$ point group symmetry centres of K$_2$YF$_5$ yields good approximation to the data.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of a SU(3) color-orbit coupling in an ultracold gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-orbit interaction couples the spin of a particle to its motion and leads to spin-induced transport phenomena such as spin-Hall effects and Chern insulators. In this work, we extend the concept of internal-external state coupling to higher internal symmetry, exploring features beyond the established spin-orbit regime. We couple suitable resonant laser beams to a gas of ultracold atoms, thereby inducing artificial SU(3) non-Abelian gauge fields that act on a degenerate ground state manifold comprised of three dark states. We demonstrate the inherent all-state connectivity of SU(3) systems by performing targeted geometric transformations. Then, we investigate color-orbit coupling, an extension of SU(2) spin-orbit coupling to SU(3) systems. We reveal a rich dynamical interplay between three distinct oscillation frequencies, which possesses interesting analogies with neutrino oscillations and quark mixing mechanisms. In the future, the system should provide a testbed for exploring topological properties of SU(3) systems.</description>

      <title>Probing the spatial distribution of k-vectors in situ with Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method for mapping \textit{in situ} the spatial distribution of photon momentum across a laser beam using a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) as a moving probe. By displacing the BEC, we measure the photon recoil by atom interferometry at different positions in the laser beam and thus reconstruct a two-dimensional map of the local intensity and effective dispersion of the $k$ wave vector. Applied to a beam diffracted by a diaphragm, this method reveals a local \textit{extra recoil} effect, which exceeds the magnitude $h\nu/c$ of the individual plane-waves over which the beam can be decomposed. This method offers a new way to precisely characterize wavefront distortions and to evaluate one of the major systematic bias sources in quantum sensors based on atom interferometry.</description>
