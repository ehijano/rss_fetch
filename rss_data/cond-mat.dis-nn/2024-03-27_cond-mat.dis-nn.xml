      <title>Superlattice induced electron percolation within a single Landau level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum Hall effect in a single Landau level in the presence of a square superlattice of $\delta$-function potentials. The interplay between the superlattice spacing $a_s$ and the magnetic length $\ell_B$ in clean system leads to three interesting characteristic regimes corresponding to $a_s \lt \ell_B$, $a_s \gg \ell_B$ and the intermediate one where $a_s \sim \ell_B$ . In the intermediate regime, the continuous magnetic translation symmetry breaks down to discrete lattice symmetry. In contrast, we show that in the other two regimes, the same is hardly broken in the topological band despite the presence of the superlattice. In the presence of weak disorder (white-noise) one typically expects a tiny fraction of extended states due to topological protection of the Landau level. Interestingly, we obtain a large fraction of extended states throughout the intermediate regime which maximizes at the special point $a_s = \sqrt{2\pi} \ell_B$. We argue the superlattice induced percolation phenomenon requires both the breaking of the time reversal symmetry and the continuous magnetic translational symmetry. It could have a direct implication on the integer plateau transitions in both continuous quantum Hall systems and the lattice based anomalous quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Facet formation in slow three-dimensional fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cracks develop various surface patterns as they propagate in three-dimensional (3D) materials. Facet formation in nominally tensile (mode-I) fracture emerge in the slow, non-inertial regime and oftentimes takes the form of surface steps. We show that the same phase-field framework that recently shed basic light on dynamic (inertial) tensile fracture in 3D, also gives rise to crack surface steps. Step formation is shown to be an intrinsically nonlinear phenomenon that involves two essential physical ingredients: finite-strength quenched disorder and a small, mesoscopic anti-plane shear (mode-III) loading component (on top of the dominant tensile, mode-I loading component). We quantify the interplay between disorder (both its strength and spatial correlation length) and mesoscopic mode I+III mixity in controlling step formation. Finally, we show that surface steps grow out of the small-scale, background surface roughness and are composed of two overlapping crack segments connected by a bridging crack, in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Consensus formation in quality-sensitive interdependent agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of a collective decision-making model inspired by honeybee behavior. This model integrates individual exploration for option discovery and social interactions for information sharing, while also considering option qualities. Our assessment of the decision process outcome employs standard consensus metrics and investigates its correlation with convergence time, revealing common trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Furthermore, we investigate fluctuations arising from finite-size effects. In scenarios with strong interdependence, we identify an absorbing phase transition and scrutinize its key features, including critical fluctuations in finite spatial systems. We find that fluctuations play a significant role in the collective decision-making process, particularly when options have similar qualities. Our findings are especially relevant for finite adaptive systems, as they provide insights into navigating decision-making scenarios with similar options more effectively. Finally, we show that this model also fulfills Weber's Law of perception, aligning with previous analyses of collective-decision problems in their adherence to different psychophysical laws.</description>

      <title>Zero-point entropies of spin-jam and spin-glass states in a frustrated magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamics studies of a prototypical quasi-two-dimensional frustrated magnet Ba$_2$Sn$_2$ZnCr$_{7p}$Ga$_{10-7p}$O$_{22}$ where the magnetic Cr$^{3+}$ ions are arranged in a triangular network of bipyramids show that the magnetic zero-point entropy for $p=0.98$ is 55(1)\% of the entropy expected when the Cr$^{3+}$ moments are fully disordered. Furthermore, when combined with a previous neutron scattering study and the perimeter scaling entropy of a spin jam, the analysis reveals that with decreasing $p$, i.e., doping of the nonmagnetic Ga$^{3+}$ ions, the variation in the magnetic zero-point entropy can be well explained by the combined effects of the zero-point entropy of the spin jam state and that of weakly coupled orphan spins, shedding light on the coexistence of the two types of spin states in quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>Chimera states in neural networks and power systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial, frustrated synchronization and chimera-like states are expected to occur in Kuramoto-like models if the spectral dimension of the underlying graph is low: $d_s &lt; 4$. We provide numerical evidence that this really happens in case of the high-voltage power grid of Europe ($d_s &lt; 2$), a large human connectome (KKI113) and in case of the largest, exactly known brain network corresponding to the fruit-fly (FF) connectome ($d_s &lt; 4$), even though their graph dimensions are much higher, i.e.: $d^{EU}_g\simeq 2.6(1)$ and $d^{FF}_g\simeq 5.4(1)$, $d^{\mathrm{KKI113}}_g\simeq 3.4(1)$. We provide local synchronization results of the first- and second-order (Shinomoto) Kuramoto models by numerical solutions on the FF and the European power-grid graphs, respectively, and show the emergence of \red{chimera-like} patterns on the graph community level as well as by the local order parameters.</description>

      <title>Applying statistical learning theory to deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although statistical learning theory provides a robust framework to understand supervised learning, many theoretical aspects of deep learning remain unclear, in particular how different architectures may lead to inductive bias when trained using gradient based methods. The goal of these lectures is to provide an overview of some of the main questions that arise when attempting to understand deep learning from a learning theory perspective. After a brief reminder on statistical learning theory and stochastic optimization, we discuss implicit bias in the context of benign overfitting. We then move to a general description of the mirror descent algorithm, showing how we may go back and forth between a parameter space and the corresponding function space for a given learning problem, as well as how the geometry of the learning problem may be represented by a metric tensor. Building on this framework, we provide a detailed study of the implicit bias of gradient descent on linear diagonal networks for various regression tasks, showing how the loss function, scale of parameters at initialization and depth of the network may lead to various forms of implicit bias, in particular transitioning between kernel or feature learning.</description>

      <title>Dissolution of the non-Hermitian skin effect in one-dimensional lattices with linearly varying nonreciprocal hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices with linearly varying nonreciprocal hopping, where the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is found to be dissolved gradually as the strength of nonreciprocity increases. The energy spectrum under the open boundary condition is composed of real and imaginary eigenenergies when the nonreciprocal hopping is weak. Interestingly, the real eigenenergies form an equally spaced ladder, and the corresponding eigenstates are localized at the boundary with a Gaussian distribution due to NHSE. By increasing the nonreciprocity, the number of real eigenenergies will decrease while more and more eigenenergies become imaginary. Accompanied by the real-imaginary transition in the spectrum, the eigenstates are shifted from the boundary into the bulk of the lattice. When the nonreciprocity gets strong enough, the whole spectrum will be imaginary and the NHSE disappears completely in the system; i.e., all the eigenstates become Gaussian bound states localized inside the bulk. Our work unveils the exotic properties of non-Hermitian systems with spatially varying nonreciprocal hopping.</description>

      <title>Validation Workflow for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Complex Ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of published Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) has increased significantly in recent years. These new data-driven potential energy approximations often lack the physics-based foundations that inform many traditionally-developed interatomic potentials and hence require robust validation methods for their applicability, accuracy, computational efficiency, and transferability to the intended applications. This work presents a sequential, three-stage workflow for MLIP validation: (i) preliminary validation, (ii) static property prediction, and (iii) dynamic property prediction. This material-agnostic procedure is demonstrated in a tutorial approach for the development of a robust MLIP for boron carbide (B4C), a widely employed, structurally complex ceramic that undergoes a deleterious deformation mechanism called "amorphization" under high-pressure loading. It is shown that the resulting B4C MLIP offers a more accurate prediction of properties compared to the available empirical potential.</description>
