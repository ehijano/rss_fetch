      <title>A Portable Multi-GPU Solver for Collisional Plasmas with Coulombic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study parallel particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for low-temperature plasmas (LTPs), which discretize kinetic formulations that capture the time evolution of the probability density function of particles as a function of position and velocity. We use a kinetic description for electrons and a fluid approximation for heavy species. In this paper, we focus on GPU acceleration of algorithms for velocity-space interactions and in particular, collisions of electrons with neutrals, ions, and electrons. Our work has two thrusts. The first is algorithmic exploration and analysis. The second is examining the viability of rapid-prototyping implementations using Python-based HPC tools, in particular PyKokkos. We discuss several common PIC kernels and present performance results on NVIDIA Volta V100 and AMD MI250X GPUs. Overall, the MI250X is slightly faster for most kernels but shows more sensitivity to register pressure. We also report scaling results for a distributed memory implementation on up to 16 MPI ranks.</description>

      <title>Application of association rule mining to assess forest species distribution in Italy considering abiotic and biotic factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biodiversity monitoring represents a pressing global priority, and assessing forest community composition plays a crucial role due to its influence on ecosystem functions. The spatial distribution of forest species becomes essential for understanding biodiversity dynamics, territorial planning, aiding nature conservation and enhancing ecosystem resilience amid global change. Association Rule Mining, commonly applied to other scientific contexts, is now innovatively adopted in the ecological field to explore the relationships among co-occurring plant species and extract hidden interpretable patterns, also with abiotic and biotic conditions. Multiple heterogeneous data sources were integrated through data preprocessing into a unique dataset, including georeferenced information about 151 plant species monitored within 6,784 plots across Italy and several bioclimatic indices, soil-related factors, and variables from earth observations. The Frequent Pattern Growth algorithm, used for association rule mining, provided interesting and encouraging findings, suggesting ecological rules among plant species and environmental conditions. Indeed, temperature seasonality between 650-700 and precipitation seasonality between 45-50 resulted very correlated with Picea abies (confidence = 90.9%, lift = 7.13). Patterns detected for Picea abies highlighted its ecological specificity, indicating a strong association with cold, highly seasonal environments, and particular plant communities. Some species appeared acting as community "hubs", frequently co-occurring with other species, suggesting ties to specific environmental or biotic conditions. These findings represent a valuable resource for future research, especially in regions with similar environmental settings and when prior ecological knowledge exists, also underlining the importance of publicly accessible, high-quality ecological data.</description>

      <title>Harmonic balance-automatic differentiation method: an out-of-the-box and efficient solver for general nonlinear dynamics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Harmonic Balance-Alternating Frequency-Time domain (HB-AFT) method is extensively employed for dynamic response analysis of nonlinear systems. However, its application to high-dimensional complex systems is constrained by the manual derivation of Jacobian matrices during Newton-Raphson iterations, which become computationally intractable or error-prone for intricate nonlinearities. The Harmonic Balance-Automatic Differentiation (HB-AD) method is proposed to address this limitation, in which AD is integrated with the harmonic balance framework. This approach eliminates all manual derivations by leveraging AD to compute exact Jacobians numerically, enabling generic and efficient analysis of high-dimensional complex nonlinear systems. The implementation utilizes advanced deep learning frameworks for native parallel computing and CUDA acceleration, and combines AD with arc-length continuation, establishing an out-of-the-box and high efficiency computational architecture. Users need only supply the system's dynamic equations, HB-AD then autonomously trace the complete panorama of periodic responses -- including stable/unstable solution branches. Computational experiments on a rotor system with squeeze-film damper (SFD) demonstrate HB-AD's capability in handling complex nonlinear expressions with automated Jacobian calculations. For a high-dimensional aero-engine rotor-bearing-casing system with complex bearing nonlinearities, HB-AD achieves 17-fold higher efficiency than traditional HB-AFT and 144-fold acceleration over the Newmark method. The HB-AD method is a synergistic merger of computational mechanics and machine learning primitives, delivers an easy to use, general-purpose, high efficiency platform for high-fidelity dynamic characterization of high-dimensional engineering systems.</description>

      <title>Cardiotensor: A Python Library for Orientation Analysis and Tractography in 3D Cardiac Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the architecture of the human heart requires analysis of its microstructural organization across scales. With the advent of high-resolution imaging techniques such as synchrotron-based tomography, it has become possible to visualize entire hearts at micron-scale resolution. However, translating these large, complex volumetric datasets into interpretable, quantitative descriptors of cardiac organization remains a major challenge. Here we present cardiotensor, an open-source Python package designed to quantify 3D cardiomyocyte orientation in whole- or partial-heart imaging datasets. It provides efficient, scalable implementations of structure tensor analysis, enabling extraction of directional metrics such as helical angle (HA), intrusion angle (IA), and fractional anisotropy (FA). The package supports datasets reaching teravoxel-scale and is optimized for high-performance computing environments, including parallel and chunk-based processing pipelines. In addition, cardiotensor includes tractography functionality to reconstruct continuous cardiomyocyte trajectories. This enables multi-scale myoaggregate visualization down to the myocyte level, depending on resolution. These capabilities enable detailed structural mapping of cardiac tissue, supporting the assessment of anatomical continuity and regional organization.</description>

      <title>Material Fingerprinting: A shortcut to material model discovery without solving optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Material Fingerprinting, a new method for the rapid discovery of mechanical material models from direct or indirect data that avoids solving potentially non-convex optimization problems. The core assumption of Material Fingerprinting is that each material exhibits a unique response when subjected to a standardized experimental setup. We can interpret this response as the material's fingerprint, essentially a unique identifier that encodes all pertinent information about the material's mechanical characteristics. Consequently, once we have established a database containing fingerprints and their corresponding mechanical models during an offline phase, we can rapidly characterize an unseen material in an online phase. This is accomplished by measuring its fingerprint and employing a pattern recognition algorithm to identify the best matching fingerprint in the database. In our study, we explore this concept in the context of hyperelastic materials, demonstrating the applicability of Material Fingerprinting across different experimental setups. Initially, we examine Material Fingerprinting through experiments involving homogeneous deformation fields, which provide direct strain-stress data pairs. We then extend this concept to experiments involving complexly shaped specimens with heterogeneous deformation fields, which provide indirect displacement and reaction force measurements. We show that, in both cases, Material Fingerprinting is an efficient tool for model discovery, bypassing the challenges of potentially non-convex optimization. We believe that Material Fingerprinting provides a powerful and generalizable framework for rapid material model identification across a wide range of experimental designs and material behaviors, paving the way for numerous future developments.</description>

      <title>Assessing Engineering Student Perceptions of Introductory CS Courses in an Indian Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding student perceptions of assessment is vital for designing inclusive and effective learning environments, especially in technical education. This study explores engineering students' perceptions of assessment practices in an introductory computer science/ programming course, and its associated laboratory within an Indian engineering institute context. A total of 318 first-year Bachelor of Technology students participated in a weekly 25-statement Likert-scale survey conducted over nine weeks. Using descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis), the analysis reveals that students largely perceive lab assignments as effective learning activities and view exams and projects as authentic and skill-enhancing. Students appreciated the role of instructors in shaping course content and found teaching assistants to be approachable and helpful, despite some inconsistencies. The study also finds significant variations in students' academic performance and assessment perceptions based on prior programming experience, technology familiarity, gender, and academic branch. Notably, the performance data did not follow a Gaussian distribution, challenging common assumptions in grade modeling. A comparative analysis with European cohorts highlights both universal patterns and contextual differences, offering valuable insights for designing inclusive and equitable assessment strategies in programming education.</description>

      <title>Discovery Learning accelerates battery design evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and reliable validation of novel designs in complex physical systems such as batteries is critical to accelerating technological innovation. However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing. Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to inform and accelerate the development of next-generation battery technologies. DL represents a key advance toward efficient data-driven modeling and helps realize the promise of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery and engineering innovation.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Enhanced Time-Series Forecasting via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy, meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</description>

      <title>A Lagrangian method for solving the spherical shallow water equations using power diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of the air in the atmosphere and water in the oceans are essential for numerical weather prediction. The state-of-the-art for performing these fluid simulations relies on an Eulerian viewpoint, in which the fluid domain is discretized into a mesh, and the governing equations describe the fluid motion as it passes through each cell of the mesh. However, it is unclear whether a Lagrangian viewpoint, in which the fluid is discretized by a collection of particles, can outperform Eulerian simulations in global atmospheric simulations. To date, Lagrangian approaches have shown promise, but tend to produce smoother solutions. In this work, a new Lagrangian method is developed to simulate the atmosphere in which particles are represented with spherical power cells. We introduce an efficient algorithm for computing these cells which are then used to discretize the spherical shallow water equations. Mass conservation is enforced by solving a semi-discrete optimal transport problem and a semi-implicit time stepping procedure is used to advance the solution in time. We note that, in contrast to previous work, artificial viscosity is not needed to stabilize the simulation. The performance of the spherical Voronoi diagram calculation is first assessed, which shows that spherical Voronoi diagrams of 100 million sites can be computed in under 2 minutes on a single machine. The new simulation method is then evaluated on standard benchmark test cases, which shows that momentum and energy conservation of this new method is comparable to the latest Lagrangian approach for simulating the spherical shallow water equations.</description>

      <title>Organizations, teams, and job mobility: A social microdynamics approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of the modeling approaches used to understand organizational worker mobility are highly stylized, using idealizations such as structureless organizations, indistinguishable workers, and a lack of social bonding of the workers. In this article, aided by a decade of precise, temporally resolved data of a large civilian organization of the US Army in which employees can change jobs in a similar way to many private organizations, we introduce a new framework to describe organizations as composites of teams within which individuals perform specific tasks and where social connections develop. By tracking the personnel composition of organizational teams, we find that workers who change jobs are highly influenced by preferring to reunite with past coworkers. In this organization, 34% of all moves across temporally stable teams (and 32% of the totality of moves) lead to worker reunions, percentages that have not been reported and are well-above intuitive expectation. To assess the importance of worker reunions in determining job moves, we compare them to labor supply and demand with or without occupational specialization. The comparison shows that the most consistent information about job change is provided by reunions. We find that the greater the time workers spend together or the smaller the team they share both increase their likelihood to reunite, supporting the notion of increased familiarity and trust behind such reunions and the dominant role of social capital in the evolution of large organizations. Our study of this organization supports the idea that to correctly forecast job mobility inside large organizations, their teams structures and the social ties formed in those teams play a key role in shaping internal job change.</description>

      <title>EngiBench: A Framework for Data-Driven Engineering Design Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Engineering design optimization seeks to automatically determine the shapes, topologies, or parameters of components that maximize performance under given conditions. This process often depends on physics-based simulations, which are difficult to install, computationally expensive, and require domain-specific expertise. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce EngiBench, the first open-source library and datasets spanning diverse domains for data-driven engineering design. EngiBench provides a unified API and a curated set of benchmarks -- covering aeronautics, heat conduction, photonics, and more -- that enable fair, reproducible comparisons of optimization and machine learning algorithms, such as generative or surrogate models. We also release EngiOpt, a companion library offering a collection of such algorithms compatible with the EngiBench interface. Both libraries are modular, letting users plug in novel algorithms or problems, automate end-to-end experiment workflows, and leverage built-in utilities for visualization, dataset generation, feasibility checks, and performance analysis. We demonstrate their versatility through experiments comparing state-of-the-art techniques across multiple engineering design problems, an undertaking that was previously prohibitively time-consuming to perform. Finally, we show that these problems pose significant challenges for standard machine learning methods due to highly sensitive and constrained design manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shockwave classification in shadowgraph imaging is challenging due to limited labeled data and complex flow structures. This study presents a hybrid framework that combines unsupervised autoencoder models with a fuzzy inference system to generate and interpret anomaly maps. Among the evaluated methods, the hybrid $\beta$-VAE autoencoder with a fuzzy rule-based system most effectively captured coherent shock features, integrating spatial context to enhance anomaly classification. The resulting approach enables interpretable, unsupervised classification of flow disruptions and lays the groundwork for real-time, physics-informed diagnostics in experimental and industrial fluid applications.</description>

      <title>SARDet-100K: Towards Open-Source Benchmark and ToolKit for Large-Scale SAR Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection has gained significant attention recently due to its irreplaceable all-weather imaging capabilities. However, this research field suffers from both limited public datasets (mostly comprising &lt;2K images with only mono-category objects) and inaccessible source code. To tackle these challenges, we establish a new benchmark dataset and an open-source method for large-scale SAR object detection. Our dataset, SARDet-100K, is a result of intense surveying, collecting, and standardizing 10 existing SAR detection datasets, providing a large-scale and diverse dataset for research purposes. To the best of our knowledge, SARDet-100K is the first COCO-level large-scale multi-class SAR object detection dataset ever created. With this high-quality dataset, we conducted comprehensive experiments and uncovered a crucial challenge in SAR object detection: the substantial disparities between the pretraining on RGB datasets and finetuning on SAR datasets in terms of both data domain and model structure. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Multi-Stage with Filter Augmentation (MSFA) pretraining framework that tackles the problems from the perspective of data input, domain transition, and model migration. The proposed MSFA method significantly enhances the performance of SAR object detection models while demonstrating exceptional generalizability and flexibility across diverse models. This work aims to pave the way for further advancements in SAR object detection. The dataset and code is available at https://github.com/zcablii/SARDet_100K.</description>

      <title>Can LLM-based Financial Investing Strategies Outperform the Market in Long Run?</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been leveraged for asset pricing tasks and stock trading applications, enabling AI agents to generate investment decisions from unstructured financial data. However, most evaluations of LLM timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols. Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.</description>
