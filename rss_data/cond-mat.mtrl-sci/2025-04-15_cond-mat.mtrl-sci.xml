      <title>Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation of silicon nanoparticle crystallization during laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) printing is a versatile technique to realize micro/nano-scale additive manufacturing of functional materials, including metals, and semiconductors. However, the crystallization phenomena during LIFT printing have not been well understood. In this work, we attempt to gain a comprehensive understanding of silicon crystallization during LIFT printing. Specifically, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is used to investigate the size effect on the melting and crystallization of Si nanoparticles during transportation in air. We found with the decrease in nanoparticle size, crystallization becomes rare, even with a low cooling rate. The nucleation location of different particles is also analyzed and almost always starts at a sub-surface location (below 5 {\AA}). The atomic structure evolution during solidification is also monitored to provide guidance for LIFT printing of Si. Our simulation results indicate that nano-confinement can lead to single-crystal structure formation, which may shed light on single-crystal additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Insights into Nb2C and Nb2CO2 as high-performance anodes for sodium- and lithium-ion batteries: An ab initio investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employ first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the electrochemical properties of Nb2C and Nb2CO2 MXenes as potential anode materials for sodium-ion (SIBs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Our findings reveal that Li and Na intercalation primarily modifies the electronic properties of Nb2C without inducing significant structural distortions, as indicated by Raman intensity variations. Adsorption energy calculations show that the T4 and H3 sites are the most favorable for metal intercalation, with Nb2CO2 exhibiting stronger adsorption due to oxygen functionalization. We find that Nb2C offers lower diffusion barriers, especially for Na ions, making it a promising candidate for fast-charging SIBs. In contrast, Nb2CO2 enhances charge retention through stronger electrostatic interactions but introduces higher migration resistance. Electronic structure analysis confirms the metallic nature of both MXenes, ensuring efficient electron transport. Open-circuit voltage (OCV) calculations indicate that Nb2CO2 exhibits higher OCV values than Nb2C, highlighting the role of surface functionalization in tuning electrochemical performance. Our study suggests that, while Li-based systems achieve slightly higher theoretical capacities, Na-based systems exhibit comparable performance, reinforcing the viability of sodium-ion batteries as a cost-effective alternative. Overall, our results demonstrate that Nb2C is better suited for rapid ion transport, whereas Nb2CO2 offers enhanced charge retention. These insights provide a foundation for the optimization of MXene-based electrodes for next-generation high performance energy storage applications.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Transition-State Searches in Zeolite Nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zeolites are important for industrial catalytic processes involving organic molecules. Understanding molecular reaction mechanisms within the confined nanoporous environment can guide the selection of pore topologies, material compositions, and process conditions to maximize activity and selectivity. However, experimental mechanistic studies are time- and resource-intensive, and traditional molecular simulations rely heavily on expert intuition and hand manipulation of chemical structures, resulting in poor scalability.
  Here, we present an automated computational pipeline for locating transition states (TS) in nanopores and exploring reaction energy landscapes of complex organic transformations in pores. Starting from the molecular structure of potential reactant and products, the Pore Transition State finder (PoTS) locates gas-phase transition states using DFT, docks them in favorable orientations near active sites in nanopores, and leverages the gas-phase reaction mode to seed condensed-phase DFT calculations using the dimer method. The approach sidesteps tedious manipulations, increases the success rate of TS searches, and eliminates the need for long path-following calculations.
  This work presents the largest ensemble of zeolite-confined transition states computed at the DFT level to date, enabling rigorous analysis of mechanistic trends across frameworks, reactions, and reactant types. We demonstrate the applicability of PoTS by analyzing 644 individual reaction steps for transalkylation of diethylbenzene in BOG, IWV, UTL and FAU zeolites, and in skeletal isomerization of 162 individual reaction steps in BEA, FER, FAU, MFI and MOR zeolites finding good experimental agreement in both cases. Lastly, we propose a path to address the limitations we observe regarding unsuccessful TS searches and insufficient theory in other reactions, like alkene cracking.</description>

      <title>Research on the Crystal Growth, Band Structure and Luminescence Mechanism of (CH3NH3)2HgI4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear radiation detectors play a crucial role in fields such as nuclear safety and medical imaging. The core of their performance lies in the selection of detection materials. Semiconductor detectors have become a hot topic in current research due to their advantages such as small size, good energy resolution, and high detection efficiency. As one of the most promising materials for fabricating room - temperature nuclear radiation semiconductor detectors, HgI2 exhibits excellent detection performance due to its high atomic number, large band gap, strong ray - stopping power, and high volume dark resistivity. However, issues such as poor chemical stability and low vacancy mobility of HgI2 limit its development. Therefore, researchers have carried out inorganic doping/organic hybridization on it. By introducing the organic ligand CH3NH3I, the synthesis of organic - inorganic hybrid compounds based on HgI2 is expected to significantly improve the stability of HgI2. Research on organic - inorganic hybrid metal halide crystals shows that this material has great application potential in the field of luminescent materials.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Robust Non-Janus Hybrid MoSH Monolayer as a Two-Gap Superconductor via High-Throughput Computational Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomic-scale determination of hydrogen positions in MoSH monolayers remains experimentally challenging, and existing studies are confined to Janus-type configurations. Here, we combine high-throughput structural screening with first-principles calculations to predict a novel non-Janus Hybrid 1T$^{'}$-MoSH monolayer, which energetically surpasses all previously reported MoSH phases with a binding energy of -3.02 eV. This structure emerges as a hybrid of MoS$_2$ and MoH$_2$, featuring alternating S and H atoms on both sides of the Mo layer. Comprehensive stability analyses confirm its robustness in energy, mechanics, dynamics, and thermodynamics (stable up to 1600 K). Remarkably, anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg theory predicts Hybrid 1T$^{'}$-MoSH as a two-gap superconductor with a critical temperature T$_c$ of 16.34 K, driven by strong electron-phonon coupling ($\lambda$$=$1.39). Substituting Mo with Hf, Ta, or Ti drastically suppresses T$_c$ $\sim$ (0.53-2.42 K), highlighting Mo$^{'}$s unique role in enhancing superconductivity. Our work not only expands the family of 2D transition metal chalcogenides but also proposes a promising candidate for quantum technologies, bridging theoretical design to functional material discovery.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced polarization rotation in freestanding ferroelectric oxide membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Freestanding ferroelectric membranes have emerged as a versatile tool for strain engineering, enabling the exploration of ferroelectric properties beyond traditional epitaxy. The resulting ferroelectric domain patterns stem from the balance at the local scale of several effects playing a key role, i.e. piezoelectricity linked to strain, and flexoelectricity arising from strain gradients. To weight their respective contributions for a given membrane geometry, the strain profile has to be mapped with respect to the ferroelectric polarization landscape, a necessary step to allow for a controlled tailoring of the latter. In this study, we examine the effect of bending strain on a Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 membrane in a fold-like structure, observing a polarization rotation from out-of-plane to in-plane at the fold apex. Combining piezoresponse force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy, we map the ferroelectric polarization direction relative to the height profile of the membrane, and discuss the contributions of strain and strain gradients for this archetypal fold geometry. Our findings offer new insights into strain-engineered polarization configurations, and emphasize strain effects at the nanoscale to tune the functional properties in freestanding membranes.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Indium Oxide at the Epitaxial Graphene/SiC Interface: Synthesis, Structure, Properties, and Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality two-dimensional (2D) dielectrics are crucial for fabricating 2D/3D hybrid vertical electronic devices such as metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) based Schottky diodes and hot electron transistors, the production of which is constrained by the scarcity of bulk layered wide bandgap semiconductors. In this research, we present the synthesis of a new 2D dielectric, monolayer InO2, which differs in stoichiometry from its bulk form, over a large area (&gt;300 um2) by intercalating at the epitaxial graphene (EG)/SiC interface. By adjusting the lateral size of graphene through optical lithography prior to the intercalation, we tune the thickness of InO2 where predominantly (~85%) monolayer InO2 is formed. The preference for monolayer formation of InO2 is explained using ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, the band gap of InO2 is calculated to be 4.1 eV, differing from its bulk form (2.7 eV). Furthermore, MOS-based Schottky diode measurements on InO2 intercalated EG/n-SiC demonstrate that the EG/n-SiC junction transforms from ohmic to a Schottky junction upon intercalation, with a barrier height of 0.87 eV and a rectification ratio of ~10^5. These findings introduce a new addition to the 2D dielectric family, showing significant potential for monolayer InO2 to be used as a barrier in vertical electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Probing Spin Defects via Single Spin Relaxometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin defects in solids offer promising platforms for quantum sensing and memory due to their long coherence times and compatibility with quantum networks. Here, we integrate a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond with scanning probe microscopy to discover, read out, and spatially map arbitrary spin-based quantum sensors at the nanoscale. Using the boron vacancy (V$_B^-$) center in hexagonal boron nitride$\unicode{x2013}$an emerging two-dimensional spin system$\unicode{x2013}$as a model, we detect its electron spin resonance through changes in the spin relaxation time ($T_1$) of a nearby NV center, without requiring direct optical excitation or readout of the V$_B^-$ fluorescence. Cross-relaxation between the NV and V$_B^-$ ensembles results in a pronounced NV $T_1$ reduction, enabling nanoscale mapping of spin defect distributions beyond the optical diffraction limit. This approach highlights NV centers as versatile quantum probes for characterizing spin systems, including those emitting at wavelengths beyond the range of silicon-based detectors. Our results open a pathway to hybrid quantum architectures where sensing and readout qubits are decoupled, facilitating the discovery of otherwise inaccessible quantum defects for advanced sensing and quantum networking.</description>

      <title>Strong altermagnetism and topological features in a two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructure via broken time reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of altermagnetism, a new phase of magnetism, has garnered significant interest due to its extraordinary spin-polarized electronic bands despite zero net magnetization. Such spin-symmetry-guided robust non-relativistic alternating spin splitting in a compensated collinear magnet presents a novel platform for magnetotransport and nontrivial topology. Predominantly, altermagnetic behavior is observed in bulk magnetic materials upon incorporating external perturbations. However, van der Waals heterostructures can offer exceptional flexibility in tailoring their various emerging properties without the need for external perturbations in the two-dimensional regime. Here, an unconventional time reversal symmetry breaking with sizeable spin splitting via broken space-spin symmetry (\textit{P$\mathcal{T}$}) has been demonstrated in an antiferromagnet/nonmagnet vdW heterostructure. The lifted Kramer's degeneracy alongwith spin-orbit interactions result in non-zero Berry curvature, contributing to the outstanding magnetotransport with a large value of anomalous Hall conductivity ($\sim 732.9\ {\mathit{\Omega}}^{-1}{cm}^{-1}$). The presence of relativistic spin-orbit interactions in addition to predominant non-relativistic effects governed spin-momentum locking with a weak out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which induces small spin canting. Further, the lowest magnetic anisotropy energy confirms collinear antiferromagnetic ground state. In particular, a nontrivial topology is observed along the surface [001], which is confirmed by the non-zero Chern number. This study provides a novel approach to realize strong altermagnetism in broken space-spin symmetry systems and fosters emergent transport behaviors.</description>

      <title>Luttinger compensated magnetic material LaMn2SbO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional magnetism including altermagnetism and Luttinger compensated magnetism,
  characterized by its duality of real-space antiferromagnetic alignment and momentum-space spin
  splitting, has garnered widespread attention. While altermagnetism has been extensively studied,
  research on Luttinger compensated magnetism remains very rare. In particular, Luttinger com pensated magnetic materials are only theoretically predicted and have not yet been synthesized
  experimentally. In this study, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic struc ture calculations, we predict that LaMn2SbO6 is a Luttinger compensated magnetic semiconductor.
  Given that the Mn ions at opposite spin lattice cannot be connected by any symmetry, the spin
  splitting in LaMn2SbO6 is isotropic. More importantly, LaMn2SbO6 has already been synthesized
  experimentally, and its magnetic structure has been confirmed by neutron scattering experiments.
  Therefore, LaMn2SbO6 serves as an excellent material platform for investigating the novel physical
  properties of Luttinger compensated magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics analysis of acoustically actuated nanospherical antennas embedded in polymer/metal medium with magneto-electro-elastic surface/interface effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precise analytical treatment for predicting the behavior of nano-sized magneto-electro-elastic (MEE) antennas and resonators under incident acoustic waves requires consideration of multiphysics surface/interface effects, including magnetization, polarization, and elasticity. No analytical solutions to date have incorporated all three phenomena simultaneously. This work presents a rigorous mathematical analysis of a nano-sized spherically isotropic embedded MEE spherical shell subjected to acoustic waves. The study distinguishes between the coupled spectral constitutive relations for the bulk of the MEE shell and those for its free inner surface and matrix-shell interface. The surrounding matrix may be isotropic dielectric or metallic. Conventional electrodynamics theories do not address MEE effects at the surface or interface. To overcome this, the equivalent impedance matrix (EIM) method combined with surface/interface elasticity is used to model the MEE behaviors. For metallic matrices, a plasmonics-based framework with optical properties described by the plasma model captures metallic behavior. The spectral EIM method, along with vector and tensor spherical harmonics, solves the coupled elastodynamics and Maxwell's equations. This approach enables the exploration of surface/interface characteristic lengths, revealing size-dependent effects on electromagnetic radiated power and resonance frequency. The findings provide insights into the behavior of acoustically actuated nanospherical antennas, sensors, and resonators, with implications for the design of nanoscale devices in advanced technological applications.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Machine Learning for Quantum-Accurate Predictions of Non-Equilibrium Behavior in 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting the non-equilibrium mechanical properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials is essential for understanding their deformation, thermo-mechanical properties, and failure mechanisms. In this study, we parameterize and evaluate two machine learning (ML) interatomic potentials, SNAP and Allegro, for modeling the non-equilibrium behavior of monolayer MoSe2. Using a density functional theory (DFT) derived dataset, we systematically compare their accuracy and transferability against the physics-based Tersoff force field. Our results show that SNAP and Allegro significantly outperform Tersoff, achieving near-DFT accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Allegro surpasses SNAP in both accuracy and efficiency due to its advanced neural network architecture. Both ML potentials demonstrate strong transferability, accurately predicting out-of-sample properties such as surface stability, inversion domain formation, and fracture toughness. Unlike Tersoff, SNAP and Allegro reliably model temperature-dependent edge stabilities and phase transformation pathways, aligning closely with DFT benchmarks. Notably, their fracture toughness predictions closely match experimental measurements, reinforcing their suitability for large-scale simulations of mechanical failure in 2D materials. This study establishes ML-based force fields as a powerful alternative to traditional potentials for modeling non-equilibrium mechanical properties in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Resistive switching and charge accumulation in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revealed the resistive switching and charge accumulation effect in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders sintered by the auto-combustion sol-gel method. To explain the experimental results, we analyze phase composition of the nanopowder samples annealed at temperatures from 500{\deg}C to 800{\deg}C, determined by the X-ray diffraction analysis, and relate it with the peculiarities of their electronic paramagnetic resonance spectra. The analysis allows us to relate the resistive switching and charge accumulation observed in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders with the appearance of the ferroelectric-like polar regions in the orthorhombic Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanoparticles, which agrees with the calculations performed in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Optical spatial dispersion via Wannier interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical implementation, based on Wannier interpolation, of a Kubo-Greenwood formalism for computing the spatially dispersive optical conductivity in crystals at first order in the wave vector of light. This approach is more efficient than direct $\textit{ab initio}$ methods because, with less computational cost, it allows for a much finer sampling of reciprocal space, resulting in better resolved spectra. Moreover, Wannier interpolation avoids errors arising from truncation of the sums over conduction bands when evaluating the spatially dispersive optical matrix elements. We validate our method by computing the optical activity spectrum of selected crystals, both polar (GaN) and chiral (trigonal Te, trigonal Se, and $\alpha$-quartz), and comparing with existing literature.</description>

      <title>Berry curvature-induced intrinsic spin Hall effect in light-element-based CrN system for magnetization switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current-induced spin-orbit torque-based devices for magnetization switching are commonly relied on the 4d and 5d heavy metals owing to their strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to produce large spin current via spin Hall effect (SHE). Here we present the sizable SHE in CrN, a light element-based system and demonstrate the current-induced magnetization switching in the adjacent ferromagnetic layer [Co(0.35nm)/Pt(0.3nm)]3, which exhibits perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We found the switching current density of 2.6 MA/cm2. The first principles calculation gives the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) to be 120 (hcross/e) S/cm due to intrinsic Berry curvature arising from SOC induced band splitting near Fermi-energy. The theoretically calculated intrinsic SHC is close to the experimental SHC extracted from second harmonic Hall measurement. We estimated spin Hall angle to be 0.09, demonstrating efficient charge-to-spin conversion in CrN system.</description>

      <title>Strain Engineering of Magnetoresistance and Magnetic Anisotropy in CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tailoring magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy in van der Waals magnetic materials is essential for advancing their integration into technological applications. In this regard, strain engineering has emerged as a powerful and versatile strategy to control magnetism at the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here, we demonstrate that compressive biaxial strain significantly enhances the magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy of few-layer CrSBr flakes. Strain is efficiently transferred to the flakes from the thermal compression of a polymeric substrate upon cooling, as confirmed by temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. This strain induces a remarkable increase in the magnetoresistance ratio and in the saturation fields required to align the magnetization of CrSBr along each of its three crystalographic directions, reaching a twofold enhancement along the magnetic easy axis. This enhancement is accompanied by a subtle reduction of the N\'eel temperature by ~10K. Our experimental results are fully supported by first-principles calculations, which link the observed effects to a strain-driven modification in interlayer exchange coupling and magnetic anisotropy energy. These findings establish strain engineering as a key tool for fine-tuning magnetotransport properties in 2D magnetic semiconductors, paving the way for implementation in spintronics and information storage devices.</description>

      <title>Probing Temperature at Nanoscale through Thermal Vibration Characterization using Scanning Precession Electron Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate, non-contact temperature measurement with high spatial resolution is essential for understanding thermal behavior in integrated nanoscale devices and heterogeneous interfaces. However, existing techniques are often limited by the need for physical contact or insufficient spatial resolution for the measurement of local temperature and mapping its distribution. Here, we showcase the direct temperature measurement of graphene with nanometer spatial resolution in transmission electron microscopy. In experiments, combining a scanning nanobeam with precession electron diffraction offers the collection of kinemetic diffraction from a local area at the nanometer scale. In analysis, we use a pre-calculated, sample-specific structure-factor-based correction method to enable the linear fitting of the diffraction intensities, allowing the determination of the Debye-Waller factor as a function of temperature at the precision of 10-4{\AA}2/{\deg}C. With the high spatial resolution and measurement precision, the temperature and thermal vibration mapping further reveal the influence of graphene lattice parameters and thickness on the Debye-Waller factor, providing valuable insights into the vibrational properties impacted by temperature, lattice structure, and graphene layer thickness.</description>

Abstract: The static magnetic properties of the silica-based aergoels of Cryogel$^{\tiny{\circledR}}$ and Pyrogel$^{\tiny{\circledR}}$, manufactured by Aspen Aerogels$^{\tiny{\circledR}}$, were measured over a range of temperatures (2 K $\leq$ T $\leq$ 400 K) and in magnetic fields up to 70 kG. These data and a model of the responses are reported so these properties are familiar to others who may benefit from knowing them before the materials are employed in potential applications.</description>

      <title>CMOS-compatible vanadium dioxide via Pulsed Laser and Atomic Layer deposition: towards ultra-thin film phase-change layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadium dioxide, a well-known Mott insulator, is a highly studied electronic material with promising applications in information processing and storage. While fully crystalline layers exhibit exceptional properties, such as a sharp and abrupt conductivity change at the metal-insulator transition, fabricating poly-crystalline films on silicon substrates often involves trade-offs in transport characteristics and switching performance, especially for ultra-thin layers required in advanced gate applications. In this study, we explore the growth of vanadium dioxide films on standard wet-oxidized silicon wafers using two established deposition techniques with pulsed laser deposition and atomic layer deposition. Thin films, ranging in thickness from 200 to 10 nano meters, were systematically characterized through structural and electrical analyses to optimize key growth parameters. Temperature and pressure were identified as the primary factors affecting film quality, and the optimal growth conditions across the entire thickness range are discussed in detail. We demonstrate that both pulsed laser deposition and atomic layer deposition methods can successfully produce ultra-thin vanadium dioxide layers down to 8 nano meters with functional properties suitable for practical applications. This work underscores the potential of vanadium dioxide for fully industry compatible phase-change switching devices and provides valuable insights into optimizing growth processes for poly-crystalline films.</description>

      <title>Performances in solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the Yambo code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the performances of two different strategies in solving the structured eigenvalue problem deriving from the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) in condensed matter physics. The first strategy employs direct diagonalization, while the second is based on an iterative solver. The BSE matrix is constructed with the Yambo code, and the two strategies are implemented by interfacing Yambo with the ScaLAPACK and ELPA libraries for direct diagonalization, and with the SLEPc library for the iterative approach. We consider both the hermitian (Tamm-Dancoff approximation) and pseudo-hermitian forms, addressing dense matrices of three different sizes. A description of the implementation is also provided, with details for the pseudo-hermitian case. Timing and memory utilization are analyzed on both CPU and GPU clusters. The CPU simulations are performed on a local cluster in Rome, while the GPU simulations are performed on the Leonardo HPC cluster of CINECA. Our results demonstrate that it is now feasible to handle dense BSE matrices of the order 10$^5$.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Ferroelectric Behavior of Wurtzite Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the first experimental exploration into cryogenic ferroelectric behavior in wurtzite ferroelectrics. A breakdown field (EBD) to coercive field (EC) ratio of 1.8 is achieved even at 4 K, marking the lowest ferroelectric switching temperature reported for wurtzite ferroelectrics. Additionally, a significant evolution in fatigue behavior is captured, transitioning from hard breakdown to ferroelectricity loss at cryogenic temperatures. These findings unlock the feasibility for wurtzite ferroelectrics to advance wide temperature non-volatile memory.</description>

      <title>Highly Hydrogenated Monolayer Graphene with Wide Band Gap Opening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thorough spectroscopic characterisation of highly hydrogenated monolayer graphene trasferred on TEM grids is herein reported. The graphene hydrogenation has the effect to distort the $sp^2$ arrangement of carbon atoms in the lattice toward a $sp^3$-like coordination, through the breaking of the $\pi$-bonds, as determined by X ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the C 1s core level. The hydrogen bonding was found to be favoured for a more distorted graphene lattice. Indeed, a 100$\%$ $sp^3$-saturation - the highest ever achieved - was observed after the hydrogenation of a sample with more pristine $sp^3$-like deformed bonds, while the flatter, more $sp^2$-arranged, sample reached a 59$\%$ $sp^3$-saturation. Electron energy loss spectroscopy confirmed the photoemission result showing the $\pi$-plasmon excitation quenching, in the totally hydrogenated sample, and significant reduction, for the other one. High loading levels of hydrogenation were also witnessed by the opening of a wide optical band gap (6.3 and 6.2 eV). The observation of the C-H stretching vibrational mode is also reported, as a direct footprint of graphene hydrogenation. Finally, valence band measurements of the 59$\%$ saturated sample suggest the coexistence of one-side and two-side hydrogenation morphologies.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Autonomous Microscopy for Scalable and Intelligent Characterization of 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of atomic-scale materials traditionally requires human experts with months to years of specialized training. Even for trained human operators, accurate and reliable characterization remains challenging when examining newly discovered materials such as two-dimensional (2D) structures. This bottleneck drives demand for fully autonomous experimentation systems capable of comprehending research objectives without requiring large training datasets. In this work, we present ATOMIC (Autonomous Technology for Optical Microscopy &amp; Intelligent Characterization), an end-to-end framework that integrates foundation models to enable fully autonomous, zero-shot characterization of 2D materials. Our system integrates the vision foundation model (i.e., Segment Anything Model), large language models (i.e., ChatGPT), unsupervised clustering, and topological analysis to automate microscope control, sample scanning, image segmentation, and intelligent analysis through prompt engineering, eliminating the need for additional training. When analyzing typical MoS2 samples, our approach achieves 99.7% segmentation accuracy for single layer identification, which is equivalent to that of human experts. In addition, the integrated model is able to detect grain boundary slits that are challenging to identify with human eyes. Furthermore, the system retains robust accuracy despite variable conditions including defocus, color temperature fluctuations, and exposure variations. It is applicable to a broad spectrum of common 2D materials-including graphene, MoS2, WSe2, SnSe-regardless of whether they were fabricated via chemical vapor deposition or mechanical exfoliation. This work represents the implementation of foundation models to achieve autonomous analysis, establishing a scalable and data-efficient characterization paradigm that fundamentally transforms the approach to nanoscale materials research.</description>

      <title>Electron-Phonon Coupling Mediated by Fr\"ohlich Interaction in Rb2SnBr6 Perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their well-suited optoelectronic properties, metal halide perovskites are emerging semiconductor materials with potential applications in solar cells, detectors, and light-emitting diodes. Beyond the traditional 3D perovskites, low-dimensional counterparts have more attractive effects such as excitonic emissions and quantum confinements that are enhanced by the reduced dimensionality, which involve the Electron-Phonon Coupling (EPC). Such phenomenon, which comprehends the interaction between charge carriers and lattice vibrations, usually strongly impacts the photoluminescence (PL) response in low-dimensional frameworks. In this paper, we investigated the intrinsic EPC onto low-temperature PL of the zero-dimensional (0D) Rb2SnBr6 perovskite. Temperature-dependent PL measurements, complemented by various characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, revealed broadband emission with a significant Stokes shift attributed to self-trapped excitons (STEs). The Fr\"ohlich mechanism, mediated by interactions between excitonic charge carriers and longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, primarily accounts for the emission broadening through phonon-assisted radiative recombination. The EPC strength was evaluated through the Huang-Rhys factor S=34, confirming strong correlations between electronic and vibrational properties and supporting the STE emission assumption. The possible mechanism of STE formation was evaluated by the Fr\"ohlich parameter {\alpha} of 1.94 for electrons and 4.73 for holes, which points out a major contribution of the hole-polaron quasi-particle on exciton trapping. Our findings give insights regarding the influence of EPC in 0D perovskites and STE formation, which leads to the assessment of Rb2SnBr6 for light-harvesting applications.</description>

      <title>Improving diffusion modeling in all-solid-state lithium batteries: a novel approach for grain boundary effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-solid-state lithium-ion batteries offer promising advantages with respect to capacity, safety, and performance. The diffusion behavior of lithium ions in the contained polycrystalline solid-state electrolyte is crucial for battery function. While atomistic studies indicate that grain boundaries (GBs) and grain size significantly impact diffusivity, the corresponding effects are either neglected in simulations on larger scales or considered only under strong assumptions such as isotropy. Our approach considers the fully resolved crystalline structure with a parametrization aligned with the atomistic perspective to describe diffusion along and across GBs. The approach is embedded into a finite element simulation using a novel collapsed interface element based on an analytical description in thickness direction. Results are governed by different and potentially anisotropic diffusion coefficients in bulk and GB domains. The mesoscale response is derived using linear computational homogenization to capture large-scale effects. The novel collapsed interface description allows for a reconstruction of the 3D transport behavior within the GB domain without resolving it and is able to capture the relevant transport mechanisms such as channeling effects and concentration jumps. Grain size and GB volume fraction are expressed in terms of an affine parameter dependence and can be altered without any changes to geometry or mesh. Together with the observed dependence of the effective material response on the anisotropic GB parametrization, this leads to the identification of four distinct diffusion regimes, each with implications for the design of battery materials.</description>

      <title>Fundamental longitudinal electromagnetic (EM) force investigation using DC current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work was to investigate historical claims of the existence of a longitudinal ElectroMagnetic (EM) force component acting on metallic atomic current elements in a direction parallel to the current flowing through them. This lies outside conventional textbook physics predictions, yet its existence has been indicated previously and if eventually confirmed will have a significant effect on physics theory and many technological applications, especially those involving high current density (&gt; 10^9 A/m2). The experiment described here is based on the measurement of force on a copper armature submerged in a trough containing liquid metal through which constant DC current is passing. The coaxial symmetry of the experiment (CRE Coaxial Recoil Experiment) was able to limit all net force on the centred armature to the direction of interest, parallel to the current within it. All the experimental data related the measured forces on the armature to the current flowing through the circuit. Variations were made to the length and location of the armature along the central axis as well as modifications to the liquid metal configuration. Raw and processed results are presented, and an experimental technique described that revealed strong evidence for the existence of and discrimination between axial mechanical contact forces and longitudinal EM force. The original EM force law, proposed in 1822 by Ampere, includes a longitudinal component and has been found to be qualitatively consistent with all experiments to date, including these reported findings, and is considered a candidate explanatory theory.</description>

      <title>Twist-Induced Effects on Weyl Pairs in Magnetized Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical investigation into the dynamics of Weyl pairs within magnetized helicoidal graphene nanoribbons. By embedding a curved surface into flat Minkowski space-time, we derive a fully covariant two-body Dirac equation specific to this system. We begin by formulating a non-perturbative wave equation that governs the relative motion of the Weyl pairs and obtain exact solutions. Our results demonstrate the influence of the uniform magnetic field and the number of twists on the dynamics of Weyl pairs in graphene nanoribbons, providing precise energy values that lay a robust foundation for future research. Furthermore, we examine the material's response to perturbation fields by calculating the polarization function and investigating how twisting and magnetic fields affect this response. Our findings indicate that, in principle, the material's properties, which are crucial for practical applications, can be effectively controlled by precisely tuning the magnetic field and the number of twists in graphene nanoribbons.</description>

      <title>Corrosion of metal reinforcements within concrete and localisation of supporting reactions under natural conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Corrosion in concrete prevents in-situ observation, necessitating models to provide insight into the local reaction currents. We present a computational method for predicting corrosion rates of reinforcements within concrete under natural conditions, i.e. requiring the corrosion current to be supported by equal cathodic currents. In contrast to typical corrosion models, where these two counteracting currents are required to be co-located, we allow these currents to be separated such that pitting corrosion can be supported by cathodic reactions over a much larger area. Pitting corrosion is investigated, elucidating the effects of the concrete porosity and water saturation, the presence of dissolved oxygen, and chlorine concentration within the pore solution. The presented model is capable of capturing the dynamic growth of acidic regions around corrosion pits, showing the limited region over which the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs and how this region evolves over time. The ability of oxygen to diffuse towards the metal surface due to increased porosity is seen to have a major effect on the corrosion rate, whereas changes in the chlorine concentration (and thus changes in the conductivity of the pore solution) play a secondary role. Furthermore, external oxygen is seen to enhance corrosion but is not required to initialise and sustain acidic corrosion pits.</description>

      <title>PriM: Principle-Inspired Material Discovery through Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex chemical space and limited knowledge scope with biases holds immense challenge for human scientists, yet in automated materials discovery. Existing intelligent methods relies more on numerical computation, leading to inefficient exploration and results with hard-interpretability. To bridge this gap, we introduce a principles-guided material discovery system powered by language inferential multi-agent system (MAS), namely PriM. Our framework integrates automated hypothesis generation with experimental validation in a roundtable system of MAS, enabling systematic exploration while maintaining scientific rigor. Based on our framework, the case study of nano helix demonstrates higher materials exploration rate and property value while providing transparent reasoning pathways. This approach develops an automated-and-transparent paradigm for material discovery, with broad implications for rational design of functional materials. Code is publicly available at our \href{https://github.com/amair-lab/PriM}{GitHub}.</description>

      <title>Banana DNA derivatives as homeotropic alignment layers in optical devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from bananas was extracted and functionalized and used for the first time as a homeotropic alignment layer for liquid crystals (LCs). Our research was aimed at extracting and investigating DNA from bananas via the synthesis and study of DNA complexes with various surfactants to examine the usefulness of such a complex as an alignment layer in electro-optical transducers. We proposed a simple and eco-friendly synthesis of the DNA complexes isolated from bananas with surfactants, so we transformed the DNA isolated from bananas into a functionalized alignment layer. A biopolymer alignment layer like deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from a banana complexed with a cationic surfactant is an excellent alternative to a commonly used but toxic polyimide alignment layer. DNA-based materials are promising for photonic applications and biosensors because of their excellent optical and physical properties, biodegradability, and low production cost. The novelty of the research lies in the potential use of these materials as biodegradable biopolymer alignment layers for optical devices instead of conventional polymers, which are usually harmful for the environment.</description>

      <title>Breaking better: Imperfections increase fracture resistance in architected lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Architected materials offer unique opportunities to tailor fracture properties through local structural modifications. In this study, we investigate how the failure of architected materials with triangular lattice topology is affected by the removal of individual struts, which represent well-controlled and localized imperfections. Using a combination of macroscopic mechanical testing and digital image correlation (DIC), we analyze both global response and local crack propagation. We observe that the designed imperfections do not alter the failure initiation site nor the peak tensile load but significantly increase the work to failure. DIC-based tracking reveals that this increase correlates with deviations in the crack path and may also involve mechanisms such as crack bridging or temporary pinning near defects. These results demonstrate that small, well-characterized imperfections, when properly mastered, can be harnessed to improve failure resistance and expand the design space of architected materials beyond regular, periodic structures.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced spectral diffusion of T centers in silicon nanophotonic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color centers in silicon are emerging as spin-photon interfaces operating at telecommunication wavelengths. The nanophotonic device integration of silicon color centers via ion implantation leads to significant optical linewidth broadening, which makes indistinguishable photon generation challenging. Here, we study the optical spectral diffusion of T centers in a silicon photonic crystal cavity. We investigate the linewidth broadening timescales and origins by measuring the temporal correlations of the resonance frequency under different conditions. Spectral hole burning measurements reveal no spectral broadening at short timescales from 102 ns to 725 ns. We probe broadening at longer timescales using a check pulse to herald the T center frequency and a probe pulse to measure frequency after a wait time. The optical resonance frequency is stable up to 3 ms in the dark. Laser pulses below the silicon band gap applied during the wait time leads to linewidth broadening. Our observations establish laser-induced processes as the dominant spectral diffusion mechanism for T centers in devices, and inform materials and feedback strategies for indistinguishable photon generation.</description>

      <title>Magnetic order and physical properties of the Kagome metal UNb$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $RM_6X_6$ family of materials ($R$ = rare-earth, $M$ = transition metal, $X$ = Ga, Si, Ge, Sn) produces an array of emergent phenomena, such as charge density waves, intrinsic Hall effects, and complex magnetic order, due to its Kagome net of transition metal atoms, its local-moment magnetic anisotropies, and its extensive chemical tunability. Here, we report a new ``166" material containing both an actinide (uranium) and a 4$d$ transition metal (niobium) to investigate the properties of a 5$f$-4$d$ electron 166 system. UNb$_6$Sn$_6$ crystallizes in the hexagonal $P$6/$mmm$ space group with a small degree of disorder due to shifts in the size of the CoSn-like cages along the $c$ axis. Upon cooling at zero magnetic field, the material undergoes two magnetic phase transitions at $T_\mathrm{2}$ = 46 K and $T_\mathrm{N}$ = 43 K. The low-temperature, zero-field phase is an antiferromagnet with ordered uranium moments and a $\textbf{k}$=(0,0,1/2) propagation vector determined by neutron diffraction. Remarkably, with a magnetic field applied along the $c$ axis, five additional magnetic transitions occur, evidenced by magnetization and resistivity data, before the moment saturates at 2.62 ${\mu}_{\mathrm{B}}$/U at 2 K and $\ge$13.6 T. In two magnetic phase regions, the Hall resistivity of UNb$_6$Sn$_6$ significantly deviates from the magnetization, suggesting that the phases have a large Berry curvature or a change in the Fermi surface. The unknown magnetic ordering of the field-dependent phases of UNb$_6$Sn$_6$ demonstrates the complexity of the 5$f$-4$d$ 166 system and encourages further study of its properties.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Discharge Inhibition in n-Butane Oxidation: Two-Component BaTiO3 and Mn-Cu Mixed Oxide Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A twin surface dielectric barrier discharge on the microsecond scale was used in combination with a two-component coating to oxidize 300 ppm n-butane as a model volatile organic compound to CO2 and H2O in synthetic air at room temperature and at 160 {\deg}C. The integration of BaTiO3 as a base material for the coating allowed the successful use of otherwise discharge-ignition-inhibiting materials such as MnO2-CuO applied as a full coating. Application of pure BaTiO3 led to highly porous coatings that do not hinder the discharge ignition and show a negligible influence on n-butane conversion while reducing byproduct formation. Thus, BaTiO3 was identified as a suitable structure-directing agent in two-component coatings, using 1:1 and 1:2 ratios of BaTiO3:catalyst coatings. Coated electrode configurations were compared to their respective uncoated state to highlight the coating-induced changes. The two-component coatings strongly increased the CO2 selectivity, reaching a maximum of 91.6 % at an energy density of 450 J/L and 160 {\deg}C for the 1:2 ratio, corresponding to an increase of 51.0 % relative to the uncoated electrode.</description>

      <title>Strongly confined Mid-infrared to Terahertz Phonon Polaritons in Ultra-thin SrTiO3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) have emerged as a promising platform for subwavelength optical manipulation, offering distinct advantages for applications in infrared sensing, imaging, and optoelectronic devices. However, the narrow Reststrahlen bands of conventional polar materials impose significant limitations on their applications across the mid-infrared (MIR) to terahertz (THz) range. Addressing this challenge requires the development of materials capable of supporting SPhPs with broad spectral range, strong field confinement, slow group velocity, and high quality factor. Here, using monochromatic electron energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope, we demonstrate that ultra-thin SrTiO3 membranes encompass the exceptional properties mentioned above that have long been sought after. Systematic measurements across varying membrane thicknesses reveal two distinct SPhP branches characterized by wide spectral dispersion, high field confinement, and anomalously slow group velocities spanning from the MIR (68 ~ 99 meV) to THz (12 ~ 59 meV) range. Notably, in membranes approaching ~ 3 nm thickness (~ 8 unit cells), these polaritons exhibit unprecedented confinement factors exceeding 500 and group velocities as low as ~ 7 * 10-5 c, rivaling the best-performing van der Waals materials. These findings establish perovskite oxide such as SrTiO3 as a versatile platform for tailoring light-matter interactions at the nanoscale, providing critical insights for the design of next-generation photonic devices requiring broadband operation and enhanced optical confinement.</description>

      <title>MatWheel: Addressing Data Scarcity in Materials Science Through Synthetic Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data scarcity and the high cost of annotation have long been persistent challenges in the field of materials science. Inspired by its potential in other fields like computer vision, we propose the MatWheel framework, which train the material property prediction model using the synthetic data generated by the conditional generative model. We explore two scenarios: fully-supervised and semi-supervised learning. Using CGCNN for property prediction and Con-CDVAE as the conditional generative model, experiments on two data-scarce material property datasets from Matminer database are conducted. Results show that synthetic data has potential in extreme data-scarce scenarios, achieving performance close to or exceeding that of real samples in all two tasks. We also find that pseudo-labels have little impact on generated data quality. Future work will integrate advanced models and optimize generation conditions to boost the effectiveness of the materials data flywheel.</description>

      <title>Stability diagram of layer-polarized quantum Hall states in twisted trilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the twisted trilayer graphene (tTLG) platform, the rich beating patterns between the three graphene layers give rise to a plethora of new length scales and reconstructed electronic bands arising from the emergent moir\'e and moir\'e-of-moir\'e superlattices. The co-existing lattices and superlattices interact and compete with each other to determine the overall transport properties of tTLG, the hierarchy of which can be electrostatically controlled by tuning the out-of-plane charge distribution or layer polarization. In this work, we measure the stability diagram of layer-polarized quantum Hall states in tTLG by systematically mapping out layer-specific Chern numbers in each layer, and intra- and interlayer Chern transitions as a function of displacement field D and total carrier density n. In contrast to twisted bilayer systems, the rich interplay between the three atomic layers gives rise to a complex layer-polarized stability diagram with unconventional transport features that evolve rapidly with electric and magnetic fields. The stability diagram quantitatively characterizes the interlayer screening and charge distribution in tTLG with implication of strong inter-atomic-layer Coulomb coupling. Our work provides comprehensive guidance and insights into predicting and controlling layer-polarization and interlayer transitions in tTLG, and for tuning the individual role and interactions of each participating constituent towards novel material properties.</description>

      <title>Stiffness, strength, energy dissipation and reusability in heterogeneous architected polycrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design, fabricate and test heterogeneous architected polycrystals, composed of hard plastomers and soft elastomers, which thus show outstanding mechanical resilience and energy dissipation simultaneously. Grain boundaries that separate randomly oriented single crystalline grains is carefully designed, first enabling coherent connectivity and strength in the grain boundary regions throughout the polycrystalline network. By combining experiments and numerical simulations on 3D-printed prototypes, we show that the interplay between grain interiors and grain boundaries is responsible for the grain-size effects emerging in these architected materials, analogous to those in their atomic or metallic counterparts. Furthermore, direct visualization of inter- and intra-grain deformation and failure mechanisms at the macroscopic scale reveals that crystallographic texture throughout the polycrystalline aggregates plays a fundamental role in the key mechanical features in our new heterogeneous polycrystals. Our results show that the engineered grain boundary and crystallographic texture not only modify the highly resilient yet dissipative global responses but also critically influence reusability in this new class of architected materials.</description>

      <title>Giant and anisotropic magnetostriction in $\beta$-O$_{2}$ at 110 T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetostriction is a crystal's deformation under magnetic fields, usually in the range of $10^{-6}$ - $10^{-3}$, where the lattice change occurs with the change of spin and orbital state through spin-lattice couplings. In strong magnetic fields beyond 100 T, the significant Zeeman energy competes with the lattice interactions, where one can expect considerable magnetostriction. However, directly observing magnetostriction above 100 T is challenging, because generating magnetic fields beyond 100 T accompanies the destruction of the coil with a single-shot $\mu$-second pulse. Here, we observed the giant and anisotropic magnetostriction of $\sim$1 % at 110 T in the spin-controlled crystal of $\beta$-O$_{2}$, by combining the single-shot diffraction of x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) and the state-of-the-art portable 100 T generator. The magnetostriction of $\sim$1 % is the largest class as a deformation of the unit cell. It is a response of the soft lattice of $\beta$-O$_{2}$ originating, not only in the competing van der Waals force and exchange interaction, but also the soft state of spin and lattice frustrated on the triangular network. Meanwhile, the anisotropy originates from the strong two-dimensionality of the spin system. Giant magnetostriction in crystals should become more ubiquitous and diverse beyond 100 T, where our XFEL experiment above 100 T opens a novel pathway for their exploration, providing fundamental insights into the roles of spin in stabilizing crystal structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the internal structure of self-gravitating solid and liquid bodies presents a challenge, as existing approaches are often limited to either overly simplistic constant-density approximations or more complex numerical equations of state. We present a detailed analysis of a tractable and physically motivated model for perfectly elastic, spherically symmetric self-gravitating bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium. The model employs a logarithmic equation of state (logotropic EOS) with a non-zero initial density and constant bulk modulus. Importantly, scaling properties of the model allow all solutions to be derived from a single, universal solution of an ordinary differential equation, resembling the Lane-Emden and Chandrasekhar models. The model provides new insights into stability issues and reveals oscillatory asymptotic behavior in the mass-radius relation, including the existence of both a maximum mass and a maximum radius. We derive useful, simple analytical approximations for key properties, such as central overdensity, moment of inertia, binding energy, and gravitational potential, applicable to small, metallic bodies like asteroids and moons. These new approximations could aid future research, including space mining and the scientific characterization of small Solar System bodies.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbital Intertwined Topological Superconductivity in a Class of Correlated Noncentrosymmetric Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose an alternative route to achieving topological superconductivity (TSC). Our approach applies to a new class of correlated noncentrosymmetric materials that host two spin-split Fermi surfaces with identical spin textures due to a spin-orbital intertwined effect. Incorporating multi-orbital repulsive Hubbard interactions, we calculate the superconducting pairings of a minimal two-orbital effective model within a spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity framework. We find that, depending on the effective Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) strength and filling level, the Hubbard interaction can drive the leading pairing symmetry into the $A_1(S_{\pm})$, $B_1$, $B_2$ or $B_2(d_{\pm})$ irreducible representations (IRs) of the $C_{4v}$ point group. Notably, the $A_1(S_{\pm})$ pairing gives rise to a fully gapped TSC characterized by a $Z_2$ invariant, while the $B_2(d_{\pm})$ pairing results in a nodal TSC. Our analysis reveals that the fully gapped TSC is predominated by spin-singlet regardless of the presence of the spin-triplet components. This distinguishes our model from noncentrosymmetric materials with conventional Rashba-split band structures, where TSC typically emerges near the van Hove singularity and is primarily driven by $p$-wave or $f$-wave spin-triplet pairing. These features enhances its experimental accessibility, and we discuss potential experimental systems for its realization.</description>

      <title>Overcoming light scattering with high optical nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving high-resolution optical imaging deep within heterogeneous and scattering media remains a fundamental challenge in biological microscopy, where conventional techniques are hindered by multiple light scattering and absorption. Here, we present a non-invasive imaging approach that harnesses the nonlinear response of luminescent labels in conjunction with the statistical and spatial properties of speckle patterns - an effect of random light interference. Using avalanching nanoparticles (ANPs) with strong photoluminescence nonlinearity, we demonstrate that random speckle illumination can be converted into a single, localized, sub-diffraction excitation spot. This spot can be scanned across the sample using the angular memory effect, enabling high-resolution imaging through a scattering layer. Our method is general, fast, and cost-effective. It requires no wavefront shaping, no feedback, and no reconstruction algorithm, offering a powerful new route to deep, high-resolution imaging through complex media.</description>

      <title>AC Current-Driven Magnetization Switching and Nonlinear Hall Rectification in a Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque arising from the spin-orbit-coupled surface states of topological insulators enables current-induced control of magnetization with high efficiency. Here, alternating-current (AC) driven magnetization reversal is demonstrated in a semi-magnetic topological insulator (Cr,Bi,Sb)2Te3/(Bi,Sb)2Te3, facilitated by a low threshold current density of 1.5x10^9 A/m^2. Time-domain Hall voltage measurements using an oscilloscope reveal a strongly nonlinear and nonreciprocal Hall response during the magnetization reversal process. Fourier analysis of the time-varying Hall voltage identifies higher-harmonic signals and a rectified direct-current (DC) component, highlighting the complex interplay among the applied current, external magnetic field, and magnetization dynamics. Furthermore, a hysteretic behavior in the current-voltage characteristics gives rise to frequency mixing under dual-frequency excitation. This effect, distinct from conventional polynomial-based nonlinearities, allows for selective extraction of specific frequency components. The results demonstrate that AC excitation can not only switch magnetization efficiently but also induce tunable nonlinear responses, offering a new pathway for multifunctional spintronic devices with potential applications in energy-efficient memory, signal processing, and frequency conversion.</description>

      <title>Donor-Acceptor Pairs near Silicon Carbide surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Donor-acceptor pairs (DAPs) in wide-bandgap semiconductors are promising platforms for the realization of quantum technologies, due to their optically controllable, long-range dipolar interactions. Specifically, Al-N DAPs in bulk silicon carbide (SiC) have been predicted to enable coherent coupling over distances exceeding 10 nm. However, their practical implementations require an understanding of the properties of these pairs near surfaces and interfaces. Here, using first principles calculations we investigate how the presence of surfaces influence the stability and optical properties of Al-N DAPs in SiC, and we show that they retain favorable optical properties comparable to their bulk counterparts, despite a slight increase in electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of surface-defect pairs (SDPs), where an electron-hole pair is generated between a near-surface defect and an occupied surface state located in the bandgap of the material. We show that vanadium-based SDPs near OH-terminated 4H-SiC surfaces exhibit dipoles naturally aligned perpendicular to the surface, greatly enhancing dipole-dipole coupling between SDPs. Our results also reveal significant polarization-dependent modulation in the stimulated emission and photoionization cross sections of V-based SDPs, which are tunable by two orders of magnitude via the polarization angle of the incident laser light. The near-surface defects investigated here provide novel possibilities for the development of hybrid quantum-classical interfaces, as they can be used to mediate information transfer between quantum nodes and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

Abstract: Heterogeneous materials exhibit anisotropy which is influenced by factors such as individual phase properties and microstructural configuration that form crucial descriptors of heterogeneity. A review of anisotropy indices proposed in the context of single crystals reveals that they do not account for the descriptors of heterogeneity limiting their utility in heterogeneous materials. To address this shortcoming, this work presents a novel approach to quantify elastic anisotropy in heterogeneous materials utilizing their effective elastic properties. Anisotropy quantification has been demonstrated considering two phase composite materials highlighting the crucial role of constituent volume fractions, secondary phase shape, and elastic contrast in influencing the extent of anisotropy. Additionally, specific material and microstructural descriptors leading to overall isotropy in composite materials are validated and an extension of the approach to account for defects such as porosity and cracks is presented. The presented results demonstrate the applicability of the anisotropy quantification approach to any configuration of heterogeneous materials.</description>

Abstract: Electron-phonon interactions in solids are crucial for understanding many interesting phenomena, such as conventional superconductivity, temperature-dependent band-gap renormalization, and polarons. For harmonic materials, the linear interaction of one electron with one phonon is sufficient to quantitatively describe these properties. However, in anharmonic materials such as quantum paraelectrics, halide perovskites, and high-pressure hydrides, the nonlinear electron-phonon interactions may play an important role. Currently, the only available Hamiltonians for nonlinear electron-phonon interaction are model Hamiltonians, written in terms of phenomenological parameters. Here, we present a microscopic theory for long-range nonlinear electron-phonon interactions, which can be combined with first-principles calculations. We provide a semi-analytical expression for the long-range part of the 1-electron-2-phonon matrix element. We show that in contrast to the long-range 1-electron-1-phonon interaction, the continuum approximation is not sufficient and the entire phonon dispersion must be taken into account. Additionally, we show that the quasiparticle energies can be written in terms of a 1-electron-2-phonon spectral function. To demonstrate the method, we calculate the 1-electron-2-phonon spectral function for LiF and KTaO$_3$ from first principles. Our framework is a step forward toward complete first-principles calculations of nonlinear electron-phonon interactions in solids.</description>

Abstract: Describing electron-phonon interactions in a solid requires knowledge of the electron-phonon matrix elements in the Hamiltonian. State-of-the-art first-principles calculations for the electron-phonon interaction are limited to the 1-electron-1-phonon matrix element, which is suitable for harmonic materials. However, there is no first-principles theory for 1-electron-2-phonon interactions, which occur in anharmonic materials with significant electron-phonon interaction such as halide perovskites and quantum paraelectrics. Here, we derive an analytical expression for the long-range part of the 1-electron-2-phonon matrix element, written in terms of microscopic quantities that can be calculated from first principles. We show that the long-range 1-electron-2-phonon interaction is described by the derivative of the phonon dynamical matrix with respect to an external electric field. We calculate the quasiparticle energy of a large polaron including 1-electron-2-phonon interaction, and show that it can be written in terms of a 1-electron-2-phonon spectral function $\mathcal{T}_{\alpha \beta}(\omega)$. We demonstrate how to calculate this spectral function and its temperature dependence for the benchmark materials LiF and KTaO$_3$. The first-principles framework developed in this article is general, paving the way for future calculations of 1-electron-2-phonon interactions from first principles.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic signatures of magnetization-induced band renormalization and strong spin-charge-lattice coupling in EuZn$_2$As$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an infrared spectroscopy study of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator EuZn$_2$As$_2$ over a broad frequency range, spanning temperatures both above and below the AFM transition $T_{\rm N} \simeq$ 20 K. The optical response reveals an insulating behavior, featuring two prominent infrared-active phonon modes at around 95 and 190 cm$^{-1}$, and two subtle absorption peaks at around 130 ($\alpha$ peak) and 2700 cm$^{-1}$ ($\beta$ peak), along with a strong absorption edge rising around 9000 cm$^{-1}$ ($\gamma$ peak). Significantly, the temperature-dependent changes in these peaks show noticeable anomalies across the AFM transition, particularly the emergence of the $\alpha$ peak and an unusual redshift of the $\gamma$ peak, suggesting a strong interaction between the charge excitations and the AFM order. Band structure calculations reveal that these anomalies arise from magnetization-induced band renormalizations, including shifts and foldings. Additionally, both phonon modes feature asymmetric Fano line shapes at low temperatures, with the 95 cm$^{-1}$ phonon mode exhibiting strong coupling to the fluctuations of Eu spins. These findings highlight a complex interplay of spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom in EuZn$_2$As$_2$.</description>

      <title>Two-fluid mobility model from coupled hydrodynamic equations for simulating laser-driven semiconductor switches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a two-fluid mobility model incorporating fundamental aspects of electron-hole (e-h) scattering such as momentum conservation for simulating laser-driven semiconductor switches (LDSSs). Compared to previous works that use Matthiessen's rule, the two-fluid mobility model predicts distinct AC responses of e-h plasmas in semiconductors. Based on the two-fluid mobility model, we develop a theory with very few adjustable parameters for simulating the switching performance of LDSSs based on high-purity indirect-gap semiconductors such as silicon (Si). As a prototypical application, we successfully reproduce experimentally measured reflectance at around 320 GHz in a laser-driven Si switch. By injecting e-h plasmas with densities up to $10^{20}\,\rm cm^{-3}$, we reveal the importance of carrier-screening effects in e-h scattering and Auger recombination for carrier densities above the critical carrier density for exciton-plasma Mott transition. Our results also suggest a way to characterize the intrinsic momentum-relaxation mechanism, e-h scattering, and the intrinsic e-h recombination mechanism in indirect-gap semiconductors, Auger recombination. We reassess the ambipolar Auger coefficient of high-purity Si with high injection levels of e-h plasmas up to $10^{20}\,\rm cm^{-3}$ and find a minimal value of $1.8\times10^{-41}\,{\rm cm^6/ns}$. The value is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the ambipolar Auger coefficient widely used for simulating LDSSs, $3.8\times10^{-40}\,{\rm cm^6/ns}$, which was deduced from minority-carrier lifetime in highly doped silicon more than four decades ago.</description>

Abstract: Rare-earth ions doped in crystals with low nuclear-spin densities are highly promising candidates for quantum technology applications. In this study, we investigated the spectroscopic properties of the 7F0 - 5 D0 optical and the hyperfine transitions of Eu3+ ions in a CaWO4 crystal, where the nuclear spin arises solely from the 183W isotope, with a natural abundance of 14%. At a temperature of 3 K, we experimentally identified four distinct crystal field environments for Eu3+ ions in a 0.1 at.% Eu3+ doped CaWO4 crystal. The optical coherence properties of Eu3+ ions in these environments were characterized. Additionally, we resolved the hyperfine structures in the 7F0 ground state and 5D0 excited state, and determined the 7F0 ground state lifetimes using spectral hole-burning techniques. These findings highlight the significant potential of Eu3+:CaWO4 for optical quantum memory applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization; equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescale. This is due to their identical local electronic structures guided by the underlying symmetries. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization dynamics of identical sublattices in the d-wave compensated altermagnet RuO2, resulting in a photo-induced ferrimagnetic state with a net moment of ~0.2 {\mu}B per unit cell. This metastable magnetization is highly controllable; depends on the direction of the linear polarized laser. We identify the underlying mechanism as an anisotropic optical-induced intersite spin transfer (a-OISTR) effect, originating from the momentum-dependent spin splitting unique to altermagnets. This a-OISTR effect enables the polarization of light to drive direction-selective transient spin-dependent currents between sublattices, leading to a controllable ultrafast magnetic state transition in AM. These findings uncover novel laser-driven pathways to control magnetic order in altermagnets, enabling a phase transition from AM to ferrimagnetic state.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets, which exhibit spin-split electronic bands without net magnetization, provide an appealing platform for exploring unconventional spin and ferroic physics. Through symmetry analyses and first-principles calculations, we show that monolayer \(\mathrm{VOX_2}\) (\(\mathrm{X = Cl, Br, I}\)) is a two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric altermagnet (FEAM). The spin splitting in its electronic band structure can be precisely tuned by ferroelectric polarization and magnetic order, accompanied by a giant magnetoelectric coupling coefficient. Owing to the absence of inversion symmetry, this material also exhibits pronounced nonlinear optical responses. The altermagnetic \(\mathrm{VOI_2}\) monolayer show an exceptionally large spin shift current of up to \(330.072\,\mu\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{V}^2\), which is switchable by reversing the magnetic order. These results uncover a strong interplay between magnetic and ferroelectric orders, offering a route toward electrically and magnetically tunable nonlinear spin photocurrents in 2D multiferroic systems.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the large time-reversal-odd ($\mathcal{T}$-odd) spin current generated by the non-relativistic altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) has demonstrated significant potential for spintronic applications, with both computational and experimental validations. However, considering the broad application prospects and the scarcity of conductive altermagnetic materials, the development of novel reliable methods for inducing altermagnetism is necessary. Here, strain engineering is proposed as a simple yet effective approach. This work focuses on $\mathrm{OsO}_2$--the $5d$ counterpart of $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ sharing the rutile structure--employing $ab~initio$ calculations to systematically investigate strain effects on its ASSE. We find that applying a minor equibiaxial tensile strain $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ to $\mathrm{OsO}_2$ can induce a transition from non-magnetic to altermagnetic states. Only $3\%$ $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{ts}}$ is required to achieve a spin-charge conversion ratio ($\theta_{\text{AS}}$) of $\sim7\%$ for the $\mathcal{T}$-odd spin current generated by ASSE, far exceeding the intrinsic spin Hall angle $\theta_{\text{IS}}$ produced by the conventional spin Hall effect (CSHE). Calculations reveal that substantial $\theta_{\text{AS}}$ persists even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, with its magnitude positively correlating to non-relativistic spin splitting magnitude, which further confirms the strain-induced ASSE's non-relativistic origin. Further calculations reveal that $\mathrm{RuO}_2$ exhibits analogous phenomena, which may resolve recent controversies regarding its magnetic properties. Our research opens new simple pathways for developing next-generation altermagnetic spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Computing ternary liquid phase diagrams: Fe-Cu-Ni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the phase separation of the immiscible liquid alloy Fe-Cu-Ni. Our computational approach uses a virtual semigrand canonical Widom approach to determine differences in excess chemical potentials between different species. Using an embedded atom potential for Fe-Cu-Ni, we simulate liquid states over a range of compositions and temperatures. This raw data is then fit to Redlich-Kister polynomials for the Gibbs free energy with a simple temperature dependence. Using the analytic form, we can determine the phase diagram for the ternary liquid, compute the miscibility gap and spinodal decomposition as a function of temperature for this EAM potential. In addition, we compute density as a function of composition and temperature, and predict pair correlation functions. We use static structure factors to estimate the second derivative of the Gibbs free energy (the $S^0$ method) and compare with our fit Gibbs free energy. Finally, using a nonequilibrium Hamiltonian integration method, we separately compute absolute Gibbs free energies for the pure liquid states; this shows that our endpoints are accurate to within 1 meV for our ternary Gibbs free energy, as well as the absolute Gibbs free energy for the ternary liquid.</description>

      <title>Dome-like pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NaNiO$_2$ is a Ni$^{3+}$-containing layered material consisting of alternating triangular networks of Ni and Na cations, separated by octahedrally-coordinated O anions. At ambient pressure, it features a collinear Jahn--Teller distortion below $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}\approx480$ K, which disappears in a first-order transition on heating to $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{end}\approx500$ K, corresponding to the increase in symmetry from monoclinic to rhombohedral. It was previously studied by variable-pressure neutron diffraction [ACS Inorganic Chemistry 61.10 (2022): 4312-4321] and found to exhibit an increasing $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$ with pressure up to ~5 GPa. In this work, powdered NaNiO$_2$ was studied via variable-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction up to pressures of ~67 GPa at 294 K and 403 K. Suppression of the collinear Jahn--Teller ordering is observed via the emergence of a high-symmetry rhombohedral phase, with the onset pressure occurring at ~18 GPa at both studied temperatures. Further, a discontinuous decrease in unit cell volume is observed on transitioning from the monoclinic to the rhombohedral phase. These results taken together suggest that in the vicinity of the transition, application of pressure causes the Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$, to decrease rapidly. We conclude that the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$ is dome-like.</description>

      <title>High-Yield Assembly of Plasmon-Coupled Nanodiamonds via DNA Origami for Tailored Emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling the spatial arrangement of optically active elements is crucial for the advancement of engineered photonic systems. Color centers in nanodiamond offer unique advantages for quantum sensing and information processing; however, their integration into complex optical architectures is limited by challenges in precise and reproducible positioning, as well as efficient coupling. DNA origami provides an elegant solution, as demonstrated by recent studies showcasing nanoscale positioning of fluorescent nanodiamonds and plasmonic gold nanoparticles. Here, we present a scalable and robust method for covalently functionalizing nanodiamonds with DNA, enabling high-yield, spatially controlled assembly of diamond and gold nanoparticles onto DNA origami. By precisely controlling the interparticle spacing, we reveal distance-dependent modulation of NV center photoluminescence with a 10-fold increase in the fastest decay pathway at short interparticle distances. Our findings indicate selective plasmon-driven effects and interplay between radiative and non-radiative processes. This work overcomes key limitations in current nanodiamond assembly strategies and provides insights into engineering NV photoluminescence by plasmonic coupling that advance toward quantum photonic and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing TiFe Alloy Activation for Hydrogen Storage Through Al, Cr, Co, and Cu Substitutions as a Step Towards Future Recycling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the activation behavior of $TiFe_{0.80}$-$X_{0.20}$ (X = Co, Cu, Cr, Al) alloys to identify the most effective materials for producing hydrogen storage alloys from recycled sources in view of a circular economy perspective. Activation was tested using two methods: a Sievert Volumetric Apparatus at room temperature and 64 bar of hydrogen, and high-pressure differential scanning calorimetry with 50 bar hydrogen under thermal cycles up to 400 {\deg}C. Activation properties were analyzed by assessing time for incubation and for full charging, that are influenced, respectively, by surface and bulk diffusion of hydrogen. Results showed that Cr-substituted alloys are rapidly activated, due to the presence of $TiCr_{2}$ compound, while Al-containing alloys absorbed hydrogen immediately. In contrast, Co- and Cu-substituted alloys required extended activation times, due to less quantity of secondary phases and limited diffusion channels.</description>

      <title>The dynamical role of optical phonons and sub-lattice screening in a solid-state ion conductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) require ionic conductivities that are competitive with liquid electrolytes to realize applications in all-solid state batteries. Although numerous materials have been discovered, the underlying mechanisms enabling superionic conduction remain elusive. In particular, the role of ultrafast lattice dynamics in mediating ion migration, which involves couplings between ions, phonons, and electrons, is rarely explored experimentally at their corresponding timescales. To investigate the contributions of coupled lattice dynamics on ion migration, we modulate the charge density occupations within the crystal, and then measure the time-resolved change in impedance on picosecond timescales for a candidate SSE, Li0.5La0.5TiO3. Upon perturbation, we observe enhanced ion migration at ultrafast timescales that are shorter than laser-induced heating. The respective transients match the timescales of optical and acoustic phonon vibrations, suggesting their involvement in ion migration. We further computationally evaluate the effect of a charge transfer from the O 2p to Ti 3d band on the electronic and physical structure of LLTO. We hypothesize that the charge transfer excitation distorts the TiO6 polyhedra by altering the local charge density occupancy of the hopping site at the migration pathway saddle point, thereby causing a reduction in the migration barrier for the Li+ hop, shown using computation. We rule out the contribution of photogenerated electrons and laser heating. Overall, our investigation introduces a new spectroscopic tool to probe fundamental ion hopping mechanisms transiently at ultrafast timescales, which has previously only been achieved in a time-averaged manner or solely via computational methods. Our proposed technique expands our capability to answer dynamical questions previously limited by incumbent spectroscopic strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characterization of deep levels in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures is one of the most important problems in GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) technology. This work reports on a technique for determination of deep level concentration in AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures. The proposed method is relatively simple, and it is based on the detection of free holes created by optically induced transitions of electrons from the deep levels to the conduction band. The developed method can detect and provide quantitative estimation of deep level traps in a barrier layer of AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures. Furthermore, it provides a framework for analysis of light induced threshold voltage shift, which includes an important experimental criterion of determination whether the holes are generated or not in the AlGaN/GaN HEMT structures by sub-band gap illumination. The method was verified by applications it to a study of the deep levels in GaN HEMTs grown on various substrates, i.e. SiC and GaN.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Waves (PAW): extended resolution of unity method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20171v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) method is based on a linear transformation between the pseudo wavefunctions and the all electron wavefunctions. To obtain high accuracy with this method, it is important that the local part of the linear transform (inside each atomic sphere) be defined over a complete basis set (with deviations from completeness leading to corrections to the total energy not computed within current implementations of PAW). Here we show how to make this basis much closer to complete without significant additional computational work and without modifying the transformation in any significant way thereby making the modifications we propose easy to implement in current electronic structure codes for PAW.. This is done by extending the resolution of unity used for the transform to include more smooth wavefunctions (which have nothing to do with the atomic problem) and having them linearly transform via the identity.</description>

      <title>Preventing overfitting in infrared ellipsometry using temperature dependence: fused silica as a case study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05323v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fitting oscillator models to variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) data can lead to non-unique, unphysical results. We demonstrate using temperature-dependent trends to prevent overfitting and ensure model physicality. As a case study, we performed mid-infrared VASE measurements on fused silica (SiO2) of various grades, from room temperature to 600 {\deg}C. We fitted oscillator models independently at each temperature, and confirmed the model's physical validity by observing the expected monotonic trends in vibrational oscillator parameters. Using this technique, we generated a highly accurate dataset for the temperature-dependent complex refractive index of fused silica for modeling mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of semiconductor thin films that are only a few nanometers thick. In spite of intense research, the thickness-dependent resistivity or conductivity of semiconductor thin films is not understood at a fundamental physical level. We develop a theory based on quantum confinement which yields the dependence of the concentration of intrinsic carriers on the film thickness. The theory predicts that the resistivity $\rho$, in the 1-10 nm thickness range, increases exponentially as $\rho \sim \exp(const/L^{1/2})$ upon decreasing the film thickness $L$. This law is able to reproduce the remarkable increase in resistivity observed experimentally in Si thin films, whereas the effect of surface scattering (Fuchs-Sondheimer theory) alone cannot explain the data when the film thickness is lower than 10 nm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied theoretically the specific heat of a large number of non-frustrated magnetic structures described by the Heisenberg model for systems with total angular momentum $J=7/2$, corresponding to the 4f$^7$ configuration of Gd$^{+3}$ and Eu$^{+2}$. For a given critical temperature (determined by the magnitude of the exchange interactions), we find that, to a high degree of accuracy, the specific heat is governed by two primary parameters: the effective number of neighbors, which dictates the extent of quantum fluctuations, and the axial anisotropy. Using these two parameters we fit the specific heat of four Gd compounds and two Eu compounds, achieving a remarkable agreement. Our work opens the possibility of describing the specific heat of 4f$^7$ systems within a general framework.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the application of Madelung hydrodynamic models to study two-dimensional electron gases, with a focus on nonlocal plasmonics and nonlinear optics. We begin by reviewing the derivation of the Madelung equations. Using the Madelung equations in conjunction with Poisson's equation, we calculate the spectrum of magnetoplasmons and the magneto-optical conductivity in the electrostatic regime, incorporating nonlocal corrections due to the Fermi pressure. In the absence of a magnetic field, we analyze nonlinear and nonlocal second-harmonic generation, demonstrating how plasmon excitation enhances this process. We further discuss the emergence of self-modulation phenomena driven by nonlinearity, leading to the renormalization of the plasmon dispersion. Notably, we show that nonlinearity amplifies nonlocal effects and, leveraging the hydrodynamic formalism, derive a simple analytic expression for the renormalized spectra.</description>

      <title>An accurate and efficient framework for modelling the surface chemistry of ionic materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum-mechanical simulations can offer atomic-level insights into chemical processes on surfaces. This understanding is crucial for the rational design of new solid catalysts as well as materials to store energy and mitigate greenhouse gases. However, achieving the accuracy needed for reliable predictions has proven challenging. Density functional theory (DFT), the workhorse quantum-mechanical method, can often lead to inconsistent predictions, necessitating accurate methods from correlated wave-function theory (cWFT). However, the high computational demands and significant user intervention associated with cWFT have traditionally made it impractical to carry out for surfaces. In this work, we address this challenge, presenting an automated framework which leverages multilevel embedding approaches, to apply accurate cWFT methods to the surfaces of ionic materials with computational costs approaching DFT. With this framework, we have reproduced experimental adsorption enthalpies for a diverse set of 19 adsorbate-surface systems. Moreover, we resolve debates on the adsorption configuration of several systems, while offering benchmarks to assess DFT. This framework is open-source, making it possible to more routinely apply cWFT to complex problems involving the surfaces of ionic materials.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the secondary low-energy electron emission induced by inelastic electron scattering from graphene and layered materials thereof. By applying a coincidence detection of the primary scattered and the emitted secondary electron we unravel pronounced resonance features otherwise overshadowed by the largely structureless secondary electron energy distribution. Supported by density functional theory calculations we show that these structures are the signature of prominent Feshbach resonances above the vacuum threshold which originate from interlayer states acting as a doorway state for electron emission. Remarkably, some of these doorway states open up only for samples with more than 5 layers.</description>

      <title>Bulk superconductivity in pressurized trilayer nickelate Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer and trilayer nickelates has generated significant interest. However, their superconducting properties are often dependent on sample quality and pressure conditions, complicating the interpretation of the underlying physics. Finding new systems with optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for advancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response below Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.</description>

      <title>Spin-Phonon Relaxation of Boron-Vacancy Centers in Two-Dimensional Boron Nitride Polytypes</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials hosting color centers and spin defects are emerging as key platforms for quantum technologies. However, the impact of reduced dimensionality on the spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) of embedded defect spins -- critical for quantum applications -- remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_{\text{B}}^-$) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA$^\prime$-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the $T_1$ times of V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN opening additional spin relaxation channels, V$_{\text{B}}^-$ exhibits a longer $T_1$ compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength. These findings suggest that V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in rBN offers enhanced spin coherence properties, making it a promising candidate for quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>Lifetime-limited Gigahertz-frequency Mechanical Oscillators with Millisecond Coherence Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07523</link>

Abstract: High-frequency mechanical oscillators with long coherence times are essential to realizing a variety of high-fidelity quantum sensors, transducers, and memories. However, the unprecedented coherence times needed for quantum applications require exquisitely sensitive new techniques to probe the material origins of phonon decoherence and new strategies to mitigate decoherence in mechanical oscillators. Here, we combine non-invasive laser spectroscopy techniques with materials analysis to identify key sources of phonon decoherence in crystalline media. Using micro-fabricated high-overtone bulk acoustic-wave resonators ($\mu$HBARs) as an experimental testbed, we identify phonon-surface interactions as the dominant source of phonon decoherence in crystalline quartz; lattice distortion, subsurface damage, and high concentration of elemental impurities near the crystal surface are identified as the likely causes. Removal of this compromised surface layer using an optimized polishing process is seen to greatly enhance coherence times, enabling $\mu$HBARs with Q-factors of &gt; 240 million at 12 GHz frequencies, corresponding to &gt; 6 ms phonon coherence times and record-level f-Q products. Complementary phonon linewidth and time-domain ringdown measurements, performed using a new Brillouin-based pump-probe spectroscopy technique, reveal negligible dephasing within these oscillators. Building on these results, we identify a path to &gt; 100 ms coherence times as the basis for high-frequency quantum memories. These findings clearly demonstrate that, with enhanced control over surfaces, dissipation and noise can be significantly reduced in a wide range of quantum systems.</description>
