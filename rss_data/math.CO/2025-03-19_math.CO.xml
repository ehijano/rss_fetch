      <title>Counting of lattices containing up to five comparable reducible elements and having nullity up to three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2020 Bhavale and Waphare introduced the concept of a nullity of a poset as nullity of its cover graph. In 2003 Pawar and Waphare counted all non-isomorphic lattices on n elements and n edges, which are precisely lattices of nullity one. In 2002 Thakare et al. counted all non-isomorphic lattices on n elements containing two reducible elements. In the same paper, Thakare et al. counted lattices on n elements containing up to n+1 edges, which are precisely lattices of nullity up to two. In 2024 Bhavale and Aware counted all non-isomorphic lattices on n elements, containing up to three reducible elements. Recently, Aware and Bhavale counted all non-isomorphic lattices on n elements, containing four comparable reducible elements, and having nullity three. In this paper, we count up to isomorphism the class of all lattices on n elements containing five comparable reducible elements, and having nullity three.</description>

      <title>Symmetric 2-(35,17,8) designs with an automorphism of order 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The largest prime p that can be the order of an automorphism of a 2-(35,17,8) design is p=17, and all 2-(35,17,8) designs with an automorphism of order 17 were classified by Tonchev. The symmetric 2-(35,17,8) designs with automorphisms of odd prime order $p&lt;17$ were also classified. In this paper we give the classification of all symmetric 2-(35,17,8) designs that admit an automorphism of order $p=2$. It is shown that there are exactly $11,642,495$ nonisomorphic such designs. Furthermore, it is shown that the number of nonisomorphic 3-(36,18,8) designs which have at least one derived 2-$(35,17,8)$ design with an automorphism of order 2, is $1,015,225$.</description>

      <title>Hermitian adjacency matrices with at most three distinct eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study oriented graphs whose Hermitian adjacency matrices of the second kind have few eigenvalues. We give a complete characterization of the oriented graphs with two distinct eigenvalues, showing that there are only four such graphs. We show that there are infinitely many regular tournaments with three distinct eigenvalues. We extend our main results to Hermitian adjacency matrices defined over other roots of unity.</description>

      <title>Reliability Evaluation of Generalized $K_4$-Hypercubes Based on Five Link Fault Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the scale of data centers continues to grow, there is an increasing demand for interconnection networks to resist malicious attacks. Hence, it is necessary to evaluate the reliability of networks under various fault patterns. The family of generalized $K_4$-hypercubes serve as interconnection networks of data centers, characterized by topological structures with exceptional properties. The $h$-extra edge-connectivity $\lambda_h$, the $l$-super edge-connectivity $\lambda^l$, the $l$-average degree edge-connectivity $\overline{\lambda^l}$, the $l$-embedded edge-connectivity $\eta_l$ and the cyclic edge-connectivity $\lambda_c$ are vital parameters to accurately assess the reliability of interconnection networks. Let integer $n\geq3$. This paper obtains the optimal solution of the edge isoperimetric problem and its explicit representation, which offers an upper bound of the $h$-extra edge-connectivity of an $n$-dimensional $K_4$-hypercube $H_n^4$. As an application, we presents $\lambda_h(H_n^4)$ for $1\leq h\leq 2^{\lceil n/2 \rceil }$. Moreover, for $2^{\lceil n/2\rceil+t}-g_t \le h\le2^{\lceil n/2\rceil+t}$, $g_t=\lceil(2^{2t+2+\gamma})/3\rceil$,
  $0\leq t \leq\lfloor n/2\rfloor-1 $, $\gamma=0$ for even $n$ and $\gamma=1$ for odd $n$, $\lambda_h(H_n^4)$ is a constant $(\lfloor n/2\rfloor-t)2^{\lceil n/2\rceil+t}$. The above lower and upper bounds of the integer $h$ are both sharp. Furthermore, $\lambda^l(H_n^4)$, $\overline{\lambda^l}(H_n^4)$, $\lambda_{2^l}(H_n^4)$, and $\eta_l(H_n^4)$ share a common value $(n-l)2^l$ for $2\leq l\leq n-1$, and we determines the values of $\lambda_c(H_n^4)$.</description>

      <title>Strongly regular generalized partial geometries and associated LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce strongly regular generalized partial geometries of grade $r$, which generalise partial geometries and strongly regular $(\alpha,\beta)$-geometries. By the properties of quadrics in PG$(2,q)$ and PG$(3,q)$, we construct two classes of strongly regular generalized partial geometries of grade $3$. Besides, we define low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes by considering the combinatorial structures of strongly regular generalized partial geometries and derive bounds on minimum distance, dimension and girth for the LDPC codes.</description>

      <title>The Hierarchy of Saturating Matching Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study three matching problems all of which came up quite recently in the field of machine teaching. The cost of a matching is defined in such a way that, for some formal model of teaching, it equals (or bounds) the number of labeled examples needed to solve a given teaching task. We show how the cost parameters associated with these problems depend on each other and how they are related to other well known combinatorial parameters (like, for instance, the VC-dimension).</description>

      <title>Enumerating k-connected blocks and gk-connected blocks in words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define two new statistics on words: the k-connector and the gk-connector. For a word $\pi = \pi_1\pi_2\cdots\pi_n$ of length $n$ over the alphabet $[k]$, a k-connector is defined as an ordered pair $(\pi_j, \pi_{j+1})$ where $1 \leq j \leq n-1$ and $\pi_j + \pi_{j+1} = k$. Conversely, a gk-connector is defined as an ordered pair $(\pi_j, \pi_{j+1})$ where $1 \leq j \leq n-1$ and $\pi_j + \pi_{j+1} &gt; k$. We investigate the enumeration of partitions based on these statistics, providing generating functions and explicit formulas.</description>

Abstract: The Falconer distance problem for Cartesian product sets was introduced and studied by Iosevich and Liu (\cite{MR3525385}). In this paper, by implementing a new observation on Cartesian product sets associated with a particular parabolic structure, we study the pinned version of Falconer distance problem for Cartesian product sets, and improve the threshold for the Falconer distance set in \cite{MR3525385} in certain case.</description>

      <title>New upper and lower bounds on the smallest singular values of nonsingular lower triangular $(0,1)$-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K_n$ denote the set of all nonsingular $n\times n$ lower triangular $(0,1)$-matrices. Hong and Loewy (2004) introduced the number sequence $$ c_n=\min\{\lambda\mid\lambda~\text{is an eigenvalue of}~XX^{\rm T},~X\in K_n\},\quad n\in\mathbb Z_+. $$ There have been a number of attempts in the literature to obtain bounds on the numbers $c_n$ by Mattila (2015), Altinisik et al. (2016), Kaarnioja (2021), Loewy (2021), and Altinisik (2021). In this paper, improved upper and lower bounds are derived on the numbers $c_n$. By considering the characteristic polynomial corresponding to the matrix $Z_n$ satisfying $c_n=\|Z_n\|_2^{-1}$, it is shown that the second largest eigenvalue of $Z_n$ is bounded from above by $\frac45$ leading to an improved upper bound on $c_n$. Meanwhile, Samuelson's inequality applied to the roots of the characteristic polynomial of $Z_n$ yields an improved lower bound. Numerical experiments demonstrate the sharpness of the new bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the tilings of a strip with equilateral triangles. The number of ways in which the lattices can be covered with a combination of tiles of the two types of triangles is related to Pell's numbers. Additionally, the question of the number of tiles required for all possible tilings - both the number of tiles in total and by type - is developed for the first time in this article.</description>

      <title>Orbits of consistent walk in dart-transitive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a simple graph, a shunt is a symmetry which sends an edge to an incident edge (without fixing their shared vertex). The orbit of this edge under the shunt forms a consistent cycle. The important theorem of Biggs and Conway says that in a dart-transitive graph of valence q, there are exactly q-1 orbits of consistent cycles. These ideas have become a useful tool in the area of graphs symmetries, and generalize easily to consistent walks in graphs which are not simple. These walks are not necessarily cycles, or even circuits. This paper considers these walks and their orbits in the venue of dart-transitive maps and classifies them geometrically.</description>

      <title>The $\alpha$-representation for the Tait coloring and for the characteristic polynomial of matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a finite field $\mathbb F_q$, $q=p^d$, where $p$ is an odd number. Let $M=(E,r)$ be a regular matroid; denote by ${\mathcal B}$ the family of its bases, $\bar s(M;\alpha)=\sum_{B\in {\mathcal B}}\prod_{e\not\in B} \alpha_e$, where ${\alpha_e\in \mathbb F_q}$, $\alpha_e\neq 0$. Let a subset $A\equiv A(\alpha)$ in $E$ have the maximal cardinality and satisfy the condition $\bar s(M|A;\alpha)\neq 0$, while ${r^*}(\alpha)=|A|-r(E)$. Let us represent the value of the characteristic polynomial of the matroid $M$ at the point $q$ as the linear combination of Legendre symbols with respect to $\bar s(M|A;\alpha)$, whose coefficients are modulo equal to $1/q^{r^*(\alpha)/2}$. This representation generalizes the formula for a flow polynomial of a graph which was obtained by us earlier. The latter formula is an analog of the so-called $\alpha$-representation of vacuum Feynman amplitudes in the case of a finite field, which has inspired the Kontsevich conjecture (1997). The $\alpha$-representation technique is also applicable for expressing the number of Tait colorings for a cubic biconnected planar graph in terms of principal minors of the matrix of faces of this graph.</description>

      <title>The law of the circumference of sparse binomial random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been much interest in the distribution of the circumference, the length of the longest cycle, of a random graph $G(n,p)$ in the sparse regime, when $p = \Theta\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)$. Recently, the first author and Frieze established a scaling limit for the circumference in this regime, along the way establishing an alternative 'structural' approximation for this parameter. In this paper, we give a central limit theorem for the circumference in this regime using a novel argument based on the Efron-Stein inequality, which relies on a combinatorial analysis of the effect of resampling edges on this approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a positive integer $n$ and a partitioning $n=r_1s_1+\dots+ r_ts_t$, $t,r_i,s_i$ positive integers, such that $r_1&gt;\dots&gt;r_t$ (for $t\ge 2$), we can write $n$ symbols $1,\dots,n$ in the form of a staircase matrix having $r_1$ rows where first $r_1-r_2$ rows have $x_1$ columns, next $r_2-r_3$ rows have $t_1+t_2$ columns, etc., and finally last $r_t$ rows have $t_1+\dots+t_k$ columns. Then we can construct a~design having $r_1+s_1+\dots+s_t$ sets by taking all $r_1$ rows and $s_1+\dots+s_t$ columns of this staircase matrix. Such designs have exactly two replications of each symbol and various cardinalities for the sets constituting the design. The minimum size of combinatorial designs of staircase type is found.</description>

      <title>Matrix symmetric and quasi-symmetric functions and noncommutative representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental result by L. Solomon in algebraic combinatorics and representation theory states that Mackey formulas for products of characters of a symmetric group, or equivalently the computation of tensor products of representations thereof, can be lifted to the corresponding Solomon's descent algebra, a subalgebra of the group algebra with a very rich structure. Motivated by the structure of the product formula in these algebras and by other results and ideas in the field, we introduce and investigate in the present article a two dimensional analogue of descent algebras based on packed integer matrices that inherits most of their fundamental properties. One of the various bialgebra structures we introduce on packed integer matrices identifies with a bialgebra recently introduced by J. Diehl and L. Schmitz to define a two dimensional generalisation of Chen's iterated integrals signatures.</description>

      <title>An improved hypergraph Mantel's Theorem</title>

Abstract: In a recent paper, Chao and Yu used an entropy method to show that the Tur\'an density of a certain family $\mathcal{F}$ of $\lfloor r/2\rfloor$ triangle-like $r$-uniform hypergraphs is $r^r/r!$. Later, Liu determined for large $n$ the exact Tur\'an number $\text{ex}(n,\mathcal{F})$ of this family, and showed that the unique extremal graph is the balanced complete $r$-partite $r$-uniform hypergraph. These two results together can be viewed as a hypergraph version of Mantel's Theorem. In this paper, building on their methods, we improve both of these results by showing that they still hold with a subfamily $\mathcal{F}'\subset\mathcal{F}$ of size $\lceil r/e\rceil$ in place of $\mathcal{F}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate which subsets of the real plane are realisable as the set of points on which a one-layer ReLU neural network takes a positive value. In the case of cones we give a full characterisation of such sets. Furthermore, we give a necessary condition for any subset of $\mathbb R^d$. We give various examples of such one-layer neural networks.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction coefficients from Amplitubes</title>

Abstract: Given a graph its set of connected subgraphs (tubes) can be defined in two ways: either by considering subsets of edges, or by considering subsets of vertices. We refer to these as binary tubes and unary tubes respectively. Both notions come with a natural compatibility condition between tubes which differ by a simple adjacency constraint. Compatible sets of tubes are refered to as tubings. By considering the set of binary tubes, and summing over all maximal binary-tubings, one is lead to an expression for the flat space wavefunction coefficients relevant for computing cosmological correlators. On the other hand, considering the set of unary tubes, and summing over all maximal unary-tubings, one is lead to expressions recently referred to as amplitubes which resemble the scattering amplitudes of $\text{tr}(\phi^3)$ theory. In this paper we study the two definitions of tubing in order to provide a new formula for the flat space wavefunction coefficient for a single graph as a sum over products of amplitubes. We also show how the expressions for the amplitubes can naturally be understood as a sum over orientations of the underlying graph. Motivated by our rewriting of the wavefunction coefficient we introduce a new definition of tubing which makes use of both the binary and unary tubes which we refer to as cut tubings. We explain how each cut tubing induces a decorated orientation of the underlying graph and demonstrate how the set of all decorated orientations for a given graph count the number of basis functions appearing in the kinematic flow.</description>

      <title>Color-Constrained Arborescences in Edge-Colored Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a multigraph $G$ whose edges are colored from the set $[q]:=\{1,2,\ldots,q\}$ (\emph{$q$-colored graph}), and a vector $\alpha=(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_{q}) \in \mathbb{N}^{q}$ (\emph{color-constraint}), a subgraph $H$ of $G$ is called \emph{$\alpha$-colored}, if $H$ has exactly $\alpha_i$ edges of color $i$ for each $i \in[q]$. In this paper, we focus on $\alpha$-colored arborescences (spanning out-trees) in $q$-colored multidigraphs. We study the decision, counting and search versions of this problem. It is known that the decision and search problems are polynomial-time solvable when $q=2$ and that the decision problem is NP-complete when $q$ is arbitrary. However the complexity status of the problem for fixed $q$ was open for $q &gt; 2$. We show that, for a $q$-colored digraph $G$ and a vertex $s$ in $G$, the number of $\alpha$-colored arborescences in $G$ rooted at $s$ for all color-constraints $\alpha \in \mathbb{N}^q$ can be read from the determinant of a symbolic matrix in $q-1$ indeterminates. This result extends Tutte's matrix-tree theorem for directed graphs and gives a polynomial-time algorithm for the counting and decision problems for fixed $q$. We also use it to design an algorithm that finds an $\alpha$-colored arborescence when one exists. Finally, we study the weighted variant of the problem and give a polynomial-time algorithm (when $q$ is fixed) which finds a minimum weight solution.</description>

      <title>The Theory of Khinchin Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of Khinchin families connects Probability Theory and Complex Analysis. Along this PhD thesis, we exploit this connection to obtain, using a variety of local central limit theorems, asymptotic formulas for the coefficients of analytic functions with non-negative coefficients. We give criteria for a power series to have certain specific, and in most cases, computable, asymptotic formula.
  The theory of Khinchin families was initiated and is strongly influenced by the work of Walter K. Hayman, Paul C. Rosembloom, and Luis B\'aez-Duarte. We can assign to each power series $f$ in the class $\mathcal{K}$, having radius of convergence $R&gt;0$, a family of random variables $(X_t)_{[0,R)}$. This theory examines the behavior of this family of random variables, and also of its normalized version, as $t \uparrow R$.
  This thesis aims to harmonize the various asymptotic formulas for combinatorial or probabilistic objects within a single framework. With this aim we have extended some of the classes of functions and also studied the coefficients of large powers of analytic functions. One of our main goals was to consolidate and develop some aspects of a comprehensive theory: providing a guidebook for combinatorialists or probabilists, a series of results, or basic criteria, where they can follow a step-by-step process, verify if certain straightforward conditions are met, and then derive an asymptotic formula for the object of study. However, this is not the sole primary goal; we are also profoundly interested in the functional theoretical properties of these classes of functions and their connections to the respective Khinchin families (such as the case of $f \in \mathcal{K}$ being an entire function).</description>

      <title>Invariants of nested Hilbert and Quot schemes on surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(S,p)$ be a smooth pointed surface. In the first part of this paper we study motivic invariants of punctual nested Hilbert schemes attached to $(S,p)$ using the Hilbert-Samuel stratification. We compute two infinite families of motivic classes of punctual nested Hilbert schemes, corresponding to nestings of the form $(2,n)$ and $(3,n)$. As a consequence, we are able to give a lower bound for the number of irreducible components of $S_p^{[2,n]}$ and $S_p^{[3,n]}$.
  In the second part of this paper we characterise completely the generating series of Euler characteristics of all nested Hilbert and Quot schemes. This is achieved via a novel technique, involving differential operators modelled on the enumerative problem, which we introduce. From this analysis, we deduce that in the Hilbert scheme case the generating series is the product of a rational function by the celebrated Euler's product formula counting integer partitions. In higher rank, we derive functional equations relating the nested Quot scheme generating series to the rank one series, corresponding to nested Hilbert schemes.</description>

      <title>A new bound in Majority Dynamics on Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of majority dynamics on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi $G(n,p)$ random graphs. In this process, each vertex of a graph is assigned one of two initial states. Subsequently, on every day, each vertex simultaneously updates its state to the most common state in its neighbourhood.
  If the difference in the number of vertices in each state on day $0$ is much larger than $ \max \left\{p^{-1/2} \sqrt{\log\left(\frac{1}{p}\right)}, p^{-3/2}n^{-1/2}\right\}$, we demonstrate that the state with the initial majority wins with overwhelmingly high probability. This extends work by Linh Tran and Van Vu (2023), who previously considered this phenomenon.
  We also study majority dynamics with a random initial assignment of vertex states. When each vertex is assigned to a state with equal probability, we show that unanimity occurs with arbitrarily high probability for every $p \geq \lambda n^{-2/3}$, for some constant $\lambda$. This improves work by Fountoulakis, Kang and Makai (2020).
  Furthermore, we also consider a random initial assignment of vertex states where a vertex is slightly more likely to be in the first state than the second state. Previous work by Zehmakan (2018) and Tran and Vu (2023) provided conditions on how big this bias needs to be for the first colour to achieve unanimity with high probability. We strengthen these results by providing that a weaker sufficient condition.</description>

In this article we prove an effective version of the Erd\H{o}s, Gr\"unwald, and Weiszfeld theorem for a class of graphs where vertices of infinite degree are allowed, generalizing a theorem of D.Bean. Our results are obtained from a characterization of those finite paths in a graph that can be extended to infinite Eulerian paths.</description>

      <title>The critical group of a combinatorial map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the appearance of embeddings in the theory of chip firing and the critical group of a graph, we introduce a version of the critical group (or sandpile group) for combinatorial maps, that is, for graphs embedded in orientable surfaces. We provide several definitions of our critical group, by approaching it through analogues of the cycle-cocycle matrix, the Laplacian matrix, and as the group of critical states of a chip firing game (or sandpile model) on the edges of a map.
  Our group can be regarded as a perturbation of the classical critical group of its underlying graph by topological information, and it agrees with the classical critical group in the plane case. Its cardinality is equal to the number of spanning quasi-trees in a connected map, just as the cardinality of the classical critical group is equal to the number of spanning trees of a connected graph.
  Our approach exploits the properties of principally unimodular matrices and the methods of delta-matroid theory.</description>

      <title>Counting Packings of List-colorings of Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a list assignment for a graph, list packing asks for the existence of multiple pairwise disjoint list colorings of the graph. Several papers have recently appeared that study the existence of such a packing of list colorings. Formally, a proper $L$-packing of size $k$ of a graph $G$ is a set of $k$ pairwise disjoint proper $L$-colorings of $G$ where $L$ is a list assignment of colors to the vertices of $G$. In this note, we initiate the study of counting such packings of list colorings of a graph. We define $P_\ell^\star(G,q,k)$ as the guaranteed number of proper $L$-packings of size $k$ of $G$ over all list assignments $L$ that assign $q$ colors to each vertex of $G$, and we let $P^\star(G,q,k)$ be its classical coloring counterpart. We let $P_\ell^\star(G,q)= P_\ell^\star(G,q,q)$ so that $P_\ell^\star(G,q)$ is the enumerative function for the previously studied list packing number $\chi_\ell^\star(G)$. Note that the chromatic polynomial of $G$, $P(G,q)$, is $P^\star(G,q,1)$, and the list color function of $G$, $P_\ell(G,q)$, is $P_\ell^\star(G,q,1)$.
  Inspired by the well-known behavior of the list color function and the chromatic polynomial, we make progress towards the question of whether $P_{\ell}^\star(G,q,k) = P^\star(G,q,k)$ when $q$ is large enough. Our result generalizes the recent theorem of Dong and Zhang (2023), which improved results going back to Donner (1992), about when the list color function equals the chromatic polynomial. Further, we use a polynomial method to generalize bounds on the list packing number, $\chi_\ell^\star(G)$, of sparse graphs to exponential lower bounds (in the number of vertices of $G$) on the corresponding list packing functions, $P_\ell^\star(G,q)$.</description>

Abstract: Discrete homotopy theory or A-homotopy theory is a combinatorial homotopy theory defined on graphs, simplicial complexes, and metric spaces, reflecting information about their connectivity. The present paper aims to further understand the (non-)similarities between the A-homotopy and ordinary homotopy theories through explicit constructions. More precisely, we define mapping fiber graphs and study their basic properties yielding, under a technical condition, a discrete analogous of Puppe sequence in a naive discrete homotopy theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18802v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An endhered (end-adhered) pattern is a subset of arcs in matchings, such that the corresponding starting points are consecutive and the same holds for the ending points. Such patterns are in one-to-one correspondence with the permutations. We focus on the occurrence frequency of such patterns in matchings and native (real-world) RNA structures with pseudoknots. We present combinatorial results related to the distribution and asymptotic behavior of the pattern 21, which corresponds to two consecutive base pairs frequently encountered in RNA, and the pattern 12, representing the archetypal minimal pseudoknot. We show that in matchings these two patterns are equidistributed, which is quite different from what we can find in native RNAs. We also examine the distribution of endhered patterns of size 3, showing how the patterns change under the transformation called endhered twist. Finally, we compute the distributions of endhered patterns of size 2 and 3 in native secondary RNA structures with pseudoknots and discuss possible outcomes of our study.</description>

      <title>Induced Saturation of the Poset 2C_2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set $X$, the power set $\mathbb{P}(X)$, and a finite poset $P$, a family $F\subset \mathbb{P}(X)$ is said to be induced-$P$-free if there is no injection $\phi: P\rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ such that $\phi(p)\subseteq\phi(q)$ if and only if $p\leq_{P} q$, for all $p, q \in P$. The family $F$ is induced-$P$-saturated if it is maximal with respect to being induced-$P$-free. If $n=|X|$, then the size of the smallest induced-$P$-saturated family in $\mathbb{P}(X)$ is denoted $sat(n,P)$.
  The poset $2C_2$ is two incomparable 2-chains (the Hasse diagram is two vertex-disjoint edges) and Keszegh, Lemons, Martin, P\'alv\"olgyi, and Patk\'os proved that $n+2\leq sat(n,2C_2)\leq 2n$ and gave one isomorphism class of an induced-$2C_2$-saturated family that achieves the upper bound.
  We show that the lower bound can be improved to $3n/2 + 1/2$ by examining the necessary structure of a saturated family. In addition, we provide many examples of induced-$2C_2$-saturated families of size $2n$ in $\mathbb{P}(X)$ where $|X|=n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every cubic graph on $n$ vertices contains a spanning subgraph in which the number of vertices of each degree deviates from $\frac{n}{4}$ by at most $\frac{1}{2}$, up to three exceptions. This resolves the conjecture of Alon and Wei (Irregular subgraphs, Combin. Probab. Comput. 32(2) (2023), 269--283) for cubic graphs.</description>

      <title>Deformed Homogeneous Polynomials and the Generalized $q$-Exponential Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the deformed homogeneous polynomials $\mathrm{R}_{n}(x,y;u,v|q)$. These polynomials generalize some classical polynomials: the Rogers-Szeg\"o polynomials $\mathrm{h}_{n}(x|q)$, the generalized Rogers-Szeg\"o polynomials $\mathrm{r}_{n}(x,y)$, the Stieljes-Wigert polynomials $\mathrm{S}_{n}(x;q)$, among others. Basic properties of the polynomial $\mathrm{R}_{n}$ are given, along with recurrence relations, its $q$-difference equation, and representations. We introduce the deformed basic hypergeometric series. Generalizations of the $q$-binomial theorem and Heine's transformation formula are given. We define the $u$-deformed $q$-exponential operator $\mathrm{T}(yD_{q}|u)$, and we get for free the operators $\mathrm{T}(yD_{q})$ the Chen, $\mathrm{R}(yD_{q})$ of Saad, $\mathcal{E}(yD_{q})$ of Exton, and $\mathcal{R}(yD_{q})$ of Rogers-Ramanujan, defined here, when $u=1,q,\sqrt{q},q^2$, respectively. Generalizations of the Mehler and Rogers formulas are given.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for incidences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p_1,\ldots,p_n$ be a set of points in the unit square and let $T_1,\ldots,T_n$ be a set of $\delta$-tubes such that $T_j$ passes through $p_j$. We prove a lower bound for the number of incidences between the points and tubes under a natural regularity condition (similar to Frostman regularity). As a consequence, we show that in any configuration of points $p_1,\ldots, p_n \in [0,1]^2$ along with a line $\ell_j$ through each point $p_j$, there exist $j\neq k$ for which $d(p_j, \ell_k) \lesssim n^{-2/3+o(1)}$.
  It follows from the latter result that any set of $n$ points in the unit square contains three points forming a triangle of area at most $n^{-7/6+o(1)}$. This new upper bound for Heilbronn's triangle problem attains the high-low limit established in our previous work arXiv:2305.18253.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial connections in snake graphs: Tilings, lattice paths, and perfect matchings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Snake graphs and their perfect matchings play a key role in the description of cluster variables of cluster algebras associated to surfaces. In this paper, we introduce triangular snake graphs and establish a bijection between their routes (non-intersecting lattice paths), perfect matchings of their underlying snake graphs, and tilings. As an application, we show that the number of perfect matchings in straight snake graphs can be expressed in terms of determinants of Hankel matrices with Catalan number entries. Moreover, we prove that the number of perfect matchings in snake graphs can be expressed as a sum of products of Fibonacci numbers, and we show how Fibonacci and Pell sequences arise from determinants of matrices with Fibonacci entries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the classification of isomorphism classes of Schubert varieties from complete flag varieties G/B to a class of partial flag varieties G/P. In particular, we classify all Schubert varieties in G/P where P is a minimal parabolic subgroup, and all Schubert surfaces which are two-dimensional Schubert varieties. We also obtain several classes of isomorphisms of Schubert varieties in flag varieties G/P where P is a maximal parabolic subgroup. In particular, we find an upper bound of the number of isomorphism classes of Schubert threefolds which are three-dimensional Schubert varieties.</description>

      <title>$k$-Adjoint of Hyperplane Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the $k$-adjoint of a given hyperplane arrangement $\mathcal{A}$ associated with rank-$k$ elements in the intersection lattice $L(\mathcal{A})$, which generalizes the classical adjoint proposed by Bixby and Coullard. The $k$-adjoint of $\mathcal{A}$ induces a decomposition of the Grassmannian, which we call the $\mathcal{A}$-adjoint decomposition. Inspired by the work of Gelfand, Goresky, MacPherson, and Serganova, we generalize the matroid decomposition and refined Schubert decomposition of the Grassmannian from the perspective of $\mathcal{A}$. Furthermore, we prove that these three decompositions are exactly the same decomposition. A notable application involves providing a combinatorial classification of all the $k$-dimensional restrictions of $\mathcal{A}$. Consequently, we establish the anti-monotonicity property of some combinatorial invariants, such as Whitney numbers of the first kind and the independece numbers.</description>

      <title>Reflexive Digraph Reconfiguration by Orientation Strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reconfiguration problem for homomorphisms of digraphs to a reflexive digraph cycle, which amounts to deciding if a `reconfiguration graph' is connected, is known to by polynomially time solvable via a greedy algorithm based on certain topological requirements. Even in the case that the instance digraph is a cycle of length $m$, the algorithm, being greedy, takes time $\Omega(m^2)$.
  Encoding homomorphisms between two cycles as a relation on strings that represent the orientations of the cycles, we give a characterization of the components of the reconfiguration graph that can be computed in linear time and logarithmic space. In particular, this solves the reconfiguration problem for homomorphisms of cycles to cycles in log-space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proves that the process of gluing finite lattices to form a larger lattice is bijective, that is each lattice is the glued sum of a unique system of finite lattices, provided the class of lattices is constrained to modular, locally-finite lattices with finite covers. The results of this work are not surprising given the prior literature, but this seems to be the first proof that the processes of gluing and dissection can be made inverses, and hence that gluing is bijective.</description>

Abstract: Call a subset of $\mathbf{FIN}_k$ small if it does not contain a copy of $\langle{A\rangle}$ for some infinite block sequence $A \in \mathbf{FIN}_k^{[\infty]}$. Gowers' $\mathbf{FIN}_k$ theorem asserts that the set of small subsets of $\mathbf{FIN}_k$ forms an ideal, so it is sensible to consider almost disjoint families of $\mathbf{FIN}_k$ with respect to the ideal of small subsets of $\mathbf{FIN}_k$. We shall show that $\mathfrak{a}_{\mathbf{FIN}_k}$, the smallest possible cardinality of an infinite mad family of $\mathbf{FIN}_k$, is uncountable.</description>

      <title>The Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi Random Graph Conditioned on Every Component Being a Clique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by an application in community detection, we consider an \ER random graph conditioned on the rare event that all connected components are fully connected. Such graphs can be considered as partitions of vertices into cliques. Hence, this conditional distribution defines a distribution over partitions. We show that a popular community detection method is equivalent to Bayesian inference with this distribution as prior over the community partitions. Using tools from analytic combinatorics, we prove limit theorems for several graph observables in this conditional distribution: the number of cliques; the number of edges; and the degree distribution. We consider several regimes of the connection probability $p$ as the number of vertices $n$ diverges. For $p=\tfrac{1}{2}$, the conditioning yields the uniform distribution over set partitions, which is well-studied, but has not been studied as a graph distribution before. For $p&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}$, we show that the number of cliques is of the order $n/\sqrt{\log n}$, while for $p&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}$, we prove that the graph consists of a single clique with high probability. This shows that there is a phase transition at $p=\tfrac{1}{2}$. We additionally study the near-critical regime $p_n\downarrow\tfrac{1}{2}$, as well as the sparse regime $p_n\downarrow0$. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for community detection.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing semi-directed level-1 networks using few quarnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-directed networks are partially directed graphs that model evolution where the directed edges represent reticulate evolutionary events. We present an algorithm that reconstructs binary $n$-leaf semi-directed level-1 networks in $O( n^2)$ time from its quarnets (4-leaf subnetworks). Our method assumes we have direct access to all quarnets, yet uses only an asymptotically optimal number of $O(n \log n)$ quarnets. When the network is assumed to contain no triangles, our method instead relies only on four-cycle quarnets and the splits of the other quarnets. A variant of our algorithm works with quartets rather than quarnets and we show that it reconstructs most of a semi-directed level-1 network from an asymptotically optimal $O(n \log n)$ of the quartets it displays. Additionally, we provide an $O(n^3)$ time algorithm that reconstructs the tree-of-blobs of any binary $n$-leaf semi-directed network with unbounded level from $O(n^3)$ splits of its quarnets.</description>

Abstract: Integer programs (IPs) on constraint matrices with bounded subdeterminants are conjectured to be solvable in polynomial time. We give a strongly polynomial time algorithm to solve IPs where the constraint matrix has bounded subdeterminants and at most two non-zeros per row after removing a constant number of rows and columns. This result extends the work by Fiorini, Joret, Weltge \&amp; Yuditsky (J. ACM 72(1), 1-50 (2025)) by allowing for additional, unifying constraints and variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We answer in the negative the long-standing open question of whether biholomorphic equivalence implies algebraic equivalence for germs of real algebraic manifolds in $\mathbb C^n$. More precisely we give an example of two germs of real algebraic surfaces in $\mathbb C^2$ that are biholomorphic, but not via an algebraic biholomorphism. In fact we even prove that the components of any biholomorphism between these two surfaces are never solutions of polynomial differential equations. The proof is based on enumerative combinatorics and differential Galois Theory results concerning the nature of the generating series of walks restricted to the quarter plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of denominator vectors can be extended to all generic basis elements of upper cluster algebras in a natural way. Under a weakened version of generic pairing assumption, we provide a representation-theoretic interpretation for this extended notion. We derive several consequences in this generality. We present a counterexample to the conjecture that distinct cluster monomials have distinct denominator vectors. Utilizing a new rank function called the Schur rank, we extend the notion of compatibility degree. As an application, we find a tropical method to compute the multiplicity of a real component in the canonical decomposition of $\delta$-vectors.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this note is to rectify a typographical error in the statements of Theorems 5.5 and 5.6 of Sharma, Chauhan and Singh[3] and further analyze and discuss the significance of the results derived in Takieldin and Sol\'e [4]. In our opinion, several claims made by the authors in [4] are either factually incorrect or lack adequate substantiation, which may confuse the readers about the contributions of [1,3]. Our remarks on the work [4] intend to provide the clarity and inform about the true contributions and findings of our research.</description>
