      <title>Sentiment and Social Signals in the Climate Crisis: A Survey on Analyzing Social Media Responses to Extreme Weather Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme weather events driven by climate change, such as wildfires, floods, and heatwaves, prompt significant public reactions on social media platforms. Analyzing the sentiment expressed in these online discussions can offer valuable insights into public perception, inform policy decisions, and enhance emergency responses. Although sentiment analysis has been widely studied in various fields, its specific application to climate-induced events, particularly in real-time, high-impact situations like the 2025 Los Angeles forest fires, remains underexplored. In this survey, we thoroughly examine the methods, datasets, challenges, and ethical considerations related to sentiment analysis of social media content concerning weather and climate change events. We present a detailed taxonomy of approaches, ranging from lexicon-based and machine learning models to the latest strategies driven by large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we discuss data collection and annotation techniques, including weak supervision and real-time event tracking. Finally, we highlight several open problems, such as misinformation detection, multimodal sentiment extraction, and model alignment with human values. Our goal is to guide researchers and practitioners in effectively understanding sentiment during the climate crisis era.</description>

      <title>Scalable Substructure Discovery Algorithm For Homogeneous Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph mining analyzes real-world graphs to find core substructures (connected subgraphs) in applications modeled as graphs. Substructure discovery is a process that involves identifying meaningful patterns, structures, or components within a large data set. These substructures can be of various types, such as frequent patterns, motifs, or other relevant features within the data.
  To model complex data sets -- with multiple types of entities and relationships -- multilayer networks (or MLNs) have been shown to be more effective as compared to simple and attributed graphs. Analysis algorithms on MLNs using the decoupling approach have been shown to be both efficient and accurate. Hence, this paper focuses on substructure discovery in homogeneous multilayer networks (one type of MLN) using a novel decoupling-based approach. In this approach, each layer is processed independently, and then the results from two or more layers are composed to identify substructures in the entire MLN. The algorithm is designed and implemented, including the composition part, using one of the distributed processing frameworks (the Map/Reduce paradigm) to provide scalability.
  After establishing the correctness, we analyze the speedup and response time of the proposed algorithm and approach through extensive experimental analysis on large synthetic and real-world data sets with diverse graph characteristics.</description>

      <title>TeleScope: A Longitudinal Dataset for Investigating Online Discourse and Information Interaction on Telegram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Telegram is a globally popular instant messaging platform known for its strong emphasis on security, privacy, and unique social networking features. It has recently emerged as the host for various cross-domain analysis and research works, such as social media influence, propaganda studies, and extremism. This paper introduces TeleScope, an extensive dataset suite that, to our knowledge, is the largest of its kind. It comprises metadata for about 500K Telegram channels and downloaded message metadata for about 71K public channels, accounting for around 120M crawled messages. We also release channel connections and user interaction data built using Telegram's message-forwarding feature to study multiple use cases, such as information spread and message forwarding patterns. In addition, we provide data enrichments, such as language detection, active message posting periods for each channel, and Telegram entities extracted from messages, that enable online discourse analysis beyond what is possible with the original data alone. The dataset is designed for diverse applications, independent of specific research objectives, and sufficiently versatile to facilitate the replication of social media studies comparable to those conducted on platforms like X (formerly Twitter)</description>

      <title>Mapping the Italian Telegram Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Telegram has become a major space for political discourse and alternative media. However, its lack of moderation allows misinformation, extremism, and toxicity to spread. While prior research focused on these particular phenomena or topics, these have mostly been examined separately, and a broader understanding of the Telegram ecosystem is still missing. In this work, we fill this gap by conducting a large-scale analysis of the Italian Telegram sphere, leveraging a dataset of 186 million messages from 13,151 chats collected in 2023. Using network analysis, Large Language Models, and toxicity detection tools, we examine how different thematic communities form, align ideologically, and engage in harmful discourse within the Italian cultural context. Results show strong thematic and ideological homophily. We also identify mixed ideological communities where far-left and far-right rhetoric coexist on particular geopolitical issues. Beyond political analysis, we find that toxicity, rather than being isolated in a few extreme chats, appears widely normalized within highly toxic communities. Moreover, we find that Italian discourse primarily targets Black people, Jews, and gay individuals independently of the topic. Finally, we uncover common trend of intra-national hostility, where Italians often attack other Italians, reflecting regional and intra-regional cultural conflicts that can be traced back to old historical divisions. This study provides the first large-scale mapping of the Italian Telegram ecosystem, offering insights into ideological interactions, toxicity, and identity-targets of hate and contributing to research on online toxicity across different cultural and linguistic contexts on Telegram.</description>

      <title>Observational Learning with a Budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model of Bayesian observational learning in which a sequence of agents receives a private signal about an underlying binary state of the world. Each agent makes a decision based on its own signal and its observations of previous agents. A central planner seeks to improve the accuracy of these signals by allocating a limited budget to enhance signal quality across agents. We formulate and analyze the budget allocation problem and propose two optimal allocation strategies. At least one of these strategies is shown to maximize the probability of achieving a correct information cascade.</description>

      <title>How Cohesive Are Community Search Results on Online Social Networks?: An Experimental Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, numerous community search methods for large graphs have been proposed, at the core of which is defining and measuring cohesion. This paper experimentally evaluates the effectiveness of these community search algorithms w.r.t. cohesiveness in the context of online social networks. Social communities are formed and developed under the influence of group cohesion theory, which has been extensively studied in social psychology. However, current generic methods typically measure cohesiveness using structural or attribute-based approaches and overlook domain-specific concepts such as group cohesion. We introduce five novel psychology-informed cohesiveness measures, based on the concept of group cohesion from social psychology, and propose a novel framework called CHASE for evaluating eight representative CS algorithms w.r.t.these measures on online social networks. Our analysis reveals that there is no clear correlation between structural and psychological cohesiveness, and no algorithm effectively identifies psychologically cohesive communities in online social networks. This study provides new insights that could guide the development of future community search methods.</description>

      <title>LLM-Assisted Automated Deductive Coding of Dialogue Data: Leveraging Dialogue-Specific Characteristics to Enhance Contextual Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dialogue data has been a key source for understanding learning processes, offering critical insights into how students engage in collaborative discussions and how these interactions shape their knowledge construction. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced promising opportunities for advancing qualitative research, particularly in the automated coding of dialogue data. However, the inherent contextual complexity of dialogue presents unique challenges for these models, especially in understanding and interpreting complex contextual information. This study addresses these challenges by developing a novel LLM-assisted automated coding approach for dialogue data. The novelty of our proposed framework is threefold: 1) We predict the code for an utterance based on dialogue-specific characteristics -- communicative acts and communicative events -- using separate prompts following the role prompts and chain-of-thoughts methods; 2) We engaged multiple LLMs including GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o, DeepSeek in collaborative code prediction; 3) We leveraged the interrelation between events and acts to implement consistency checking using GPT-4o. In particular, our contextual consistency checking provided a substantial accuracy improvement. We also found the accuracy of act predictions was consistently higher than that of event predictions. This study contributes a new methodological framework for enhancing the precision of automated coding of dialogue data as well as offers a scalable solution for addressing the contextual challenges inherent in dialogue analysis.</description>

      <title>AgileRate: Bringing Adaptivity and Robustness to DeFi Lending Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13105v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has revolutionized lending by replacing intermediaries with algorithm-driven liquidity pools. However, existing platforms like Aave and Compound rely on static interest rate curves and collateral requirements that struggle to adapt to rapid market changes, leading to inefficiencies in utilization and increased risks of liquidations. In this work, we propose a dynamic model of the lending market based on evolving demand and supply curves, alongside an adaptive interest rate controller that responds in real-time to shifting market conditions. Using a Recursive Least Squares algorithm, our controller tracks the external market and achieves stable utilization, while also controlling default and liquidation risk. We provide theoretical guarantees on the interest rate convergence and utilization stability of our algorithm. We establish bounds on the system's vulnerability to adversarial manipulation compared to static curves, while quantifying the trade-off between adaptivity and adversarial robustness. We propose two complementary approaches to mitigating adversarial manipulation: an algorithmic method that detects extreme demand and supply fluctuations and a market-based strategy that enhances elasticity, potentially via interest rate derivative markets. Our dynamic curve demand/supply model demonstrates a low best-fit error on Aave data, while our interest rate controller significantly outperforms static curve protocols in maintaining optimal utilization and minimizing liquidations.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Misinformation Detection Data and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misinformation is a complex societal issue, and mitigating solutions are difficult to create due to data deficiencies. To address this, we have curated the largest collection of (mis)information datasets in the literature, totaling 75. From these, we evaluated the quality of 36 datasets that consist of statements or claims, as well as the 9 datasets that consist of data in purely paragraph form. We assess these datasets to identify those with solid foundations for empirical work and those with flaws that could result in misleading and non-generalizable results, such as spurious correlations, or examples that are ambiguous or otherwise impossible to assess for veracity. We find the latter issue is particularly severe and affects most datasets in the literature. We further provide state-of-the-art baselines on all these datasets, but show that regardless of label quality, categorical labels may no longer give an accurate evaluation of detection model performance. Finally, we propose and highlight Evaluation Quality Assurance (EQA) as a tool to guide the field toward systemic solutions rather than inadvertently propagating issues in evaluation. Overall, this guide aims to provide a roadmap for higher quality data and better grounded evaluations, ultimately improving research in misinformation detection. All datasets and other artifacts are available at misinfo-datasets.complexdatalab.com.</description>

      <title>Extracting Participation in Collective Action from Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media play a key role in mobilizing collective action, holding the potential for studying the pathways that lead individuals to actively engage in addressing global challenges. However, quantitative research in this area has been limited by the absence of granular and large-scale ground truth about the level of participation in collective action among individual social media users. To address this limitation, we present a novel suite of text classifiers designed to identify expressions of participation in collective action from social media posts, in a topic-agnostic fashion. Grounded in the theoretical framework of social movement mobilization, our classification captures participation and categorizes it into four levels: recognizing collective issues, engaging in calls-to-action, expressing intention of action, and reporting active involvement. We constructed a labeled training dataset of Reddit comments through crowdsourcing, which we used to train BERT classifiers and fine-tune Llama3 models. Our findings show that smaller language models can reliably detect expressions of participation (weighted F1=0.71), and rival larger models in capturing nuanced levels of participation. By applying our methodology to Reddit, we illustrate its effectiveness as a robust tool for characterizing online communities in innovative ways compared to topic modeling, stance detection, and keyword-based methods. Our framework contributes to Computational Social Science research by providing a new source of reliable annotations useful for investigating the social dynamics of collective action.</description>

      <title>Exploring Unknown Social Networks for Discovering Hidden Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of discovering hidden nodes in unknown social networks, formulating three types of hidden-node discovery problems, namely, Sybil-node discovery, peripheral-node discovery, and influencer discovery. We tackle these problems by employing a graph exploration framework grounded in machine learning. Leveraging the structure of the subgraph gradually obtained from graph exploration, we construct prediction models to identify target hidden nodes in unknown social graphs. Through empirical investigations of real social graphs, we investigate the efficiency of graph exploration strategies in uncovering hidden nodes. Our results show that our graph exploration strategies discover hidden nodes with an efficiency comparable to that when the graph structure is known. Specifically, the query cost of discovering 10% of the hidden nodes is at most only 1.2 times that when the topology is known, and the query-cost multiplier for discovering 90% of the hidden nodes is at most only 1.4. Furthermore, our results suggest that using node embeddings, which are low-dimensional vector representations of nodes, for hidden-node discovery is a double-edged sword: it is effective in certain scenarios but sometimes degrades the efficiency of node discovery. Guided by this observation, we examine the effectiveness of using a bandit algorithm to combine the prediction models that use node embeddings with those that do not, and our analysis shows that the bandit-based graph exploration strategy achieves efficient node discovery across a wide array of settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People's collectively shared beliefs can have significant social implications, including on democratic processes and policies. Unfortunately, as people interact with peers to form and update their beliefs, various cognitive and social biases can hinder their collective wisdom. In this paper, we probe whether and how the psychological construct of intellectual humility can modulate collective wisdom in a networked interaction setting. Through agent-based modeling and data-calibrated simulations, we provide a proof of concept demonstrating that intellectual humility can foster more accurate estimations while mitigating polarization in social networks. We investigate the mechanisms behind the performance improvements and confirm robustness across task settings and network structures. Our work can guide intervention designs to capitalize on the promises of intellectual humility in boosting collective wisdom in social networks.</description>

      <title>FROG: Effective Friend Recommendation in Online Games via Modality-aware User Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the convenience of mobile devices, the online games have become an important part for user entertainments in reality, creating a demand for friend recommendation in online games. However, none of existing approaches can effectively incorporate the multi-modal user features (e.g., images and texts) with the structural information in the friendship graph, due to the following limitations: (1) some of them ignore the high-order structural proximity between users, (2) some fail to learn the pairwise relevance between users at modality-specific level, and (3) some cannot capture both the local and global user preferences on different modalities. By addressing these issues, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end model FROG that better models the user preferences on potential friends. Comprehensive experiments on both offline evaluation and online deployment at Tencent have demonstrated the superiority of FROG over existing approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From science to industry, teamwork plays a crucial role in knowledge production and innovation. Most studies consider teams as static groups of individuals, thereby failing to capture how the micro-dynamics of collaborative processes and organizational changes determine team success. Here, we leverage fine-grained temporal data on software development teams from three software ecosystems -- Rust, JavaScript, and Python -- to gain insights into the dynamics of online collaborative projects. Our analysis reveals an uneven workload distribution in teams, with stronger heterogeneity correlated with higher success, and the early emergence of a lead developer carrying out the majority of work. Moreover, we find that a sizeable fraction of projects experience a change of lead developer, with such a transition being more likely in projects led by inexperienced users. Finally, we show that leadership change is associated with faster success growth. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the link between team evolution and success in collaborative processes.</description>

Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the news media coverage encompassed a wide range of topics that includes viral transmission, allocation of medical resources, and government response measures. There have been studies on sentiment analysis of social media platforms during COVID-19 to understand the public response given the rise of cases and government strategies implemented to control the spread of the virus. Sentiment analysis can provide a better understanding of changes in societal opinions and emotional trends during the pandemic. Apart from social media, newspapers have played a vital role in the dissemination of information, including information from the government, experts, and also the public about various topics. A study of sentiment analysis of newspaper sources during COVID-19 for selected countries can give an overview of how the media covered the pandemic. In this study, we select The Guardian newspaper and provide a sentiment analysis during various stages of COVID-19 that includes initial transmission, lockdowns and vaccination. We employ novel large language models (LLMs) and refine them with expert-labelled sentiment analysis data. We also provide an analysis of sentiments experienced pre-pandemic for comparison. The results indicate that during the early pandemic stages, public sentiment prioritised urgent crisis response, later shifting focus to addressing the impact on health and the economy. In comparison with related studies about social media sentiment analyses, we found a discrepancy between The Guardian with dominance of negative sentiments (sad, annoyed, anxious and denial), suggesting that social media offers a more diversified emotional reflection. We found a grim narrative in The Guardian with overall dominance of negative sentiments, pre and during COVID-19 across news sections including Australia, UK, World News, and Opinion</description>

      <title>A Compounded Burr Probability Distribution for Fitting Heavy-Tailed Data with Applications to Biological Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex biological networks, encompassing metabolic pathways, gene regulatory systems, and protein-protein interaction networks, often exhibit scale-free structures characterized by heavy-tailed degree distributions. However, empirical studies reveal significant deviations from ideal power law behavior, underscoring the need for more flexible and accurate probabilistic models. In this work, we propose the Compounded Burr (CBurr) distribution, a novel four parameter family derived by compounding the Burr distribution with a discrete mixing process. This model is specifically designed to capture both the body and tail behavior of real-world network degree distributions with applications to biological networks. We rigorously derive its statistical properties, including moments, hazard and risk functions, and tail behavior, and develop an efficient maximum likelihood estimation framework. The CBurr model demonstrates broad applicability to networks with complex connectivity patterns, particularly in biological, social, and technological domains. Extensive experiments on large-scale biological network datasets show that CBurr consistently outperforms classical power-law, log-normal, and other heavy-tailed models across the full degree spectrum. By providing a statistically grounded and interpretable framework, the CBurr model enhances our ability to characterize the structural heterogeneity of biological networks.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Collective Accuracy in Socially Connected Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the accuracy of collective decision-making in socially connected populations, where agents update binary choices through local interactions on a network. Each agent receives a private signal that is biased -- even marginally -- toward the correct alternative, and social influence mediates the aggregation of these signals. We show analytically that, in the large-population limit, the probability of a correct majority converges to a nontrivial expression involving the regularized incomplete beta function. Remarkably, this collective accuracy surpasses that of any individual agent whenever private signals are better than random, revealing that network-mediated influence can enhance, rather than impair, group performance. Our findings may inform the design of resilient decision-making systems in social, biological, and engineered networks, where accuracy must emerge from interdependent and noisy agents.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods to probe for spatial correlations in temporal networks and infer their topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motifs are thought to be some fundamental components of social face-to-face interaction temporal networks. However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of the literature. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.</description>

      <title>Arab Spring's Impact on Science through the Lens of Scholarly Attention, Funding, and Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Arab Spring is a major socio-political movement that reshaped democratic aspirations in the Middle East and North Africa, attracting global attention through news, social media, and academic discourse. However, its consequences on the academic landscape in the region are still unclear. Here, we conduct the first study of scholarly attention toward 10 target countries affected by the Arab Spring by analyzing more than 25 million articles published from 2002 to 2019. Using a difference-in-difference statistical framework, we find that most target countries have experienced a significant increase in scholarly attention post-Arab Spring compared to the rest of the world, with Egypt attracting the most attention. We investigate how funding and migration networks relate to scholarly attention and reveal that Saudi Arabia has emerged as a key player among Western nations by attracting researchers and funding projects that shape research on the region.</description>

      <title>Reflection on Code Contributor Demographics and Collaboration Patterns in the Rust Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open-source software communities thrive on global collaboration and contributions from diverse participants. This study explores the Rust programming language ecosystem to understand its contributors' demographic composition and interaction patterns. Our objective is to investigate the phenomenon of participation inequality in key Rust projects and the presence of diversity among them. We studied GitHub pull request data from the year leading up to the release of the latest completed Rust community annual survey in 2023. Specifically, we extracted information from three leading repositories: Rust, Rust Analyzer, and Cargo, and used social network graphs to visualize the interactions and identify central contributors and sub-communities. Social network analysis has shown concerning disparities in gender and geographic representation among contributors who play pivotal roles in collaboration networks and the presence of varying diversity levels in the sub-communities formed. These results suggest that while the Rust community is globally active, the contributor base does not fully reflect the diversity of the wider user community. We conclude that there is a need for more inclusive practices to encourage broader participation and ensure that the contributor base aligns more closely with the diverse global community that utilizes Rust.</description>
