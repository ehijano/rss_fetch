      <title>The equilibrium configurations of neutron stars in the optimized $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct equilibrium configurations for neutron stars using a specific $f(R,T)$ functional form, recently derived through gaussian process applied to measurements of the Hubble parameter. By construction, this functional form serves as an alternative explanation for cosmic acceleration, circumventing the cosmological constant problem. Here, we aim to examine its applicability within the stellar regime. In doing so, we seek to contribute to the modified gravity literature by applying the same functional form of a given gravity theory across highly distinct regimes. Our results demonstrate that equilibrium configurations of neutron stars can be obtained within this theory, with the energy density and maximum mass slightly exceeding those predicted by General Relativity. Additionally, we show that the value of some parameters in the $f(R,T)$ functional form must differ from those obtained in cosmological configurations, suggesting a potential scale-dependence for these parameters. We propose that further studies apply this functional form across different regimes to more thoroughly assess this possible dependence.</description>

      <title>Dipoles and chains of solitons in the Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct static axisymmetric multisolitons in the Einstein-Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model. This theory features a complex scalar field which gains mass through its interaction with a real scalar field that has a non-zero vacuum expectation value. By performing three-dimensional numerical relativity simulations, we identify stable dipolar boson stars in specific regions of the parameter space. Based on the dipole results, non-rotating odd parity chains with and without gravity can also be constructed when the mass of the real scalar field is sufficiently small. However, chains beyond the dipole case are found to be unstable.</description>

      <title>Massive Fields Affected by Echoes: New Physics vs. Astrophysical Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike the perturbations of massless fields, the asymptotic tails of massive fields exhibit oscillations and decay slowly, following a power-law envelope. In this work, considering various scenarios admitting (either fundamental or effective) massive scalar and gravitational fields, we demonstrate that bump deformations in the effective potential, either in the near-horizon or far-field regions, modify these asymptotic oscillatory tails. Specifically, the power-law envelope transitions to a more complex oscillatory pattern, which cannot be easily fitted to a simple formula. This behavior is qualitatively different from the echoes of massless fields, which appear mainly during the quasinormal ringing stage and are considerably suppressed at the asymptotic tails. We show that in some models echoes may considerably amplify the signal at the stage of asymptotic tails.</description>

      <title>Geometrical-optics analysis of the interaction between light and gravitational waves from binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a situation in which light emitted from the neighborhood of a binary interacts with gravitational waves from the binary (e.g., a supermassive black hole binary in a quasar, a binary pulsar, etc.). The effect is cumulative over the long path lengths of light propagation and might be appreciable if the interaction initially takes place close to the source of gravitational waves, where the strain amplitude can be large. This situation can be modeled effectively using spherical gravitational waves (i.e., transverse-traceless radially propagating waves), with the strain amplitude varying with the distance from the source to a field point where the two wavefronts of light and gravitational waves meet each other. Our analysis employs geometrical-optics methods in curved spacetime, where the curvature is due to gravitational waves propagating in a flat spacetime background. We place a particular focus on the effect of gravitational Faraday rotation (or Skrotskii/Rytov effect) resulting from the interaction between light and gravitational waves from binaries.</description>

      <title>Proca stars in excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider families of solutions for excited states of Proca stars in spherical symmetry. We focus on the first two excited configurations and perform a series of fully non-linear dynamical simulations in order to study their properties and stability. Our analysis reveals that excited Proca stars are always unstable against even very small perturbations, and their dynamical evolution can lead to three different final states: collapse to a black hole, dissipation, or migration to a different configuration in the ground state. We find that migration to the ground state can only occur in a small region of the parameter space of solutions with negative binding energy.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian templates for phase evolution of spherical extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present various post-Newtonian (PN) models for the phase evolution of compact objects moving along quasi-spherical orbits in Kerr spacetime derived by using the 12PN analytic formulas of the energy, angular momentum and their averaged rates of change calculated in the framework of the black hole perturbation theory. To examine the convergence of time-domain PN models (TaylorT families), we evaluate the dephasing between approximants with different PN orders. We found that the TaylorT1 model shows the best performance and the performance of the TaylorT2 is the next best. To evaluate the convergence of frequency-domain PN models (TaylorF families), we evaluate the mismatch between approximants with different orders. We found that the performance of the TaylorF2 model is comparable with the TaylorT2 model. Although the TaylorT2 and TaylorF2 models are not so accurate as the TaylorT1, the fully analytical expressions give us easy-to-handle templates and are useful to discuss effects beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Birkhoff's Theorem and Uniqueness: A Peak Beyond General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In General Relativity, Birkhoff's theorem asserts that any spherically symmetric vacuum solution must be static and asymptotically flat. In this paper, we study the validity of Birkhoff's theorem for a broad class of modified gravity theories in four spacetime dimensions, including quadratic and higher-order gravity models. We demonstrate that the Schwarzschild spacetime remains the unique Einstein branch solution outside any spherically symmetric configuration of these theories. Consequently, unlike black holes, the breakdown of junction conditions at the surface of the star further implies that the actual spacetime metric outside a horizonless star in these modified theories cannot simultaneously be spherically symmetric and remain within the Einstein branch. This insight offers a unique observational probe for theories beyond General Relativity.</description>

      <title>A new rotating Lorentzian wormhole spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rotating version of a known static, spherically symmetric, zero Ricci scalar Lorentzian wormhole is constructed. It turns out that for this given non-rotating geometry, the standard Newman-Janis algorithm does not produce a rotating wormhole and, therefore, the method pioneered by Azreg-A\"inou has to be used. The rotating spacetime thus obtained is shown to be regular with wormhole features, though it is no longer a $R=0$ spacetime. The required matter is found to violate the energy conditions, as expected. A few other characteristic properties of this new rotating spacetime are mentioned. Finally, we calculate the shadow for this geometry and discuss its features {\em vis-a-vis} the Kerr geometry and available EHT observations.</description>

      <title>Angle of Null Energy Condition Lines in Critical Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a new critical parameter in Choptuik's gravitational collapse: the angle at which null energy condition (NEC) saturation lines intersect at the center of the critical spacetime. These NEC lines coincide with regions of vanishing curvature, dividing spacetime into stripes of positive and negative curvature. By numerically solving Choptuik's original system we find the NEC angle to be $\alpha\approx0.64$ ($\approx37^\circ$) and analytically derive $\alpha=2$arccot$(D-1)$ for any spacetime dimension $D&gt;3$.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes with Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact, spherically symmetric, static solution of the Einstein field equations minimally coupled to a self-interacting scalar field. The solution does not exhibit any zero proper volume singularity at the centre, and therefore, curvature scalars are always regular. We study the property of radial null geodesics and derive that the metric can describe either a two-way or a one-way traversable wormhole depending on certain parameter ranges. Notably, it lacks a Schwarzschild limit. The scalar field exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking within the coordinate range where a wormhole throat forms. It can be seen as a suggestion that spontaneous symmetry breaking may act as a threshold for wormhole throat formation. Additionally, we compute the radius of the photon sphere, the Lyapunov exponent, the shadow radius, and the innermost stable circular orbits for this spacetime metric.</description>

      <title>Is The Internal Entropy of F(R)-Gravity Really An Entropy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper connects two methods for finding the functional of entropy in F(R)-Gravity: Padmanabhan's and Hammad's. The resulting approach is simple to follow and yields entropy functional, which can be separated into two parts. The part unknown in General Relativity is often called in the literature as an internal entropy and this paper points on incompatibility between the internal entropy found from the entropy functional and the one found using conventional approach.</description>

      <title>Slowly rotating and charged Black-holes in Entangled Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled Relativity is a non-linear reformulation of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity (General Relativity) that offers a more parsimonious formulation. This non-linear approach notably requires the simultaneous definition of matter fields, thus aligning more closely with Einstein's \textit{principle of relativity of inertia} than General Relativity does. Solutions for spherically charged black holes have already been identified. After exploring further some of the properties of these solutions, we present new solutions for the field equations pertaining to slowly rotating charged black holes.</description>

      <title>Shadows of rotating black holes in effective quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, two new spherically symmetric black hole models with covariance have been proposed in effective quantum gravity. Based on these models, we use the modified Newman-Janis algorithm to generate two rotating quantum-corrected black hole solutions, characterized by three parameters, the mass $M$, the spin $a$, and the quantum parameter $\zeta$. To understand the effects of the quantum parameter $\zeta$ on these two rotating black holes, we investigate in detail the horizons and static limit surfaces. By constraining the possible range of the parameters, we study the shadows cast by these rotating black holes. The results indicate that for both rotating BHs, the parameter $\zeta$ mainly affects the shadow size in the non-extremal case, while it deforms the shadow shape by arising a cuspy edge in the near-extremal case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformally invariant scalar equation permits the Robin boundary condition at infinity of asymptotically-AdS spacetimes. We show how the dynamics of conformal cubic scalar field on the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-anti-de Sitter background depend on the black hole size, charge and the choice of the boundary condition. We study the whole range of admissible charges, including the extremal case. In particular, we observe the transition in stability of the field for large black holes at the specific critical value of the charge. Similarities between Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black hole let us suspect that similar effect may also occur in rotating black holes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the strong gravitational lensing effect around a spherically symmetric regular black hole, whose metric is derived from a non-singular collapsing dust ball model in asymptotically safe gravity. In this regular black hole spacetime, we obtain the analytical expression of the light deflection angle via calculating the strong field limit coefficients, and then evaluate the lensing observables in strong field regime by supposing the regular black holes as the candidate of $M87*$ and $SgrA*$ supermassive black holes, respectively. In addition, we also in detail analyze the effects of the scale parameter $\xi$ on the strong deflection angle and the lensing observables. We expect our results will be useful in the future to distinguish these non-singular black holes from their classical singular counterparts.</description>

      <title>Searching for quantum-gravity footprint around stellar-mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the asymptotically safe gravity, black holes can have characteristics different from those described according to general relativity. Particularly, they are more compact, with a smaller event horizon, which in turn affects the other quantities dependent on it, like the photon ring and the size of the innermost stable circular orbit. We decided to test the latter by searching in the literature for observational measurements of the emission from accretion disk around stellar-mass black holes. All published values of the radius of the inner accretion disk were made homogeneous by taking into account the most recent and more reliable values of mass, spin, viewing angle, and distance from the Earth. We do not find any significant deviation from the expectations of general relativity. Some doubtful cases can be easily understood as due to specific states of the object during the observation or instrumental biases.</description>

      <title>Mutual Influence of Photon Sphere and Non-Commutative Parameter in Various Non-Commutative Black Holes: Part I- Towards evidence for WGC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-commutative black holes(NCBH), due to the non-commutativity of spacetime coordinates, lead to a modification of the spacetime metric. By replacing the Dirac delta function with a Gaussian distribution, the mass is effectively smeared, eliminating point-like singularities. Our objective is to investigate the impact of this change on spacetime geodesics, including photon spheres and time-like orbits. We will demonstrate how the photon sphere can serve as a tool to classify spacetime, illustrating the influence of the NC parameter and constraining its values in various modes of these black holes. Additionally, using this classification, we will show how the addition of the nonlinear Einstein-Born-Infeld(BI) field to the model enhances its physical alignment with reality compared to the charged model. In the dS BI model, we will show how the study of the effective potential and photon sphere can provide insights into the initial structural status of the model, thereby establishing this potential as an effective tool for examining the initial conditions of black holes. Finally, by examining super-extremality conditions, we will show that the AdS BI model, with the necessary conditions, can be a suitable candidate for studying and observing the effects of the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC).</description>

      <title>Modeling lunar response to gravitational waves using normal-mode approach and tidal forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the light of the recent advances in lunar space missions a great interest into using Moon as a future environment for gravitational waves (GWs) detectors has been initiated. Moon offers a unique environment for such detectors due to constrained noise sources, since unlike Earth it does not have ocean and atmosphere. In this paper, we further explore the idea of using Moon as a giant resonator of GWs, a proposal that was first introduced by Weber in 1969. This idea is relaying on the theory how GWs interact with free masses and finally elastic solids, such as is a planet to some approximation. We start by carefully setting up General Relativity (physics) and elastic theory (geophysics) background to be able to derive analytically the coupling between GWs and elastic solids through associated equations of motion. Once the analytical solution is derived, we explore the parameter space this interaction depends on. This eventually provides us with the transfer function, which defines the frequency band of the interest. We show how this interaction robustly depends on the regolith structure by altering the initial lunar model and exploring different regolith models. Our results show that detection might be troublesome in the high frequency regime between 0.1 and 1 Hz, without beforehand constraining the regolith structure with geophysical methods. Finally, we discuss what are the implications of detecting these signals with the future GW detectors build on the Moon.</description>

      <title>Toward the Observation of Entangled Pairs in BEC analogue Expanding Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair creation is a fundamental prediction of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. While classical aspects of this phenomenon have been observed, the experimental confirmation of its quantum origin remains elusive. In this article, we quantify the entanglement produced by pair creation in a two dimensional Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) analogues of expanding universes and examine the impact of various experimental factors, including decoherence from thermal noise and losses. Our analysis evaluates the feasibility of detecting entanglement in these systems and identifies optimal experimental configurations for achieving this goal. Focusing on the experimental setup detailed in \cite{Viermann:2022wgw}, we demonstrate that entanglement can be observed in these BEC analogues at a significance level of $\sim 2\sigma$ with current capabilities, and at $\gtrsim 3.3\sigma$ with minor improvements. Achieving this would provide unequivocal evidence of the quantum nature of pair creation and validate one of the most iconic predictions of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of having relativistic quantum mechanics re-formulated with hydrodynamic variables, and specifically the problem of deriving the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations from the Dirac equation. The problem will be answered on a general manifold with torsion and gravity. We will demonstrate that when plane waves are considered the MPD equations acquire the form given in [1], but we will also see that in such a form the MPD equations become trivial.</description>

      <title>Strong Field Scattering of Black Holes: Assessing Resummation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in post-Minkowksian (PM) calculations have led to a fast-growing body of weak-field perturbative information. As such, there is major interest within the gravitational wave community as to how this information can be used to improve the accuracy of theoretical waveform models. In this work, we build on recent efforts to validate high-order PM calculations using numerical relativity simulations. We present a new set of high-energy scattering simulations for equal-mass, non-spinning binary black holes, further expanding the existing suite of NR simulations. We outline the basic features of three recently proposed resummation schemes (the $\mathscr{L}$-resummed model, the $w^\mathrm{eob}$ model and the SEOB-PM model) and compare the analytical predictions to our NR data. Each model is shown to demonstrate pathological behaviour at high energies, with common features such as PM hierarchical shifts and divergences. The NR data can also be used to calibrate pseudo-5PM corrections to the scattering angle or EOB radial potentials. In each case, we argue that including higher-order information improves the agreement between the analytical models and NR, though the extent of improvement depends on how this information is incorporated and the choice of analytical baseline. Finally, we demonstrate that further resummation of the EOB radial potentials could be an effective strategy to improving the model agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analytical expressions for the fluxes of energy and angular momentum from a point mass on an inclined spherical orbit about a Kerr black hole. The expressions are obtained using the method of Mano, Suzuki and Takasugi to construct analytical solutions of the Teukolsky equation, and are given as post-Newtonian expansions valid through 12PN, with arbitrary values for the inclination parameter $x$ and black hole spin $a$. We characterize the structure of the PN expansions in terms of their dependence on $x$ and $a$, and we validate our results against numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Dense Association of Stars in the Vicinity of the Supermassive Black Hole Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on a sample of 42 sources in the vicinity of the bow-shock source IRS 1W (N-sources), located at the distance of $6.05''$ north-east of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), within the radius of $1.35''$. We present the first proper motion measurements of N-sources and find that a larger subset of N-sources (28 sources) exhibit a north-westward flying angle. These sources can be bound by an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) or the concentration that we observe is due to a disk-like distribution projection along the line of sight. We detect the N-sources in $H$, $K_s$, and $L$' bands. The north-westward flying sources could be a bound collection of stars. We discuss a tentative existence of an IMBH or an inclined disk distribution to explain a significant overdensity of stars. The first scenario of having an IMBH implies the lower limit of $\sim 10^4~M_\odot$ for the putative IMBH. Our measurements for the first time reveal that the dense association of stars containing IRS 1W is a co-moving group of massive, young stars. This stellar association might be the remnant core of a massive stellar cluster that is currently being tidally stripped as it inspirals towards Sgr A*. The second scenario suggests that the appearance of the N-sources might be influenced by the projection of a disk-like distribution of younger He-stars and/or dust-enshrouded stars.</description>

      <title>Does decoherence violate decoupling?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent calculations in both flat and de Sitter spacetimes have highlighted a tension between the decoupling of high-energy physics from low-energy degrees of freedom and the expectation that quantum systems decohere due to interactions with unknown environments. In effective field theory (EFT), integrating out heavy fields should lead to Hamiltonian time evolution, which preserves the purity of low-energy states. This is consistent with the fact that we never observe isolated quantum states spontaneously decohering in the vacuum due to unknown high-energy physics. However, when a heavy scalar of mass $M$ is traced out, the resulting purity of a light scalar with mass $m$ typically appears to scale as a power of $1/M$ (when $m\ll M$), an effect that cannot be captured by a local effective Hamiltonian. We resolve this apparent paradox by showing that the purity depends on the resolution scale of the EFT and how the environment is traced out. We provide a practical method for diagnosing the purity of low-energy states consistent with EFT expectations, and briefly discuss some of the implications these observations have for how ultraviolet divergences can appear in decoherence calculations.</description>

      <title>Classical Observables from Causal Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the calculation of classical observables from causal response functions, following up on recent work by Caron-Huot at al. [JHEP 01 (2024) 139]. We derive a formula to compute asymptotic in-in observables from a particular soft limit of five-point amputated response functions. Using such formula, we re-derive the formulas by Kosower, Maybee and O'Connell (KMOC) for the linear impulse and radiated linear momentum of particles undergoing scattering, and we present an unambiguous calculation of the radiated angular momentum at leading order. Then, we explore the consequences of manifestly causal Feynman rules in the calculation of classical observables by employing the causal (Keldysh) basis in the in-in formalism. We compute the linear impulse, radiated waveform and its variance at leading and/or next-to-leading order in the causal basis, and find that all terms singular in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit cancel manifestly at the integrand level. We also find that the calculations simplify considerably and classical properties such as factorization of six-point amplitudes are more transparent in the causal basis.</description>

      <title>The origin channels of hierarchical binary black hole mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O1, O2, and O3 runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We infer the origin channels of hierarchical mergers observed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O1, O2, and O3 runs using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis under a parametric population model. By assuming the active galactic nucleus (ANG) disk and nuclear star cluster (NSC) channels, we find that NSCs likely dominate the hierarchical merger rate in the universe, corresponding to a fraction of $f_{\rm NSC}=0.87_{-0.29}^{+0.10}$ at 90\% credible intervals in our fiducial model; AGN disks may contribute up to nearly half of hierarchical mergers detectable with LVK, specifically $f_{\rm det,AGN}=0.34_{-0.26}^{+0.38}$. We investigate the impact of the escape speed, along with other population parameters on the branching fraction, suggesting that the mass, mass ratio, and spin of the sources play significant roles in population analysis. We show that hierarchical mergers constitute at least $\sim$$10\%$ of the gravitational wave events detected by LVK during the O1-O3 runs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is challenging to effectively infer detailed information about the host environment based solely on the distribution of black hole merger parameters if multiple formation channels are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the static planar black hole solutions in the STU model of the gauged $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity in four dimensions. We give a straightforward derivation of the equation of state of the purely electric and purely magnetic solutions with four charges. Then we give a simple proof that the determinant of the Hessian of the energy is always negative below some critical finite temperature for the purely electric solutions. We compute the spinodal line for the usual planar Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution in four dimensions. Inspired by the magnetic superalgebra we show that the supersymmetric solutions are metastable if the energy is restricted to satisfy the topological twist condition ab initio and it is shifted to be zero on the BPS solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on previous works, in this article we systematically analyze the implications of the explicit normal modes of a probe scalar sector in a BTZ background with a Dirichlet wall, in an asymptotically AdS-background. This is a Fuzzball-inspired geometric model, at least in an effective sense. We demonstrate explicitly that in the limit when the Dirichlet wall approaches the event horizon, the normal modes condense fast to yield an effective branch cut along the real line in the complex frequency plane. In turn, in this approximation, quasi-normal modes associated to the BTZ black hole emerge and the corresponding two-point function is described by a thermal correlator, associated with the Hawking temperature in the general case and with the right-moving temperature in the extremal limit. We further show, analytically, that the presence of a non-vanishing angular momentum non-perturbatively enhances this condensation. The consequences are manifold: {\it e.g.}~there is an emergent {\it strong thermalization} due to these modes, adding further support to a quantum chaotic nature associated to the spectral form factor. We explicitly demonstrate, by considering a classical collapsing geometry, that the one-loop scalar determinant naturally inherits a Dirichlet boundary condition, as the shell approaches the scale of the event horizon. This provides a plausible dynamical mechanism in the dual CFT through a global quench, that can create an emergent Dirichlet boundary close to the horizon-scale. We offer comments on how this simple model can describe salient features of Fuzzball-geometries, as well as of extremely compact objects. This also provides an explicit realization of how an effective thermal physics emerges from a non-thermal microscopic description, within a semi-classical account of gravity, augmented with an appropriate boundary condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential for generating an AMPS firewall from the replica wormhole topology, which describes the post-Page time spacetime in the evaporation process of a black hole. Our analysis reveals that this topology gives rise to a Dirac delta force experienced by infalling particles at the event horizon, consistent with the AMPS firewall hypothesis. This force, proportional to the particle's total energy squared, is a direct consequence of the inherent Dirac delta in the Ricci scalar of the replica wormhole. We provide a regularization scheme for this force, which is crucial for obtaining physically meaningful results. Notably, our approach suggests that considering the replica wormhole resolves both the information paradox and the AMPS argument regarding the monogamy of entanglement simultaneously, yielding a more coherent framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following our previous work on hybrid quantum states in the RST model, we study its most interesting solution representing a completely regular spacetime with the structure of causal diamond, containing an apparent horizon and radiation at infinity. Adapting recent computations of radiation entropy in terms of the entropy of entanglement, we find that this entropy follows a Page curve. This confirms our previous result [1], which was obtained by directly calculating the thermodynamic entropy of radiation at infinity. We also investigate the presence of a possible island in these systems, and find that it does not seem to play a role in contributing to the generalized black hole entropy.</description>

      <title>An Improved Bound on Nonlinear Quantum Mechanics using a Cryogenic Radio Frequency Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are strong arguments that quantum mechanics may be nonlinear in its dynamics. A discovery of nonlinearity would hint at a novel understanding of the interplay between gravity and quantum field theory, for example. As such, experiments searching for potential nonlinear effects in the electromagnetic sector are important. Here we outline such an experiment, consisting of a stream of random bits (which were generated using Rigetti's Aspen-M-3 chip) as input to an RF signal generator coupled to a cryogenic detector. Projective measurements of the qubit state, which is originally prepared in an equal superposition, serve as the random binary output of a signal generator. Thereafter, spectral analysis of the RF detector would yield a detectable excess signal predicted to arise from such a nonlinear effect. A comparison between the projective measurements of the quantum bits vs the classical baseline showed no power excess. This sets a new limit on the electromagnetic nonlinearity parameter $|\epsilon| \lessapprox 1.15 \times 10^{-12}$, at a 90.0% confidence level. This is the most stringent limit on nonlinear quantum mechanics thus far and an improvement by nearly a factor of 50 over the previous experimental limit.</description>

      <title>Non-Locality induces Isometry and Factorisation in Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In holography, two manifestations of the black hole information paradox are given by the non-isometric nature of the bulk-boundary map and by the factorisation puzzle. By considering time-shifted microstates of the eternal black hole, we demonstrate that both these puzzles may be simultaneously resolved by taking into account non-local quantum corrections that correspond to wormholes arising from state averaging. This is achieved by showing, using a resolvent technique, that the resulting Hilbert space for an eternal black hole in Anti-de Sitter space is finite-dimensional with a discrete energy spectrum. The latter gives rise to a transition to a type I von Neumann algebra.</description>

      <title>Chaos in hyperscaling violating Lifshitz theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We holographically study quantum chaos in hyperscaling-violating Lifshitz (HVL) theories (with charge). Particularly, we present a detailed computation of the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC) via the shockwave analysis in the bulk HVL geometry with a planar horizon topology. We also compute the butterfly velocity ($v_{B}$) using the entanglement wedge reconstruction and find that the result matches the one obtained from shockwave analysis. Furthermore, we analyze in detail, the behavior of $v_{B}$ with respect to the dynamical critical exponent (z), hyperscaling-violating parameter ($\theta$), charge (Q) and the horizon radius ($r_{h}$). We interestingly find non-monotonic behavior of $v_{B}$ with respect to z (in the allowed region and for certain (not all) fixed, permissible values of $\theta$, Q and $r_{h}$) and $\theta$ (in the allowed region and for certain (not all) fixed, permissible values of z, Q and $r_{h}$). Moreover, $v_{B}$ is found to monotonically decrease with an increase in charge (for all permissible, fixed values of z, $\theta$ and $r_{h}$), whereas it is found to monotonically increase with $r_{h}$ (for all fixed, permissible values of z, $\theta$ and Q). Unpacking these features can offer some valuable insights into the chaotic nature of HVL theories.</description>

      <title>A physical basis for cosmological correlators from cuts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the analytic structure of FRW wavefunction coefficients, facilitated by the development of efficient algorithms to derive the differential equations they satisfy. Moreover, recent findings indicate that the twisted cohomology of the associated hyperplane arrangement defining FRW integrals overestimates the number of integrals required to define differential equations for the wavefunction coefficient. We demonstrate that the associated dual cohomology is automatically organized in a way that is ideal for understanding and exploiting the cut/residue structure of FRW integrals. Utilizing this understanding, we develop a systematic approach to organize compatible sequential residues, which dictates the physical subspace of FRW integrals for any $n$-site, $\ell$-loop graph. In particular, the physical subspace of tree-level FRW wavefunction coefficients is populated by differential forms associated to cuts/residues that factorize the integrand of the wavefunction coefficient into only flat space amplitudes. After demonstrating the validity of our construction using intersection theory, we develop simple graphical rules for cut tubings that enumerate the space of physical cuts and, consequently, differential forms without any calculation.</description>

      <title>Improved Analytic Modeling of Neutron Star Interiors</title>

      <description>arXiv:1904.05954v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studies of neutron stars are extremely timely given the recent detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star merger GW170817, and an International Space Station payload NICER currently in operation that aims to determine radii of neutron stars to a precision better than 5%. In many cases, neutron star solutions are constructed numerically due to the complexity of the field equations with realistic equations of state. However, in order to relate observables like the neutron star mass and radius to interior quantities like central density and pressure, it would be useful to provide an accurate, analytic modeling of a neutron star interior. One such solution for static and isolated neutron stars is the Tolman VII solution characterized only by two parameters (e.g. mass and radius), though its agreement with numerical solutions is not perfect. We here introduce an improved analytic model based on the Tolman VII solution by introducing an additional parameter to make the analytic density profile agree better with the numerically obtained one. This additional parameter can be fitted in terms of the stellar mass, radius and central density in an equation-of-state-insensitive way. In most cases, we find that the new model more accurately describes realistic profiles than the original Tolman VII solution by a factor of 2-5. Our results are first-step calculations towards constructing analytic interior solutions for more realistic neutron stars under rotation or tidal deformation.</description>

      <title>Tidal effects in the gravitational-wave phase evolution of compact binary systems to next-to-next-to-leading post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.13367v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the gravitational-wave (GW) energy flux up to the next-to-next-to-leading (NNL) order of tidal effects in a spinless compact binary system on quasi-circular orbits. Starting from an effective matter action, we obtain the stress-energy tensor of the system, which we use in a GW generation formalism based on multipolar-post-Minkowskian (MPM) and post-Newtonian (PN) approximations. The tidal contributions to the multipole moments of the system are first obtained, from which we deduce the instantaneous GW energy flux to NNL order (formally 7PN order). We also include the remaining tidal contributions of GW tails to the leading (formally 6.5PN) and NL (7.5PN) orders. Combining it with our previous work on the conservative equations of motion (EoM) and associated energy, we get the GW phase and frequency evolution through the flux-balance equation to the same NNL order. These results extend and complete several preceding results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes induced by Stress Energy Conservation: combining Casimir Energy with a scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate possible manifolds characterizing traversable wormholes in the presence of a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity, which has both kinetic and potential energy. The feature of traversability requires the violation of the null energy condition, which, in turn, signals the existence of exotic matter with negative energy density. To achieve this, we introduce a hypothetical Casimir apparatus with plates positioned either at a parametrically fixed or radially varying distance. A consistent set of field equations requires the introduction of an auxiliary field composed solely of pressure terms, which we interpret as the gravitational back-reaction of the traversable wormhole to the original source. Interestingly, the only case that appears to avoid the need for such an auxiliary field involves a scalar field with potential energy, combined with a Casimir device with fixed plates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we show that in a particular braneworld scenario with variable brane tension, we obtain matter acting as dark energy while the gravitational constant $G$ promoted to a scalar field on the brane plays the role of matter (both in the sense they have an 'effective' Equation of State equivalent to that of dark energy and matter respectively). This result is interpreted from the Friedmann equation obtained from our model that exactly matches the standard Friedmann equation of General Relativity with a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in terms of the aforementioned quantities. The universe is assumed to consist of only matter and dark energy in this model which is a good approximation for our universe.</description>

Abstract: This letter extends previous findings on the modified Schr\"odinger evolution inspired by quantum gravity phenomenology. By establishing a connection between this approach and fractional quantum mechanics, we provide insights into a potential deep infrared regime of quantum gravity, characterized by the emergence of fractal dimensions, similar to behaviors observed in the deep ultraviolet regime. Additionally, we explore the experimental investigations of this regime using Bose-Einstein condensates. Notably, our analysis reveals a direct implication of this analogy: general experiments probing fractional quantum mechanics may serve as equivalent models of quantum gravity. We identify instances of nonlocal behavior in such systems, suggesting an analogous phenomenon of nonlocality in quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasinormal mode spectrum of black holes plays a crucial role in the modelling of post-merger ringdown signals. However, the spectrum is extremely sensitive to small deformations of the system and describes the linear response only in a certain (not precisely defined) timeframe after the merger. We argue here that the greybody factors, recently shown to describe the ringdown spectral amplitude at relatively high frequencies, are instead stable under small perturbations of the system and free of certain ambiguities that plague the quasinormal mode spectrum. Our analysis also unveils a nontrivial interplay: while certain ringdown quantities are dominated by the contribution of spectrally unstable quasinormal modes, these modes conspire to produce stable observables. Thus, we propose a complementary approach to ringdown studies, which circumvents some limitations of the standard quasinormal mode description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05270v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the metric of a circular chiral vorton in the weak field limit. The object is self-supporting by means of its chiral current. A conical singularity with deficit angle, identical to that of straight string with the same linear mass density, is present at the vorton's core. We find that the metric is akin to the electromagnetic $4$-potential of a circular current wire loop, illustrating the concept of gravito-electromagnetism. Surprisingly we find that the solution asymptotically mimics a Kerr-like naked singularity with mass $M_v=4\pi R\mu$ and spin parameter $a=R/2$. Finally, we also simulate the gravitational lensing images by solving the corresponding null geodesic equations. This reveals interesting properties of the images, such as the simultaneous creation of a minimally distorted source image and its Einstein ring, as well as the formation of double images on the back side of the ring.</description>

Higher-order derivative profiles proposed for gravitational collapse, etc [2] are shortly discussed.</description>

      <title>Resonant excitation of eccentricity in spherical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational radiation reaction, has been one of the fundamental issues in general relativity. Over a span of decades, this process has been analyzed in the adiabatic limit, in order to comprehend how it drives extreme-mass-ratio binaries, that are prime targets for space-borne detectors. It has been shown that spherical orbits around Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes remain spherical (zero eccentricity) under the influence of gravitational radiation reaction. Here, we show that spherical orbits in non-Kerr black holes, that still preserve most of the good qualities and symmetries of Kerr spacetime, can access certain resonances in such a way that an initially spherical inspiral acquires non-zero eccentricity and becomes non-spherical. Therefore, the crossing of resonances under radiation reaction interrupts and even inverts, up to some small radius close to plunge, the process of circularization of orbits. The strength of resonant excitation of eccentricity depends on the initial position and inclination of the integrable extreme-mass-ratio system, as well as the integrability-breaking parameter introduced in the background spacetime that amplifies further the excitation. We find that the harmonics of gravitational waves emitted from these inspirals undergo a frequency modulation as the orbit `metamorphoses' from spherical to non-spherical, due to the effect of resonant eccentricity excitation. The gain that low-amplitude harmonics experience in these oligochromatic EMRIs, due to resonances, may be detectable with future spaceborne detectors and serves as an indicator of non-Kerrness of the background spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, metrics that describe regular black holes, extreme black holes, or traversable wormholes have been widely discussed. These spacetimes, appearing in scenarios such as the brane world, are contingent on the values of the parameters, with each metric encompassing all three objects. We are considering various known models for these black hole/wormhole interpolating spacetimes and showing that, starting from the macroscopic black holes, all of them must evaporate into macroscopic wormholes, thus avoiding existential problems related to the final stages of black hole evaporation and issues of quantum gravity and black hole remnants. For this purpose, we are calculating the energy emission rates of black holes and the appropriate lifetimes. We argue that some of our conclusions should hold regardless of the specific model, as long as it permits an extremal black hole state with zero temperature at a particular value of the coupling constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the evaporation behaviors of asymptotically flat charged black holes in the Einstein-Horndeski gravity theory. Based on the thermodynamics of the Horndeski black hole, we present a physical understanding of the scalar charge of the Horndeski black hole and also clarify its connection to the Einstein vector theory. As the presence of non-minimal coupling, the evaporating behaviors of the Horndeski black hole are vastly different from the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole case. Due to the different spacetime and electric field structures, the evaporation rate of the Horndeski black hole will slow down at the late stage of evaporation and thus gain a lifetime much longer than the RN black hole. These results illuminate the effect of non-minimally coupled matters on the black hole evaporation and provide clues to search for these matter fields in future observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study four classical tests of Schwarzschild space-time with Lorentzian distribution in non-commutative geometry. We performed detailed calculations of the first-order corrections induced by the non-commutative parameter on planetary orbital precession, light deflection, radar wave delay, and gravitational redshift. The study showed that the impact of the non-commutative parameter on timelike geodesics is significantly greater than its effect on null geodesics. Using precise experimental observations, the allowable range for the non-commutative parameter is ultimately constrained within $\Theta\leq0.067579~\mathrm{m}^{2}$, which is given by Mercury's orbital precession. This result aligns with the view that $\sqrt{\Theta}$ is on the order of the Planck length. Moreover, the constrained parameter range exceeds the Planck scale by a significant margin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an effective cosmological spin-foam model for a (2+1) dimensional spatially flat universe, discretized on a hypercubical lattice, containing both space- and time-like regions. Our starting point is the recently proposed coherent state spin-foam model for (2+1) Lorentzian quantum gravity. The full amplitude is assumed to factorize into single vertex amplitudes with boundary data corresponding to Lorentzian 3-frusta. A stationary phase approximation is performed at each vertex individually, where the inverse square root of the Hessian determinant serves as a measure for the effective path integral. Additionally, a massive scalar field is coupled to the geometry, and we show that its mass renders the partition function convergent. For a single 3-frustum with time-like struts, we compute the expectation value of the bulk strut length and show that it generically agrees with the classical solutions and that it is a discontinuous function of the scalar field mass. Allowing the struts to be space-like introduces causality violations, which drive the expectation values away from the classical solutions due to the lack of an exponential suppression of these configurations. This is a direct consequence of the semi-classical amplitude only containing the real part of deficit angles, in contrast with the Lorentzian Regge action used in effective spin-foams. We give an outlook on how to evaluate the partition function on an extended discretization including a bulk spatial slice. This serves as a foundation for future investigations of physically interesting scenarios such as a quantum bounce or the viability of massive scalar field clocks. Our results demonstrate that the effective path integral in the causally regular sector serves as a viable quantum cosmology model, but that the agreement of expectation values with classical solutions is tightly bound to the path integral measure.</description>

      <title>The Lense-Thirring effect at work in M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the temporal evolution of the angles characterizing the spatial configuration of the jet in the supermassive black hole M87$^\ast$ was measured exhibiting a precessional pattern around the hole's spin axis. It would be due to the dragging induced by the fact that the hole's external spacetime is described by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense-Thirring orbital precessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object, calculated perturbatively to the first post-Newtonian order, are able to fully reproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87$^\ast$. In particular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of the accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular orbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense-Thirring precessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of $0.56\pm 0.02$ radians per year of the jet's one is satisfied for a range of physically meaningful values of the hole's spin parameter, close to unity, and of the effective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii. Relying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the angle between the hole's spin axis and the jet's one stays constant over the years amounting to $1.16^\circ$, in agreement with its measured value of $1.25^\circ\pm 0.18^\circ$. Furthermore, also the temporal pattern and the amplitudes of the time series of the jet's angles are reproduced by the aforementioned Lense-Thirring precessional model.</description>

      <title>Subregion-subalgebra duality: emergence of space and time in holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In holographic duality, a higher dimensional quantum gravity system emerges from a lower dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) with a large number of degrees of freedom. We propose a formulation of duality for a general causally complete bulk spacetime region, called subregion-subalgebra duality, which provides a framework to describe how geometric notions in the gravity system, such as spacetime subregions, different notions of times, and causal structure, emerge from the dual CFT. Subregion-subalgebra duality generalizes and brings new insights into subregion-subregion duality (or equivalently entanglement wedge reconstruction). It provides a mathematically precise definition of subregion-subregion duality and gives an independent definition of entanglement wedges without using entropy. Geometric properties of entanglement wedges, including those that play a crucial role in interpreting the bulk as a quantum error correcting code, can be understood from the duality as the geometrization of the superadditivity of certain algebras. Using general boundary subalgebras rather than those associated with geometric subregions makes it possible to find duals for general bulk spacetime regions, including those not touching the boundary. Applying subregion-subalgebra duality to a boundary state describing a single-sided black hole also provides a precise way to define mirror operators.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave seismology of charged strange stars in the Cowling approximation: the fluid pulsation modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study, within the framework of Cowling approximation, the effect of the electric charge on the gravitational wave frequency of fluid oscillation modes of strange quark stars. For this purpose, the dense matter of the stellar fluid is described by the MIT bag model equation of state (EoS), while for the electric charge profile, we consider that the electric charge density is proportional to the energy density. We find that the gravitational wave frequencies change with the increment of electric charge; these effects are more noticeable at higher total mass values. We obtain that the $f$-mode is very sensitive to the change in the electric charge of the star. Furthermore, in the case of the $p_1$ mode, the effect of the electric charge is not very significant. Our results reveal that the study of the fundamental pulsation mode of an electrically charged compact star is very important in distinguishing whether compact stars could contain electric charge. We also employ another electric charge distribution profile that follows a power law, and it is found that the $f$-mode change is more noticeable than the $p_1$-mode when the electric charge is incremented.</description>

      <title>Axion species scale and axion weak gravity conjecture-like bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a cutoff scale of quantum gravity, the species scale can be defined by the scale at which the perturbativity of the non-renormalizable gravitational interaction begins to break down. Since it is determined by the number of species in the effective field theory, we can find the close connection to the distance conjecture, which predicts the lowering of the cutoff at the asymptotic limit of the moduli space caused by the descent of a tower of states from UV. Meanwhile, the same kind of the cutoff scale can be obtained from any non-renormalizable interaction, in particular the interaction between the axion and the gauge field through the $\theta F\wedge F$ term. Demanding this `axion species scale' not to exceed the gravitational species scale, we obtain the bound $(8\pi^2/g^2)f \lesssim M_{\rm Pl}$. This is quite similar to the axion weak gravity conjecture bound, but can be applied to any gauge as well as the string interactions which are relevant to towers of states. We also investigate the implications of the (axion) species scale and the axion weak gravity conjecture-like bound by considering the Peccei-Quinn charge reduction of black hole through the interaction between black hole and the string or wormhole.</description>

      <title>Dual balanced readout for scattered light noise mitigation in Michelson interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to detect the minuscule distance change between test masses caused by gravitational waves. Stray light that scatters back into the interferometer causes transient signals that can cover the same frequency range as a potential gravitational wave signal. Scattered light noise is a potentially limiting factor in current and future detectors thus making it relevant to find new ways to mitigate it. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a technique for the subtraction of scattered light noise from the displacement readout of a Michelson interferometer. It is based on using a balanced homodyne detector at both the symmetric and the antisymmetric port. While we have been able to demonstrate a noise reduction of \SI{13.2}{\decibel}, the readout scheme seems to be only limited by the associated noise couplings, with no theoretical limit to the scattered light suppression itself other than shot noise. We also discuss challenges for using the dual balanced homodyne detection scheme in more complex interferometer topologies, which could lead to improvements in scattered light noise mitigation of gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way accretion history compared to cosmological simulations -- from bulge to dwarf galaxy infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic halos are known to grow hierarchically, inside out. This implies a correlation between the infall lookback time of satellites and their binding energy. Cosmological simulations predict a linear relation between the infall lookback time and the logarithm of the binding energy, with a small scatter. Gaia measurements of the bulk proper motions of globular clusters and dwarf satellites of the Milky Way are sufficiently accurate to establish the kinetic energies of these systems. Assuming the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, we can deduce the binding energies of the dwarf satellites and those of the galaxies that were previously accreted by the Milky Way. This can be compared to cosmological simulations for the first time. The relation of the infall lookback time versus binding energy we found in a cosmological simulation matches that for the early accretion events when the simulated total Milky Way mass within 21 kpc was rescaled to 2 $10^{11}$ solar masses. This agrees well with previous estimates from globular cluster kinematics and from the rotation curve. However, the vast majority of the dwarf galaxies are clear outliers to this rescaled relation, unless they are very recent infallers. In other words, the very low binding energies of most dwarf galaxies compared to Sgr and previous accreted galaxies suggests that most of them were accreted much later than 8 or even 5 Gyr ago. We also found that the subhalo systems in some cosmological simulations are too dynamically hot when they are compared to identified Milky Way substructures. This leads to an overestimated impact of satellites on the Galaxy rotation curve.</description>

      <title>Diving into a multi-band holographic superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the interior structure of a multi-band holographic superconductor model. We focus on the holographic superconductor system with two scalar fields which correspond to two s-wave order parameters in the dual condensed matter system. With two s-wave order parameters, the boundary system has more interesting behaviors which can also be reflected in black hole interior structure. We find the Einstein-Rosen bridge collapse and Josephson oscillations of two scalar fields inside the horizon. For the region near the singularity, we find that the metric still presents Kasner form and there is also Kasner transition behavior. However, when two scalar fields coexist, the Kasner exponents and Kasner transition formula will be different from the single scalar field case. The different interior structures between multi-band holographic superconductor and single-band holographic superconductor we find in this work further confirms that the black hole interior is important to reflect the properties of dual condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Flat limit of AdS/CFT from AdS geodesics: scattering amplitudes and antipodal matching of Li\'enard-Wiechert fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the flat limit of AdS/CFT from the point of view of geodesics in AdS. We show that the flat space scattering amplitudes can be constructed from operator insertions where the geodesics of the particles corresponding to the operators hit the conformal boundary of AdS. Further, we compute the Li\'enard-Wiechert solutions in AdS by boosting a static charge using AdS isometries and show that the solutions are antipodally matched between two regions, separated by a global time difference of $\Delta\tau=\pi$. Going to the boundary of AdS along null geodesics, in the flat limit, this antipodal matching leads to the flat space antipodal matching near spatial infinity.</description>
