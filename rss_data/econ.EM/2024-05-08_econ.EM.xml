      <title>A quantile-based nonadditive fixed effects model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I propose a quantile-based nonadditive fixed effects panel model to study heterogeneous causal effects. Similar to standard fixed effects (FE) model, my model allows arbitrary dependence between regressors and unobserved heterogeneity, but it generalizes the additive separability of standard FE to allow the unobserved heterogeneity to enter nonseparably. Similar to structural quantile models, my model's random coefficient vector depends on an unobserved, scalar ''rank'' variable, in which outcomes (excluding an additive noise term) are monotonic at a particular value of the regressor vector, which is much weaker than the conventional monotonicity assumption that must hold at all possible values. This rank is assumed to be stable over time, which is often more economically plausible than the panel quantile studies that assume individual rank is iid over time. It uncovers the heterogeneous causal effects as functions of the rank variable. I provide identification and estimation results, establishing uniform consistency and uniform asymptotic normality of the heterogeneous causal effect function estimator. Simulations show reasonable finite-sample performance and show my model complements fixed effects quantile regression. Finally, I illustrate the proposed methods by examining the causal effect of a country's oil wealth on its military defense spending.</description>

      <title>A Primer on the Analysis of Randomized Experiments and a Survey of some Recent Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The past two decades have witnessed a surge of new research in the analysis of randomized experiments. The emergence of this literature may seem surprising given the widespread use and long history of experiments as the "gold standard" in program evaluation, but this body of work has revealed many subtle aspects of randomized experiments that may have been previously unappreciated. This article provides an overview of some of these topics, primarily focused on stratification, regression adjustment, and cluster randomization.</description>

      <title>Detailed Gender Wage Gap Decompositions: Controlling for Worker Unobserved Heterogeneity Using Network Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in the literature of decomposition methods in economics have allowed for the identification and estimation of detailed wage gap decompositions. In this context, building reliable counterfactuals requires using tighter controls to ensure that similar workers are correctly identified by making sure that important unobserved variables such as skills are controlled for, as well as comparing only workers with similar observable characteristics. This paper contributes to the wage decomposition literature in two main ways: (i) developing an economic principled network based approach to control for unobserved worker skills heterogeneity in the presence of potential discrimination; and (ii) extending existing generic decomposition tools to accommodate for potential lack of overlapping supports in covariates between groups being compared, which is likely to be the norm in more detailed decompositions. We illustrate the methodology by decomposing the gender wage gap in Brazil.</description>

      <title>Two-way Fixed Effects and Differences-in-Differences Estimators in Heterogeneous Adoption Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider treatment-effect estimation under a parallel trends assumption, in heterogeneous adoption designs where no unit is treated at period one, and units receive a weakly positive dose at period two. First, we develop a test of the assumption that the treatment effect is mean independent of the treatment, under which the commonly-used two-way-fixed-effects estimator is consistent. When this test is rejected, we propose alternative, robust estimators. If there are stayers with a period-two treatment equal to 0, the robust estimator is a difference-in-differences (DID) estimator using stayers as the control group. If there are quasi-stayers with a period-two treatment arbitrarily close to zero, the robust estimator is a DID using units with a period-two treatment below a bandwidth as controls. Finally, without stayers or quasi-stayers, we propose non-parametric bounds, and an estimator relying on a parametric specification of treatment-effect heterogeneity. We use our results to revisit Pierce and Schott (2016) and Enikolopov et al. (2011).</description>

      <title>A Heteroskedasticity-Robust Overidentifying Restriction Test with High-Dimensional Covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.00171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an overidentifying restriction test for high-dimensional linear instrumental variable models. The novelty of the proposed test is that it allows the number of covariates and instruments to be larger than the sample size. The test is scale-invariant and is robust to heteroskedastic errors. To construct the final test statistic, we first introduce a test based on the maximum norm of multiple parameters that could be high-dimensional. The theoretical power based on the maximum norm is higher than that in the modified Cragg-Donald test (Koles\'{a}r, 2018), the only existing test allowing for large-dimensional covariates. Second, following the principle of power enhancement (Fan et al., 2015), we introduce the power-enhanced test, with an asymptotically zero component used to enhance the power to detect some extreme alternatives with many locally invalid instruments. Finally, an empirical example of the trade and economic growth nexus demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed test.</description>

      <title>Transfer Estimates for Causal Effects across Heterogeneous Sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01435v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of extrapolating treatment effects across heterogeneous populations (``sites"/``contexts"). We consider an idealized scenario in which the researcher observes cross-sectional data for a large number of units across several ``experimental" sites in which an intervention has already been implemented to a new ``target" site for which a baseline survey of unit-specific, pre-treatment outcomes and relevant attributes is available. Our approach treats the baseline as functional data, and this choice is motivated by the observation that unobserved site-specific confounders manifest themselves not only in average levels of outcomes, but also how these interact with observed unit-specific attributes. We consider the problem of determining the optimal finite-dimensional feature space in which to solve that prediction problem. Our approach is design-based in the sense that the performance of the predictor is evaluated given the specific, finite selection of experimental and target sites. Our approach is nonparametric, and our formal results concern the construction of an optimal basis of predictors as well as convergence rates for the estimated conditional average treatment effect relative to the constrained-optimal population predictor for the target site. We quantify the potential gains from adapting experimental estimates to a target location in an application to conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs using a combined data set from five multi-site randomized controlled trials.</description>
