      <title>Bright yet dark: how strong coupling quenches exciton-polariton radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the radiative decay of exciton-polaritons is essential for achieving long-lived polaritons - a key prerequisite for enhancing nonlinear and quantum polaritonic effects. However, conventional wisdom - the coupled oscillator model - often oversimplifies polariton radiation as independent emissions from uncoupled excitonic and photonic resonances, overlooking the role of strong exciton-photon coupling in reshaping their radiative behavior. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that goes beyond the conventional coupled oscillator model by fully accounting for the collective and coherent nature of exciton-photon interactions. We demonstrate that these interactions can strongly suppress polariton radiation via destructive interference - both within the excitonic ensemble and between excitonic and photonic radiation channels - giving rise to polaritonic bound states in the continuum with infinitely long radiative lifetimes. Our approach offers a unified description of polariton radiative decay and establishes new design principles for engineering long-lived exciton-polaritons with tailored radiation properties, opening new avenues for nonlinear, topological, and quantum polaritonic applications.</description>

      <title>Electric-Magnetic-Switchable Free-Space Skyrmions in Toroidal Light Pulses via a Nonlinear Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances reveal that light propagation in free space supports many exotic topological textures, such as skyrmions. Their unique space-time topologies make them promising candidates as next-generation robust information carriers. Hence, the ability of switching different texture modes is highly demanded to serve as a manner of data transfer. However, previous studies focus on generation of one specific mode, lacking integrated devices with externally variable and stable mode generation capability. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the first realization of switchable skyrmions between electric and magnetic modes in toroidal light pulses using a nonlinear metasurface platform in terms of broadband terahertz generation driven by vectorial pulse. The spatial and temporal evolutions of them are also clearly observed. Our work establishes a new paradigm for manipulating and switching topologically structured light.</description>

      <title>Observation of nonlinear topological corner states originating from different spectral charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) are unique topological materials supporting edge states with the dimensionality at least by two lower than the dimensionality of the underlying structure. HOTIs were observed on lattices with different symmetries, but only in geometries, where truncation of HOTI produces a finite structure with the same order of discrete rotational symmetry as that of the unit cell, thereby setting the geometry of insulator edge. Here we experimentally demonstrate a new type of two-dimensional (2D) HOTI based on the Kekule-patterned lattice, whose order of discrete rotational symmetry differs from that of the unit cells of the constituent honeycomb lattice, with hybrid boundaries that help to produce all three possible corners that support effectively 0D corner states of topological origin, especially the one associated with spectral charge 5/6. We also show that linear corner states give rise to rich families of stable hybrid nonlinear corner states bifurcating from them in the presence of focusing nonlinearity of the material. Such new types of nonlinear corner states are observed in hybrid HOTI inscribed in transparent nonlinear dielectric using fs-laser writing technique. Our results complete the class of HOTIs and open the way to observation of topological states with new internal structure and symmetry.</description>

      <title>Ion-Beam-Sputtered Mid-Infrared Coatings for Hybrid Supermirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the development of low-loss ion-beam-sputtered (IBS) mid-infrared coatings for hybrid supermirrors. Two highly reflective designs were realized: HR1, a 4-period a-Si/SiO$_2$ DBR with an Al$_2$O$_3$ bonding layer, and HR2, a 6-period a-Si/Ta$_2$O$_5$ DBR with an a-Si terminating layer for bonding. Combined with a GaAs/AlGaAs crystalline mirror, HR2-based hybrids yielded a total loss of 9.3 ppm and excess loss of 6.8 ppm at 4.45 $\mu$m, with cavity finesse up to 396000. For the first time, we used IBS-deposited a-Si directly as a bonding layer, verified its sub-angstrom roughness, and demonstrated excellent performance. This establishes a clear path toward scalable coatings for longer mid-infrared wavelengths, building on prior results in Nat. Commun. 14, 7846 (2023).</description>

      <title>Ultrafast nonlinear dynamics of indium tin oxide nanocrystals probed via fieldoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable, high-speed, small-footprint photonic switching platforms are essential for advancing optical communication. An effective optical switch must operate at high duty cycles with fast recovery times, while maintaining substantial modulation depth and full reversibility. Colloidal nanocrystals, such as indium tin oxide (ITO), offer a scalable platform to meet these requirements. In this work, the transmission of ITO nanocrystals near their epsilon-near-zero wavelength is modulated by two-cycle optical pulses at a repetition rate of one megahertz. The modulator exhibits a broad bandwidth spanning from 2 um to 2.5 um. Sensitive fieldoscopy measurements resolve the transient electric-field response of the ITO for the first time, showing that the modulation remains reversible for excitation fluences up to 1.2 mJ/cm2 with a modulation depth of 10%, and becomes fully irreversible beyond 3.3 mJ/cm2, while reaching modulation depth of up to 20%. Field sampling further indicates that at higher excitation fluences, the relative contribution from the first cycle of the optical pulses is reduced. These findings are crucial for the development of all-optical switching, telecommunications, and sensing technologies capable of operating at terahertz switching frequencies.</description>

      <title>Broadband birefringence spectroscopy with sub-kHz precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although current amorphous high-reflective mirror coatings have had tremendous success in metrology applications, they are inherently limited by thermal fluctuations in their coating structure. Alternatively, crystalline coating technology has demonstrated superior thermal noise performance. However, recent studies have revealed birefringent noise sources, raising questions about the limits of frequency stability of high-finesse cryogenic silicon cavities with crystalline mirror coatings. Here, we show the applicability of cavity-mode dispersion spectroscopy to measure birefringent cavity mode splitting. We measured birefringence induced cavity mode splitting by probing the resonance frequencies of a high-finesse, ultra-low expansion glass cavity with all-crystalline mirror coatings, reaching fractional frequency sensitivity of \SI{5e-14}{} utilizing an optical frequency comb for two orthogonal polarizations. Subsequently, we calculated the static birefringent splitting of the refractive index for \SI{23.8}{\celsius} and \SI{31.3}{\celsius} on the order of \SI{802 \pm 7}{ppm} and \SI{772 \pm 7}{ppm} over \SI{30}{nm} respectively. Furthermore, we propose measurements of dispersive birefringent noise based on optical frequency combs. Our results not only extend the use of optical frequency combs to measure static birefringence, but also implicate a possibility to further study spectrally dependent frequency noise.</description>

      <title>Permittivity-asymmetric qBIC metasurfaces for refractive index sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) provide exceptional light confinement due to their inherent decoupling from radiative channels. Small symmetry breaking transforms BIC into quasi-BIC (qBIC) that couples to free-space radiation enabling ultra-high-quality-factor (Q-factor) resonances desirable for refractive index (RI) sensing. In practical implementations, geometric asymmetry is typically employed. However, since the radiative loss remains fixed once fabricated, such metasurfaces exhibit only a horizontal translation of the resonance spectrum in RI sensing, without modification of its overall shape. Here, we demonstrate a permittivity-asymmetric qBIC ({\epsilon}-qBIC) metasurface, which encodes environmental refractive index variations directly into the asymmetry factor, resulting in indexes response involving both resonance wavelength shift and modulation variation. In addition to exhibiting a competitive transmittance sensitivity of ~5300%/RIU under single-wavelength conditions, the {\epsilon}-qBIC design provides a substantially improved linear response. Specifically, the linear window area of its sensing data distribution, calculated as the integrated wavelength region where the linearity parameter remains above the preset threshold, is 104 times larger than that of the geometry-asymmetric qBIC (g-qBIC), enabling more robust and reliable single-wavelength signal readout. Additionally, numerical results reveal that environmental permittivity asymmetry can optically restore the g-qBIC to a state with ultra-high-Q (over 10^7), approaching to BIC condition. Unlike traditional BICs, which are typically inaccessible once perturbed, the permittivity-restored BIC becomes accessible through environmental perturbations. These findings suggest an alternative design strategy for developing high-performance photonic devices for practical sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Vectorial microlasers with designable topological charges based on M\"{o}bius-like correspondence in quasi-BICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control topological properties of laser emission represents a fundamental advancement in photonic technology. Achieving topological laser in a single compact photonic structure is crucial for device integration and miniaturization but faces significant challenges for designing both the high-quality (high-Q) mode and radiative topological configurations. Recently, bound states in the continuum (BICs), as extraordinary states possessing both ultrahigh Q factors and polarization topological charges, have been demonstrated as a promising platform for compact topological lasers. However, as the cornerstone of BIC lasing's non-trivial properties, topological charges of BICs are protected by real-space structural symmetries, which simultaneously impose fundamental limitations that hinder their designability of lasing topological charges. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a compound cavity design method based on the M\"{o}bius-like correspondence in quasi-BICs (q-BICs), by which compact vectorial microlasers with designable topological charges can be realized. We reveal the hidden connection between real-space symmetry breaking and eigen-polarizations of q-BICs from the triangular photonic crystal (PhC) slab, manifesting as a M\"{o}bius-like correspondence. By splicing PhC slab sectors utilizing this M\"{o}bius-like correspondence, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between compound cavities and their lasing topological charges. Vectorial lasing with designable topological charges from $-5$ to $+5$ were experimentally realized. Our work establishes a novel BIC-based platform that enables designable topological lasing, providing a promising route toward compact topological sources.</description>

      <title>Experimental Construction of NOON State Dynamics in Photonic Flat Band Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport of path-entangled multi-photon NOON states in a flat-band photonic rhombic lattice and observe intriguing localization-delocalization features that depend on the phase as well as the photon number of the NOON states. To experimentally emulate photon number correlations, we develop an intensity correlation measurement protocol using coherent laser light with tunable relative phases. We first apply this protocol to show spatial bunching and anti-bunching of two-photon NOON states in a one-dimensional lattice consisting of identical waveguides. In the case of the rhombic lattice, we show that for an even (odd) photon number $N$, localization occurs at $0 \, (\pi)$ phase of the NOON state with a probability of $2^{1-N}$. Our results open an exciting route toward predicting quantum interference of correlated photons in complex photonic networks.</description>

      <title>Application of Super-Sampling to Microscopy Images Produces Image Resolution below Optical Diffraction Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image Phase Alignment Super-Sampling (ImPASS) is a computational imaging algorithm for converting a sequence of displaced low-resolution images into a single high-resolution image. The method consists of a unique combination of Phase Correlation image registration and SeDDaRA blind deconvolution. The method has previously been validated in simulations and applied successfully to images captured in a laboratory setting. As discussed here, the performance of ImPASS surpasses similar methods that provide quantitative results. ImPASS is applied for the first time to images taken by a widefield microscope, requiring no customization other than a translation stage, to determine if this approach can subceed the diffraction limit for this application. The 80-frame image sets had as targets a slide with a slice of Porcine Cornea, and a standard US Air Force resolution chart, providing quantitative and quantitative assessments. The sets were up-sampled by a factor of eight, aligned, combined, and processed. The measurement revealed that image resolution improved by a factor of 2.68 and subceeded the diffraction limit by a factor of 1.79.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency infrared upconversion imaging with nonlinear silicon metasurfaces empowered by quasi-bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared imaging is indispensable for its ability to penetrate obscurants and visualize thermal signatures, yet its practical use is hindered by the intrinsic limitations of conventional detectors. Nonlinear upconversion, which converts infrared light into the visible band, offers a promising pathway to address these challenges. Here, we demonstrate high-efficiency infrared upconversion imaging using nonlinear silicon metasurfaces. By strategically breaking in-plane symmetry, the metasurface supports a high-$Q$ quasi-bound states in the continuum resonance, leading to strongly enhanced third-harmonic generation (THG) with a conversion efficiency of $3\times10^{-5}$ at a pump intensity of 10 GW/cm$^{2}$. Through this THG process, the metasurface enables high-fidelity upconversion of arbitrary infrared images into the visible range, achieving a spatial resolution of $\sim 6$ $\upmu$m as verified using a resolution target and various customized patterns. This work establishes a robust platform for efficient nonlinear conversion and imaging, highlighting the potential of CMOS-compatible silicon metasurfaces for high-performance infrared sensing applications with reduced system complexity.</description>

      <title>The Spontaneous Cascading Mechanism Behind Critical Phenomena in Self-Coupled Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basic physics of lasers is characterized by a second-order continuous phase transition at the critical lasing threshold. Nevertheless, laser bistability with abrupt transitions has been reported in some laser systems, but its underlying mechanism has never been explored. Here we study experimentally and theoretically a novel nonlinearly self-coupled laser system. We show both experimentally and theoretically that this system experiences spontaneous cascading that yields an abrupt mixed-order transition. At the critical point, a long-lived cascading plateau is observed, characterized by a critical branching factor equal to one. When deviating from criticality, the branching factor departs monotonically from one. The critical scaling close to and at the critical point resembles similar phenomena observed recently in other interdependent systems, suggesting a common universal cascading origin for abrupt transitions. Our results shed light on the cascading mechanism of abrupt transitions in laser systems, which can be utilized for future research and applications.</description>

      <title>Optical Integration With Heralded Single Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform optical integration with heralded single photons and investigate the role played by the spatial correlation between the photons in this task. To address this, we experimentally investigate the use of the transverse spatial degrees of freedom of light in an optical processing scheme utilizing heralded single photons. The integration is realized over the binary phases encoded with a phase-only spatial light modulator assisted by polarization. As a result, while spatially uncorrelated photons can capture the global properties of an image displayed in a spatial light modulator, correlated photons capture the local properties of the image better. Also, emphasize the strong connection between the optical integration scheme implemented here and the DQC1 (deterministic quantum computation with one qubit) model.</description>

      <title>Single atom enables extraordinary light transmission through zero-mode waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a theory of light transmission through a Zero-Mode Waveguide (ZMW) containing a single atom. It is shown that the presence of a single atom inside the ZMW can lead to either a significant enhancement or suppression of light transmission, depending on the detuning of the excitation field frequency from the atomic resonance. This extraordinary transmission and blocking effect can be employed for studying the spatiotemporal dynamics of atoms in complex nanoscopic environments, probing quantum optical phenomena, and developing novel nano-optical devices.</description>

      <title>Scalability of On-chip Diffractive Optical Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18493v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This short report focuses on the scalability challenges of the on-chip diffractive optical neural networks. It addresses an emerging gap in the literature, specifically around the limitations and challenges of scaling optical neural networks on a chip. A thorough investigation of diffractive optical neural networks provides evidence that such networks are not capable of performing complex tasks and exhibit significant performance degradation as the number of classification categories increases. Despite optimizations, these networks classify only 3-4 classes, suggesting fundamental limitations in their computational scale. The inherent scalability challenges in these systems are underscored by the fact that the design parameters, such as the number of diffractive layers, the number of neurons per layer, and the inter-layer distances, cannot substantially change the performance. Therefore, the on-chip diffraction-based approach provides a limited number of controllable degrees of freedom compared to electronic neural networks, restricting the complexity of functions an on-chip diffractive neural network can learn.</description>

      <title>Stabilization and Destabilization of Multimode Solitons in Nonlinear Degenerate Multi-Pass Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical solitons in multimode nonlinear optical systems offer a unique platform for exploring the interplay of nonlinearity, dispersion, and spatial mode coupling, offering insights into complex nonlinear wave phenomena. Multi-pass cavities (MPCs) incorporating nonlinear Kerr media serve as prototypical systems, enabling high-efficiency supercontinuum generation and pulse compression. However, stabilizing femtosecond laser pulses in solid-medium-based MPCs (solid MPCs) under strong Kerr nonlinearity remains a significant challenge due to multimode coupling, which disrupts beam stability. In this work, we address this challenge by investigating the stability of laser pulses in MPCs using Floquet and perturbation model. We identify novel mode-coupling-suppression (MCS) medium lengths, where destructive interference among multimode wave components suppresses coupling and facilitates soliton stabilization. Under MCS conditions, our simulations demonstrate stable beam propagation in solid MPCs with nonlinear phases up to 1.5{\pi} per pass, achieving &gt;13-fold pulse compression with excellent spatio-spectral homogeneity. Our findings offer valuable guidance for designing advanced MPCs with tailored Kerr media.</description>

      <title>Phase-matched electron-photon interactions enabled by 3D-printed helical waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Smith-Purcell effect enables electromagnetic radiation across arbitrary spectral ranges by phase-matching the diffraction orders of an optical grating with the near-field of a moving electron. In this work, we introduce a novel approach using a helically shaped waveguide, where phase-matching is achieved through guided light within a helical optical fiber fabricated via two-photon polymerization using a 3D printer. Our results demonstrate that radiation from these structures precisely satisfies the phase-matching condition and is emitted directionally at specific angles, contrasting with the broad angular distribution characteristic of the traditional Smith-Purcell effect. Helical electron-driven photon sources establish a new paradigm, enabling 3D-printed structures to control electron-beam-induced radiation and, inversely, to facilitate light-induced efficient electron beam shaping and acceleration.</description>

      <title>Spectral tuning and nanoscale localization of single color centers in silicon via controllable strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17290v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of color centers in silicon enables scalable quantum technologies by combining telecom-wavelength emission and compatibility with mature silicon fabrication. However, large-scale integration requires precise control of each emitter's optical transition to generate indistinguishable photons for quantum networking. Here, we demonstrate a foundry-fabricated photonic integrated circuit (PIC) combining suspended silicon waveguides with a microelectromechanical (MEMS) cantilever to apply local strain and spectrally tune individual G-centers. Applying up to 35 V between the cantilever and the substrate induces a reversible wavelength shift of the zero-phonon line exceeding 100 pm, with no loss in brightness. Moreover, by modeling the strain-induced shifts with a digital twin physical model, we achieve vertical localization of color centers with sub-3 nm vertical resolution, directly correlating their spatial position, dipole orientation, and spectral behavior. This method enables on-demand, low-power control of emission spectrum and nanoscale localization of color centers, advancing quantum networks on a foundry-compatible platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical clock networks connected by phase-coherent links offer significant potential for advancing fundamental research and diverse scientific applications. Free-space optical frequency transfer extends fiber-based connectivity to remote areas and holds the potential for global coverage via satellite links. Here we present a compact and robust portable, rack-integrated two-way free-space link characterization system. Equipped with plug-and-play capabilities, the system enables straightforward interfacing with various optical systems and facilitates quick deployment for field experiments. In this work, we achieve a fractional frequency instability of $2.0 \times 10^{-19}$ for an averaging time of 10 s over a 3.4 km horizontal fully folded intra-city free-space link. Moreover, the system maintains an uptime of $94\%$ over 15 hours, illustrating its reliability and effectiveness for high-precision optical frequency comparisons over free-space.</description>

      <title>Polarization-controlled strong light-matter interaction with templated molecular aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate strong light-matter interaction for a layer of templated merocyanine molecules in a planar microcavity. Using a single layer of graphene nanoribbons as a templating layer, we obtain an aligned layer of aggregated molecules. The molecular layer displays anisotropic optical properties resembling those of a biaxial crystal. The anisotropic excitonic component in the cavity results in strongly polarization-dependent light-matter interaction and in increased Rabi-energies. The increased light-matter interaction is possibly due to reduced molecular disorder in the templated molecular layer. This conclusion is supported by an analysis based on a multi-oscillator model. We further use photoluminescence microspectroscopy to demonstrate that the light-matter coupling is spatially homogeneous. Our study introduces molecular templating to strong light-matter studies. The reduced disorder of the system as a consequence of templating is highly beneficial for engineering light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of a strange nonchaotic attractor in a Nd:YVO4 laser with saturable absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diode-pumped Nd: Vanadate laser is one of the most widely used lasers in the near-infrared range. Using passive Q-switching with a Cr:YAG saturable absorber (SA), it generates nanosecond pulses at tens of kilohertz. It is well known to display either regular pulsing or low-dimensional deterministic chaos, depending on the absorber's position within the cavity. However, to our knowledge, a strange nonchaotic attractor (SNA) has never been reported in this system. Our experiments provide the first evidence that, for a specific absorber position, the laser dynamics correspond to a strange nonchaotic attractor.
  SNAs exhibit complex dynamical behavior that is neither periodic nor chaotic, positioning them as a valuable resource for applications requiring high spectral diversity while preserving predictable dynamics.
  By experimentally obtaining time series of two laser variables, we reconstruct the underlying attractor. For a certain position of the SA, we find that all Lyapunov exponents are negative and that the energy spectra exhibit a broad frequency range, indicating that the attractor is nonchaotic and lacks periodicity. Using Higuchi's method, we estimate the fractal dimension (df) and find that 13 percent of the nonchaotic time series exhibit a well-defined df, confirming the presence of an SNA.</description>

      <title>Light-matter interaction between templated molecular layers and surface lattice resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We couple a templated layer of merocyanine molecules with surface lattice resonances in a plasmonic grating. The templating of the molecular layer is achieved using a layer of aligned graphene nanoribbons, resulting in anisotropic optical properties. The anisotropy manifests itself in polarization-dependent coupling between excitons in the organic layer and lattice plasmons in the grating. We study the influence of the templating on the coupling and find that surprisingly the more orientational ordered templated layer displays a lower coupling strength than an identical amorphous merocyanine layer. Our work demonstrates the use of molecular templating in controlling the interaction of excitons with excitations in optical nanostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report presents a theoretical demonstration of a novel bistable quartic soliton (BQS) in saturable nonlinear media, specifically within a realistic dispersion-engineered ridge waveguide made of Lithium Niobate LiNbO3 . The study employs the variational method to establish the amplitude-width relationship, indicating the coexistence of stable solitons with the same duration but differing amplitudes. The impact of shock on the bistable soliton is examined through perturbative variational analysis, supported by numerical results. Additionally, we examine the interaction of BQS in different regimes and analyze the formation of the bound state. The robustness of the BQS under perturbations is further investigated via linear stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Lie algebraic invariants in quantum linear optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum linear optics without post-selection is not powerful enough to produce any quantum state from a given input state. This limits its utility since some applications require entangled resources that are difficult to prepare. Thus, we need a deeper understanding of linear optical state preparation. In this work, we give a recipe to derive conserved quantities in the evolution of arbitrary states along any possible passive linear interferometer. One example of such an invariant is the projection of a density operator onto the Lie algebra of passive linear optical Hamiltonians. These invariants give necessary conditions for exact state preparation: if the input and output states have different invariants, it is impossible to design a passive linear interferometer that evolves one into the other. Moreover, we provide a lower bound to the distance between an output and target state based on the distance between their invariants. This gives a necessary condition for approximate or heralded state preparations. Therefore, the invariants allow us to narrow the search when trying to prepare useful entangled states, like NOON states, from easy-to-prepare states, like Fock states. We conclude that future exact and approximate state preparation methods will need to consider the necessary conditions given by our invariants to weed out impossible linear optical evolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a graphene photodetector coupled to a layer of aggregated organic semiconductor. A graphene phototransistor is covered with a thin film of merocyanine molecules. The aggregation of the molecular layer can be controlled by the deposition parameters and post-deposition annealing to obtain films ranging from amorphous to a highly aggregated state. The molecular layer has a uniaxial structure with excitonic transitions whose transition dipole moments are well defined. The presence of the molecular layer results in an enormous increase in the response of the phototransistor. We further demonstrate that the signal-enhancement is due to p-photodoping of the graphene. The spectroscopic photoresponse suggests that the photodoping via monomers and molecular aggregates takes place differently. Our photodetector is a platform to study the influence of molecular aggregation and order on charge transport processes between aggregated organic semiconductors and two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-precision optical frequency measurement is indispensable to modern science and technology, yet conventional spectroscopic techniques struggle to resolve sub-linewidth spectral features. We introduce a unique platform for super-resolving frequency estimation utilizing a mode-selective atomic Raman quantum memory implemented in warm cesium vapor. By precisely engineering the light matter interaction, our memory coherently stores the optimal temporal mode with high fidelity and retrieves it on-demand, realizing a mode crosstalk as low as 0.34%. To estimate the separation between two spectral lines, we experimentally measure the mean squared error of the frequency estimate, achieving a sensitivity of 1/20 of the linewidth with a ($34\pm4$)-fold enhancement in precision over direct intensity measurements. This enhanced frequency resolution, combined with the memory's on-demand storage, retrieval, and mode conversion capabilities, paves the way for multifunctional memory-based time-frequency sensors and their integration within quantum networks.</description>
