      <title>Peer Effects and Herd Behavior: An Empirical Study Based on the "Double 11" Shopping Festival</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs a Bayesian Probit model to empirically analyze peer effects and herd behavior among consumers during the "Double 11" shopping festival, using data collected through a questionnaire survey. The results demonstrate that peer effects significantly influence consumer decision-making, with the probability of participation in the shopping event increasing notably when roommates are involved. Additionally, factors such as gender, online shopping experience, and fashion consciousness significantly impact consumers' herd behavior. This research not only enhances the understanding of online shopping behavior among college students but also provides empirical evidence for e-commerce platforms to formulate targeted marketing strategies. Finally, the study discusses the fragility of online consumption activities, the need for adjustments in corporate marketing strategies, and the importance of promoting a healthy online culture.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Delivery Routes for Fresh E-commerce in Pre-warehouse Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of the economy, fresh food e-commerce has experienced rapid growth. One of the core competitive advantages of fresh food e-commerce platforms lies in selecting an appropriate logistics distribution model. This study focuses on the front warehouse model, aiming to minimize distribution costs. Considering the perishable nature and short shelf life of fresh food, a distribution route optimization model is constructed, and the saving mileage method is designed to determine the optimal distribution scheme. The results indicate that under certain conditions, different distribution schemes significantly impact the performance of fresh food e-commerce platforms. Based on a review of domestic and international research, this paper takes Dingdong Maicai as an example to systematically introduce the basic concepts of distribution route optimization in fresh food e-commerce platforms under the front warehouse model, analyze the advantages of logistics distribution, and thoroughly examine the importance of distribution routes for fresh products.</description>

      <title>Iterative Distributed Multinomial Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces an iterative distributed computing estimator for the multinomial logistic regression model with large choice sets. Compared to the maximum likelihood estimator, the proposed iterative distributed estimator achieves significantly faster computation and, when initialized with a consistent estimator, attains asymptotic efficiency under a weak dominance condition. Additionally, we propose a parametric bootstrap inference procedure based on the iterative distributed estimator and establish its consistency. Extensive simulation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and highlight the computational efficiency of the iterative distributed estimator.</description>

      <title>Locally robust semiparametric estimation of sample selection models without exclusion restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing identification and estimation methods for semiparametric sample selection models rely heavily on exclusion restrictions. However, it is difficult in practice to find a credible excluded variable that has a correlation with selection but no correlation with the outcome. In this paper, we establish a new identification result for a semiparametric sample selection model without the exclusion restriction. The key identifying assumptions are nonlinearity on the selection equation and linearity on the outcome equation. The difference in the functional form plays the role of an excluded variable and provides identification power. According to the identification result, we propose to estimate the model by a partially linear regression with a nonparametrically generated regressor. To accommodate modern machine learning methods in generating the regressor, we construct an orthogonalized moment by adding the first-step influence function and develop a locally robust estimator by solving the cross-fitted orthogonalized moment condition. We prove root-n-consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator under mild regularity conditions. A Monte Carlo simulation shows the satisfactory performance of the estimator in finite samples, and an application to wage regression illustrates its usefulness in the absence of exclusion restrictions.</description>

      <title>From rotational to scalar invariance: Enhancing identifiability in score-driven factor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, for a certain class of scaling matrices including the commonly used inverse square-root of the conditional Fisher Information, score-driven factor models are identifiable up to a multiplicative scalar constant under very mild restrictions. This result has no analogue in parameter-driven models, as it exploits the different structure of the score-driven factor dynamics. Consequently, score-driven models offer a clear advantage in terms of economic interpretability compared to parameter-driven factor models, which are identifiable only up to orthogonal transformations. Our restrictions are order-invariant and can be generalized to scoredriven factor models with dynamic loadings and nonlinear factor models. We test extensively the identification strategy using simulated and real data. The empirical analysis on financial and macroeconomic data reveals a substantial increase of log-likelihood ratios and significantly improved out-of-sample forecast performance when switching from the classical restrictions adopted in the literature to our more flexible specifications.</description>

      <title>A Dimension-Agnostic Bootstrap Anderson-Rubin Test For Instrumental Variable Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak-identification-robust Anderson-Rubin (AR) tests for instrumental variable (IV) regressions are typically developed separately depending on whether the number of IVs is treated as fixed or increasing with the sample size. These tests rely on distinct test statistics and critical values. To apply them, researchers are forced to take a stance on the asymptotic behavior of the number of IVs, which can be ambiguous when the number is moderate. In this paper, we propose a bootstrap-based, dimension-agnostic AR test. By deriving strong approximations for the test statistic and its bootstrap counterpart, we show that our new test has a correct asymptotic size regardless of whether the number of IVs is fixed or increasing -- allowing, but not requiring, the number of IVs to exceed the sample size. We also analyze the power properties of the proposed uniformly valid test under both fixed and increasing numbers of IVs.</description>

      <title>New possibilities in identification of binary choice models with fixed effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10475v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the identification of binary choice models with fixed effects. We provide a condition called sign saturation and show that this condition is sufficient for the identification of the model. In particular, we can guarantee identification even with bounded regressors. We also show that without this condition, the model is not identified unless the error distribution belongs to a small class. The same sign saturation condition is also essential for identifying the sign of treatment effects. A test is provided to check the sign saturation condition and can be implemented using existing algorithms for the maximum score estimator.</description>

      <title>Composite Quantile Factor Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the method of composite quantile factor model for factor analysis in high-dimensional panel data. We propose to estimate the factors and factor loadings across multiple quantiles of the data, allowing the estimates to better adapt to features of the data at different quantiles while still modeling the mean of the data. We develop the limiting distribution of the estimated factors and factor loadings, and an information criterion for consistent factor number selection is also discussed. Simulations show that the proposed estimator and the information criterion have good finite sample properties for several non-normal distributions under consideration. We also consider an empirical study on the factor analysis for 246 quarterly macroeconomic variables. A companion R package cqrfactor is developed.</description>

      <title>The Robust F-Statistic as a Test for Weak Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Montiel Olea and Pflueger (2013) proposed the effective F-statistic as a test for weak instruments in terms of the Nagar bias of the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator relative to a benchmark worst-case bias. We show that their methodology applies to a class of linear generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators with an associated class of generalized effective F-statistics. The standard nonhomoskedasticity robust F-statistic is a member of this class. The associated GMMf estimator, with the extension f for first-stage, is a novel and unusual estimator as the weight matrix is based on the first-stage residuals. As the robust F-statistic can also be used as a test for underidentification, expressions for the calculation of the weak-instruments critical values in terms of the Nagar bias of the GMMf estimator relative to the benchmark simplify and no simulation methods or Patnaik (1949) distributional approximations are needed. In the grouped-data IV designs of Andrews (2018), where the robust F-statistic is large but the effective F-statistic is small, the GMMf estimator is shown to behave much better in terms of bias than the 2SLS estimator, as expected by the weak-instruments test results.</description>

      <title>Inference on LATEs with covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In theory, two-stage least squares (TSLS) identifies a weighted average of covariate-specific local average treatment effects (LATEs) from a saturated specification, without making parametric assumptions on how available covariates enter the model. In practice, TSLS is severely biased as saturation leads to a large number of control dummies and an equally large number of, arguably weak, instruments. This paper derives asymptotically valid tests and confidence intervals for the weighted average of LATEs that is targeted, yet missed by saturated TSLS. The proposed inference procedure is robust to unobserved treatment effect heterogeneity, covariates with rich support, and weak identification. We find LATEs statistically significantly different from zero in applications in criminology, finance, health, and education.</description>

      <title>Randomly Assigned First Differences?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I consider treatment-effect estimation with a two-periods panel, using a first-difference regression of the outcome evolution $\Delta Y_g$ on the treatment evolution $\Delta D_g$. To justify this regression, one may assume that $\Delta D_g$ is as good as randomly assigned, namely uncorrelated to the residual of the first-differenced model and to the treatment's effect. This note shows that if one posits a causal model in levels between the treatment and the outcome, then the residual of the first-differenced model is a function of $D_{g,1}$, so $\Delta D_g$ uncorrelated to that residual essentially implies that $\Delta D_g$ is uncorrelated to $D_{g,1}$. This is a strong, testable condition. If $\Delta D_g$ is correlated to $D_{g,1}$, a solution is simply to control for $D_1$ in the regression. I use these results to revisit Acemoglu et al (2016).</description>

      <title>A Note on Doubly Robust Estimator in Regression Continuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note introduces a doubly robust (DR) estimator for regression discontinuity (RD) designs. RD designs provide a quasi-experimental framework for estimating treatment effects, where treatment assignment depends on whether a running variable surpasses a predefined cutoff. A common approach in RD estimation is the use of nonparametric regression methods, such as local linear regression. However, the validity of these methods still relies on the consistency of the nonparametric estimators. In this study, we propose the DR-RD estimator, which combines two distinct estimators for the conditional expected outcomes. The primary advantage of the DR-RD estimator lies in its ability to ensure the consistency of the treatment effect estimation as long as at least one of the two estimators is consistent. Consequently, our DR-RD estimator enhances robustness of treatment effect estimators in RD designs.</description>

      <title>Causal Panel Analysis under Parallel Trends: Lessons from A Large Reanalysis Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15983v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-way fixed effects (TWFE) models are widely used in political science to establish causality, but recent methodological discussions highlight their limitations under heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) and violations of the parallel trends (PT) assumption. This growing literature has introduced new estimators and diagnostics, causing confusion among researchers about the reliability of existing results and best practices. To address these concerns, we replicated and reanalyzed 49 articles from leading journals using TWFE models for observational panel data with binary treatments. Using six HTE-robust estimators, diagnostic tests, and sensitivity analyses, we find: (i) HTE-robust estimators yield qualitatively similar but highly variable results; (ii) while a few studies show clear signs of PT violations, many lack evidence to support this assumption; and (iii) many studies are underpowered when accounting for HTE and potential PT violations. We emphasize the importance of strong research designs and rigorous validation of key identifying assumptions.</description>
