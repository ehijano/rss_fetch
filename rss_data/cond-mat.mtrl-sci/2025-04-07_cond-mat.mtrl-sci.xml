      <title>Evaluation of strain and charge-transfer doping in wet-polymeric transferred monolayer MoS2: implications for field effect transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials offer exceptional tunability of electronic and optical properties via strain and doping engineering. However, the unintentional introduction of polymeric residues during wet chemical 2D film transfer processes such as wet chemical etching and surface energy assisted methods remains critical, yet unexplored. This study systematically investigates the impact of such residues on the optical and electrical properties of monolayer MoS\textsubscript{2} using Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy. We reveal that polymer residues in transferred films from wet chemical etching induce distinct strain and doping behaviors: PMMA-existed regions exhibit biaxial tensile strain and \textit{p}-type doping, while PMMA-free regions show compressive strain. In contrast, the surface energy assisted transfer method introduces compressive strain and \textit{n}-type doping in the transferred film due to residue interactions. Field-effect transistor measurements corroborate these findings, showing polymer residue-influenced modulation of charge transport. Notably, the surface energy assisted technique minimizes transfer-induced defects, highlighting its superiority for fabricating high-performance 2D optoelectronic devices. These results underscore the critical role of transfer methodologies in tailoring optoelectronic properties and provide practical insights for optimizing 2D material integration in advanced technologies.</description>

      <title>Multicolor phonon excitation in terahertz cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driving materials using light with more than one frequency component is an emerging technique, enabled by advanced pulse-shaping capabilities in recent years. Here, we translate this technique to lattice vibrations, by exciting multicolor phonons using terahertz cavities. In contrast to light, phonon frequencies are determined by the crystal structure and cannot readily be changed. We overcome this problem by tuning the frequencies of phonon polaritons in terahertz cavities to achieve the desired frequency ratios necessary for phononic Lissajous figures. This methodology enables dynamical crystallographic symmetry breaking and the creation of staggered phonon angular momentum and magnetic moment patterns.</description>

      <title>A silicon spin vacuum: isotopically enriched $^{28}$silicon-on-insulator and $^{28}$silicon from ultra-high fluence ion implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isotopically enriched silicon (Si) can greatly enhance qubit coherence times by minimizing naturally occurring $^{29}$Si which has a non-zero nuclear spin. Ultra-high fluence $^{28}$Si ion implantation of bulk natural Si substrates was recently demonstrated as an attractive technique to ultra-high $^{28}$Si isotopic purity. In this work, we apply this $^{28}$Si enrichment process to produce $^{28}$Si and $^{28}$Si-on-insulator (SOI) samples. Experimentally, we produced a $^{28}$Si sample on natural Si substrate with $^{29}$Si depleted to 7~ppm (limited by measurement noise floor), that is at least 100 nm thick. This is achieved with an ion energy that results in a sputter yield of less than one and a high ion fluence, as supported by simulations. Further, our simulations predict the $^{29}$Si and $^{30}$Si depletion in our sample to be less than 1~ppm. In the case of SOI, ion implantation conditions are found to be more stringent than those of bulk natural Si in terms of minimizing threading dislocations upon subsequent solid phase epitaxy annealing. Finally, we report the observation of nanoscopic voids in our $^{28}$SOI and $^{28}$Si samples located in the depth region between the surface and 70~nm. These voids appear to be stabilized by the presence of gold impurities and can be annealed out completely by a standard SPE annealing protocol at 620\deg C for 10 minutes in the absence of gold.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Compensated Nanometer-thin Ga-Substituted Yttrium Iron Garnet (Ga:YIG) Films with Robust Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetically full or partially compensated insulating ferrimagnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) offer valuable insights into fundamental spin-wave physics and high-speed magnonic applications. This study reports on key magnetic parameters of nanometer-thin Ga substituted yttrium iron garnet (Ga:YIG) films with saturation magnetization 4PiMs below 200 G. Vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) is used to determine the remanent magnetization 4PiMr and the polar orientation of the magnetic easy axis in samples with very low net magnetic moments. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the net magnetization of magnetically compensated Ga:YIG films, with compensation points Tcomp near room temperature is investigated. For films with remanent magnetization values below 60 G at room temperature, the compensation points Tcomp are determined and correlated with their Curie temperatures TC. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements at 6.5 GHz show that the FMR linewidths Delta H FWHM correlate inversely proportional with the remanent magnetization. The reduced saturation magnetization in the Ga:YIG films leads to a significant increase in the effective magnetization 4PiMeff and thus enables films with robust PMA. This opens up a new parameter space for the fine-tuning of potential magnonic spin-wave devices on commonly used GGG substrates.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Training Enhances Machine Learning Potentials for Long-Lasting Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are vital for exploring complex systems in computational physics and chemistry. While machine learning methods dramatically reduce computational costs relative to ab initio methods, their accuracy in long-lasting simulations remains limited. Here we propose dynamic training (DT), a method designed to enhance model performance over extended MD simulations. Applying DT to an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) on the challenging system of a hydrogen molecule interacting with a palladium cluster anchored to a graphene vacancy demonstrates a superior prediction accuracy compared to conventional approaches. Crucially, the DT architecture-independent design ensures its applicability across diverse machine learning potentials, making it a practical tool for advancing MD simulations.</description>

      <title>Large plastic deformation of voids in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms of void growth and coalescence are key contributors to the ductile failure of crystalline materials. At the grain scale, single crystal plastic anisotropy induces large strain localization leading to complex shape evolutions. In this study, an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework for 2D crystal plasticity combined with dynamic remeshing is used to study the 2D shape evolution of cylindrical voids in single crystals. The large deformation and shape evolution of the voids under two types of loading are considered: (i) radial and (ii) uni-axial loadings. In both cases, the voids undergo complex shape evolutions induced by the interactions between slip bands, lattice rotations and large strain phenomena. In case (i), the onset of the deformation revealed the formation of a complex fractal network of slip bands around the voids. Then, large deformations unearth an unexpected evolution of the slip bands network associated with significant lattice rotations, leading to a final hexagonal shape for the void. In case (ii), we obtain shear bands with very large accumulated plastic strain (&gt; 200%) compared to the macroscopic engineering strains (&lt; 15%). A high dependence between crystalline orientations, slip band localization and therefore shape evolution was observed, concluding in a high dependency between crystalline orientation and void shape elongation, which is of prime importance regarding coalescence of the voids, thus to the formation of macro-cracks.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning from first-principles calculations to experiments with chemistry-informed domain transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02848v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-to-Real (Sim2Real) transfer learning, the machine learning technique that efficiently solves a real-world task by leveraging knowledge from computational data, has received increasing attention in materials science as a promising solution to the scarcity of experimental data. We proposed an efficient transfer learning scheme from first-principles calculations to experiments based on the chemistry-informed domain transformation, that integrates the heterogeneous source and target domains by harnessing the underlying physics and chemistry. The proposed method maps the computational data from the simulation space (source domain) into the space of experimental data (target domain). During this process, these qualitatively different domains are efficiently integrated by a couple of prior knowledge of chemistry, (1) the statistical ensemble, and (2) the relationship between source and target quantities. As a proof-of-concept, we predict the catalyst activity for the reverse water-gas shift reaction by using the abundant first-principles data in addition to the experimental data. Through the demonstration, we confirmed that the transfer learning model exhibits positive transfer in accuracy and data efficiency. In particular, a significantly high accuracy was achieved despite using a few (less than ten) target data in domain transformation, whose accuracy is one order of magnitude smaller than that of a full scratch model trained with over 100 target data. This result indicates that the proposed method leverages the high prediction performance with few target data, which helps to save the number of trials in real laboratories.</description>

      <title>Atomistic insights on prebiotic phosphorylation of methanol from Schreibersite (Fe2NiP) corrosion: ab-initio computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prebiotic history of phosphorus is a matter of debate in the scientific community: its origin, how it landed on Earth, the selective speciation of the phosphate, and its inclusion into the organic matrix are the main unsolved issues. In this regard, Schreibersite ((Fe,Ni)3P), a mineral present in iron meteorites, can play a fundamental role as a carrier of reactive P which, as a result of the weathering processes, produces oxygenated phosphorus compounds, even the phosphate among others. In the present paper, we studied the interaction of methanol (alone and mixed with water) with the Schreibersite surfaces throughout periodic density functional theory calculations at PBE level. The results indicate that Schreibersite promotes the deprotonation of methanol and water both from thermodynamic and kinetic points of view, thus enabling the first step towards corrosion. We have simulated advanced stages of the corrosion process up to the formation of the phosphate and the phosphorylated form of methanol (methyl phosphate), showing that the formation of both products is thermodynamically favoured, as well as its solubilization, which allows other water molecules to proceed with further corrosion of Schreibersite.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the Electronic Structure of Quantum Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last several decades have seen significant advances in the theoretical modeling of materials within the fields of solid-state physics and materials science, but many methods commonly applied to this problem struggle to capture strong electron correlation accurately. Recent widespread interest in quantum materials -- where strong correlation plays a crucial role in the quantum effects governing their behavior -- further highlights the need for theoretical methods capable of rigorously treating such correlation. Here, we present a periodic generalization of variational two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) theory, a bootstrapping-type method that minimizes the ground-state energy as a functional of the 2-RDM without relying on the wavefunction. The 2-RDM is computed directly by semidefinite programming with $N$-representability conditions, ensuring accurate treatment of strongly correlated electronic systems. By exploiting translational symmetry, we significantly reduce computational scaling, enabling applications to realistic materials-scale systems. Additionally, we introduce an alternative to conventional energy band structures: natural-orbital occupation-number bands, which, being independent of mean-field assumptions, offer deeper insights into electron correlation effects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by applying the theory to hydrogen chains, molybdenum disulfide, and nickel oxide, showing that natural-orbital occupation bands correctly capture electronic character in regimes where density functional theory fails. This work represents a major step toward accurately describing the electronic structure of quantum materials using reduced density matrices rather than wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Determining Spin-Dependent Light Dark Matter Rates from Neutron Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scattering and absorption rates of light dark matter with electron spin-dependent interactions depend on the target's spin response. We show how this response is encoded by the target's dynamical magnetic susceptibility, which can be measured using neutron scattering. We directly use existing neutron scattering data to compute the dark matter scattering rate in a candidate target material, finding close agreement with the previous first-principles calculation at MeV dark matter masses. Complementary experiments and measurements can extend the reach of this technique to other dark matter models and masses, and identify promising target materials for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Elastic instability of wormlike micelle solution flow in serpentine channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wormlike micelle (WLM) solutions are abundant in energy, environmental, and industrial applications, which often rely on their flow through tortuous channels. How does the interplay between fluid rheology and channel geometry influence the flow behavior? Here, we address this question by experimentally visualizing and quantifying the flow of a semi-dilute WLM solution in millifluidic serpentine channels. At low flow rates, the base flow is steady and laminar, with strong asymmetry and wall slip. When the flow rate exceeds a critical threshold, the flow exhibits an elastic instability, producing spatially-heterogeneous, unsteady three-dimensional (3D) flow characterized by two notable features: (i) the formation and persistence of stagnant but strongly-fluctuating and multistable "dead zones" in channel bends, and (ii) intermittent 3D "twists" throughout the bulk flow. The geometry of these dead zones and twisting events can be rationalized by considering the minimization of local streamline curvature to reduce flow-generated elastic stresses. Altogether, our results shed new light into how the interplay between solution rheology and tortuous boundary geometry influences WLM flow behavior, with implications for predicting and controlling WLM flows in a broad range of complex environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the study of an atomic layer deposition (ALD) of zirconium by means of a quantum computation on an emulator representing the features of an architecture based on qubits implemented on carbon nanotubes. ALD process control is key in several technological applications such as spintronics, catalysis and renewable energy storage. We first derive a large ab-initio model of the precursor molecule approaching the infinite hydroxylated silicon (100) surface. In particular, we optimize geometry in three configurations: reactants, transition state and products. Subsequently, we derive an effective small cluster model for each state. Atomic valence active space (AVAS) transformation is then performed on these small clusters, leading to an effective qubit Hamiltonian, which is solved using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. We study the convergence of the reaction activation barrier with respect to the active space size and benchmark quantum calculations on a noiseless emulator and on an emulator representing a carbon nanotube qubit architecture, including an appropriate noise model and post-selection error mitigation. These calculations reveal an excellent agreement between the two emulation modes. Our VQE calculations provide the multi-configurational corrections to the single determinant DFT and HF states and pave the way for the routine quantum calculations of ALD reactions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field-tuned randomness in inhomogeneous altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetic (AM) states have compensated collinear magnetic configurations that are invariant under a combination of real-space rotation and time reversal. While these symmetries forbid a direct bilinear coupling of the AM order parameter with a magnetic field, they generally enable piezomagnetism, manifested as a trilinear coupling with magnetic field and strain. Here, we show that, because of this coupling, in an altermagnet subjected to random strain, the magnetic field triggers an effective random field conjugate to the AM order parameter, providing a rare realization of a tunable random-field Ising model. Specifically, we find two competing effects promoted by an external magnetic field: an increasing random-field disorder, which suppresses long-range AM order, and an enhanced coupling to elastic fluctuations, which favors AM order. By solving the corresponding random-field transverse-field Ising model via a mean-field approach, we obtain the temperature-magnetic field phase diagram of an inhomogeneous AM state for different strengths of random-strain disorder, unveiling the emergence of a field-induced reentrant AM phase. We also discuss the fingerprints of this rich behavior on several experimentally-accessible quantities, such as the shear modulus, the elasto-caloric effect coefficient, and the AM order parameter. Our results reveal an unusual but experimentally-feasible path to tune AM order with uniform magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: Disordered athermal biopolymer materials, such as collagen networks that constitute a major component in extracellular matrices and various connective tissues, are initially soft and compliant but stiffen dramatically under strain. Such network materials are topologically sub-isostatic and feature strong rigidity scale separation between the bending and stretching response of the constituent polymer fibers. Recently, a comprehensive scaling theory of the athermal strain-stiffening phase transition has been developed, providing predictions for all critical exponents characterising the transition in terms of the distance to the critical strain and of the small rigidity scales ratio. Here, we employ large-scale computer simulations, at and away from criticality, to test the analytic predictions. We find that all numerical critical exponents are in quantitative agreement with the analytically-predicted ones. Moreover, we find that all predicted exponents remain valid whether the driving strain is shear, i.e., volume-preserving, or dilation, and independent of the degree of the network's sub-isostaticity, thus establishing the universality of the strain-stiffening phase transition with respect to the symmetry of the driving strain and the network's topology.</description>

      <title>Improved Strategies for Fermionic Quantum Simulation with Global Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present efficient quantum circuits for fermionic excitation operators tailored for ion trap quantum computers exhibiting the M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen (MS) gate. Such operators commonly arise in the study of static and dynamic properties in electronic structure problems using Unitary Coupled Cluster theory or Trotterized time evolution. We detail how the global MS interaction naturally suits the non-local structure of fermionic excitation operators under the Jordan-Wigner mapping and simultaneously provides optimal parallelism in their circuit decompositions. Compared to previous schemes on ion traps, our approach reduces the number of MS gates by factors of 2-, and 4, for single-, and double excitations, respectively. This improvement promises significant speedups and error reductions.</description>

      <title>Silicon nanoantennas for tailoring the optical properties of MoS2 monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon-based dielectric nanoantennas provide an effective platform for engineering light-matter interactions in van der Waals semiconductors. Here, we demonstrate near-field coupling between monolayer MoS2 and silicon nanoantennas arranged in hexagonal lattices with tunable geometric parameters, leading to a three-fold enhancement in photoluminescence and an excitation-wavelength-dependent emission that aligns with Mie-resonant modes. Raman spectroscopy reveals an up to 8-fold enhancement in the vibrational modes of MoS2, while second-harmonic generation exhibits a 20 to 30-fold increase in efficiency, closely correlating with the presence of the underlying nanoantennas. Our experiments and simulations quantify the tunable benefits of the near-field interactions, taking into account thin-film interference and strain-induced effects. Our findings present dielectric nanoantennas as a promising platform for tailoring linear and nonlinear optical properties in 2D materials, with potential applications in nanophotonic devices and integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Orbital Order and Disorder in Fluoro-Perovskites with $t_{2g}$ Electronic Degeneracies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A detailed high-resolution, variable temperature powder diffraction study of the fluoro-perovskites NaFeF$_3$ and NaCoF$_3$ is performed to probe their orbital ordering transitions. Through analysis of the symmetry adapted macrostrains and atomic distortions, we show that NaFeF$_3$ undergoes a C-type orbital order transition associated with the $t_{2g}^4$ states of Fe$^{2+}$. Counter-intuitively, the phase transition leading to the orbital order appears second order-like, which contradicts the thermodynamic requirements for electronic and isosymmeric phase transitions, implying that there must be an associated hidden symmetry breaking. On the other hand, for NaCoF$_3$, consideration of the symmetry adapted strains allows us to confidently rule out the occurrence of any long-range orbital orders down to 4 K. Since NaCoF$_3$ is an insulator with quenched orbital angular momentum at this temperature, our findings point towards a novel kind of orbital disorder associated to the $t_{2g}^5$ electronic degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Healing of a Topological Scar: Coordination Defects in a Honeycomb Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A crystal structure with a point defect typically returns to its ideal local structure upon moving a few bond lengths away from the defect; topological defects such as dislocations or disclinations also heal rapidly in this regard. Here we describe a simple point defect -- a two-fold atom incorporated at the growth edge of a 2D hexagonal honeycomb material -- whose healing may require a defect complex with 50 or more atoms. $\textit{Topologically}$ the two-fold atom disappears into a single 'long bond' between its neighbors, thereby inducing a pentagonal disclination. However, $\textit{chemically}$ this disclination occupies as much physical space as a six-fold ring. This incompatibility of chemistry and topology can cause a ''ringing'' of the Gaussian curvature that creates an expansive healing region and may even spawn a semi-infinite grain boundary propagating outwards from the topological scar.</description>

      <title>A Novel Liquid-Liquid Interface Deposition Method for the Production of Thin Films and van der Waals Heterostructures of Two-Dimensional Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin films and van der Waals heterostructures derived from two-dimensional solids offer enormous potential for a broad range of novel, energy efficient devices, however, their use is currently hampered by slow, labor-intensive fabrication methods often employing hazardous chemicals. We demonstrate a novel technique for rapid, low-cost and environmentally-friendly production of ultra-thin films and van der Waals heterostructures of two-dimensional solids from aqueous surfactant-stabilized suspensions, which we term `Liquid Interface Deposition'. Films are produced by the transfer of platelets of two-dimensional materials assembled at the interface between two immiscible liquids (water and dicholoromethane), at which surfactants which stabilize the two-dimensional materials in the aqueous phase are `stripped' from the platelets due to preferential partitioning of the surfactant to the non-aqeuous phase. The approach is generic to two-dimensional materials which can be stabilized in aqueous suspension by a surfactant and the resulting films can then be transferred to an arbitrary substrate by a range of approaches. The generic applicability of this technique is demonstrated through production of thin films on a variety of substrates, deposition of transparent, highly conductive, graphene films with conductivities between $7.7 \times 10^{3} - 1.26\times 10^{5}~\textrm{S m}^{-1}$ and transmittances of 55-75%, and by the fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures of MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, and few-layer graphene.</description>

      <title>On the distributed resistor-constant phase element transmission line in a reflective bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we derive and study the analytical solution of the voltage and current diffusion equation for the case of a finite-length resistor-constant phase element (CPE) transmission line (TL) network that can represent a model for porous electrodes in the absence of any Faradic processes. The energy storage component is considered to be an elemental CPE per unit length of impedance $z_c(s)={1}/{(c_{\alpha} s^{\alpha})}$ with constant parameters $(c_{\alpha},\alpha)$ instead of the ideal capacitor of impedance $z(s)={1}/{(c\, s)}$ usually assumed in TL modeling. The problem becomes a time-fractional diffusion equation for the voltage that we solve under galvanostatic charging, and derive from it a reduced impedance function of the form $z_{\alpha}(s_n)=s_n^{-\alpha/2}\coth({s_n^{\alpha/2}})$, where $s_n = j\omega_n$ is a normalized frequency. We also derive the system's step response, and the distribution function of relaxation times associated with it. The analysis can be viewed and used as a support for the fractal finite-length Warburg model.</description>

      <title>Polarization-Resolved Core Exciton Dynamics in LiF Using Attosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to control absorption by modifying the polarization of light presents an exciting opportunity to experimentally determine the orbital alignment of absorption features. Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the polarization dependence of core exciton dynamics in LiF thin films at the Li+ K edge. XUV pulses excite electrons from the Li 1s core level into the conduction band, allowing for the formation of a p-orbital-like core exciton, aligned along the XUV light polarization axis. A sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) probe pulse then arrives at variable time delays, perturbing the XUV-excited states and allowing the coherence decay of the core exciton to be mapped. The coherence lifetimes are found to be ~2.4 +- 0.4 fs, which is attributed to a phonon-mediated dephasing mechanism as in previous core exciton studies. The differential absorption features are also shown to be sensitive to the relative polarization of the XUV and NIR fields. The parallel NIR probe induces couplings between the initial XUV-excited p-like bright exciton and s-like dark excitons. When crossed pump and probe polarizations are used, the coupling between the bright and dark states is no longer dipole-allowed, and the transient absorption signal associated with the coupling is suppressed by approximately 90%. This interpretation is supported by simulations of a few-level model system, as well as analysis of the calculated band structure. The results indicate that laser polarization can serve as a powerful experimental tool for exploring the orbital alignment of core excitonic states in solid-state materials.</description>

      <title>Predicting the N\'eel temperatures in general helimagnetic materials: a comparison between mean field theory, random phase approximation, renormalized spin wave theory and classical Monte Carlo simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The critical temperature for magnetic order comprises a crucial property of any magnetic material and ranges from a few Kelvin in certain antiferromagnets to 1400 K in ferromagnetic Co. However, the prediction of critical temperatures based on, for example, a spin wave dispersion is in general non-trivial. For ferromagnets and simple collinear antiferromagnets, estimates may be obtained from the Heisenberg model using either renormalized spin wave theory or the Green's function random phase approximation (RPA), but a systematic assessment of the accuracy of such approaches seems to be lacking in the literature. In this work, we propose generalizations of both renormalized spin wave theory and RPA to calculate the critical temperatures of single-$Q$ helimagnetic ground states, which include ferromagnets and antiferromagnets as special cases. We compare the methods to classical Monte Carlo simulations and Mean field theory, using experimental exchange parameters for a wide range of materials; MnO and NiO (single site N\'eel ground states), MnF$_2$ (altermagnet), Cr$_2$O$_3$ and Fe$_2$O$_3$ (two site N\'eel states) and Ba$_3$NbFe$_3$Si$_2$O$_{14}$ (incommensurate helimagnet). In all cases, we observe that predictions from RPA are in excellent agreement with experimental values and RPA thus constitutes a rather reliable all-purpose method for calculating critical temperatures.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly derive the wavefunctions of chiral phonons propagating along the helical axis in chiral crystals and clarify the characteristics of electron-phonon interactions in chiral helical crystals. In particular, we elucidate how the conservation of not only the crystal momentum (CM) but also the crystal angular momentum (CAM) manifests in the interaction vertex. This formulation provides a microscopic framework for describing physical processes involving chiral phonons. Furthermore, we construct a phononic analogue of Zilch, a known measure of chirality carried by light, and discuss its relationship with phonon angular momentum.</description>

Abstract: Sorbent materials like Cr decorated 2D materials are explored among its storage options. 2D material like graphene has been used as it has a high surface to volume ratio. A comparative study is done with Cr adsorbed in defect-free and single vacancy defect graphene systems. Ab-initio calculations are performed with and without Van der Waals interaction to check the hydrogen storage efficiency. Efficiency is determined by calculating the binding energy of the system. The preferred range for binding energy for reversible hydrogen storage, as determined by the Department of Energy, US, is between 0.2-0.6 eV. This work also visualizes the thermal stability spectrum of the efficient materials at 300 K using molecular dynamics calculations, predicting their stability at room temperature.</description>

      <title>FeGe as a building block for the kagome 1:1, 1:6:6, and 1:3:5 families: hidden d-orbital decoupling of flat band sectors, effective models and interaction Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electronic structure and interactions of kagome materials, such as the 1:1 (FeGe) and 1:6:6 (MgFe6Ge6) classes, are complicated and involve many orbitals and bands around the Fermi level. Current theoretical models treat the systems in an $s$-orbital kagome representation, unsuited and incorrect both quantitatively and qualitatively to the material realities. In this work, we lay the basis of a faithful framework of the electronic model for this large class of materials. We show that the complicated ``spaghetti" of electronic bands near the Fermi level can be decomposed into three groups of Fe d orbitals coupled to specific Ge orbitals via symmetry and chemical analysis. Such a decomposition allows for a clear analytical understanding (leading to different results than the simple s-orbital kagome models) of the flat bands in the system based on the S-matrix formalism of generalized bipartite lattices. Our three minimal Hamiltonians can reproduce the quasiflat bands, van Hove singularities, topology, and Dirac points close to the Fermi level, which we prove by extensive ab initio studies. We also obtain the interacting Hamiltonian for the d orbitals in FeGe using the constraint random phase approximation (cRPA) method, which faithfully describes the antiferromagnetic phase. We then use FeGe as a fundamental LEGO-like building block for a large family of 1:6:6 kagome materials, which can be obtained by doubling and perturbing the FeGe Hamiltonian. We apply the model to its kagome siblings FeSn and CoSn, and also MgFe6Ge6. We further extend the formalism developed for the 1:1 family to the 1:3:5 family AB3Z5 (A = K, Rb, Cs; B = Cr, V, Ti; Z = Sb, Bi), demonstrating the broad applicability of the LEGO-like building block approach. Our work serves as the first complete framework for the study of the interacting phase diagram of kagome compounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Little is known about the quantum effects of friction, and first-principles studies are virtually non-existent. In multilayer graphene, the order of the stacking of the layers plays a crucial role in the electronic properties and the manifestation of superconductivity, and friction affects how layers slide to change the stacking. Here, we study the effects of friction in bilayer graphene by focusing on quantum fluctuations in the free energy barrier that layers have to overcome to slide with respect to each other. We evaluate the free energy at the barrier in bilayer graphene through the self-consistent harmonic approximation, accounting for quantum and thermal ionic fluctuations. We obtain a very large reduction of the barrier of more than 30%. Temperature effects are weaker, although high temperatures induce a significant reduction of the barrier as well. Our approach is general and paves the way for systematically accounting for nuclear quantum and thermal effects in free energy barriers of other macroscopic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The renormalization of a parity-even massless $U(1)\times U(1)$ quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions (QED$_3$) is studied by adopting the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann-Lowenstein (BPHZL) renormalization method. The presence of two massless fermions requires the Lowenstein-Zimmermann (LZ) subtraction scheme to renormalize the infrared divergences induced by the ultraviolet subtractions at 1- and 2-loops, moreover due to the model superrenormalizability the ultraviolet divergences are bounded up to 2-loops. Finally, through the BPHZL renormalization method together with the LZ subtraction scheme the ultraviolet and infrared finiteness of the model is proved up to 2-loops and beyond.</description>
