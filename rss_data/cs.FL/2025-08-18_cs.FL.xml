      <title>Characterizing NC1 with Typed Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Krebs et al. (2007) gave a characterization of the complexity class TC0 as the class of languages recognized by a certain class of typed monoids. The notion of typed monoid was introduced to extend methods of algebraic automata theory to infinite monoids and hence characterize classes beyond the regular languages. We advance this line of work beyond TC0 by giving a characterization of NC1. This is obtained by first showing that NC1 can be defined as the languages expressible in an extension of first-order logic using only unary quantifiers over regular languages. The expressibility result is a consequence of a general result showing that finite monoid multiplication quantifiers of higher dimension can be replaced with unary quantifiers in the context of interpretations over strings, which also answers a question of Lautemann et al. (2001). We establish this collapse result for a much more general class of interpretations using results on interpretations due to Boja\'nczyk et al. (2019), which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Presheaf automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce presheaf automata as a generalisation of different variants of higher-dimensional automata and other automata-like formalisms, including Petri nets and vector addition systems. We develop the foundations of a language theory for them based on notions of paths and track objects. We also define open maps for presheaf automata, extending the standard notions of simulation and bisimulation for transition systems. Apart from these conceptual contributions, we show that certain finite-type presheaf automata subsume all Petri nets, generalising a previous result by van Glabbeek, which applies to higher-dimensional automata and safe Petri nets. We also present a class of presheaf automata for which there is no Kleene theorem with respect to the notions of rational and regular languages introduced.</description>

      <title>Words with factor complexity $2n+1$ and minimal critical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Word ${\mathbf G}$ is the fixed point of the morphism $\gamma=[01,2,02]$. In 2019, Shallit and Shur showed that ${\mathbf G}$ has factor complexity $2n+1$. They also showed that ${\mathbf G}$ has critical exponent $\mu=2+\frac{1}{\lambda^2-1}= 2.4808726\cdots$, where $\lambda=1.7548777$ is the real zero of $x^3-2x+x-1=0$. They conjectured that this was the least possible critical exponent among words with factor complexity $2n+1$. We confirm their conjecture. The proof, using an intricate case analysis, is by computer. The relevant program generates a `human readable' proof.</description>
