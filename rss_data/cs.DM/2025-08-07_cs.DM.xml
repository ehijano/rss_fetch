      <title>Decoupling via Affine Spectral-Independence: Beck-Fiala and Koml\'os Bounds Beyond Banaszczyk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Beck-Fiala Conjecture [Discrete Appl. Math, 1981] asserts that any set system of $n$ elements with degree $k$ has combinatorial discrepancy $O(\sqrt{k})$. A substantial generalization is the Koml\'os Conjecture, which states that any $m \times n$ matrix with unit length columns has discrepancy $O(1)$.
  In this work, we resolve the Beck-Fiala Conjecture for $k \geq \log^2 n$. We also give an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k} + \sqrt{\log n})$ bound for $k \leq \log^2 n$, where $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides $\mathsf{poly}(\log \log n)$ factors. These bounds improve upon the $O(\sqrt{k \log n})$ bound due to Banaszczyk [Random Struct. Algor., 1998].
  For the Komlos problem, we give an $\widetilde{O}(\log^{1/4} n)$ bound, improving upon the previous $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ bound [Random Struct. Algor., 1998]. All of our results also admit efficient polynomial-time algorithms.
  To obtain these results, we consider a new notion of affine spectral-independence in designing random walks. In particular, our algorithms obtain the desired colorings via a discrete Brownian motion, guided by a semidefinite program (SDP). Besides standard constraints used in prior works, we add some extra affine spectral-independence constraints, which effectively decouple the evolution of discrepancy across different rows, and allow us to better control how many rows accumulate large discrepancy at any point during the process. This technique of ``decoupling via affine spectral-independence'' is quite general and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Millions of inequivalent quadratic APN functions in eight variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The only known example of an almost perfect nonlinear (APN) permutation in even dimension was obtained by applying CCZ-equivalence to a specific quadratic APN function. Motivated by this result, there have been numerous recent attempts to construct new quadratic APN functions. Currently, 32,892 quadratic APN functions in dimension 8 are known and two recent conjectures address their possible total number. The first, proposed by Y. Yu and L. Perrin (Cryptogr. Commun. 14(6): 1359-1369, 2022), suggests that there are more than 50,000 such functions. The second, by A. Polujan and A. Pott (Proc. 7th Int. Workshop on Boolean Functions and Their Applications, 2022), argues that their number exceeds that of inequivalent quadratic (8,4)-bent functions, which is 92,515. We computationally construct 3,775,599 inequivalent quadratic APN functions in dimension 8 and estimate the total number to be about 6 million.</description>

      <title>Linear Layouts of Graphs with Priority Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A linear layout of a graph consists of a linear ordering of its vertices and a partition of its edges into pages such that the edges assigned to the same page obey some constraint. The two most prominent and widely studied types of linear layouts are stack and queue layouts, in which any two edges assigned to the same page are forbidden to cross and nest, respectively. The names of these two layouts derive from the fact that, when parsing the graph according to the linear vertex ordering, the edges in a single page can be stored using a single stack or queue, respectively. Recently, the concepts of stack and queue layouts have been extended by using a double-ended queue or a restricted-input queue for storing the edges of a page. We extend this line of study to edge-weighted graphs by introducing priority queue layouts, that is, the edges on each page are stored in a priority queue whose keys are the edge weights. First, we show that there are edge-weighted graphs that require a linear number of priority queues. Second, we characterize the graphs that admit a priority queue layout with a single queue, regardless of the edge-weight function, and we provide an efficient recognition algorithm. Third, we show that the number of priority queues required independently of the edge-weight function is bounded by the pathwidth of the graph, but can be arbitrarily large already for graphs of treewidth two. Finally, we prove that determining the minimum number of priority queues is NP-complete if the linear ordering of the vertices is fixed.</description>

      <title>Balanced-chromatic number and Hadwiger-like conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by different characterizations of planar graphs and the 4-Color Theorem, several structural results concerning graphs of high chromatic number have been obtained. Toward strengthening some of these results, we consider the \emph{balanced chromatic number}, $\chi_b(\hat{G})$, of a signed graph $\hat{G}$. This is the minimum number of parts into which the vertices of a signed graph can be partitioned so that none of the parts induces a negative cycle. This extends the notion of the chromatic number of a graph since $\chi(G)=\chi_b(\tilde{G})$, where $\tilde{G}$ denotes the signed graph obtained from~$G$ by replacing each edge with a pair of (parallel) positive and negative edges. We introduce a signed version of Hadwiger's conjecture as follows.
  Conjecture: If a signed graph $\hat{G}$ has no negative loop and no $\tilde{K_t}$-minor, then its balanced chromatic number is at most $t-1$.
  We prove that this conjecture is, in fact, equivalent to Hadwiger's conjecture and show its relation to the Odd Hadwiger Conjecture.
  Motivated by these results, we also consider the relation between subdivisions and balanced chromatic number. We prove that if $(G, \sigma)$ has no negative loop and no $\tilde{K_t}$-subdivision, then it admits a balanced $\frac{79}{2}t^2$-coloring. This qualitatively generalizes a result of Kawarabayashi (2013) on totally odd subdivisions.</description>
