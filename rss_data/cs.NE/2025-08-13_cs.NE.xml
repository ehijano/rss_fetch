      <title>Playing Atari Space Invaders with Sparse Cosine Optimized Policy Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary approaches have previously been shown to be effective learning methods for a diverse set of domains. However, the domain of game-playing poses a particular challenge for evolutionary methods due to the inherently large state space of video games. As the size of the input state expands, the size of the policy must also increase in order to effectively learn the temporal patterns in the game space. Consequently, a larger policy must contain more trainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space. Any increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as increasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with convergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a meaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state into a coefficient matrix. By truncating and applying sparsification to this matrix, we reduce the dimensionality of the input space while retaining the highest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SCOPE as the policy for the Atari game Space Invaders. In this task, SCOPE with CMA-ES outperforms evolutionary methods that consider an unmodified input state, such as OpenAI-ES and HyperNEAT. SCOPE also outperforms simple reinforcement learning methods, such as DQN and A3C. SCOPE achieves this result through reducing the input size by 53% from 33,600 to 15,625 then using a bilinear affine mapping of sparse DCT coefficients to policy actions learned by the CMA-ES algorithm.</description>

      <title>Putnam-AXIOM: A Functional and Static Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current mathematical reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are approaching saturation, with some achieving &gt; 90% accuracy, and are increasingly compromised by training-set contamination. We introduce Putnam-AXIOM, a benchmark of 522 university-level competition problems drawn from the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, and Putnam-AXIOM Variation, an unseen companion set of 100 functional variants generated by programmatically perturbing variables and constants. The variation protocol produces an unlimited stream of equally difficult, unseen instances -- yielding a contamination-resilient test bed. On the Original set, OpenAI's o1-preview -- the strongest evaluated model -- scores 41.9%, but its accuracy drops by 19.6% (46.8% relative decrease) on the paired Variations. The remaining eighteen models show the same downward trend, ten of them with non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. These gaps suggest memorization and highlight the necessity of dynamic benchmarks. We complement "boxed" accuracy with Teacher-Forced Accuracy (TFA), a lightweight metric that directly scores reasoning traces and automates natural language proof evaluations. Putnam-AXIOM therefore provides a rigorous, contamination-resilient evaluation framework for assessing advanced mathematical reasoning of LLMs. Data and evaluation code are publicly available at https://github.com/brando90/putnam-axiom.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Lottery Ticket Networks using Genetic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building modern deep learning systems that are not just effective but also efficient requires rethinking established paradigms for model training and neural architecture design. Instead of adapting highly overparameterized networks and subsequently applying model compression techniques to reduce resource consumption, a new class of high-performing networks skips the need for expensive parameter updates, while requiring only a fraction of parameters, making them highly scalable. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that within randomly initialized, sufficiently overparameterized neural networks, there exist subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the trained original model-without any training. This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms for identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks. We find that for instances of binary and multi-class classification tasks, our approach achieves better accuracies and sparsity levels than the current state-of-the-art without requiring any gradient information. In addition, we provide justification for the need for appropriate evaluation metrics when scaling to more complex network architectures and learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Flexible Prefrontal Control over Hippocampal Episodic Memory for Goal-Directed Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many tasks require flexibly modifying perception and behavior based on current goals. Humans can retrieve episodic memories from days to years ago, using them to contextualize and generalize behaviors across novel but structurally related situations. The brain's ability to control episodic memories based on task demands is often attributed to interactions between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC). We propose a reinforcement learning model that incorporates a PFC-HPC interaction mechanism for goal-directed generalization. In our model, the PFC learns to generate query-key representations to encode and retrieve goal-relevant episodic memories, modulating HPC memories top-down based on current task demands. Moreover, the PFC adapts its encoding and retrieval strategies dynamically when faced with multiple goals presented in a blocked, rather than interleaved, manner. Our results show that: (1) combining working memory with selectively retrieved episodic memory allows transfer of decisions among similar environments or situations, (2) top-down control from PFC over HPC improves learning of arbitrary structural associations between events for generalization to novel environments compared to a bottom-up sensory-driven approach, and (3) the PFC encodes generalizable representations during both encoding and retrieval of goal-relevant memories, whereas the HPC exhibits event-specific representations. Together, these findings highlight the importance of goal-directed prefrontal control over hippocampal episodic memory for decision-making in novel situations and suggest a computational mechanism by which PFC-HPC interactions enable flexible behavior.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Software Structured to Simulate Human Working Memory, Mental Imagery, and Mental Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.05138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents an artificial intelligence (AI) architecture intended to simulate the iterative updating of the human working memory system. It features several interconnected neural networks designed to emulate the specialized modules of the cerebral cortex. These are structured hierarchically and integrated into a global workspace. They are capable of temporarily maintaining high-level representational patterns akin to the psychological items maintained in working memory. This maintenance is made possible by persistent neural activity in the form of two modalities: sustained neural firing (resulting in a focus of attention) and synaptic potentiation (resulting in a short-term store). Representations held in persistent activity are recursively replaced resulting in incremental changes to the content of the working memory system. As this content gradually evolves, successive processing states overlap and are continuous with one another. The present article will explore how this architecture can lead to iterative shift in the distribution of coactive representations, ultimately leading to mental continuity between processing states, and thus to human-like thought and cognition. Like the human brain, this AI working memory store will be linked to multiple imagery (topographic map) generation systems corresponding to various sensory modalities. As working memory is iteratively updated, the maps created in response will construct sequences of related mental imagery. Thus, neural networks emulating the prefrontal cortex and its reciprocal interactions with early sensory and motor cortex capture the imagery guidance functions of the human brain. This sensory and motor imagery creation, coupled with an iteratively updated working memory store may provide an AI system with the cognitive assets needed to achieve synthetic consciousness or artificial sentience.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Temporal Fusion for Financial Market Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting in financial markets requires integrating diverse data sources, from historical prices to macroeconomic indicators and financial news. However, existing models often fail to align these modalities effectively, limiting their practical use. In this paper, we introduce a transformer-based deep learning framework, Cross-Modal Temporal Fusion (CMTF), that fuses structured and unstructured financial data for improved market prediction. The model incorporates a tensor interpretation module for feature selection and an auto-training pipeline for efficient hyperparameter tuning. Experimental results using FTSE 100 stock data demonstrate that CMTF achieves superior performance in price direction classification compared to classical and deep learning baselines. These findings suggest that our framework is an effective and scalable solution for real-world cross-modal financial forecasting tasks.</description>
