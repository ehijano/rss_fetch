      <title>Quantitative comparison of power grid reinforcements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantitative comparison of power grid reinforcement strategies. We evaluate three approaches: (1) doubling transmission links (bridges) between different communities, (2) adding bypasses around weakly synchronized nodes, and (3) reinforcing edges that trigger the largest cascade failures. We use two different models of the Hungarian high-voltage network. These models are built from the official data provided by the transmission system operator, thus eliminating the assumptions typically used in other studies. The coupling strength distribution of the Hungarian models shows good agreement with our previous works using the European and North American grids.
  Additionally, we examine the occurrence of Braess' paradox, where added transmission capacity unexpectedly reduces overall stability. Our results show that reinforcement through community-based bridge duplication yields the most significant improvements across all parameters. A visual comparison highlights differences between this method and traditional reinforcement approaches. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantitatively compare results of oscillator-based studies with those relying on power system analysis software.
  Characteristic results of line-cut simulations reveal cascade size distributions with fat-tailed decays for medium coupling strengths, while exponential behavior emerges for small and large couplings. The observed exponents are reminiscent of the continuously changing exponents due to Griffiths effects near a hybrid type of phase transition.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the dual chemotaxis strategy of bacteria in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemotaxis of bacterial swimmers that move in a run-and-turn pattern is well studied in uniform bulk fluid. It is primarily based on modulating the run time in dependence on the swimming direction with respect to the source of chemoattractant (run time bias). Here, we provide evidence that the lophotrichously flagellated soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida may also perform chemotaxis in porous media where the free path length is severely restricted. Besides the classical run time bias, we identify a second chemotactic strategy: the change in swimming direction upon a turn event is adjusted, so that the direction of the next run phase is biased towards the source of chemoattractant (turn angle bias). Agent based simulations, based on the experimentally observed statistical properties of the swimming pattern, indicate that turn angle bias is the predominant chemotaxis strategy of bacteria in porous environments.</description>

      <title>Harris-Luck criterion in the plateau transition of the Integer Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Harris criterion imposes a constraint on the critical behavior of a system upon introduction of new disorder, based on its dimension $d$ and localization length exponent $\nu$. It states that the new disorder can be relevant only if $d \nu &lt; 2$. We analyze the applicability of the Harris criterion to the GKNS network disorder formulated in the paper [I. A. Gruzberg, A. Kl\"umper, W. Nuding, and A. Sedrakyan, Phys. Rev. B 95, 125414 (2017)] and show that the fluctuations of the geometry are relevant despite $d \nu&gt; 2$, implying that Harris criterion should be modified. We have observed that the fluctuations of the critical point in different quenched configurations of disordered network blocks is of order $L^0$, i.e.~it does not depend on block size $L$ in contrast to the expectation based on the Harris criterion that they should decrease as $L^{-d/2}$ according to the central limit theorem. Since $L^0 &gt; (x-x_c)$ is always satisfied near the critical point, the mentioned network disorder is relevant and the critical indices of the system can be changed. We have also shown that the GKNS disordered network is fundamentally different from Voronoi-Delaunay and dynamically triangulated random lattices: the probability of higher connectivity in the GKNS network decreases in a power law as opposed to an exponential, indicating that we are dealing with a ``scale free" network, such as the Internet, protein-protein interactions, etc.</description>

      <title>Dual-unitary shadow tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a classical shadow tomography protocol based on dual-unitary brick-wall circuits termed ``dual-unitary shadow tomography'' (DUST). To quantify the performance of DUST, we study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in one-dimensional qubit systems, evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a final measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits have a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of $\rho(x,t)$, which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site $x$ and depth $t$ starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for $\rho(x,t)$ and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. For the task of predicting operators with (nearly) full support, we show that DUST outperforms brick-wall Clifford shadows of equivalent depth. This advantage is further pronounced for small system sizes and more generally, our results are robust to finite-size effects.</description>

      <title>Causality and instability in wave propagation in random time-varying media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical model to investigate wave propagation in media with random time-varying properties, where temporal fluctuations lead to complex scattering dynamics. Focusing on the ensemble-averaged field, we derive an exact expression for the average Green's function in the presence of finite temporal disorder, and extend our analysis to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast to spatial disorder, causality prevents recurrent scattering, allowing us to achieve a non-perturbative solution. We identify two distinct propagation regimes: one where the field oscillates with constant amplitude, and another where it grows exponentially at long times. Our findings offer new insights into wave dynamics in temporally disordered media, with potential applications in time-varying metamaterials, dynamic sensing, and imaging in turbulent or chaotic environments.</description>
