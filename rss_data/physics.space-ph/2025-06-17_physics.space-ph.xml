      <title>Prospecting for lunar Helium-3 with a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12386v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mining $^3{\rm He}$ from lunar regolith has attracted significant interest in recent years due to the scarcity of $^3{\rm He}$ on Earth and its diverse applications, from cryogenics and medical imaging, to nuclear physics and future nuclear fusion. Given the stringent technical and economic challenges of mining lunar $^3{\rm He}$, precise prospecting is essential. Here we propose a prospecting methodology based on a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer, which can detect the dipolar magnetic field of thermally polarized $^3{\rm He}$ spins. With a 200 g regolith sample and an rf-magnetometer with sensitivity $1~{\rm fT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ we can detect $^3{\rm He}$ with abundance 5 ppb within a measurement time of just 5 min. The associated apparatus is lightweight and significantly more cost-effective than alternative measurement techniques. The proposed prospecting method is readily deployable and could substantially improve the technical and economic feasibility of mining lunar $^3{\rm He}$.</description>

      <title>Analog ensemble forecasts of solar wind parameters: Quantification of the predictability and time-domain spectral performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecasting multiscale properties of the solar wind is one of the important aspects of space weather prediction as mesoscales, larger than one minute, can affect the magnetosphere. Amongst forecasting techniques, the Analog Ensemble (AnEn) method allows the forecast of a quantity from its past behavior, is easy and quick to implement, and results in an ensemble of time series.
  A comparison of optimal AnEn forecasts of \textit{Wind} spacecraft observations of near-Earth solar wind properties with the persistence and climatology baselines allows a quantification of the predictability of the magnetic and velocity components and magnitude. The AnEn predictions were found to be as accurate as persistence for short-term forecasts and climatology for long-term ones, and performed better than both baselines for more than 60\% of the samples for a particular lead time. Furthermore, using an AnEn instead of the baselines enables prediction of the full spectrum of solar wind fluctuations. However, using the standard averaging method to generate a unique forecast from the AnEn ensemble results in a loss of power in the small-scale fluctuations. To prevent this loss, a new spectral reduction method is proposed and compared to the standard averaging method as well as the synodic recurrence baseline. The AnEn spectral-reduced forecast is shown to be more time-accurate than the synodic baseline and more frequency-accurate than the mean-reduced forecasts. Such a reduced forecast is then confirmed to be useful as a comparative baseline in performance diagnostics of space weather models.</description>

      <title>Self-referencing photothermal common-path interferometry to measure absorption of Si3N4 membranes for laser-light sails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser-light sails are a spacecraft concept wherein lightweight "sails" are propelled by high-intensity lasers. We investigated the near-infrared absorption of free-standing membranes of stoichiometric silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$), a candidate sail material. To resolve the small but non-zero optical loss, we used photothermal common-path interferometry (PCI), for which we developed a self-referencing modality where a PCI measurement is performed twice: once on a bare membrane, and a second time with monolayer graphene deposited on the membrane. The graphene increases the absorption of the sample by orders of magnitude, such that it can be measured by ellipsometry, without significantly affecting the thermal properties. We measured the absorption coefficient of Si$_3$N$_4$ to be (1.5-3) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ cm$^{-1}$ at 1064 nm, making it a suitable sail material for laser intensities as high as ~10 GW/m$^2$. By comparison, silicon-rich "low stress" SiN$_x$ (x~1), with a measured absorption coefficient of approximately 8 cm$^{-1}$, is unlikely to survive such high laser intensities. Our self-referencing technique enables testing of low-loss membranes of various materials for laser sails and other applications.</description>
