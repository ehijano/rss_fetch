      <title>On the Convergence of Elementary Cellular Automata under Sequential Update Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform a theoretical analysis of the sequential convergence of elementary cellular automata that have at least one fixed point. Our aim is to establish which elementary rules always reach fixed points under sequential update modes, regardless of the initial configuration. In this context, we classify these rules according to whether all initial configurations converge under all, some, one or none sequential update modes, depending on if they have fixed points under synchronous (or parallel) update modes.</description>

      <title>Disk and Partial Disk Inspection: Worst- to Average-Case and Pareto Upper Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15391v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider $n$ unit-speed mobile agents initially positioned at the center of a unit disk, tasked with inspecting all points on the disk's perimeter. A perimeter point is considered covered if an agent located outside the disk's interior has unobstructed visibility of it, treating the disk itself as an obstacle. For $n=1$, this problem is known as the shoreline problem with a known distance. Isbell (1957) derived an optimal trajectory that minimizes the worst-case inspection time for this problem, while Gluss (1961) proposed heuristics for its average-case version. The one-agent case was originally introduced as a more tractable variant of Bellman's famous lost-in-the-forest problem.
  Our contributions are threefold. First, as a warm-up, we extend Isbell's findings by deriving worst-case optimal trajectories for partial inspection of a section of the disk, thereby providing an alternative proof of optimality for inspection with $n \geq 2$ agents. Second, we improve Gluss's bounds on the average-case inspection time under a uniform distribution of perimeter points (equivalent to randomized inspection algorithms), and we also strengthen the methodology by combining spatial discretization with Nonlinear Programming (NLP) to build feasible solutions to the continuous problem and compare them with NLP solutions. Third, we establish Pareto-optimal bounds for the multi-objective problem of jointly minimizing the worst-case and average-case inspection times.</description>

      <title>Optimal Average Disk-Inspection via Fermat's Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work resolves the optimal average-case cost of the Disk-Inspection problem, a variant of Bellman's 1955 lost-in-a-forest problem. In Disk-Inspection, a mobile agent starts at the center of a unit disk and follows a trajectory that inspects perimeter points whenever the disk does not obstruct visibility. The worst-case cost was solved optimally in 1957 by Isbell, but the average-case version remained open, with heuristic upper bounds proposed by Gluss in 1961 and improved only recently.
  Our approach applies Fermat's Principle of Least Time to a recently proposed discretization framework, showing that optimal solutions are captured by a one-parameter family of recurrences independent of the discretization size. In the continuum limit these recurrences give rise to a single-parameter optimal control problem, whose trajectories coincide with limiting solutions of the original Disk-Inspection problem. A crucial step is proving that the optimal initial condition generates a trajectory that avoids the unit disk, thereby validating the optics formulation and reducing the many-variable optimization to a rigorous one-parameter problem. In particular, this disproves Gluss's conjecture that optimal trajectories must touch the disk.
  Our analysis determines the exact optimal average-case inspection cost, equal to $3.549259\ldots$ and certified to at least six digits of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Common information in well-mixing graphs and applications to information-theoretic cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the connection between mixing properties for bipartite graphs and materialization of the mutual information in one-shot settings. We show that mixing properties of a graph imply impossibility to extract the mutual information shared by the ends of an edge randomly sampled in the graph. We apply these impossibility results to some questions motivated by information-theoretic cryptography. In particular, we show that communication complexity of a secret key agreement in one-shot setting is inherently uneven: for some inputs, almost all communication complexity inevitably falls on only one party.</description>

      <title>Decoupling via Affine Spectral-Independence: Beck-Fiala and Koml\'os Bounds Beyond Banaszczyk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Beck-Fiala Conjecture [Discrete Appl. Math, 1981] asserts that any set system of $n$ elements with degree $k$ has combinatorial discrepancy $O(\sqrt{k})$. A substantial generalization is the Koml\'os Conjecture, which states that any $m \times n$ matrix with unit length columns has discrepancy $O(1)$.
  In this work, we resolve the Beck-Fiala Conjecture for $k \geq \log^2 n$. We also give an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k} + \sqrt{\log n})$ bound for $k \leq \log^2 n$, where $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides $\mathsf{poly}(\log \log n)$ factors. These bounds improve upon the $O(\sqrt{k \log n})$ bound due to Banaszczyk [Random Struct. Algor., 1998].
  For the Komlos problem, we give an $\widetilde{O}(\log^{1/4} n)$ bound, improving upon the previous $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ bound [Random Struct. Algor., 1998]. All of our results also admit efficient polynomial-time algorithms.
  To obtain these results, we exploit a new technique of ``decoupling via affine spectral-independence'' in designing rounding algorithms. In particular, our algorithms obtain the desired colorings via a discrete Brownian motion, guided by a semidefinite program (SDP). Besides standard constraints used in prior works, we add some extra affine spectral-independence constraints, which effectively decouple the evolution of discrepancies across different rows, and allow us to better control how many rows accumulate large discrepancies at any point during the process. This new technique is quite general and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Max-Min and 1-Bounded Space Algorithms for the Bin Packing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the (1-dimensional) bin packing problem, we are asked to pack all the given items into bins, each of capacity one, so that the number of non-empty bins is minimized. Zhu~[Chaos, Solitons \&amp; Fractals 2016] proposed an approximation algorithm $MM$ that sorts the item sequence in a non-increasing order by size at the beginning, and then repeatedly packs, into the current single open bin, first as many of the largest items in the remaining sequence as possible and then as many of the smallest items in the remaining sequence as possible. In this paper we prove that the asymptotic approximation ratio of $MM$ is at most 1.5. Next, focusing on the fact that $MM$ is at the intersection of two algorithm classes, max-min algorithms and 1-bounded space algorithms, we comprehensively analyze the theoretical performance bounds of each subclass derived from the two classes. Our results include a lower bound of 1.25 for the intersection of the two classes. Furthermore, we extend the theoretical analysis over algorithm classes to the cardinality constrained bin packing problem.</description>
