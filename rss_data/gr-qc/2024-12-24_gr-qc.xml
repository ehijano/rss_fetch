      <title>Energy Momentum Tensor of Extended and Non-extended Theory of Weak Gravity and Spinor Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two distinct energy-momentum tensors of the theory of weak gravity and spinor quantum mechanics are analyzed with respect to their four-divergence and expectation values of energy. The first energy-momentum tensor is obtained by a straightforward generalization of the symmetric energy-momentum tensor of a free Dirac field, and the second is derived by the second Noether theorem. We find that the four-divergences of both tensors are not equal. Particularly, the tensor derived by the generalization procedure does not match the four-divergence of the canonical energy-momentum tensor. As a result, both tensors predict distinct values for the energy of the Dirac field. The energy-momentum tensor of the non-extended theory with the correct expression for four-divergence obtained by the second Noether theorem is asymmetric. This contradicts the requirements of general relativity. To rectify this situation, the Lagrangian of the theory is extended with the Lagrangian of the free electromagnetic field on curved spacetime. Then, the symmetric energy-momentum tensor of quantum electrodynamics with the required four-divergence is obtained by the second Noether theorem. Moreover, the energy-momentum tensor appears in the interaction Lagrangian term of the extended theory. In addition, we show that the Lagrangian density of the extended theory can be recast into the Lagrangian density of a flat spacetime theory, contrary to the statement made for the non-extended theory.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing square-law k-inflation from Planck data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a square-law k-inflation using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. Focusing on scenarios where the Hubble parameter exhibits a power-law dependence on the k-field, our analysis encompasses the computations of crucial observables, such as the scalar power spectrum, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the scalar spectral index. We further constrain the model's parameters using Planck data and present a specific form of the potential. Our results demonstrate that the model aligns well with observational data.</description>

      <title>Angular Resolution of a Bayesian Search for Anisotropic Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a spaceborne gravitational wave (GW) detector set to launch in 2035, will observe several stochastic GW backgrounds in the mHz frequency band. At least one of these signals -- arising from the tens of millions of unresolved white dwarf binaries in the Milky Way -- is expected to be highly anisotropic on the sky. We evaluate the angular resolution of LISA and its ability to characterize anisotropic stochastic GW backgrounds (ASGWBs) using the Bayesian Spherical Harmonic formalism in the Bayesian LISA Inference Package (BLIP). We use \blip to simulate and analyze ASGWB signals in LISA across a large grid in total observing time, ASGWB amplitude, and angular size. We consider the ability of the \blip anisotropic search algorithm to both characterize single point sources and to separate two point sources on the sky, using a full-width half-max (FWHM) metric to measure the quality and spread of the recovered spatial distributions. We find that the number of spherical harmonic coefficients used in the anisotropic search model is the primary factor that limits the search's angular resolution. Notably, this trend continues until computational limitations become relevant around $\ell_{\mathrm{max}}=16$; this exceeds the maximum angular resolution achieved by other map-making techniques for LISA ASGWBs.</description>

      <title>Testing loop quantum gravity by quasi-periodic oscillations: rotating blackholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a compelling model of a rotating black hole that is deformed by the effects of loop quantum gravity (LQG). We present a simplified metric and explore two distinct geometries: one in which the masses of the black hole and white hole are equal, and another in which they differ. Our analysis yields the radius of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO), as well as the energy and angular momentum of a particle within this framework. Additionally, we find the frequency of the first-order resonance separately. We constrain the model by the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) of the X-ray binary GRO J1655-40. We show that $\lambda=0.15^{+0.23}_{-0.14}$ at $1\sigma$ confidence level for equal mass black hole and white hole geometry. For the other geometry we get $\lambda=0.11^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$ at $1\sigma$ confidence level.We encounter a degeneracy in the parameter space that hinders our ability to constrain $\lambda$ with greater precision.</description>

      <title>New modeling for hybrid stars with an elastic quark core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy neutron stars may contain solid quark cores as motivated by, e.g. the crystalline color superconducting phase, forming elastic hybrid stars (HSs). Many previous studies assumed an elastic core to be unsheared for the background, static and spherically symmetric configuration, and introduced shear deformation only at a perturbative level. This study relaxes this assumption and explores the influence of non-linear elasticity on the static, spherically symmetric structure of elastic HSs within a fully relativistic elasticity framework. Such a framework effectively introduces anisotropic pressure within the quark matter core due to elasticity. The quark core is modeled using a quasi-Hookean equation of state (EOS) with shear contributions, while the nuclear matter envelope is treated as a perfect fluid. We find that including elasticity increases the maximum mass of HSs by around 10%. This enhancement allows some soft EOSs to satisfy current observational constraints. However, since the effects of elasticity are primarily concentrated in the high-mass regime, the current observational constraints are insufficient to distinguish whether an elastic anisotropic quark core exists within these stars. Additionally, we show that the compactness of stable stars can exceed the critical value of 1/3 due to the inclusion of elasticity, making them potential candidates for black hole mimickers. Furthermore, we found that common phenomenological models fail to describe the anisotropy of the elastic core and propose a new parametrized anisotropy model that can accurately capture physically-motivated profiles with an error of 10% across a wide parameter space. This work not only bridges the gap between elastic EOSs and parametrized anisotropic models but also provides a foundation for applications such as studying nonradial perturbations, tidal deformability, and pulsation modes for elastic HSs.</description>

      <title>Returning Back to Mukhanov Parametrization of Inflationary Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have re-examined Mukhanov parametrization for inflationary equation of state $1+\omega=\frac{\beta}{({N}+1)^\alpha}$, in the light of Planck 2018 results and latest bound on tensor-to-scalar ratio employing Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We have found the current observational values of scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio can be used efficiently to constrain the model parameters. The recent findings of $r&lt;0.032$ has been used to put an upper bound on one of the model parameter. Whereas the $1-\sigma$ bound of the scalar spectral index $0.9607\leq n_{_S}\leq 0.9691$ along with the upper bound of scalar-to-tensor ratio provided restriction on the other model parameter $1.50\leq\alpha\leq2.20$. This bound depends on the number of e-foldings still left before the end of inflation and whenever $1.50\leq\alpha\leq2.20$ we can find appropriate values of the other model parameter $\beta$ so that the observational predictions are in tune with the latest available inflationary observables.</description>

      <title>Strong deflection of massive particles in spherically symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near a gravitating compact object, massive particles traveling along timelike geodesics are gravitationally deflected similarly to light. In this paper, we study the deflection angles of these particles in the strong deflection limit. This analytical approximation applies when particles in unbound orbits approach the compact object very closely, circle around it at a radius close to that of the unstable circular orbit, and eventually escape. While previous studies have provided results for particular metrics, we offer a general solution applicable to any static, spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat spacetime. After briefly reviewing the exact expression for the deflection angle of massive particles, we present a strong deflection limit analysis for this general case. The developed formulas are then applied to three particular metrics: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Janis-Newman-Winicour.</description>

      <title>Fast frequency-domain gravitational waveforms for precessing binaries with a new twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waveform (GW) models are a core ingredient for the analysis of compact binary mergers observed by current ground-based interferometers. We focus here on a specific class of such models known as PhenomX, which has gained popularity in recent years thanks to its computational efficiency. We introduce a new description of the ``twisting-up'' mapping underpinning the construction of precessing waveforms within this family. The new description is an adaptation to the frequency domain of a technique previously implemented in time-domain models, where the orbit-averaged post-Newtonian spin-precession dynamics is numerically solved on the fly. We also present an improved version of the gravitational-wave strain amplitudes approximating the signal in the co-precessing frame. We demonstrate that the new description yields improved matches against numerical relativity simulations, with only a modest computational overhead. We also show that the new model can be reliably employed in parameter estimation follow-ups of GW events, returning equivalent or more stringent measurements of the source properties compared to its predecessor.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the concept of mutual information for particle pair (MIPP) in curved spacetime, and find that MIPP is a proper chaos indicator. We tested this method in the Kerr spacetime and compared it with the fast Lyapunov indicator. The results show that the MIPP effectively identify orbital states and demonstrates prominent performance in recognizing transitions between orbital states. Our result show that information theory significantly deepen our understanding of dynamics of few-body system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we discuss the geodesic motion of covariant effective quantum black hole, and give the explicit critical values of the quantum parameter, beyond which the geodesic orbits disappear. By the analysis of the critical orbital behavior, we find that in covariant effective loop quantum gravity, there exists static free test particle lavitating outside the black hole, and, different with the attractive effect performed by the classical gravity, the quantum correction in the general relativity could perform as the repulsive effect in certain regions.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal mode spectrum of rotating black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes are excited during the ringdown phase of black holes after merger. Determination of quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes in alternative theories of gravity has remained a challenge for a long time. Here we discuss in detail our recently developed method to extract the quasinormal modes for rapidly rotating black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton theory. We first obtain numerically the exact rapidly rotating background solutions, which also clarify their domain of existence. Then we solve the equations for the linear perturbations of the metric and the dilaton field by employing an appropriate set of boundary conditions and a spectral decomposition of the perturbation functions. The resulting spectrum agrees well with the known limits obtained for slow rotation and weak coupling, while it exhibits larger deviations for stronger coupling.</description>

      <title>No Glitch in the Matrix: Robust Reconstruction of Gravitational Wave Signals Under Noise Artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations by ground based detectors such as LIGO and Virgo have transformed astrophysics, enabling the study of compact binary systems and their mergers. However, transient noise artifacts, or glitches, pose a significant challenge, often obscuring or mimicking signals and complicating their analysis. In this work, we extend the Attention-boosted Waveform Reconstruction network to address glitch mitigation, demonstrating its robustness in reconstructing waveforms in the presence of real glitches from the third observing run of LIGO. Without requiring explicit training on glitches, AWaRe accurately isolates gravitational wave signals from data contaminated by glitches spanning a wide range of amplitudes and morphologies. We evaluate this capability by investigating the events GW191109 and GW200129, which exhibit strong evidence of anti-aligned spins and spin precession respectively, but may be adversely affected by data quality issues. We find that, regardless of the potential presence of glitches in the data, AWaRe reconstructs both waveforms with high accuracy. Additionally, we perform a systematic study of the performance of AWaRe on a simulated catalog of injected waveforms in real LIGO glitches and obtain reliable reconstructions of the waveforms. By subtracting the AWaRe reconstructions from the data, we show that the resulting residuals closely align with the background noise that the waveforms were injected in. The robustness of AWaRe in mitigating glitches, despite being trained exclusively on GW signals and not explicitly on glitches, highlights its potential as a powerful tool for improving the reliability of searches and characterizing noise artifacts.</description>

      <title>Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solutions in bigravity and Kerr-Schild double copy relations using an effective metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work a formalism for proportional generalized double Kerr-Schild ansatz in bigravity is considered, where both metrics are coupled to matter. We study time-dependent and stationary solutions in the framework of the Kerr-Schild classical double copy and obtain the classical Kerr-Schild for the double, single and zeroth copy equations. For the time-dependent case, we use AdS waves solutions in bigravity previously studied in the literature. For the stationary case, we discuss a kind of Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solutions in bigravity which permit different masses, NUT parameters, electric and magnetic charges, while the kinematical parameters are the same, and the cosmological constants related. These solution is presented in Pleba\'nski coordinates, and it is noticed that in these coordinates the description simplifies the classical double copy equations allowing a clearer interpretation in terms of the defined fields. We present and interpret some cases for these solutions for the separate matter sector and using the effective metric.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Super-Poissonian Nonclassical Nature of Inflaton Field in Flat FRW Universe through Cosmological Mandels $Q$ Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the nonclassical properties of the inflaton field within the framework of semiclassical gravity by analyzing Cosmological Mandels $Q$ parameter for Squeezed Number States (SNS) and Coherent Squeezed Number States (CSNS). Mandels $Q$ parameter serves as a critical tool for identifying nonclassical states by differentiating between sub-Poissonian and super-Poissonian statistics. The values of Cosmological Mandels $Q$ are positive shows the super-Poissonian non-classical nature of inflaton for Squeezed Number States (SNS) and Coherent Squeezed Number States (CSNS). These results provide deeper insights into the statistical properties of quantum states in early-universe cosmology and emphasize the relevance of SNS and CSNS in understanding quantum effects on cosmic inflation and particle production</description>

      <title>Solar system tests in covariant f(Q) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Solar System constraints on covariant $f(Q)$ gravity. The covariant $f(Q)$ theory is described by the metric and affine connection, where both the torsion and curvature vanish. Considering a model including a higher nonmetricity-scalar correction, $f(Q)= Q +\alpha Q^{n} - 2\Lambda$, we derive static and spherically symmetric solutions, which represent the Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution with higher-order corrections, for two different ansatz of the affine connection. On the obtained spacetime solutions, we investigate the perihelion precession, light deflection, Shapiro delay, Cassini constraint, and gravitational redshift in the $f(Q)$ gravity. We place bounds on the parameter $\alpha$ with $n=2, 3$ in our model of $f(Q)$ gravity, using various observational data in the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of piecewise flat quantum gravity with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the approach to quantum gravity which is based on the assumption that the short-distance structure of the spacetime is given by a piecewise flat manifold corresponding to a triangulation of a smooth manifold. We then describe the coupling of the Standard Model to this quantum gravity theory and show that the corresponding path integral is finite when the negative power of the product of the edge lengths squared in the path-integral measure is chossen to be grater than 52,5. The implications of this result are discussed, which include a relationship between the effective action and a wavefunction of the universe, the existence of the non-perturbative effective action, the correct value of the cosmological constant and the natural appearence of the Starobinsky inflation.</description>

      <title>Spherical photon orbits around Kerr-MOG black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates photon orbits around Kerr-MOG black holes. The equation of photon of motion around the Kerr-MOG black hole is derived by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, expressed as a sixth-order polynomial involving the inclination angle $v$, the rotation parameter $u$, and the deformation parameter $\alpha$ that characterizes modified gravity. We find that $\alpha$ constrains the rotation of the black hole, modifying its gravitational field and leading to distinct photon orbital characteristics. Numerical analysis reveals that the polar plane ($v=1$) has two effective orbits: one outside and one inside the event horizon, while the equatorial plane ($v=0$) has four effective orbits: two outside and two inside the event horizon. Moreover, we derive the exact formula for general photon orbits between the polar and equatorial planes ($0&lt;v&lt;1$). In the extremal case, the rotation speed significantly impacts general photon orbits. A slowly rotating extremal black hole has two general photon orbits outside the event horizon, whereas a rapidly rotating extremal black hole has only one such orbit. In the non-extremal case, a critical inclination angle $v_{cr}$ exists in the parameter space $\left(v, u, \alpha \right)$. Below $v_{cr}$, there are four general photon orbits, while above $v_{cr}$, there are two orbits. At the critical inclination angle, three solutions are found: two photon orbits outside and one inside the event horizon. Additionally, the results indicate that all orbits are radially unstable. Furthermore, by analyzing photon impact parameter, we argue that $\alpha$ influences observational properties of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Bekenstein bounds in maximally symmetric nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore dynamical features of the maximally symmetric nonlinear extension of classical electromagnetism, recently proposed in the literature as "ModMax" electrodynamics. This family of theories is the only one that preserves all the symmetries of Maxwell's theory, having applications in the study of regular black hole solutions and supersymmetry. The purpose of this article is three-fold. Firstly, we study the initial-value problem of ModMax and show, by means of a simple geometric criterion, that such a theory admits a well-posed formulation. Secondly, we prove a series of geometric inequalities relating energy, charge, angular momentum, and size in ModMax. The validity of these bounds gives strong evidence of a universal inequality conjectured by Bekenstein for macroscopic systems. Finally, we perform the first stable numerical simulations of ModMax in the highly nonlinear regime, and verify an inequality between energy, size and angular momentum in bounded domains.</description>

      <title>Stellar collapse with pressure in effective loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore semiclassical stellar collapse scenarios with pressure within the framework of effective loop quantum gravity. The objective of this work is to generalize existent models of semiclassical dust collapse and examine the role of pressure in the formation of shell-crossing singularities in a semiclassical context. Numerical investigations show that the shell-focusing singularity characterizing the end state of any classical stellar collapse is here resolved by quantum gravitational effects and replaced by a bounce of the star. However, they also show that shell-crossing singularities remain a general feature of these models and that the inclusion of pressure does not alter the qualitative picture emerging from semiclassical models of inhomogeneous dust collapse. Given the absence of a shell-focusing singularity and the possibility of extending spacetime in the future of the trapped region formed by gravitational collapse, the investigation of the causal structure of the spacetime describing the semiclassical collapse of a star is inevitably tied to a better understanding of the physics of these shell-crossing singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study symmetry-breaking inflation within the framework of metric-affine gravity. By introducing a non-minimal coupling, $\beta(\phi)\tilde{\cal R}$, between the Holst invariant and the inflaton, both small-field and large-field inflationary predictions can be brought into agreement with the latest observational constraints. Remarkably, even for sub-Planckian vacuum expectation values, appropriately chosen values of $\beta(\phi)$ enable viable inflation, a scenario previously considered unattainable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the interaction between two quantum systems in spacetime and we compare two possible models to describe it: 1) a fully quantum field theoretical (QFT) description of the coupling of two quantum systems mediated by a quantum field and 2) a quantum-controlled model (qc-model), which is an effectively relativistic direct-coupling in which the interaction of two quantum systems is not mediated by a field with local quantum degrees of freedom. We show that while there are regimes where the qc-model can approximate QFT arbitrarily well, it can suffer from retrocausal effects. We discuss in what regimes those retrocausal predictions of the qc-model are non-negligible and whether they can be used to argue that gravity induced entanglement experiments can reveal genuinely quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction or not.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Observatories in AdS$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional general relativity with a negative cosmological constant in the presence of a finite size boundary, $\Gamma$, for both Euclidean and Lorentzian signature. As our boundary condition, we consider the `conformal' boundary condition that fixes the conformal class of the induced metric at $\Gamma$ and the trace of the extrinsic curvature, $K(x^m)$. In Lorentzian signature, we must supplement these with appropriate initial data comprising the standard Cauchy data along a spatial slice and, in addition, initial data for a boundary mode that appears due to the presence of the finite size boundary. We perform a linearised analysis of the gravitational field equations for both an $S^2\times \mathbb{R}$ as well as a Minkowskian, $\mathbb{R}^{1,2}$, boundary. In the $S^2\times \mathbb{R}$ case, in addition to the usual AdS$_4$ normal modes, we uncover a novel linearised perturbation, $\boldsymbol{\omega}(x^m)$, which can exhibit complex frequencies at sufficiently large angular momentum. Upon moving $\Gamma$ toward the infinite asymptotic AdS$_4$ boundary, the complex frequencies appear at increasingly large angular momentum and vanish altogether in the strict limit. In the $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$ case, although we uncover an analogous novel perturbation, we show it does not exhibit complex frequencies. In Euclidean signature, we show that $K(x^m)$ plays the role of a source for $\boldsymbol{\omega}(x^m)$. When close to the AdS$_4$ asymptotic boundary, we speculate on the holographic interpretation of $\boldsymbol{\omega}(x^m)$.</description>

      <title>A complete analysis of inflation with piecewise quadratic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a thorough study of the comoving curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$ in single-field inflation with two stages, represented by a piecewise quadratic potential, where both the first and second derivatives are allowed to be discontinuous at the transition point. We calculate the evolution of $\mathcal{R}$ by combining the perturbative and non-perturbative methods consistently, and obtain the power spectrum and the non-Gaussian features in the probability distribution function. We find that both the spectrum and the statistics of $\mathcal{R}$ depend significantly on the second derivatives of the potential at both the first and second stages. Furthermore, we find a new parameter constructed from the potential parameters, which we call $\alpha$, plays a decisive role in determining various features in the spectrum such as the amplitude, the slope, and the existence of a dip. In particular, we recover the typical $k^4$ growth of the spectrum in most cases, but the maximum growth rate of $k^5(\log k)^2$ can be obtained by fine-tuning the parameters. Then, using the $\delta N$ formalism valid on superhorizon scales, we give fully nonlinear formulas for $\cal{R}$ in terms of the scalar field perturbation $\delta\phi$ and its time derivative. In passing, we point out the importance of the nonlinear evolution of $\delta\phi$ on superhorizon scales. Finally, using the Press-Schechter formalism for simplicity, we discuss the effect of the non-Gaussian tails of the probability distribution function on the primordial black hole formation.</description>

      <title>Conformal geometry as a gauge theory of gravity: covariant equations of motion &amp; conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Weyl conformal geometry as a general gauge theory of the Weyl group (of Poincar\'e and dilatations symmetries) in a manifestly Weyl gauge covariant formalism in which this geometry is (automatically) metric and physically relevant. This gives a realistic (quadratic) gauge theory of gravity, with Einstein-Hilbert gravity and a (positive) cosmological constant recovered in its spontaneously broken phase. For the most general action we compute the manifestly Weyl gauge covariant equations of motion and present the conservation laws for the energy-momentum tensor and Weyl gauge current. These laws are valid both in Weyl conformal geometry (with respect to the Weyl gauge covariant derivative) but also in the Riemannian geometry equivalent picture (with respect to its associated covariant derivative). This interesting result is a consequence of (gauged) diffeomorphism invariance of the former versus usual diffeomorphism invariance of the latter. These results are first derived for $d=4$ dimensions and are then extended to conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions while automatically maintaining manifest Weyl gauge invariance/covariance. The results are useful in physical applications with this symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of quantum fluctuations on the event horizon area and their implications for corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. These quantum corrections are incorporated into the framework of large-scale gravitational systems, utilizing the holographic principle to derive modified Friedmann equations. By redefining the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, our model predicts significant alterations to the Friedmann equations within specific parameter ranges, offering novel perspectives on cosmological scales. Using distance modulus data from the Pantheon supernova sample, we demonstrate the model's potential to constrain the parameters governing quantum corrections and address unresolved cosmological issues. Crucially, our analysis reveals that quantum fluctuations can increase the area of the event horizon by up to 47\%. Beyond this threshold, theoretical predictions encounter substantial challenges when compared with observational data. This approach bridges quantum gravity and observational cosmology, opening new avenues for testing and refining theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Dark photons and tachyonic instability induced by Barbero-Immirzi parameter and axion-torsion transmutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Holst gravity by examining two distinct examples. The first example involves minimal coupling to torsion, while the second explores non-minimal coupling. The motivation for the first example stems from the recent work by Dombriz, which utilized a technique of imposing constraint constant coefficients to massive torsion in the model Lagrangian to determine parameters for the Einstein-Cartan-Holst gravity. We extend this methodology to investigate dark photons, where axial torsion transforms into axions.Interest in elucidating the abundance of dark photons within the framework of general relativity was sparked by Agrawal. Building on the work of Barman, who explored minimal coupling of massive torsion mediated by dark matter (DM) with light torsion on the order of 1.7 TeV, we have derived a Barbero-Immirzi (BI) parameter of approximately 0.775. This value falls within the range established by Panza et al. at TeV scales, specifically $0\le{\beta}\le{1.185}$. This seems to our knowledge the first time BI parameter is induced by dark photons on a minimal EC gravity. Very recently, implications of findings of BI parameter in cosmological bounces has appeared in the literature. For a smaller BI parameter a higher torsion mass of 1.51 TeV is obtained. Nevertheless. this figure is still a signature of light torsion which can be compatible with light dark photon masses. Magnetic helicity instability of dark photons is investigated. Axion oscillation frequency is shown to depend on the BI parameter and the BI spectra is determined by an histogram. This study not only broadens the understanding of Holst gravity but also provides crucial insights into the interplay between torsion, dark photons, and axions in the cosmological context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct local, in spacetime, singular solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations that exhibit Kasner-like behavior in their past boundary. Our result can be viewed as a localization (in space) of the construction in \cite{FL}. We also prove a refined uniqueness statement and give a simple argument that generates general asymptotic data for Kasner-like singularities, enjoying all expected degrees of freedom, albeit only locally in space. The key difference of the present work with \cite{FL} is our use of a first order symmetric hyperbolic formulation of the Einstein vacuum equations, relative to the connection coefficients of a parallelly propagated orthonormal frame which is adapted to the Gaussian time foliation. This makes it easier to localize the construction, since elliptic estimates are no longer required to complete the energy argument.</description>

Abstract: Glitches are non-Gaussian noise transients originating from environmental and instrumental sources that contaminate data from gravitational wave detectors. Some glitches can even mimic gravitational wave signals from compact object mergers, which are the primary targets of terrestrial observatories. In this study, we present a method to analyze noise transients from the LIGO observatories using Q-transform information combined with t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). We implement classification techniques, examine the influence of parameters on glitch classification, and conduct a week-long daily analysis to track outlier transients over time.</description>

Abstract: Neutral hydrogen serves as a crucial probe for the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Actual observations of the 21-cm signal often encounter challenges such as thermal noise and various systematic effects. To overcome these challenges, we simulate SKA-Low-depth images and process them with a deep learning method. We utilized foreground residuals acquired by LOFAR during actual North Celestial Pole field observations, thermal and excess variances calculated via Gaussian process regression, and 21-cm signals generated with 21cmFAST for signal extraction tests. Our approach to overcome these foreground, thermal noise, and excess variance components employs a 3D U-Net neural network architecture for image analysis. When considering thermal noise corresponding to 1400 hours of integration, U-Net provides reliable 2D power spectrum predictions, and robustness tests ensure that we get realistic EoR signals. Adding foreground residuals, however, causes inconsistencies below the horizon delay-line. Lastly, evaluating both thermal and excess variance with observations up to 3700 and 14000 hours ensures reliable power spectrum estimations within the EoR window and across nearly all scales, respectively.</description>

      <title>Transonic accretion flow in the mini discs of a binary black hole system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the general relativistic transonic accretion flow around the primary black hole, which forms the circumprimary disc (CPD), within a BBH system. The BBH spacetime is characterized by the mass ratio ($q$) and the separation distance ($z_2$) between the two black holes. We numerically solve the radial momentum and energy equations to obtain the accretion solutions. It is observed that the CPD can exhibit shock solutions, which exist for a wide range parameter space spanned by flow angular momentum ($\lambda$) and energy ($E$). We find that the shock parameter space is modified by $q$ and $z_2$. Investigations show that $q$ and $z_2$ also affect various shock properties, such as density compression and temperature compression across the shock fronts. Moreover, we calculate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the CPD and examine how the SEDs are modified by $q$ and $z_2$ for both shock-free and shock-induced accretion solutions. SED is found to be nearly independent of the binary parameters. We depict that the mutual interaction between two black holes in a binary system hardly alters their individual accretion features. This study replicates the existing predictions in a different context of binary accretion.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from a first-order phase transition of the inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the production of gravitational waves (GW) resulting from a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in a non-minimally coupled `Dark Higgs Inflation' model. Utilizing a dark sector scalar field as the inflaton, we demonstrate how inflationary dynamics naturally set the stage for observable FOPT. These transitions, influenced by thermal and quantum effects, generate GW spectra potentially detectable by observatories such as LISA, DECIGO, the Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. Our study highlights the inflaton's dual role in cosmic inflation and early Universe phase transitions, presenting a unified framework to probe physics beyond the Standard Model through gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing analogue Unruh effect via superradiance in a cylindrical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to detect the Unruh effect in a circularly rotated Unruh-DeWitt detector enclosed within a cylindrical cavity. This technique relies on the enhanced atomic spontaneous emission rate related to the counter-rotating coupling between the detector and massless scalar fields. Our analysis demonstrates that the integration of a cylindrical cavity, coherent light excitation, and multi-atom super-radiation significantly enhances the signal strength, as the radiation rate associated with the standard rotating-wave coupling can be greatly suppressed within the cavity. Compared to linear acceleration, circular motion can significantly reduce the atomic acceleration path length, leading to increased detection efficiency and lower experimental difficulty. Our method provides a novel avenue for exploring relativistic effects on a compact, tabletop platform.</description>

      <title>Potential Surge Preheating: enhanced resonance from potential features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of local features in the inflationary potential on the preheating dynamics after inflation. We show that a small feature in the potential can enhance the resonance and bring the radiation-like state equation during preheating despite the inflationary potential being a quadratic one. Such localized features may naturally arise due to various physical effects without altering the large-scale predictions of the original model for cosmic microwave background (CMB) observables. We demonstrate that these features effectively introduce localized higher-power terms in the potential, significantly influencing the preheating dynamics $\unicode{x2013}$ a phenomenon we term potential surge preheating. We outline the resulting modifications in energy distribution among different components. We further show that these small-scale features leave detectable imprints in the form of gravitational wave signals. These signals influence CMB measurements of the effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$, offering a way to reconstruct the shape of the inflaton potential at small scales. Finally, we argue that these modifications to the scalar potential provide a framework to explore preheating dynamics and the fragmentation of scalar fields using simple scalar potentials.</description>

Abstract: Proposed experiments for obtaining empirical evidence for a quantum description of gravity in a table-top setting focus on detecting quantum information signatures, such as entanglement or non-Gaussianity production, in gravitationally interacting quantum systems. Here, we explore an alternative approach where the quantization of gravity could be inferred through measurements of macroscopic, thermodynamical quantities, without the need for addressability of individual quantum systems. To demonstrate the idea, we take as a case study a gravitationally self-interacting Bose gas, and consider its heat capacity. We find a clear-cut distinction between the predictions of a classical gravitational interaction and a quantum gravitational interaction in the heat capacity of the Bose gas.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a no-go theorem for the novel Ricci-inverse theory of modified gravity. By considering a static spherically symmetric matter distribution embedded within a de Sitter cosmology, we demonstrate that achieving a stable Sub-Horizon non-relativistic Weak-Field limit is unattainable in any of the models previously proposed to mitigate certain cosmological and inflationary instabilities. We explore potential strategies to address this challenge, suggesting a novel methodology for constructing stable models that adhere to the Sub-Horizon non-relativistic Weak-Field limit. These models are shown to maintain full consistency with the predictions of General Relativity at small scales.</description>

Abstract: The post-inflationary epochs are critical for comprehending the early evolution of our Universe. This article delves into the cosmological signatures that shed light on these early epochs, particularly focusing on the generation of various phenomena such as matter production via inflaton oscillation and parametric resonance, primordial black holes, and gravitational waves. We review the theoretical frameworks that could produce these signatures and discuss the current observational constraints along with prospects for future detection. Furthermore, we explore the implications of such observations for our understanding of the physics of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Off-equatorial deflections and gravitational lensing. I. In Kerr spacetime and effect of spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15174v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates off-equatorial plane deflections and gravitational lensing of both null signals and massive particles in Kerr spacetime in the weak deflection limit, with the finite distance effect of the source and detector taken into account. This is the effect caused by the fact that both the source and detector are located at finite distances from the lens, while many researchers often use the deflection angle for infinite distances from sources and detectors. The deflection in both the $\phi$ and $\theta$ directions is computed as power series of $M/r_0$ and $r_0/r_{\mathrm{s,d}}$, where $M,\,r_{\mathrm{s,d}}$ are the spacetime mass and source and detector radii respectively, and $r_0$ is the minimal radial coordinate of the trajectory. The coefficients of these series are simple trigonometric functions of $\theta_\te$, the extreme value of the $\theta$ coordinate of the trajectory. A set of exact gravitational lensing equations is used to solve for $r_0$ and $\theta_\te$ for given deviation angles $\delta\theta$ and $\delta\phi$ of the source, and two lensed images are always obtained. The apparent angles and their magnifications of these images, and the time delays between them are solved and their dependence on various parameters, especially spacetime spin $\hat{a}$ are analyzed in great detail. It is found that there generally exist two critical spacetime spin values that separate the case of test particles reaching the detector from different sides of the $z$ axis from the cases in which the images appear from the same side in the celestial plane. Three potential applications of these results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Status of Birkhoff's theorem in polymerized semiclassical regime of Loop Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collapse of a spherically symmetric ball of dust has been intensively studied in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). From a quantum theory, it is possible to recover a semiclassical regime through a polymerization procedure. In this setting, general solutions to the polymerized Einstein field equations (PEFE) will be discussed both for the interior and the exterior of the dust cloud. Exterior solutions are particularly interesting since they may lead to a semiclassical version of the Birkhoff's theorem. It is seen that if time independence of the vacuum is imposed, there exists a unique class of solutions depending on two parameters. Nevertheless, the possibility of more intricate time dependent solutions is not ruled out completely. Ultimately, these results will be compared to a model of spherical collapse obtained independently from the Einstein equations.</description>

      <title>Spin foam amplitude of the black-to-white hole transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been conjectured that quantum gravity effects may cause the black-to-white hole transition due to quantum tunneling. The transition amplitude of this process is explored within the framework of the spin foam model on a 2-complex containing 56 vertices. We develop a systematic way to construct the bulk triangulation from the boundary triangulation to obtain the 2-complex. By using Thiemann's complexifier coherent state as the boundary state to resemble the semiclassical geometry, we introduce a procedure to calculate the parameters labeling the coherent state from the continuous curved geometry. Considering that triad fields of different orientations, i.e., $e_i^a$ and $-e_i^a$, give the same intrinsic geometry of the boundary, we creatively adopt the boundary state as a superposition of the coherent states associated with both orientations. We employ the method of complex critical point to numerically compute the transition amplitude. Despite the numerical results, it is interestingly found that the transition amplitude is dominated by the terms allowing the change in orientation. This suggests that the black-to-white hole transition should be accompanied by quantum tunneling process of a change in orientation.</description>

      <title>Off-equatorial deflections and gravitational lensing. II. In general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a general perturbative procedure to find the off-equatorial plane deflections in the weak deflection limit in general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes, allowing the existence of the generalized Carter constant. Deflections of both null and timelike rays, with the finite distance effect of the source and detector taken into account, are obtained as dual series of $M/r_0$ and $r_0/r_{s,d}$. These deflections allow a set of exact gravitational lensing equations from which the images' apparent angular positions are solved. The method and general results are then applied to the Kerr-Newmann, Kerr-Sen, and rotating Simpson-Visser spacetimes to study the effect of the spin and characteristic (effective) charge of the spacetimes and the source altitude on the deflection angles and image apparent angles. It is found that, in general, both the spacetime spin and charge only affect the deflections from the second non-trivial order, while the source altitude influences the deflection from the leading order. Because of this, it is found that, in gravitational lensing in realistic situations, it is hard to measure the effects of the spacetime spin and charge from the images' apparent locations. We also presented the off-equatorial deflections in the rotating Bardeen, Hayward, Ghosh, and Tinchev black hole spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we construct a theoretical framework based on the generalized Hubble parameter form which may arise within the particle creation, viscous and $f(R)$ gravity theory. The Hubble parameter is scrutinized for its compatibility with the observational data relevant to the late-time universe. By using Bayesian statistical techniques based on $\chi^{2}$ minimization method, we determine model parameters's best fit values for the cosmic chronometer and supernovae Pantheon datasets. For the best fit values, the cosmographic and physical parameters are analyzed to understand the cosmic dynamics in model. We also analyze the model section criterion in comparison to the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model.</description>

      <title>Effective Potential and Topological Photon Spheres: A Novel Approach to Black Hole Parameter Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we base our analysis on the assumption that the existence of a photon sphere is an intrinsic feature of any ultra-compact gravitational structure with spherical symmetry. Utilizing the concept of a topological photon sphere, we categorize the behaviors of various gravitational models based on the structure of their photon spheres. This innovative approach enables us to define boundaries for black hole parameters, subsequently allowing us to classify the model as either a black hole or a naked singularity. Indeed, we will demonstrate that the presence of this interplay between the gravitational structure and the existence of a photon sphere is a unique advantage that can be utilized from both perspectives. Our observations indicate that a gravitational model typically exhibits the behavior of a horizonless structure (or a naked singularity) when a minimum effective potential (a stable photon sphere) appears within the studied spacetime region. Additionally, in this study, we tried to investigate the effect of this structure on the behavior of the photon sphere by choosing models that are affected by the Perfect Fluid Dark Matter (PFDM). Finally, by analyzing a model with multiple event horizons, we show that the proposed method remains applicable even in such scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates gravitational lensing effects in the presence of plasma in the strong deflection limit, which corresponds to light rays circling around a compact object and forming higher-order images. While previous studies of this case have predominantly focused on the deflection of light in a vacuum or in the presence of a homogeneous plasma, this work introduces an analytical treatment for the influence of a non-uniform plasma. After recalling the exact expression for the deflection angle of photons in a static, asymptotically flat and spherically symmetric spacetime filled with cold non-magnetized plasma, a strong deflection limit analysis is presented. Particular attention is then given to the case of a Schwarzschild spacetime, where the deflection angle of photons for different density profiles of plasma is obtained. Moreover, perturbative results for an arbitrary power-law radial density profile are also presented. These formulae are then applied to the calculation of the positions and magnifications of higher-order images, concluding that the presence of a non-uniform plasma reduces both their angular size and their magnifications, at least within the range of the power-law indices considered. These findings contribute to the understanding of gravitational lensing in the presence of plasma, offering a versatile framework applicable to various asymptotically flat and spherically symmetric spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: The generalized second law states the total entropy of any closed system as the universe cannot decrease if we include black hole entropy. From the point of view of an asymptotic observer, a black hole can be described at late time as an open system at fixed temperature which can radiate energy and entropy to infinity. I argue that for massless free quantum fields propagating on a black hole background, we can define a black hole dynamical free energy using observables defined at future null infinity which decreases on successive cross sections. The proof of this spontaneous evolution law is similar to Wall's derivation of the generalized second law and relies on the monotonicity properties of the relative entropy. I discuss first the simpler case of the Schwarzschild background in which the grey body factor are neglected and show that in this case the free energy only depends on the Bondi mass, the Hawking temperature and the von Neumann entropy of the propagating quantum fields. Then I argue that taking into account the grey body factors adds a new term to the thermodynamic potential involving the number of particles detected at future null infinity conjugated to a chemical potential. Finally, I discuss the case of the Kerr black hole for which an angular momentum piece needs to be added to the free energy.</description>

Abstract: Using the recently proposed covariant framework of general relativistic stochastic mechanics and stochastic thermodynamics, we proved the detailed and integral fluctuation theorems in curved spacetime. The time-reversal transformation is described as a transformation from the perspective of future-directed observer to that of the corresponding past-directed observer, which enables us to maintain general covariance throughout the construction.</description>

      <title>Algebraic classification of the gravitational field in general metric-affine geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the algebraic classification of the gravitational field in four-dimensional general metric-affine geometries, thus extending the current results of the literature in the particular framework of Weyl-Cartan geometry by the presence of the traceless nonmetricity tensor. This quantity switches on four of the eleven fundamental parts of the irreducible representation of the curvature tensor under the pseudo-orthogonal group, in such a way that three of them present similar algebraic types as the ones obtained in Weyl-Cartan geometry, whereas the remaining one includes thirty independent components and gives rise to a new algebraic classification. The latter is derived by means of its principal null directions and their levels of alignment, obtaining a total number of sixteen main algebraic types, which can be split into many subtypes. As an immediate application, we determine the algebraic types of the broadest family of static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions with spin, dilation and shear charges in Metric-Affine Gravity.</description>

      <title>$SU(\infty)$ Quantum Gravity and Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We highlight the structure and properties of an abstract approach to quantum cosmology and gravity, dubbed $SU(\infty)$-QGR. Beginning from the concept of the Universe as an isolated quantum system, the main axiom of is the existence of an infinite number of mutually commuting observables. Consequently, the Hilbert space of the Universe represents $SU(\infty)$ symmetry. This Universe as a whole is static and topological. Nonetheless, quantum fluctuations induce local clustering in its quantum state and divide it into approximately isolated subsystems representing $G \times SU(\infty)$, where $G$ is a generic finite-rank internal symmetry. Due to the global $SU(\infty)$ subsystems are entangled to the rest of the Universe. In addition to parameters characterizing the representation of $G$, their quantum states depend on four continuous parameters: two of them characterize the representation of $SU(\infty)$, a dimensionful parameter arises from the possibility of comparing representations of $SU(\infty)$ by different subsystems; the fourth parameter is a measurable used as time registered by an arbitrary subsystem chosen as a clock. It introduces a relative dynamics for subsystems, formulated by a symmetry-invariant effective Lagrangian defined on the (3+1)D space of the continuous parameters. At lowest quantum order, the Lagrangian is a Yang--Mills field theory for both $SU(\infty)$ and internal symmetries. We identify the common $SU(\infty)$ symmetry and its interaction with gravity. Consequently, $SU(\infty)$-QGR predicts a spin-1 mediator for quantum gravity (QGR). Apparently, this is in contradiction with classical gravity. Nonetheless, we show that an observer who is unable to detect the quantumness of gravity perceives its effect as curvature of the space of average values of the continuous parameters. We demonstrate Lorentzian geometry of this emergent classical spacetime.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetized black holes and swirling backgrounds in nonlinear electrodynamics: The ModMax case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on constructing electromagnetized black holes and vortex-like backgrounds within the framework of the ModMax theory--the unique nonlinear extension of Maxwell's theory that preserves conformal symmetry and electromagnetic duality invariance. We begin by constructing the Melvin-Bonnor electromagnetic universe in ModMax through a limiting procedure that connects the spacetime of two charged accelerating black holes with that of a gravitating homogeneous electromagnetic field. Building on this result, we proceed to construct the Schwarzschild and C-metric Melvin-Bonnor black holes within the ModMax theory, representing the first black hole solutions embedded in an electromagnetic universe in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics. While the characteristics of the Melvin-Bonnor spacetime and some of its black hole extensions have been widely examined, we demonstrate for the first time that the Schwarzschild-Melvin-Bonnor configuration exhibits an unusual Kerr-Schild representation. Following this direction, we also unveil a novel Kerr-Schild construction for the spacetime of two accelerating black holes, drawing on the intrinsic relationship between the Melvin-Bonnor spacetime and the C-metric. Finally, we expand the spectrum of exact gravitational solutions within Einstein-ModMax theory by constructing a vortex-like background that coexists with the Melvin-Bonnor universe. In this process, the Taub-NUT spacetime in ModMax has played a crucial role. We present this Taub-NUT solution in a different gauge that facilitates the comparison with the Melvin-Bonnor-Swirling case.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Radial Acceleration Relation of Dwarf Galaxies with Emergent Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine whether the radial acceleration relation (RAR) of dwarf galaxies can be explained by Verlinde's emergent gravity. This is the extension of arXiv:2206.11685v3, which examines the RAR of typical spiral galaxies, to less massive systems. To do this, we compile the line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles of 30 dwarf galaxies in the Local Group from the literature. We then calculate the expected gravitational acceleration from the stellar component in the framework of the emergent gravity, and compare it with that from observations. The calculated acceleration with the emergent gravity under the assumption of a quasi-de Sitter universe agrees with the observed one within the uncertainty. Our results suggest that the emergent gravity can explain the kinematics of galaxies without introducing dark matter, even for less massive galaxies where dark matter is expected to dominate. This sharply contrasts with MOND, where a new interpolating function has to be introduced for dwarf galaxies to explain their kinematics without dark matter.</description>

      <title>Shadows and Strong Gravitational Lensing Around Black Hole-like Compact Object in Quadratic Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the astrophysical consequences of black holes in quadratic gravity, characterized by the parameters $S_0$, $S_2$, $m_0$ and $m_2$, in addition to the black hole mass $M$. To evaluate the physical validity of the fundamental quadratic gravity black hole solutions, we analyze their gravitational lensing properties in the strong field regime. Specifically, we examine the shadow cast by the quadratic gravity black hole and constrain its parameters using observational data from the $M87^*$ and $Sgr A^*$ supermassive black holes. Our analysis reveals that, within the $1\sigma$ confidence level, a significant portion of the parameter space for quadratic gravity black holes is consistent with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of $M87^*$ and $Sgr A^*$. This suggests that these black holes are plausible candidates for describing astrophysical black holes. As an additional observational test, we perform a detailed investigation of the strong gravitational lensing properties of these black holes. We explore the fundamental strong lensing observables in detail, including the angular positions and separations of the lensed images, the relative magnifications, the radius of the outermost Einstein ring and the relativistic time delay between images. We compare the predictions of the quadratic gravity black hole for each observable with those of the classical Schwarzschild solution using realistic astrophysical data. Our findings provide a pathway for testing quadratic gravity at the galactic and extragalactic scales, offering new insights into the observational properties of black hole solutions within this framework.</description>

      <title>Charged superradiant instability in a spherical regular black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19261v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the stability of a spherically symmetric regular black hole when subjected to perturbations from a charged scalar field. This particular black hole is constructed by deforming the Minkowski spacetime. It has been observed that the charged superradiant instability arises only within a specific range of the deformation parameter, potentially resulting in an instability growth rate with a maximum magnitude of approximately $\text{Im} (M \omega) \sim 10^{-3}$. This growth rate significantly exceeds the instability identified in ABG black holes discussed in prior research, suggesting a notable timescale for detecting this phenomenon in astrophysical scenarios. Additionally, we conduct a thorough investigation into how the three parameters of the model influence the onset and intensity of the instability. Our analysis offers further insights into the possible emergence of this instability in spherically regular black holes and its association with the nonlinear effects of the electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the scalar field potential in nonmetricity gravity through Gaussian processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the universe has been widely confirmed, posing challenges to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, particularly the cosmological coincidence problem. This has motivated the exploration of modified gravity theories, including non-metricity gravity, which explains cosmic acceleration without dark energy. In this work, we incorporate a quintessence scalar field into the non-metricity framework to model both inflation and late-time acceleration. Employing the Gaussian process method with a square exponential kernel, we reconstruct the scalar field potential, $V(\phi)$, from observational Hubble data sets coming from cosmic chronometers (CC) as well as from the method of radial baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in a model-independent approach. This approach allows us to obtain a suitable quintessence scalar field model that aligns with the observational Hubble data under the framework of power-law non-metricity gravity. Additionally, we compare our reconstructed potential with power-law scalar field potentials, revealing that these models show better agreement with the observational data, providing new insights into the dynamics of the universe. In contrast, we find that the early dark energy has minimal effect on the present-time accelerated expansion of the universe.</description>

      <title>Darkness cannot bind them: a no-bound theorem for $d=5$ Myers-Perry null &amp; timelike geodesics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Newtonian gravity, it is well known that Kepler's problem admits no bound solutions in more than three spatial dimensions. This limitation extends naturally to General Relativity, where Tangherlini demonstrated that Schwarzschild black holes in higher dimensions admit no bound timelike geodesics. However, an analogous result for the rotating counterpart of the five-dimensional Tangherlini spacetime - the $d=5$ Myers-Perry black hole - has not yet been established. This work addresses this gap by proving that no bound timelike geodesics exist outside the event horizon of a $d=5$ Myers-Perry black hole, for any choice of spin parameters that avoid naked singularities. With this result in place, we further generalize to null geodesics. It is shown that radially bound null geodesics, which are absent in the four-dimensional Kerr spacetime as established by Wilkins, also cannot exist in the $d=5$ Myers-Perry spacetime. These results complete the geodesic analysis of this spacetime and provide a direct generalization of Wilkins' classical result to higher dimensions. Specifically, we establish the following theorem: no radially bound timelike or null geodesics are possible outside the event horizon of a $d=5$ Myers-Perry black hole, regardless of the spin configuration.</description>

      <title>Absorption and scattering of charged scalar waves by charged Horndeski black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the absorption and scattering of a charged massive scalar field by a charged Horndeski black hole using both the approximation or classical geometric method and the partial wave method and compare the numerical and analytical results, which are found to agree with each other very well. We observe that an increase in either the BH charge $Q$ or the field charge $q$ when $qQ&gt;0$ leads to a smaller absorption cross section and a widening of the interference fringes in the scattering cross section, while the increase in the field mass enlarges the absorption cross section and the width of the interference fringes. Compared to the Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{\rm{o}}$m BH with the same charge and other parameter settings, the absorption and scattering cross sections of the charged Horndeski BH are higher, and its interference fringes are narrower. We also investigate the effect of the field charge $q$ on the absorption and scattering cross sections when superradiance is triggered. It is shown that the total absorption cross section can be negative, and the scattering intensity can be significantly enhanced by superradiance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, based on Cold Dark Matter and Dark Energy ({\Lambda}CDM), faces several challenges. Among these is the need to adjust the scenario to account for he presence of vast voids in the large-scale structure of the universe, as well as the early formation of the first stars and galaxies. Additionally, the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe remains an unresolved issue. To address this latter question, Andrei Sakharov proposed a twin universe model in 1967. Building upon this idea and introducing interactions between these two universe sheets through a bimetric model, we propose an alternative interpretation of the large-scale structure of the universe, including its voids and the acceleration of cosmic expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gravitational perturbations of black holes in quadratic gravity, in which the Einstein-Hilbert term is supplemented by quadratic terms in the curvature tensor. In this class of theories, the Schwarzschild solution can coexist with modified black hole solutions, and both families are radially stable in a wide region of the parameter space. Here we study non-radial perturbations of both families of static, spherically symmetric black holes, computing the quasi-normal modes with axial parity and finding strong numerical evidence for the stability of these solutions under axial perturbations. The perturbation equations describe the propagation of a massless and a massive spin-two fields. We show that the Schwarzschild solution admits the same quasi-normal modes as in general relativity, together with new classes of modes corresponding to the massive spin-two degrees of freedom. The spectrum of the modified black hole solution has the same structure, but all modes are different from those of general relativity. We argue that both classes of modes can be excited in physical processes, suggesting that a characteristic signature of this theory is the presence of massive spin-two modes in the gravitational ringdown, even when the stationary solution is the same as in general relativity.</description>

Abstract: Based on the Newtonian mechanics, in this article, we present a heuristic derivation of the Friedmann equations, providing an intuitive foundation for these fundamental relations in cosmology. Additionally, using the first law of thermodynamics and Euler's equation, we derive a set of equations that, at linear order, coincide with those obtained from the conservation of the stress-energy tensor in General Relativity. This approach not only highlights the consistency between Newtonian and relativistic frameworks in certain limits but also serves as a pedagogical bridge, offering insights into the physical principles underlying the dynamics of the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07149v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of solving the dark energy and the coincidence problems by postulating the massless sector of closed strings. This sector constitutes the gravitational multiplet of string theory and, when applied to four-dimensional cosmology, predicts that \textit{the expansion of an open Universe defined in string frame is readily accelerating}. We confront the prediction with the late-time cosmological data of Type Ia supernovae and quasar absorption spectrum, which probe the evolutions of the Hubble parameter and possibly the fine-structure constant. We report that these observations are in admirable agreement with the prediction without any dark sector or coincidence problem. We estimate the Hubble constant, $H_{0}\simeq 71.2\pm 0.2\,\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$.</description>

      <title>Observed Trends in FRB Population and Bi-modality in their Peak Luminosity Density Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11992v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are radio transients of extragalactic origin lasting for about a few to several milli-seconds. We have analyzed both non-CHIME and CHIME FRB data. To circumvent the absence of measured fluence and flux density of FRBs belonging to the CHIME catalog, we have devised a novel approach that utilizes the ratio of the lower limits of the flux density $S_{\nu_O}$ to the fluence $F_{\nu_O}$ of individual FRB events to construct several parameters to investigate the presence of underlying trends in the FRB population drawn from both CHIME and non-CHIME data sets. One of these parameters involves true brightness temperature as well as energy density, despite not knowing the actual size of the FRB emission region. Our first robust conclusion is that the non-CHIME FRBs fall under two broad categories - those with luminosity density less than about $4\times 10^{33} $ erg/s/Hz at the frequency 300 MHz and those having larger luminosity density values than this. Assuming that FRBs are caused by magnetar glitches, we have discussed in this paper a simple physical model, incorporating an abrupt change in the light cylinder radius of an oblique rotator, to address the existence of these two categories.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole Moment of a Magnetically Confined Mountain on an Accreting Neutron Star in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativistic corrections are calculated for the quadrupole moment of a magnetically confined mountain on an accreting neutron star. The hydromagnetic structure of the mountain satisfies the general relativistic Grad-Shafranov equation supplemented by the flux-freezing condition of ideal magnetohydrodynamics, as in previous calculations of the magnetic dipole moment. It is found that the ellipticity and hence the gravitational wave strain are up to $12\%$ greater than in the analogous Newtonian system. The direct contribution of the magnetic field to the nonaxisymmetric component of the stress-energy tensor is shown to be negligible in accreting systems such as low-mass X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Reconciling $S_8$: Insights from Interacting Dark Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We do a careful investigation of the prospects of dark energy (DE) interacting with cold dark matter in alleviating the $S_8$ clustering tension. To this end, we consider various well-known parametrizations of the DE equation of state (EoS) and consider perturbations in both the dark sectors, along with an interaction term. Moreover, we perform a separate study for the phantom and non-phantom regimes. Using cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae data sets, constraints on the model parameters for each case have been obtained and a generic reduction in the $H_0-\sigma_{8,0}$ correlation has been observed, both for constant and dynamical DE EoS. This reduction, coupled with a significant negative correlation between the interaction term and $\sigma_{8,0}$, contributes to easing the clustering tension by lowering $\sigma_{8,0}$ to somewhere in between the early CMB and late-time clustering measurements for the phantom regime, for almost all the models under consideration. Additionally, this is achieved without exacerbating the Hubble tension. In this regard, the interacting Chevallier-Polarski-Linder and Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan models perform the best in relaxing the $S_8$ tension to $&lt;1\sigma$. However, for the non-phantom regime the $\sigma_{8,0}$ tension tends to have worsened, which reassures the merits of phantom DE from latest data. We further investigate the role of redshift space distortion data sets and find an overall reduction in tension, with a $\sigma_{8,0}$ value relatively closer to the CMB value. We finally check whether further extensions of this scenario, such as the inclusion of the sound speed of DE and warm dark matter interacting with DE, can have some effects.</description>

      <title>Single Kerr-Schild Metric for Taub-NUT Instanton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09518v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that a complex coordinate transformation maps the Taub-NUT instanton metric to a Kerr-Schild metric. This metric involves a semi-infinite line defect as the gravitational analog of the Dirac string, much like the original metric. Moreover, it facilitates three versions of classical double copy correspondence with the self-dual dyon in electromagnetism, one of which involving a nonlocal operator. The relevance to the Newman-Janis algorithm is briefly noted.</description>

      <title>CMB Constraints on Natural Inflation with Gauge Field Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The natural inflation model with a periodic cosine potential is ruled out by recent Planck 2018 data for the decay constant $f \lesssim 5.5~M_{\rm Pl}$. If the Planck data is combined with the BICEP Keck array and BAO data, the model is excluded (at $2$-$\sigma$) for all values of $f$. In this context, we revisit the model when the pseudoscalar inflation $\phi$ is coupled with a gauge field via a coupling of the form $\frac{\alpha}{f} \phi F \tilde{F}$, where $F (\tilde F)$ denotes the gauge field (dual) strength tensor, and $\alpha$ is the coupling constant. The back-reactions associated with the gauge field production during the later stages of inflation extend the duration of inflation. We numerically evaluate the dynamics of the fields while neglecting the effects due to the perturbations in the inflaton field. It allows us to determine the scalar and tensor power spectra leading to the calculations of observables at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales. We find that the natural inflation model survives the test of the latest data only for a certain range of the coupling constant $\alpha$. Our analysis shows that the latest constraints coming from the scalar spectral index are more stringent than the ones arising from the non-gaussianities and the running of the scalar spectrum. This leads to lower and upper bounds on $\xi_*$, the parameter that controls the growth of the gauge field.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependent chirality as a smoking gun for Abelian gauge fields during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-inflation models are a compelling candidate as a mechanism behind the accelerated expansion in the early universe in light of the possibility to embed them in higher dimensional UV complete theories and the exciting prospect of testing them with next-generation cosmological probes. Adding an Abelian gauge sector to axion-inflation models makes for a rich, interesting, phenomenology spanning from primordial black holes to gravitational waves (GWs). Several recent studies employ an approximate analytic (Gaussian) template to characterize the effect of gauge field production on cosmological perturbations. In this work we go beyond such approximation and numerically study particle production and the ensuing scalar and tensor spectra. We find a significant deviation from results based on log-normally distributed vector field excitations. As an important phenomenological application of the improved method, we study the expected chirality and spectral index of the sourced GW background at scales relevant for current and next-generation GW detectors. One striking feature is that of a scale-dependent chirality. We derive a consistency relation between these two observables that can serve as an important tool in identifying key signatures of multi-field dynamics in axion inflation.</description>

      <title>Searching for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes early inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early inspiral from stellar-mass binary black holes can emit milli-Hertz gravitational wave signals, making them detectable sources for space-borne gravitational wave missions like TianQin. However, the traditional matched filtering technique poses a significant challenge for analyzing this kind of signals, as it requires an impractically high number of templates ranging from $10^{31}$ to $10^{40}$. We propose a search strategy that involves two main parts: initially, we reduce the dimensionality of the simulated signals using incremental principal component analysis (IPCA). Subsequently we train the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on the compressed TianQin data obtained from IPCA, aiming to develop both a detection model and a point parameter estimation model. The compression efficiency for the trained IPCA model achieves a cumulative variance ratio of 95.6% when applied to $10^6$ simulated signals. To evaluate the performance of CNN we generate the receiver operating characteristic curve for the detection model which is applied to the test data with varying signal-to-noise ratios. At a false alarm probability of 5% the corresponding true alarm probability for signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 is 86.5%. Subsequently, we introduce the point estimation model to evaluate the value of the chirp mass of corresponding sBBH signals with an error. For signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50, the trained point estimation CNN model can estimate the chirp mass of most test events, with a standard deviation error of 2.48 $M_{\odot}$ and a relative error precision of 0.12.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills extension of the Loop Quantum Gravity-corrected Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we endeavour to build up a non-Abelian formulation to describe the self-interactions of massless vector bosons in the context of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). To accomplish this task, we start off from the modified Maxwell equations with the inclusion of LQG corrections and its corresponding local $U(1)$ gauge invariance. LQG effects in the electromagnetic interactions have significant importance, as they might be adopted to describe the flight time of cosmic photons coming from very high-energy explosions in the Universe, such as events of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). These photons have energy-dependent speeds, indicating that the velocity of light in the vacuum is not constant. To carry out the extension from the Abelian to the non-Abelian scenario, we shall follow the so-called Noether current procedure, which consists in recurrently introducing self-interactions into an initially free action for vector bosons by coupling the latter to the conserved currents of a global symmetry present in the action of departure. In the end of the non-Abelianization process, the initial global symmetry naturally becomes local. Once the Yang-Mills system includes LQG correction terms, it becomes possible to analyze how quantum-gravity induced contributions show up in both the electroweak and the QCD sectors of the Standard Model, providing a set-up for phenomenological investigations that may bring about new elements to discuss Physics beyond the Standard-Model.</description>

      <title>Geometric realization via irrelevant deformations induced by the stress-energy tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the deformations driven by the stress-energy tensor $T$ and investigate their relation to the flow equation for the background metric at the classical level. For a deformation operator $\mathcal{O}$ as a polynomial function of the stress-energy tensor, we develop a formalism that relates a deformed action to a flow equation for the metric in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. It is shown that in the $T\bar{T}$ deformation and the $\mathcal{O}(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, the flow equations for the metric allow us to directly obtain exact solutions in closed forms. We also demonstrate the perturbative approach to find the same results. As several applications of the $\mathcal{O}(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, we discuss the relation between the deformations and gravitational models. Besides, we also deform the Lagrangians for scalar field theories.</description>

      <title>Maximal chirality transfer in the photon-graviton conversion in the early universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While photons and gravitons do not interact significantly, photons can be converted to gravitons in a background magnetic field -- a phenomenon known as the Gertsenshtein effect. In this paper, we investigate whether chiral electromagnetic (EM) waves can be converted to chiral gravitational waves (GW) in the presence of primordial magnetic fields during the radiation-dominated epoch of the early universe. We consider two situations wherein chirality is either present in the propagating EM waves or it exists in the background magnetic field. Our analysis shows that while the conversion probability increases with stronger magnetic fields, it remains insensitive to the chiral nature of the background magnetic field. Consequently, the net chirality parameter is independent of the chirality of the background field in both cases. Finally, we demonstrate that the present-day energy density of the produced chiral GWs peaks at a frequency of $\sim 100$ GHz, and the corresponding characteristic strain can be sensitive to current and future missions designed to detect high-frequency GWs.</description>

      <title>On-Shell Approach to Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an on-shell approach to study black hole mergers. Since, asymptotically, the initial and final states can be described by point-like spinning particles, we propose a massive three-point amplitude for the merger of two Schwarzschild black holes into a Kerr black hole. This three-point amplitude and the spectral function of the final state are fully determined by kinematics and the model-independent input about the black hole merger which is described by a complete absorption process. Using the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell (KMOC) formalism, we then reproduce the classical conservation laws for momentum and angular momentum after the merger. As an application, we use the proposed three-point to compute the graviton emission amplitude, from which we extract the merger waveform to all orders in spin but leading in gravitational coupling. Up to sub-subleading order in spin, this matches the classical soft graviton theorem. We conclude with a comparison to black hole perturbation theory, which gives complementary amplitudes which are non-perturbative in the gravitational coupling but to leading order in the extreme mass ratio limit. This also highlights how boundary conditions on a Schwarzschild background can be used to rederive the proposed on-shell amplitudes for merger processes.</description>

      <title>Chaos in hyperscaling violating Lifshitz theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We holographically study quantum chaos in hyperscaling-violating Lifshitz (HVL) theories (with charge). Specifically, we present a detailed computation of the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC) via shockwave analysis in the bulk HVL geometry with a planar horizon topology. We also compute the butterfly velocity ($v_{B}$) using the entanglement wedge reconstruction and find that it matches the result obtained from the shockwave analysis. Using a recently developed thermodynamic dictionary for HVL theories, we express $v_B$ purely in terms of boundary thermodynamic variables. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of $v_{B}$ with respect to the dynamical critical exponent ($z$), hyperscaling-violating parameter ($\theta$), entropy (more precisely, the ratio of entropy to the central charge, $\tilde{S}$), and charge (more precisely, the ratio of charge to the central charge, $\tilde{Q}$). Interestingly, $v_B$ varies non-monotonically with $z$ for $\tilde{S} &lt; 1$, whereas it increases monotonically with $z$ for $\tilde{S} \geq 1$. Additionally, $v_B$ varies non-monotonically with $\theta$ for non-zero charge. Moreover, $v_B$ monotonically increases with $\tilde{S}$ and decreases with $\tilde{Q}$ for all allowed values of $z$ and $\theta$. All these features are reported for combinations /{$z$, $\theta$, $\tilde{S}$, $\tilde{Q}$/} for which the temperature is positive, the null energy condition is satisfied, and $v_B$ is not superluminal. Unpacking the non-monotonicities in $v_B$ can offer interesting insights into these theories.</description>

      <title>Generalised second law beyond the semiclassical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the generalised second law (GSL), with an appropriate modification, holds in perturbative gravity to all orders beyond the semiclassical limit and without a UV cutoff imposed on the fields. Our proof uses algebraic techniques and builds on the recent work of Faulkner and Speranza, which combined Wall's proof of the GSL with the identification of generalised entropy as the von Neumann entropy of a boost-invariant crossed product algebra. The key additional step in our approach is to further impose invariance under null translations. Doing so requires one to describe horizon exterior regions in a relational manner, so we introduce `dynamical cuts': quantum reference frames which give the location of a cut of the horizon. We use idealised dynamical cuts, but expect that our methods can be generalised to more realistic models. The modified GSL that we prove says that the difference in generalised entropies of the regions outside two dynamical cuts is bounded below by the free energy of the degrees of freedom giving the location of the later cut. If one takes a semiclassical limit, imposes a UV cutoff, and requires the cuts to obey certain energy conditions, then our result reduces to the standard GSL.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Observables to Higher Order in Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study observables in the scattering of classical, spinning objects using the KMOC formalism. In particular, we derive formulas to higher order in spin and one loop $\mathcal{O}(G^2)$ for the spin kick and momentum impulse. Our derivation method is agnostic to the choice of theory or special conditions, such as the spin supplementary condition (SSC); we only rely on the generic structure of long-range scattering amplitudes of non-transverse, massive spinning fields in the classical limit. We check these formulas for the case of gravity and agree with previous results from the eikonal formalism after imposing a SSC.</description>

      <title>The UV Sensitivity of Axion Monodromy Inflation</title>

Abstract: We revisit axion monodromy inflation in the context of UV-complete theories and point out that its cosmological observables are sensitive to heavy fields with masses far above the Hubble scale, such as the moduli of flux compactifications. By studying a string-inspired two-field extension of axion monodromy, we reveal that the oscillatory modulation of the axion potential leads to continuous excitation of heavy fields during inflation when the modulation frequency exceeds the field masses. This finding challenges the conventional single-field description, as heavy moduli cannot be simply integrated out. Using a full bootstrap analysis, we demonstrate that this mechanism produces cosmological collider signals that bypass the usual Boltzmann suppression for heavy masses. Specifically, we identify detectably large signatures of heavy moduli in the primordial bispectrum, offering a promising avenue for probing high-energy physics through cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Composite Dark Energy and the Cosmological Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model currently in force, aka $\Lambda$CDM, has been plagued with a variety of tensions in the last decade or so, which puts it against the wall. At the core of the $\Lambda$CDM we have a rigid cosmological term, $\Lambda$, for the entire cosmic history. Recently, the results from the DESI collaboration suggested the possibility that dark energy (DE) should be dynamical rather than just a cosmological constant. Using a generic $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, DESI favors quintessence behavior at $\sim 3\sigma$ c.l. However, to alleviate the tensions the DE needs more features. In the proposed $w$XCDM model of [45] the DE is actually a composite cosmic fluid with two components $(X,Y)$ acting sequentially: first $X$ (above a transition redshift $z_t$) and second $Y$ (below $z_t$). Fitting the model to the data, we find that the late component $Y$ behaves as quintessence, like DESI. However, to cure the $H_0$ and growth tensions, $X$ must behave as `phantom matter' (PM), which in contrast to phantom DE provides positive pressure at the expense of negative energy density. Using the SNIa (considering separately Pantheon$+$ and DESY5), cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data, and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that both tensions can be completely cut down. We also compare the $w$XCDM with our own results using the standard $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM parameterizations of the DE. In all cases, model $w$XCDM performs much better. Finally, we have repeated our analysis with BAO 3D data (replacing BAO 2D), and we still find that the main dynamical DE models (including composite ones) provide a much better fit quality compared to $\Lambda$CDM. The growth tension is alleviated again, but in contrast, the $H_0$-tension remains significant, which is most likely reminiscent of the internal conflict in the BAO sector.</description>
