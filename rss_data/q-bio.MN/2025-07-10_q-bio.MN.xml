      <title>Local imperfect feedback control in non-equilibrium biophysical systems enabled by thermodynamic constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how biological systems achieve robust control despite relying on imperfect local information remains a challenging problem. Here, we consider non-equilibrium models which are generically used to describe natural and synthetic biological processes, such as gene regulation and protein conformational dynamics, and investigate their capacity for effective control using imperfect local feedback mechanisms. We derive a thermodynamic constraint on the response of non-equilibrium steady-state properties to changes in the driving forces. We show that this constraint enables linear, local, and easily implementable feedback rules to achieve environmental tracking and adaptation without consideration of network topology. In particular, we demonstrate that local stability of these feedback dynamics implies global stability for systems with one or two chemical regulators, regardless of the network topology. For higher-dimensional systems, global stability is not guaranteed. However, in part due to simplifications in attractor landscapes implied by our thermodynamic constraint, we find the basin of attraction remains significantly larger than would be expected from linear approximation alone. Our findings provide insight into how biological and synthetically engineered systems can respond effectively to environmental changes given only minimal feedback, without highly engineered interactions or precise parameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Exact computation of Transfer Entropy with Path Weight Sampling</title>

Abstract: The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We use our exact technique to demonstrate that commonly used approximate methods to compute transfer entropies incur large systematic errors and high computational costs. As an application, we use TE-PWS in linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.</description>

      <title>Noise equals control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise plays the role of control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low temperatures or in large populations, this leads to a precise mathematical mapping: the most probable trajectory between two states minimizes an action functional and corresponds to an optimal control strategy. In Langevin dynamics, the noise term itself serves as the control. For general Markov jump processes, such as chemical reaction networks or electronic circuits, we use the Doi-Peliti formalism to identify the `response' (or `momentum') field $\pi$ as the control variable. This resolves a long-standing interpretational problem in the field-theoretic description of stochastic systems: although $\pi$ evolves backward in time, it has a clear physical role as the control that steers the system along rare trajectories. This implies that Nature is constantly sampling control strategies. We illustrate the mapping on multistable chemical reaction networks, systems with unstable fixed points, and specifically on stochastic resonance and Brownian ratchets. The noise-control mapping justifies agential descriptions of these phenomena, and builds intuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why probabilities are generically non-smooth functions of state out of thermal equilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of noise; and how agential behavior emerges naturally without recourse to mysticism.</description>
