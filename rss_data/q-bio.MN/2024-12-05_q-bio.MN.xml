      <title>Optimal network sizes for most robust Turing patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many cellular patterns exhibit a reaction-diffusion component, suggesting that Turing instability may contribute to pattern formation. However, biological gene-regulatory pathways are more complex than simple Turing activator-inhibitor models and generally do not require fine-tuning of parameters as dictated by the Turing conditions. To address these issues, we employ random matrix theory to analyze the Jacobian matrices of larger networks with robust statistical properties. Our analysis reveals that Turing patterns are more likely to occur by chance than previously thought and that the most robust Turing networks have an optimal size, surprisingly consisting only of a handful of molecular species, thus significantly increasing their identifiability in biological systems. This optimal size emerges from a tradeoff between the highest stability in small networks and the greatest instability with diffusion in large networks. Furthermore, we find that with multiple immobile nodes, differential diffusion ceases to be important for Turing patterns. Our findings may inform future synthetic biology approaches and provide insights into bridging the gap to complex developmental pathways.</description>

      <title>Maximum likelihood estimation of log-affine models using detailed-balanced reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental question in the field of molecular computation is what computational tasks a biochemical system can carry out. In this work, we focus on the problem of finding the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for log-affine models. We revisit a construction due to Gopalkrishnan of a mass-action system with the MLE as its unique positive steady state, which is based on choosing a basis for the kernel of the design matrix of the model. We extend this construction to allow for any finite spanning set of the kernel, and explore how the choice of spanning set influences the dynamics of the resulting network, including the existence of boundary steady states, the deficiency of the network, and the rate of convergence. In particular, we prove that using a Markov basis as the spanning set guarantees global stability of the MLE steady state.</description>
