      <title>The Emperor's New Arc: gigaparsec patterns abound in a $\Lambda$CDM universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of apparent large-scale features in the structure of the universe, extending over many hundreds of megaparsecs, have been claimed to contradict the large-scale isotropy and homogeneity foundational to the standard ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model. We explicitly test and refute this conjecture using FLAMINGO-10K, a new and very large cosmological simulation of the growth of structure in a $\Lambda$CDM context. Applying the same methods used in the observations, we show that patterns like the "Giant Arc", supposedly in tension with the standard model, are, in fact, common and expected in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. We also show that their reported significant overdensities are an algorithmic artefact and unlikely to reflect any underlying structure.</description>

      <title>Closing in on Pop-III Stars: Constraints and Predictions Across the Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The absence of direct high redshift observations poses a significant challenge in understanding the properties of first stars. Nonetheless, the cumulative effect of entire stellar populations can be studied with current data. In this work we use a combination of high redshift observables in order to infer the formation and emission properties of the first stellar populations: high redshift UVLFs, the optical depth of CMB photons to reionization, hydrogen absorption lines in quasar spectra, and measurements of the soft cosmic X-ray background. We study two minimal models of stellar population: i) a single, Pop-II, stellar population which dominates throughout Cosmic Dawn, ii) two distinct stellar populations, Pop-II and Pop-III, dominating at different times with the transition between them taken as a free parameter. We set strong constraints on the properties of Pop-II stars, and upper limits on the formation and multi-wavelength emission of Pop-III stars. After applying the constraints above, we present the viable envelopes of the 21-cm global signal with and without Pop-III stars. We identify a region in the parameter space of the two population model which predicts a global 21-cm signal distinctive from that of the single population one. A measurement of such a signal would be a strong indication for the presence of Pop-III stars at early times.</description>

      <title>Elliptical multipoles for gravitational lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing galaxies are commonly modeled with elliptical density profiles, to which angular complexity is sometimes added through a multipole expansion - encoding deformations of the elliptical iso-density contours. The formalism that is widely used in current studies and software packages, however, employs perturbations that are defined with respect to a circle. In this work, we show that this popular formulation (the "circular multipoles") leads to perturbation patterns that depend on the axis ratio and do not agree with physical expectations (from studies of galaxy isophotal shapes) when applied to profiles that are not near-circular. We propose a more appropriate formulation, the "elliptical multipoles", representing deviations from ellipticity suited for any axis ratio. We solve for the lensing potentials associated with the $m=1$ circular multipole (previously undetermined in the isothermal case), as well as the elliptical multipoles of any order $m$, assuming a near-isothermal reference profile. We implement these solutions into the lens modeling package $\mathtt{lenstronomy}$, and assess the importance of the multipole formulation by comparing flux-ratio perturbations in mock lensed systems with quadruply imaged quasars: we show that elliptical multipoles typically produce smaller flux-ratio perturbations than their circular counterparts.</description>

      <title>The Proper Motion of Strongly Lensed Binary Neutron Star Mergers in LIGO/Virgo/Kagra can be Constrained by Measuring Doppler Induced Gravitational Wave Dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly lensed binary neutron star (NS-NS) mergers are expected to be observed once LIGO/Virgo/Kagra reaches the planned A+ or proposed A\# sensitivity. We demonstrate that the relative transverse velocity of the source-lens system can be constrained by comparing the phase of the two associated gravitational wave (GW) images, using both semi-analytical and numerical Bayesian methods. For A+ sensitivity, a one-sigma NS-NS merger signal in magnification $(\mu=200)$ and redshift $(z_{\rm S}=1)$ will carry a marginally detectable dephasing signature for a source transverse velocity of $\sim 1800$ km/s. This is comparable to the velocity dispersion of large galaxy clusters. Assuming the same population distribution, the most likely source parameters of $\mu=100$ and $z_{\rm S}=1.4$ are always expected to showcase detectable dephasing imprints for A\# sensitivity, provided they are moving with transverse velocities larger than $\sim 2000$ km/s. We conclude that a first measurement of the relative transverse velocity of a source via GW dephasing methods is likely only a few years away.</description>

      <title>Complementary signatures of $\alpha-$attractor inflation in CMB and cosmic string Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When cosmic strings are formed during inflation, they regrow to reach a scaling regime, leaving distinct imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Such signatures, associated with specific primordial features, can be detected by upcoming gravitational wave observatories, such as the LISA and Einstein Telescope (ET). Our analysis explores scenarios in which cosmic strings form either before or during inflation. We examine how the number of e-folds experienced by cosmic strings during inflation correlates with the predictions of inflationary models observable in cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. This correlation provides a testable link between inflationary physics and the associated gravitational wave signals in a complementary manner. Focusing on $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation, with the Polynomial $\alpha$-attractor serving as an illustrative example, we find constraints, for instance, on the spectral index $n_s$ to $0.962 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.972$ for polynomial exponent $n=1$, $0.956 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.968$ for $n=2$, $0.954 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.965$ for $n=3$, and $0.963 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.964$ for $n=4$, which along with the GW signals from LISA, are capable of detecting local cosmic strings that have experienced $\sim 34 - 47$ e-folds of inflation consistent with current Planck data and are also testable in upcoming CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD and CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>Scaling relations and tidal disruption in spin $s$ ultralight dark matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of spin 0, spin 1 and spin 2 Ultra-Light Dark Matter (ULDM) on small scales by numerically solving the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system using the time-split method. We perform simulations of ULDM for each spin, starting with different numbers of identical initial solitons and analyse the properties of the resulting halos after they merge and relax in a steady-state. Our findings reveal that higher spin values lead to broader, less dense final halo with more prominent Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) tails, a characteristic that persists regardless of the number of initial solitons involved. We identify scaling relations that describe the density profile, core and NFW tail of spin $s$ ULDM halos as a function of the number of initial solitons $N_{sol}$. These relations allow us to construct equivalent halos based on average density or total mass, for arbitrarily large $N_{sol}$, without having to simulate those systems. We simulate the orbit of a ULDM satellite in a constructed halo treated as an external potential, and find that for host halos having the same average density, the orbital decay time of the satellite is as predicted for uniform sphere host halo regardless of the spin. However, satellites orbiting haloes having the same mass for each spin, result in faster disruption in the case of spin 0, while satellites orbiting haloes having the same core size result in faster disruption in the case of spin 2.</description>

      <title>Observable Primordial Gravitational Waves from Non-minimally Coupled $R^2$ Palatini Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We probe the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) produced during the eras of hyperkination, kination, and reheating in a non-minimally coupled, $\mathcal{L} \propto (1+ \xi \chi /M_{\text{Pl}})^t (R+\alpha R^2)$, modified gravity using the Palatini formulation. We consider a runaway potential, which gives an era of kinetic domination after the end of inflation. The coupling order $t$ is varied to examine a large class of theories up to $\chi^2 R^2$. For models with $t&gt;0$, reheating is not achieved naturally; hence, we supplement such theories with a reheating mechanism based on the interaction of inflaton and radiation produced at the end of inflation due to cosmological expansion. We demonstrate that the energy density of the GWs is enhanced as a function of the coupling during kination for all considered theories, and a short-lived phase of hyperkination truncates the boost and avoids the over-production of GWs. Hyperkination, and thus the $R^2$ term, should be deemed necessary in all theories with a runaway potential as it prevents the GW enhancement during kination from destabilizing the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The spectrum remains flat for the period of hyperkination and reheating. We examine the available parameter space for which the theories remain valid and place bounds on the Hubble parameter ($H$) and radiation energy density ($\Omega_r^{\text{end}}$) at the end of inflation. We find that as we decrease the order of the coupling, the spectra shift towards a more observable regime of future GW experiments. The observation of the plateau during reheating will constrain the $H$ and $\Omega_r^{\text{end}}$ values, while the spectral shape of the boost obtained during kination will confirm the nature of the theory. The bounds from hyperkination lie in the kHz-GHz frequency range whose detection can be positively anticipated via resonant cavities.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based mass map reconstruction from weak lensing data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been used in cosmological applications as a generative model for fast simulations and to reconstruct underlying cosmological fields or astrophysical images from noisy data. These two tasks are often treated as separate: diffusion models trained for one purpose do not generalize to perform the other task. In this paper, we develop a single diffusion model that can be used for both tasks. By using the Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) approach, we use a diffusion model trained to simulate weak lensing maps for the inverse problem of reconstructing mass maps from noisy weak lensing data. We find that the standard DPS method leads to biased inference but we correct this bias by down weighting the likelihood term at early sampling time steps of the diffusion. Our method give us a way to reconstruct accurate high-resolution (sub-arcminute) mass maps that have the correct power spectrum and a range of non-Gaussian summary statistics. We discuss several applications enabled by the computational efficiency and accuracy of our model. These include generation of simulation quality mass maps, aiding covariance estimation for higher order statistics, and for finding filaments, voids and clusters from noisy lensing shear data.</description>

      <title>The DESI 2024 hint for dynamical dark energy is biased by low-redshift supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a $\sim3.9\sigma$ preference for dynamical dark energy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration inspired hot debates on new physics or systematics. In this letter, we reveal this significant preference is dominated by an external low-redshift supernova (low-$z$ SN) sample that combines with the Dark Energy Survey SN program (DES-SN) in their Year 5 data release (DESY5). Further implementing the $a_B$ (the intercept of the SN magnitude-redshift relation) diagnosis between low-$z$ and DES-SN samples, we find large dispersions in the low-$z$ SN sample with a $\sim0.043$ magnitude discrepancy in $-5a_B$ from the high-$z$ DES-SN sample, suggesting potential systematics in DESY5. Correcting for this low-$z$ systematics or directly ignoring the low-$z$ sample can largely reduce the preference for dynamical DE to be $&lt;2\sigma$. Therefore, the DESI preference for dynamical DE might be a mirage of low-$z$ SN systematics with a mismatch intercept. Our additional test demonstrates the currently available data cannot provide decisive evidence for dynamical DE.</description>

      <title>CMB-S4: Foreground-Cleaning Pipeline Comparison for Measuring Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare multiple foreground-cleaning pipelines for estimating the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, using simulated maps of the planned CMB-S4 experiment within the context of the South Pole Deep Patch. To evaluate robustness, we analyze bias and uncertainty on $r$ across various foreground suites using map-based simulations. The foreground-cleaning methods include: a parametric maximum likelihood approach applied to auto- and cross-power spectra between frequency maps; a map-based parametric maximum-likelihood method; and a harmonic-space internal linear combination using frequency maps. We summarize the conceptual basis of each method to highlight their similarities and differences. To better probe the impact of foreground residuals, we implement an iterative internal delensing step, leveraging a map-based pipeline to generate a lensing $B$-mode template from the Large Aperture Telescope frequency maps. Our results show that the performance of the three approaches is comparable for simple and intermediate-complexity foregrounds, with $\sigma(r)$ ranging from 3 to 5 $\times 10^{-4}$. However, biases at the $1-2\sigma$ level appear when analyzing more complex forms of foreground emission. By extending the baseline pipelines to marginalize over foreground residuals, we demonstrate that contamination can be reduced to within statistical uncertainties, albeit with a pipeline-dependent impact on $\sigma(r)$, which translates to a detection significance between 2 and 4$\sigma$ for an input value of $r = 0.003$. These findings suggest varying levels of maturity among the tested pipelines, with the auto- and cross-spectra-based approach demonstrating the best stability and overall performance. Moreover, given the extremely low noise levels, mutual validation of independent foreground-cleaning pipelines is essential to ensure the robustness of any potential detection.</description>

      <title>COSMOS-Web: The emergence of the Hubble Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the wide area coverage of the COSMOS-Web survey, we quantify the abundance of different morphological types from $z\sim 7$ with unprecedented statistics and establish robust constraints on the epoch of emergence of the Hubble sequence. We measure the global (spheroids, disk-dominated, bulge-dominated, peculiar) and resolved (stellar bars) morphologies for about 400,000 galaxies down to F150W=27 using deep learning, representing a two-orders-of-magnitude increase over previous studies. We then provide reference Stellar Mass Functions (SMFs) of different morphologies between $z\sim 0.2$ and $z\sim 7$ and best-fit parameters to inform models of galaxy formation. All catalogs and data are made publicly available. (a)At redshift z &gt; 4.5, the massive galaxy population ($\log M_*/M_\odot&gt;10$) is dominated by disturbed morphologies (~70%) -- even in the optical rest frame -- and very compact objects (~30%) with effective radii smaller than ~500pc. This confirms that a significant fraction of the star formation at cosmic dawn occurs in very dense regions, although the stellar mass for these systems could be overestimated.(b)Galaxies with Hubble-type morphologies -- including bulge and disk-dominated galaxies -- arose rapidly around $z\sim 4$ and dominate the morphological diversity of massive galaxies as early as $z\sim 3$. (c)Using stellar bars as a proxy, we speculate that stellar disks in massive galaxies might have been common (&gt;50%) among the star-forming population since cosmic noon ($z\sim2$-2.5) and formed as early as $z\sim 7$ (d)Massive quenched galaxies are predominantly bulge-dominated from z~4 onward, suggesting that morphological transformations briefly precede or are simultaneous to quenching mechanisms at the high-mass end. (e) Low-mass ($\log M_*/M_\odot&lt;10$) quenched galaxies are typically disk-dominated, pointing to different quenching routes in the two ends of the stellar mass spectrum from cosmic dawn.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves in Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadratic gravity is a fourth-order (in derivatives) theory that can serve as an attractive upgrade to the standard description of gravity provided by General Relativity, thanks to its renormalizability and its built-in description of primordial inflation. We bring quadratic gravity into a second-order form by introducing an auxiliary tensor field and we consider the primordial tensor fluctuations (gravitational waves) in the theory around a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker background. After a canonical quantization of the perturbations, we calculate the tensor power spectrum in quasi de Sitter spacetime. We find that the spectral index $n_t$ and the amplitude $A_t$ of the tensor power spectrum are both suppressed by the factor $(1 + 2{\bf H}^2_*/m_\text{gh}^2)^{-1}$, where ${\bf H}_*$ is the Hubble rate at horizon exit and $m_\text{gh}$ is the mass of the spin-two ghost. This restores the slow-roll consistency condition familiar from single-field inflation models, where the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is equal to $-8n_t$ in the lowest nontrivial order in the slow-roll approximation. We also discuss the well-known issue of the ghost problem in fourth-order theories and how it pertains to the results at hand.</description>

Abstract: We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) and stochastic gravitational waves background (SGWB) produced by the supercooled radion phase transition (PT) in warped extra-dimension models solving the gauge hierarchy problem. We first determine how the SGWB and the produced PBH mass and abundance depend on the warped model's infrared energy scale $\rho$, and the number of holographic colors $N$. With this finding, we recast on the plane $\{\rho, N\}$ the current SGWB and PBH constraints, as well as the expected parameter reaches of GW detectors, as LISA and ET, and the gravitational lensing ones, such as NGRST. On the same plane, we also map the collider bounds on massive graviton production, and cosmological bounds on the radion phenomenology. We find that, for $N \sim 10-50$, the considered PT predicts a PBH population mass in the range $M_{\rm PBH}\sim(10^{-1} - 10^{-25}) M_{\odot}$ for $\rho \sim (10^{-4} - 10^{8})\textrm{ TeV}$. In the range $\rho \simeq (0.05 - 0.5)$ GeV, it can explain the recent SGWB hint at nHz frequencies and generate PBH binaries with mass $M_{\rm PBH}\sim(0.1 - 1 ) M_\odot$ detectable at LISA and ET. The experimentally allowed mass region where PBHs can account for the whole dark matter abundance, and are produced with a tuning $\lesssim 10^{-4}$, corresponds to $10$ TeV $\lesssim \rho\lesssim$ $10^4$ TeV. These PBHs can compensate the lack of natural candidates for dark matter in warped extra dimensional models. Such a region represents a great science case where forthcoming and future colliders like HE-LHC and FCC-hh, gravitational-wave observatories and other PBHs probes play a key complementary role.</description>

Abstract: In this work we investigate the chemical and kinetic nonequilibrium dynamics of the Higgs boson during the primordial Universe QGP (quark-gluon plasma) epoch $130\mathrm{\,GeV}&gt;T&gt;10\mathrm{\,GeV}$. We show that the Higgs bosons is always out of chemical abundance equilibrium with a fugacity $\Upsilon_h = 0.69$ due to virtual decay channels. Additionally, Higgs momentum distribution is found to be ``cold'' for $T&lt;40$\,GeV, since the scattering rate drops below the production rate.</description>

      <title>Radio emission from little red dots may reveal their true nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented sensitivity of the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (\textit{JWST}) has revolutionized our understanding of the early universe. Among the most intriguing \textit{JWST} discoveries are red, very compact objects showing broad line emission features nicknamed as little red dots (LRDs). The discovery of LRDs has triggered great interest about their origin as either extremely starbursting galaxies or highly-obscured active galactic nuclei (AGN). Their exact nature still remains unknown. The goal of this work is to estimate the radio emission from LRDs and predict which radio surveys would detect them. To achieve these objectives, we employ the fundamental plane of black hole (BH) accretion to estimate radio emission from AGN and the stellar radio fluxes from their host galaxies. We assume a range of BH mass, X-ray luminosity ($\rm L_{X}$) and star formation rate (SFR) to bracket the likely properties of LRDs. Our findings suggest that BH radio fluxes from LRDs are 10-100 times higher than the stellar fluxes from their host galaxies, depending on BH mass, $\rm L_X$ and SFR. The detection of a $\sim$ 500 nJy signal above 2 GHz at $z \geq$ 5 or a $\sim$ 2000 nJy flux at $z =$ 3-4 would be a smoking gun for the presence of AGN provided that SFRs in the host galaxies are $\rm &lt; 30~ M_{\odot} ~yr^{-1}$. We find that LRDs are most likely radio quiet AGN otherwise would have been already detected in the current radio surveys. Our findings suggest that LRDs can be detected with the upcoming radio observatories such as ngVLA and SKA with integration times of 10-100 hrs, respectively.</description>

      <title>Drone Beam Mapping of the TONE Radio Dish Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drone-based beam measurements are a promising avenue to tackle the critical challenge of calibration for 21 cm cosmology telescopes. In this paper, we introduce a new drone-based calibration system for 400-800 MHz radio observatories, describing its instrumentation and first deployment. We discuss measurements of the TONE array, a CHIME/FRB outrigger pathfinder, and present results, including full 2D high spatial resolution beam maps in both co- and cross-polarization, as well as comparisons to simulations. The polarized beam maps cover a 70 degree by 70 degree grid, capturing the first two sidelobes and measuring the TONE main beam and first sidelobe with 7-9% statistical errors. We investigate polarization angle alignment with frequency, finding significant polarization leakage in the TONE antennas at frequencies above 600 MHz, and a polarization axis rotation with frequency. We describe statistical and systematic errors, as well as measurements of radio frequency interference from the drone and equipment. Our drone system is the first to incorporate a broad-band switched calibration source in the drone payload, enabling background subtraction and direct measurements of the RFI emitted by the drone. The results presented are the first drone-based 2D measurements of cross-polar beam structure and of polarization alignment of an array. The high frequency and spatial resolution achieved with this system have revealed the rich structure of the beam of each antenna, and enabled comparisons between individual dishes and to electromagnetic simulations.</description>

      <title>$\tt GrayHawk$: A public code for calculating the Gray Body Factors of massless fields around spherically symmetric Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and describe $\tt GrayHawk$, a publicly available Mathematica-based tool designed for the efficient computation of gray-body factors for spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat black holes. This program provides users with a rapid and reliable means to compute gray-body factors for massless fields with spin \(s = 0, 1/2, 1, 2\) in modes specified by the angular quantum number \(l\), given a black hole metric and the associated parameter values. $\tt GrayHawk$ is preloaded with seven different black hole metrics, offering immediate applicability to a variety of theoretical models. Additionally, its modular structure allows users to extend its functionality easily by incorporating alternative metrics or configurations. This versatility makes $\tt GrayHawk$ a powerful and adaptable resource for researchers studying black hole physics and Hawking radiation. The codes described in this work are publicly available at https://github.com/marcocalza89/GrayHawk.</description>

      <title>The Merging Galaxy Cluster Environment Affects the Morphology of Radio-AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has previously been found that the galaxy cluster environment can affect the fueling and evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This work examines the effect of the merging cluster environment on the properties of radio-AGN by comparing the radio morphology of cluster members in a sample of four merging and eight relaxed galaxy clusters at low redshift (z&lt;0.2). Using 144-MHz data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and Zooniverse, we classify the radio morphology of the radio-detected cluster members using the following morphology classes: compact, compact extended, extended, jetted, and disturbed. We find that the merging cluster environment has a statistically significant, higher population proportion of disturbed (bent and head tail) sources, indicating that the merging environment can affect the morphology of cluster radio-AGN. We also investigate the number of AGN that are detected in the radio data only, and the number that are detected in both the radio and optical data in mergers and non-mergers. We find that the merging cluster environment has a higher population proportion of AGN that are identified only as radio-AGN compared to AGN that are identified as both radio and optical AGN. Overall, we find that the merging environment affects certain radio-AGN (disturbed and only radio identified AGN), but not all.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity emulator for large-scale 21 cm lightcone images: a few-shot transfer learning approach with generative adversarial network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emulators using machine learning techniques have emerged to efficiently generate mock data matching the large survey volume for upcoming experiments, as an alternative approach to large-scale numerical simulations. However, high-fidelity emulators have become computationally expensive as the simulation volume grows to hundreds of megaparsecs. Here, we present a {\it multi-fidelity} emulation of large-scale 21~cm lightcone images from the epoch of reionization, which is realized by applying the {\it few-shot transfer learning} to training generative adversarial networks (GAN) from small-scale to large-scale simulations. Specifically, a GAN emulator is first trained with a huge number of small-scale simulations, and then transfer-learned with only a limited number of large-scale simulations, to emulate large-scale 21~cm lightcone images. We test the precision of our transfer-learned GAN emulator in terms of representative statistics including global 21~cm brightness temperature history, 2D power spectrum, and scattering transform coefficients. We demonstrate that the lightcone images generated by the transfer-learned GAN emulator can reach the percentage level precision in most cases on small scales, and the error on large scales only increases mildly to the level of a few tens of per cent. Nevertheless, our multi-fidelity emulation technique saves a significant portion of computational resources that are mostly consumed for generating training samples for GAN. On estimate, the computational resource by training GAN completely with large-scale simulations would be one to two orders of magnitude larger than using our multi-fidelity technique. This implies that our technique allows for emulating high-fidelity, traditionally computationally prohibitive, images in an economic manner.</description>

      <title>Precision big bang nucleosynthesis with improved Helium-4 predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:1801.08023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial nucleosynthesis is one of the three historical evidences for the big bang model, together with the expansion of the universe and the cosmic microwave background. Now that the number of neutrino families and the baryonic densities have been fixed by laboratory measurements or CMB observations, the model has no free parameter and its predictions are rigid. Departure from its predictions could provide hints or constraints on new physics or astrophysics in the early universe. Precision on primordial abundances deduced from observations have recently been drastically improved and reach the percent level for both deuterium and helium-4. Accordingly, the BBN predictions should reach the same level of precision. For most isotopes, the dominant sources of uncertainty come from those on the laboratory thermonuclear reactions. This article focuses on helium-4 whose predicted primordial abundance depends essentially on weak interactions which control the neutron-proton ratio. The rates of the various weak interaction processes depend on the experimentally measured neutron lifetime, but also includes numerous corrections that we thoroughly investigate here. They are the radiative, zero-temperature, corrections, finite nucleon mass corrections, finite temperature radiative corrections, weak-magnetism, and QED plasma effects, which are for the first time all included and calculated in a self consistent way, allowing to take into account the correlations between them, and verifying that all satisfy detailed balance. The helium-4 predicted mass fraction is $0.24709\pm0.00017$. In addition, we provide a Mathematica code (PRIMAT) that incorporates, not only these corrections but also a full network of reactions, using the best available thermonuclear reaction rates, allowing the predictions of primordial abundances up to the CNO region.</description>

      <title>Revisiting primordial black holes formation from preheating instabilities: the case of Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the formation of primordial black holes (PBH) in the early universe inflationary cosmology has garnered significant attention. One plausible scenario for primordial black hole (PBH) formation arises during the preheating stage following inflation. Notably, this scenario does not necessitate any ad-hoc fine-tuning of the scalar field potential. This paper focuses on the growth of primordial density perturbation and the consequent possibility of PBH formation in the preheating stage of the Starobinsky model for inflation. The typical mechanism for PBH formation during preheating is based on the collapse of primordial fluctuations that become super-horizon during inflation (type I) and re-enter the particle horizon in the different phases of cosmic expansion. In this work, we show that there exists a certain range of modes that remain in the sub-horizon (not exited) during inflation (type II modes) but evolve identically to type I modes if they fall into the instability band, leading to large density perturbation above the threshold and can potentially also contribute to the PBH formation. We detail the conditions determining the possible collapse of type I and/or type II modes whose wavelengths are larger than the Jeans length we derive from the effective sound speed of scalar field fluctuations. Since the preheating stage is an 'inflaton' (approximately) matter-dominated phase, we follow the framework of the critical collapse of fluctuations and compute the mass fraction using the well-known Press-Schechter and the Khlopov-Polnarev formalisms, and compare the two. Finally, we comment on the implications of our study for the investigations concerned with primordial accretion and consequent PBH contribution to the dark matter.</description>

Abstract: Recent searches for parity breaking in the galaxy four-point correlation function, as well as the prospects for greatly improved sensitivity to parity breaking in forthcoming surveys, motivate the search for physical mechanisms that could produce such a signal. Here we show that a parity-violating galaxy four-point correlation function may be induced by lensing by a chiral gravitational-wave background. We estimate the amplitude of a signal that would be detectable with a current galaxy survey, taking into account constraints to the primordial gravitational-wave-background amplitude. We find that this mechanism is unlikely to produce a signal large enough to be seen with a galaxy survey but note that it may come within reach with future 21cm observations.</description>

      <title>Black Holes from Fermi Ball Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermi balls are non-topological solitons that can naturally form in an early universe containing a dark sector with heavy fermions and an attractive interaction mediated by a light scalar field. We compute the Fermi ball mass and radius scaling relations when the potential of the scalar field $\varphi$ has a non-negligible quartic coupling $\lambda\varphi^4$. The resulting Fermi balls reach `saturation' very rapidly, even when their radius is much smaller than the effective Yukawa force range. These objects can therefore grow by mergers or by accretion of ambient dark fermions, until they become so dense that they fall within their Schwarzschild radius and collapse to black holes. This setup, therefore, provides an example of a rather natural and economical dark sector scenario for the formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Strong Lens Foundry. We discovered $\sim 3500$ new strong gravitational lens candidates in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using residual neural networks (ResNet). We observed a subset (51) of our candidates using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). All of them were confirmed to be strong lenses. We also briefly describe spectroscopic follow-up observations by DESI and Keck NIRES programs. From this very rich dataset, a number of studies will be carried out, including evaluating the quality of the ResNet search candidates and lens modeling. In this paper, we present our initial effort in these directions. In particular, as a demonstration, we present the lens model for DESI-165.4754-06.0423, with imaging data from HST, and lens and source redshifts from DESI and Keck NIRES, respectively. In this effort, we have applied a \emph{fully} forward-modeling Bayesian approach (GIGA-Lens), using \emph{multiple} GPUs, for the first time in both regards, to a strong lens with HST data, or any high resolution imaging.</description>

      <title>Clustering of the extreme: A theoretical description of weak lensing critical points power spectra in the mildly nonlinear regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cosmic web analysis, complementary to traditional cosmological probes, the extrema (e.g. peaks and voids) two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) are of particular interest for the study of both astrophysical phenomena and cosmological structure formation. However most previous studies constructed those statistics via N-body simulations without a robust theoretical derivation from first principles. A strong motivation exists for analytically describing the 2PCFs of these local extrema, taking into account the nonlinear gravitational evolution in the late Universe. In this paper, we derive analytical formulae for the power spectra and 2PCFs of 2D critical points, including peaks (maxima), voids (minima) and saddle points, in mildly non-Gaussian weak gravitational lensing fields. We apply a perturbative bias expansion to model the clustering of 2D critical points. We successfully derive the power spectrum of weak lensing critical points up to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in gravitational perturbation theory, where trispectrum configurations of the weak lensing field have to be included. We numerically evaluate those power spectra up to the next-to-leading order (NLO), which correspond to the inclusion of bispectrum configurations, and transform them to the corresponding 2PCFs. An exact Monte Carlo (MC) integration is performed assuming a Gaussian distributed density field to validate our theoretical predictions. Overall, we find similar properties in 2D compared to the clustering of 3D critical points previously measured from N-body simulations. Contrary to standard lensing power spectra analysis, we find distinct BAO features in the lensing peak 2PCFs due to the gradient and curvature constraints, and we quantify that non-Gaussianity makes for ~10% of the signal at quasi-linear scales which could be important for current stage-IV surveys.</description>

      <title>Distinctive GWBs from eccentric inspiraling SMBH binaries with a DM spike</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14041v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent detections of a low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB) from various pulsar-timing-array (PTA) observations have renewed the interest in the inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), whose population is believed to be the most promising candidate with possible generalizations from including either orbital eccentricity or dark matter (DM) spike. In this paper, we show that the inclusion of both can further display distinctive features detectable in future PTA observations. With a typical initial eccentricity $e_0\sim\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ for the inspiraling SMBHBs, even a shallow DM spike can easily drive the orbital eccentricity close to $1$, leaving behind a large turnover eccentricity when GWs begin to dominate the orbital circularization. In particular, the DM spike index $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ universally manifests itself in the characteristic strain by $h_c\sim f^{7/6-\gamma_\mathrm{sp}/3}$ in the far infrared and features a novel oscillation structure at low frequencies. Future PTA detection of such characteristics would be the smoking gun for the DM spike and even reveal the nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Bubbles kick off primordial black holes to form more binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may form before cosmological first-order phase transitions, leading to inevitable collisions between PBHs and bubble walls. In this Letter, we have simulated for the first time the co-evolution of an expanding scalar wall passing through a black hole with full numerical relativity. This black hole-bubble wall collision yields multiple far-reaching phenomena including the PBH mass growth, gravitational wave radiations, and momentum recoil that endows PBHs with additional velocities, approximately doubling the formation rate for PBH binaries and hence strengthening the observational constraints on the PBH abundances.</description>

      <title>Forecast Analysis of Astrophysical Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background beyond general relativity: A Case Study on Brans-Dicke Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor gravity, exemplified by Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity, introduces additional scalar polarization modes that contribute scalar radiation alongside tensor modes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of how gravitational wave generation and propagation effects under Brans-Dicke gravity are encoded into the astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave background (AGWB). We perform end-to-end analyses of realistic populations of simulated coalescing binary systems to generate AGWB mock data with third-generation gravitational wave detectors and conducted a complete Bayesian analysis for the first time. We find the uncertainties in the population properties of binary black holes (BBH) significantly affect the ability to constrain BD gravity. Furthermore, we explore the detectability of potential scalar backgrounds that originates from binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron-star-black-hole (NSBH) mergers, with NSBH systems expected to modify the spectral index of the scalar background and introduce oscillatory behavior. We show that the observations of the AGWB enable the separation of mixed tensor and scalar polarization modes with comparable sensitivity to each mode. However, the scalar background is expected to remain substantially weaker than the tensor background, even in scenarios where BD gravity exhibits significant deviations from general relativity (GR), resulting only upper limits can be placed on the scalar background. We conclude that for ambiguous populations, employing waveform matching with individual sources provides a more robust approach to constrain BD gravity.</description>

      <title>The TRGB-SBF Project. II. Resolving the Virgo Cluster with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Virgo Cluster is the nearest substantial cluster of galaxies to the Milky Way and a cornerstone of the extragalactic distance scale. Here, we present JWST/NIRCam observations that simultaneously cover the cores and halos of ten galaxies in and around the Virgo Cluster and are designed to perform simultaneous measurements of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and surface brightness fluctuations (SBF). Seven of the targets are within the Virgo Cluster and where we are able to resolve some of the cluster's substructure, while an additional three provide important constraints on Virgo infall. The seven galaxies within Virgo itself all have SBF measurements from the Advanced Camera for Surveys Virgo Cluster Survey (ACSVCS). After adjusting the ACSVCS measurements for the offset from our new JWST TRGB measurements, we determine a distance to the Virgo Cluster of d $=$ 16.17 $\pm$ 0.25 (stat) $\pm$ 0.47 (sys) Mpc. The work presented here is part of a larger program to develop a Population II distance scale through the TRGB and SBF that is completely independent of the prominent Cepheid + Type Ia supernova ladder. The TRGB distances to the galaxies presented here, when combined with future SBF measurements, will provide a crucial step forward for determining whether or not systematic errors can explain the well-known "Hubble tension'' or if there is significant evidence for cracks in the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>SMILE: Discriminating milli-lens systems in a VLBI pilot project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark Matter (DM) remains poorly probed on critical, sub-galactic scales, where predictions from different models diverge in terms of abundance and density profiles of halos. Gravitational lens systems on milli-arcsecond scales (milli-lenses) are expected for a population of dense DM halos (free-floating or sub-halos) and free-floating supermassive black holes in the mass range of $10^6$ to $10^9\,M_\odot$. In this paper, we aim to look for milli-lens systems via a systematic search in a large sample of radio-loud AGN observed with very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). We present the observational strategy to discriminate milli-lenses from contaminant objects mimicking a milli-lens morphology. In a pilot project, we have investigated VLBI images from 13,828 sources from the Astrogeo VLBI image database and reduced the number of candidates to 40 in a first step. We present here the images and analysis of new sensitive follow-up observations with the EVN at 5 and 22 GHz and streamline our analysis to reject milli-lens candidates. By using constraints such as the surface brightness ratio, conservation of spectral shape, stability of flux ratios over time, and changes in morphology, we can confidently discriminate between milli-lenses and contaminant objects that mimick them. Using the above constraints, we rule out 31 out of our initial 40 candidates of milli-lens systems, demonstrating the power of our approach. Also, we found many new candidate compact symmetric objects, which are thought to be primarily short-lived jetted radio sources. This serves as a pathfinder for the final sample used for the Search for MIlli-LEnses (SMILE) project, which will allow us to constrain DM models by comparing the results to theoretical predictions. This SMILE sample will consist of $\sim$5,000 sources based on the VLA CLASS survey, including many observations obtained for this project specifically.</description>
