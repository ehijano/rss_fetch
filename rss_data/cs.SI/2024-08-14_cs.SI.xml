      <title>The Adaptive Strategies of Anti-Kremlin Digital Dissent in Telegram during the Russian Invasion of Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Telegram became an essential social media platform for Kremlin-sponsored propaganda dissemination. Over time, Anti-Kremlin Russian opposition channels have also emerged as a prominent voice of dissent against the state-sponsored propaganda. This study examines the dynamics of Anti-Kremlin content on Telegram over seven phases of the invasion, inspired by the concept of breach in narrative theory. A data-driven, computational analysis of emerging topics revealed the Russian economy, combat updates, international politics, and Russian domestic affairs, among others. Using a common set of statistical contrasts by phases of the invasion, a longitudinal analysis of topic prevalence allowed us to examine associations with documented offline events and viewer reactions, suggesting an adaptive breach-oriented communications strategy that maintained viewer interest. Viewer approval of those events that threaten Kremlin control suggests that Telegram levels the online playing field for the opposition, surprising given the Kremlin's suppression of free speech offline.</description>

      <title>ProCom: A Few-shot Targeted Community Detection Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Targeted community detection aims to distinguish a particular type of community in the network. This is an important task with a lot of real-world applications, e.g., identifying fraud groups in transaction networks. Traditional community detection methods fail to capture the specific features of the targeted community and detect all types of communities indiscriminately. Semi-supervised community detection algorithms, emerged as a feasible alternative, are inherently constrained by their limited adaptability and substantial reliance on a large amount of labeled data, which demands extensive domain knowledge and manual effort.
  In this paper, we address the aforementioned weaknesses in targeted community detection by focusing on few-shot scenarios. We propose ProCom, a novel framework that extends the ``pre-train, prompt'' paradigm, offering a low-resource, high-efficiency, and transferable solution. Within the framework, we devise a dual-level context-aware pre-training method that fosters a deep understanding of latent communities in the network, establishing a rich knowledge foundation for downstream task. In the prompt learning stage, we reformulate the targeted community detection task into pre-training objectives, allowing the extraction of specific knowledge relevant to the targeted community to facilitate effective and efficient inference. By leveraging both the general community knowledge acquired during pre-training and the specific insights gained from the prompt communities, ProCom exhibits remarkable adaptability across different datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on five benchmarks to evaluate the ProCom framework, demonstrating its SOTA performance under few-shot scenarios, strong efficiency, and transferability across diverse datasets.</description>

      <title>Confrontation of capitalism and socialism in Wikipedia networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Ising Network Opinion Formation (INOF) model and apply it for the analysis of networks of 6 Wikipedia language editions. In the model, Ising spins are placed at network nodes/articles and the steady-state opinion polarization of spins is determined from the Monte Carlo iterations in which a given spin orientation is determined by in-going links from other spins. The main consideration is done for opinion confrontation between {\it capitalism, imperialism} (blue opinion) and {\it socialism, communism} (red opinion). These nodes have fixed spin/opinion orientation while other nodes achieve their steady-state opinions in the process of Monte Carlo iterations. We find that the global network opinion favors {\it socialism, communism} for all 6 editions. The model also determines the opinion preferences for world countries and political leaders, showing good agreement with heuristic expectations. We also present results for opinion competition between {\it Christianity} and {\it Islam}, and USA Democratic and Republican parties. We argue that the INOF approach can find numerous applications for directed complex networks.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Algorithms to Calculate Expected Modularity in Probabilistic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modularity maximization is a widely used community detection technique for deterministic networks. However, little research has been performed to develop efficient modularity calculation algorithms for probabilistic networks. Particularly, it is challenging to efficiently calculate expected modularity when all possible worlds are considered. To address this problem, we propose two algorithms, namely $\mathrm{PWP}^{\mathrm{EMOD}}$ and $\mathrm{APWP}^{\mathrm{EMOD}}$, partitioning the possible worlds based on their modularities to significantly reduce the number of probability calculations. We evaluate the accuracy and time efficiency of our algorithms through comprehensive experiments.</description>

      <title>Joint Graph Rewiring and Feature Denoising via Spectral Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) take as input the graph structure and the feature vectors associated with the nodes. Both contain noisy information about the labels. Here we propose joint denoising and rewiring (JDR)--an algorithm to jointly denoise the graph structure and features, which can improve the performance of any downstream algorithm. We do this by defining and maximizing the alignment between the leading eigenspaces of graph and feature matrices. To approximately solve this computationally hard problem, we propose a heuristic that efficiently handles real-world graph datasets with many classes and different levels of homophily or heterophily. We experimentally verify the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic data and real-world graph datasets. The results show that JDR consistently outperforms existing rewiring methods on node classification tasks using GNNs as downstream models.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics Incorporating Higher-Order Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.03569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The issue of opinion sharing and formation has received considerable attention in the academic literature, and a few models have been proposed to study this problem. However, existing models are limited to the interactions among nearest neighbors, ignoring those second, third, and higher-order neighbors, despite the fact that higher-order interactions occur frequently in real social networks. In this paper, we develop a new model for opinion dynamics by incorporating long-range interactions based on higher-order random walks. We prove that the model converges to a fixed opinion vector, which may differ greatly from those models without higher-order interactions. Since direct computation of the equilibrium opinion is computationally expensive, which involves the operations of huge-scale matrix multiplication and inversion, we design a theoretically convergence-guaranteed estimation algorithm that approximates the equilibrium opinion vector nearly linearly in both space and time with respect to the number of edges in the graph. We conduct extensive experiments on various social networks, demonstrating that the new algorithm is both highly efficient and effective.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Open Source User Activity Traces with Applications to User Mobility Characterization and Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.06382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current state-of-the-art in user mobility research has extensively relied on open-source mobility traces captured from pedestrian and vehicular activity through a variety of communication technologies as users engage in a wide-range of applications, including connected healthcare, localization, social media, e-commerce, etc. Most of these traces are feature-rich and diverse, not only in the information they provide, but also in how they can be used and leveraged. This diversity poses two main challenges for researchers and practitioners who wish to make use of available mobility datasets. First, it is quite difficult to get a bird's eye view of the available traces without spending considerable time looking them up. Second, once they have found the traces, they still need to figure out whether the traces are adequate to their needs.
  The purpose of this survey is three-fold. It proposes a taxonomy to classify open-source mobility traces including their mobility mode, data source and collection technology. It then uses the proposed taxonomy to classify existing open-source mobility traces and finally, highlights three case studies using popular publicly available datasets to showcase how our taxonomy can tease out feature sets in traces to help determine their applicability to specific use-cases.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Curing and Network Design in SIS Epidemic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies efficient algorithms for dynamic curing policies and the corresponding network design problems to guarantee the fast extinction of epidemic spread in a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model. We consider a Markov process-based SIS epidemic model. We provide a computationally efficient curing algorithm based on the curing policy proposed by Drakopoulos, Ozdaglar, and Tsitsiklis (2014). Since the corresponding optimization problem is NP-hard, finding optimal policies is intractable for large graphs. We provide approximation guarantees on the curing budget of the proposed dynamic curing algorithm. We also present a curing algorithm fair to demographic groups.
  When the total infection rate is high, the original curing policy includes a waiting period in which no measure is taken to mitigate the spread until the rate slows down. To avoid the waiting period, we study network design problems to reduce the total infection rate by deleting edges or reducing the weight of edges. Then the curing processes become continuous since the total infection rate is restricted by network design. We provide algorithms with provable guarantees for the considered network design problems. In summary, the proposed curing and network design algorithms together provide an effective and computationally efficient approach that mitigates SIS epidemic spread in networks.</description>

      <title>Community Detection Guarantees Using Embeddings Learned by Node2Vec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embedding the nodes of a large network into an Euclidean space is a common objective in modern machine learning, with a variety of tools available. These embeddings can then be used as features for tasks such as community detection/node clustering or link prediction, where they achieve state of the art performance. With the exception of spectral clustering methods, there is little theoretical understanding for commonly used approaches to learning embeddings. In this work we examine the theoretical properties of the embeddings learned by node2vec. Our main result shows that the use of $k$-means clustering on the embedding vectors produced by node2vec gives weakly consistent community recovery for the nodes in (degree corrected) stochastic block models. We also discuss the use of these embeddings for node and link prediction tasks. We demonstrate this result empirically, and examine how this relates to other embedding tools for network data.</description>
