      <title>Ladder Symmetries and Love Numbers of Reissner--Nordstr\"om Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that asymptotically flat black holes in general relativity have vanishing tidal Love numbers. In the case of Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, this property has been shown to be a consequence of a hidden structure of ladder symmetries for the perturbations. In this work, we extend the ladder symmetries to non-rotating charged black holes in general relativity. As opposed to previous works in this context, we adopt a more general definition of Love numbers, including quadratic operators that mix gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations in the point-particle effective field theory. We show that the calculation of a subset of those couplings in full general relativity is affected by an ambiguity in the split between source and response, which we resolve through an analytic continuation. As a result, we derive a novel master equation that unifies scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations around Reissner--Nordstr\"om black holes. The equation is hypergeometric and can be obtained from previous formulations via nontrivial field redefinitions, which allow to systematically remove some of the singularities and make the presence of the ladder symmetries more manifest.</description>

      <title>Most general Type-D Black Hole and Accelerating Reissner-Nordstrom-NUT-(A)dS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Plebanski-Demianski metric is commonly thought to describe the most general Type D black hole in general relativity (possibly coupled with Maxwell electromagnetism), but it fails to describe the elusive accelerating spacetimes with gravitomagnetic mass without angular momentum. We propose a very general type D metric, stemming from a binary black hole system, which represents a novel branch of the type D spacetimes: accelerating Kerr-Newman-NUT black hole with cosmological constant. It has straightforward limits to all the known type D black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell theory and in particular to the accelerating Reissner-Nordstrom-NUT solution, yet unknown in the literature.</description>

      <title>On the central singularity of the BTZ geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the central singularity of the BTZ geometries -- stationary vacuum solutions of 2+1 gravity with negative cosmological constant $\Lambda=-\ell^{-2}$ and $SO(2)\times \mathbb{R}$ isometry -- is discussed. The essential tool for this analysis is the holonomy operator on a closed path (i.e., Wilson loop) around the central singularity. The study considers the holonomies for the Lorentz and AdS$_3$ connections. The analysis is carried out for all values of the mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, namely, for black holes ($M \ell \ge |J|$) and naked singularities ($M \ell &lt; |J|$). In general, both Lorentz and AdS$_3$ holonomies are nontrivial in the zero-radius limit revealing the presence of delta-like singularity at the origin in the curvature and torsion two-forms. However, in the cases $M\pm J/\ell=-n_{\pm}^2$, with $n_{\pm} \in \mathbb{N}$, recently identified in \cite{GMYZ} as BPS configurations, the AdS$_3$ holonomy reduces to the identity. Nevertheless, except for the AdS$_{3}$ spacetime ($M=-1$, $J=0$), all BTZ geometries have a central singularity which is not revealed by local operations.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild Black Hole Surrounded by Perfect Fluid Dark Matter in the presence of Quintessence Matter Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we examine the Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter in the presence of the quintessence matter field in the context of thermodynamics, shadows, and quasinormal modes. We find that the quintessence matter field sets an upper bound value on the horizon where dark matter settles a lower limit on the event horizon but also expands the upper bound value of the horizon. We discuss how this impact alters the black hole's thermodynamics, shadows, and quasinormal modes.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Khronon Theory in agreement with Modified Newtonian Dynamics and Large-Scale Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extension of General Relativity (GR) based on a space-time foliation by three-dimensional space-like hypersurfaces labeled by the Khronon scalar field $\tau$. We show that this theory (i) leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) at galactic scales for stationary systems; (ii) recovers GR plus a cosmological constant in the strong field regime; (iii) is in agreement with the standard cosmological model and the observed cosmic microwave background anisotropies at linear cosmological scales, where the theory reduces to a subset of the generalized dark matter (GDM) model. We compute the second order action on a Minkowski background and show that it contains the usual tensor modes of GR and a scalar degree of freedom with dispersion relation $\omega=0$. We find that the deconstrained Hamiltonian is bounded from below for wavenumbers larger than $\sim 10^{-31}\,\text{eV}$ and unbounded for smaller wavenumbers.</description>

      <title>Energetics of Buchdahl stars and the magnetic Penrose process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buchdahl star is the most compact object without an event horizon and is an excellent candidate for a black hole mimicker. Unlike black holes, rotating Buchdahl star can be over-extremal with respect to the black hole, sustaining a larger spin. We show that it can also develop an ergosphere above the threshold spin $\beta &gt; 1/\sqrt{2}$, which allows extraction of its rotational energy. Electromagnetic field around Buchdahl star is also expected to differ from that of black hole in both strength and topology. In this paper, we explore the energetics of Buchdahl star focusing on the magnetic Penrose process in the two magnetic field configurations, i.e., uniform and dipole. Below the threshold spin, Buchdahl star is expected to be quiet, while above the threshold it can be much more efficient than the black hole if a dipolar magnetic field is developed on its surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the homogeneous and anisotropic evolution of spacetime driven by perfect fluid with shear viscosity. We obtain exact solutions by considering the simplest form of the equation of state wherein the pressure and the shear stress are proportional to the energy density individually. The solutions represent Bianchi type-I cosmology of which the special case becomes Bianchi type-VII. We find that the initial singularity can be removed only for the Bianchi type-VII.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers and approximate universal relations for fermion soliton stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermion soliton stars are a consistent model of exotic compact objects which involve a nonlinear interaction between a real scalar field and fermions through a Yukawa term. This interaction results in an effective fermion mass that depends upon the vacuum structure in the scalar potential. In this work we investigate the tidal deformations of fermion soliton stars and compute the corresponding tidal Love numbers for different model parameters. Furthermore, we discuss the existence of approximate universal relations for the electric and magnetic tidal deformabilities of these stars, and compare them with other solutions of general relativity, such as neutron stars or boson stars. These relations for fermion soliton stars are less universal than for neutron stars, but they are sufficiently different from the ordinary neutron star case that a measurement of the electric and magnetic tidal Love numbers (as potentially achievable by next-generation gravitational wave detectors) can be used to disentangle these families of compact objects. Finally, we discuss the conditions for tidal disruption of fermion soliton stars in a binary system and estimate the detectability of the electromagnetic signal associated with such tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>Friedmann equations of the fractal apparent horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a fractal perspective, the entropy bound of gravitational systems undergoes changes. Furthermore, in the cosmological setting, the conservation law of a perfect fluid is also altered in such systems, affecting spatial elements like volume, area, and radius. By applying the first law of thermodynamics and deriving the Friedmann equations, we can gain insight into the evolution of such a fractal cosmos. However, observations continue to necessitate the existence of a dark energy source. To address this, in this article, we have created a novel fractal $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model and determined the fractal cosmological observables. We show that the spatial fractal dimension is two, and the age of the Universe is 13.91 Gyr, by fitting the model's parameters to cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational mode mixing around black holes in scalar-tensor theories with parity-violating terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate black holes and gravitational perturbations when both the scalar Gauss-Bonnet and dynamical Chern-Simons gravity sectors coexist in addition to the Einstein-Hilbert term, and both sectors are coupled to a single canonically normalized scalar field. The presence of the scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity sector allows the scalar field to possess a non-vanishing background solution, resulting in additional couplings between odd and even-type gravitational perturbations arising from the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity sector. We illustrate the impact of these even-odd gravitational couplings in gravitational perturbations around a static spherically symmetric black hole. Although the couplings between the odd and even-type gravitational perturbations are known to appear in purely tensorial gravity theories with higher curvature corrections, we demonstrate it in scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>Observational features of reflection asymmetric black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kerr spacetime is symmetric with respect to a well-defined equatorial plane. When testing the equatorial reflection symmetry of an isolated black hole, one is at the same time testing the Kerr hypothesis in General Relativity. In this work, we investigate the possible observational features when a Keplerian disk is surrounding a rotating black hole without reflection symmetry. When such symmetry is broken, generically, the photon trajectories around the black hole and the Keplerian orbits on the accretion disk are distorted vertically away from the equatorial plane by an amount that depends on their distance to the black hole. In the reflection asymmetric spacetime we are considering, these two kinds of orbits are distorted in opposite directions. Interestingly, while the size and shape of black hole shadows closely resemble those of Kerr black holes, distinct observational characteristics can emerge in the disk image and emission line profiles. When observing the disk edge-on, a pronounced concave shape may appear along its innermost edge on the incoming side. Furthermore, distinctive horn-like features might be observed on the spectral line profile at the blue-shifted side. These special features can serve as compelling indicators of the reflection asymmetry present in rotating black holes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Isotropic Universe in RQM Analogy: the Cosmological Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of the isotropic Universe in the presence of a free massless scalar field, playing the role of a physical clock. The Hilbert space is constructed via a direct analogy between the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the minisuperspace and a relativistic scalar one in physical space. In particular, we show how the introduction of a "turning point" in the Universe evolution allows to overcome an intrinsic ambiguity in representing the expanding and collapsing Universe. In this way, the positive and negative frequencies are simply identified with time reversed states. The main subject of the present analysis is the construction of a horizon operator, whose quantum behavior is investigated when Polymer Quantum Mechanics is implemented to describe the asymptotic evolution near the initial singularity. The reason of this choice is motivated by the intrinsic spreading of localized wavepackets when the polymer dispersion relation governs the quantum dynamics. The evidence that the mean value of the quantum horizon operator follows its semiclassical behavior (corrected for polymerization) is a clear indication that a concept of causality can be restored also in the quantum cosmological picture.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently it was shown that essentially all regular black hole models constructed so far can be obtained as solutions of vacuum gravity equations, upon considering an infinite series of quasi-topological higher curvature corrections. Here we show that such a construction can be upgraded to yield regular black holes with vanishing inner horizon surface gravity. In four dimensions, such a condition is necessary for the absence of classical instabilities associated with mass inflation on the inner horizon.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Null Energy Condition Violation from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's First Three Observing Runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The null energy condition (NEC) is a cornerstone of general relativity, and its violation could leave observable imprints in the cosmic gravitational wave spectrum. Theoretical models suggest that NEC violations during inflation can amplify the primordial tensor power spectrum, leading to distinct features in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this work, we search for these NEC-violating signatures in the SGWB using data from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's first three observing runs. Our analysis reveals no statistically significant evidence of such signals, allowing us to place stringent upper limits on the tensor power spectrum amplitude, $P_{T,2}$, during the second inflationary stage. Specifically, we find that $P_{T,2} \lesssim 0.15$ at a $95\%$ confidence level. Notably, this upper limit is consistent with constraints derived from pulsar timing array observations, reinforcing the hypothesis that NEC violations during inflation could explain the signal detected by pulsar timing arrays. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the early Universe and highlight the potential of current and future gravitational wave experiments in probing the physics of inflation and NEC violations.</description>

      <title>Wave optics lensing of gravitational waves: theory and phenomenology of triple systems in the LISA band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study lensing of gravitational waves by a black hole in the deep wave optics regime, i.e. when the wavelength is much larger than the black hole Schwarzschild radius. We apply it to triple systems, with a binary of stellar mass objects in the inspiraling phase orbiting around a central massive black hole. We describe the full polarisation structure of the wave and derive predictions for the polarisation modes of the scattered wave measured by the observer. We show that lensing in the wave optics regime is not helicity preserving, as opposed to lensing in the geometric optics regime. The amplitude of the total wave is modulated due to interference between the directly transmitted and lensed components. The relative amplitude of the modulation is fixed by the lensing geometry and can reach unity in the most favourable settings. This indicates that wave optics lensing is potentially detectable by LISA for sufficiently high SNR systems. Our findings show that in the wave optics regime it is necessary to go beyond the usual lensing description where the amplification factor is assumed to be the same for both helicity modes. While motivated by GW190521 and the AGN formation scenario, our results apply more broadly to stellar-mass binaries orbiting a third body described as a Schwarzschild black hole, with a period comparable to the GW observation time.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Cosmological Gravitational Particle Production in Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of the baryon asymmetry within the framework of cosmological gra\-vi\-ta\-tional particle production, employing the Bogoliubov approach. We examine two well-known baryogenesis scenarios, namely baryogenesis in Grand Unified Theories (GUT) and leptogenesis, while considering reheating temperatures sufficiently low for thermal processes to be negligible. Considering $\alpha-$attractor T-models for the inflaton potential, we demonstrate that GUT baryogenesis from scalar decays can be successful across a large range of conformal couplings with gravity, without necessitating substantial levels of CP violation. In the case of leptogenesis, we find that the reheating temperature should be $T_{\rm RH}\lesssim 10^{6}~{\rm GeV}$ for right-handed neutrino masses $M_1 \lesssim 6 \times 10^{12}~{\rm GeV}$ to generate the observed asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Primordial Black Hole Power Spectra from Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel methodology for analysing the relation between the energy density in gravitational waves and primordial power spectra is developed. Focusing on scalar-induced gravitational radiation, this methodology is applied to a number of scenarios for the primordial black hole formation. Being differed from conventional Bayesian approaches, its advantages include directness and computational efficiency, which are crucial for handling the complex data characteristic of gravitational wave research. As an important application, it is demonstrated that it allows to systematically identify all scenarios consistent with current and future pulsar-timing-array data.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the behavior of a massive scalar field dark matter scenarios in the large mass limit around a central Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole. This study is motivated by observations from the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration, which does not exclude the possibility of the existence of such black holes. Through these inquiries, we uncover that the electric charge may significantly impact the scalar field profile and the density profile in the vecinty of the black hole. For the maximum electric charge allowed by the constraints of the Event Horizon Telescope, the maximum accretion rate decreases by $\thicksim$ 50 \% compared to the Schwarszchild case for marginally bound orbits. The maximum accretion rate of the massive scalar field is approximately $\dot M_{\text{SFDM}} \thicksim 10^{-8} M_{\odot} \;\text{yr}^{-1}$, which is significantly lower than the typical baryonic accretion rate commonly found in the literature. This implies that the scalar cloud located at the center of galaxies may have survived untill present times.</description>

      <title>Gravitational production of massive scalars in the context of inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set up a formalism for calculating the energy density generated in a quantized massive scalar field in the course of the drastic change in spacetime geometry at the end of the inflationary era. The calculation relies on the notion of adiabatic vacuum. The Bogolubov coefficients are computed by employing the sudden approximation. After obtaining a general formula, we calculate explicitly the energy density generated in a particle species with $m/H \ll1$, where $m$ is the particle mass and $H$ is the Hubble constant during the inflationary epoch. We find the contribution of the long-wavelength modes to be $\propto H^5/m$. If such particles are very weakly interacting, they can come to dominate the total energy density in the Universe. Other cosmological implications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Future stability of perfect fluids with extreme tilt and linear equation of state $p=c_s^2\rho$ for the Einstein-Euler system with positive cosmological constant: The range $\frac{1}{3}&lt;c_s^2&lt;\frac{3}{7}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the future stability of cosmological fluids, in spacetimes with an accelerated expansion, which exhibit extreme tilt behavior, ie. their fluid velocity becoming asymptotically null at timelike infinity. It has been predicted in the article \cite{LEUW} that the latter behavior is dominant for sound speeds beyond radiation $c_s=1/\sqrt{3}$, hence, bifurcating off of the stable orthogonal fluid behavior modeled by the classical FLRW family of solutions, for $c_s^2\in[0,\frac{1}{3}]$. First, we construct homogeneous solutions to the Einstein-Euler system with the latter behavior, in $\mathbb{S}^3$ spatial topology, for sound speeds $c_s^2\in(\frac{1}{3},1)$. Then, we study their future dynamics and prove a global stability result in the restricted range $c_s^2\in(\frac{1}{3},\frac{3}{7})$. In particular, we show that extreme tilt behavior persists to sufficiently small perturbations of the homogeneous backgrounds, without any symmetry assumptions or analyticity. Our method is based on a bootstrap argument, in weighted Sobolev spaces, capturing the exponential decay of suitable renormalized variables. Extreme tilt behavior is associated with a degeneracy in the top order energy estimates that we derive, which allows us to complete our bootstrap argument only in the aforementioned restricted range of sound speeds. Interestingly, this is a degeneracy that does not appear in the study of formal series expansions. Moreover, for the Euler equations on a fixed FLRW background, our estimates can be improved to treat the entire beyond radiation interval $c_s^2\in(\frac{1}{3},1)$, a result already obtained in \cite{MO}. The latter indicates that the former issue is related to the general inhomogeneous geometry of the perturbed metric in the coupled to Einstein case.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmological Physics with DESI BAO Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DESI year one observations can help probe new physics on cosmological scales. In light of the latest DESI BAO measurements, we constrain four popular cosmological scenarios including inflation, modified gravity, annihilating dark matter and interacting dark energy. Using a data combination of BICEP/Keck array, cosmic microwave background and DESI, we obtain the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.05}= 0.0176^{+0.0070}_{-0.0130}$ and $r_{0.05}=0.018^{+0.020}_{-0.017}$. Using the combination of cosmic microwave background and DESI, we find a $2.4\sigma$ evidence for gravitational theories beyond the general relativity, shrinks the dark matter annihilation cross-section by $12\%$ relative to cosmic microwave background, and obtain a $1.6\sigma$ hint of the positive interaction between dark matter and dark energy indicating that energy may be transferred from dark matter to dark energy in the dark sector of the universe. Future DESI observations could go a step further to explore the nature of inflation, dark matter and dark energy, and test the validity of general relativity on cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>Precession and Split of Tilted, Geometrically Thin Accretion Disk: an Analytical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been observed that many relativistic jets display a kind of cork-screw-like precession. Numerical simulations has suggested that such kind of precession may originate from the precession of the disk. In this work, we introduce an analytical model to describe the precession and split of a tilted, geometrically thin disk. We consider the Lense-Thirring effect from the central (primary) black hole (BH) and the gravitational effect from the companion (secondary) BH far away from the center, both of which could induce the precession of the accretion disk around the spin axis of central black hole. We propose the splitting conditions that when the rate of viscous diffusion cannot catch up with the dynamical frequency at a certain layer of fluid, the disk would split into two parts which precess independently. We presume that the precessions of the inner and outer disks are in accord with the rotation and precession of jet, respectively. By matching the frequencies of the disks to the observed frequencies of jet in the cork-screw-like precession and considering the splitting condition, we are allowed to read four parameters, the innermost radius ($r_{\rm in}$), the outermost radius ($r_{\rm out}$) of the disk, the initial splitting radius ($r_{\rm sp,0}$), and the inflow speed magnitude($\beta$), of the disk. We apply this model to OJ 287. Moreover, considering the inward shrinking of the disks, we find the time variation of the precession angle of jet. This time variation presents a unique feature of our model, which could be distinguishable in the future observation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Memory Imprints on the CMB from Populations of Massive Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: To showcase and characterise the rich phenomenology of temperature fluctuation patterns that are imprinted on the CMB by the gravitational wave memory (GWM) of massive black hole (BH) mergers. Methods: We analyse both individual binaries as well as populations of binaries, distributed in local cosmological boxes at a given redshift. Results: The magnitude of the temperature fluctuations scales primarily as a function of binary total mass and pattern angular scale, and accumulates as a random-walk process when populations of mergers are considered. Fluctuations of order $\sim 10^{-10}$ K are easily reached across scales of $\sim 1'$ to $\sim 1^{\circ}$ for realistic volumetric merger rates of 10$^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ Gyr$^{-1}$, as appropriate for massive galaxies at $z=1$. We determine numerically that GWM temperature fluctuations result in a universal power spectrum with a scaling of $P(k)\propto k^{-2.7}$. Conclusion: While not detectable given the limitations of current all-sky CMB surveys, our work explicitly shows how every black hole merger in the Universe left us its unique faint signature.</description>

      <title>Model independent cosmographic constraints from DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore model independent constraints on the universe kinematics up to the snap and jerk hierarchical terms. To do so, we consider the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) release provided by the DESI collaboration, tackling the $r_d$ parameter to span within the range $[144,152]$ Mpc, with fixed step, $\delta r_d=2$ Mpc, aligning with Planck and DESI results. Thus, employing Monte Carlo Markov chain analyses, we place stringent constraints on the cosmographic series, incorporating three combinations of data catalogs: the first BAO with observational Hubble data, the second BAO with type Ia supernovae, and the last including all three data sets. Our results conclusively constrain the cosmographic series, say the deceleration $q_0$, the jerk $j_0$, and the snap $s_0$ parameters, at the $2$--$\sigma$ level, showcasing a significant departure on $j_0$ even at $1$--$\sigma$ confidence level, albeit being compatible with the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm on $q_0$ and $s_0$, at $2$--$\sigma$ level. Analogously, the $h_0$ tension appears alleviated in the second hierarchy, say including snap. Finally, a direct comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM models and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization is reported, definitively favoring the wCDM scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of braneworld holography, we construct a quantum charged black hole that is localized on a three-dimensional anti-de Sitter brane and incorporates quantum backreaction effects from the boundary field theory. The field on the brane consists of higher curvature gravitation coupled with a nonlinear electromagnetic field, and it does not exhibit conformal symmetry. We also investigate the thermodynamics of these quantum charged black holes from three distinct perspectives: a pure bulk description, where the bulk gravitation interacts with a brane; a brane description, where local dynamical gravitation is subject to quantum backreaction from the dual quantum conformal field; a boundary description, where the degrees of freedom for defect quantum conformal matters are considered. In so doing we obtain doubly holographic formulations of both the first law of thermodynamics and the Smarr (energy) relations.</description>

      <title>One-loop power spectrum in ultra slow-roll inflation and implications for primordial black hole dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the in-in formalism to address the question of whether the size of the one-loop spectrum of curvature fluctuations in ultra-slow-roll inflation models designed for producing a large population of primordial black holes implies a breakdown of perturbation theory. We consider a simplified piece-wise description of inflation, in which the ultra-slow-roll phase is preceded and followed by slow-roll phases linked by transitional periods. We work in the $\delta\phi$-gauge, including all relevant cubic and quartic interactions and the necessary counterterms to renormalize the ultraviolet divergences, regularized by a cutoff. The ratio of the one-loop to the tree-level contributions to the spectrum of curvature perturbations is controlled by the duration of the ultra-slow-roll phase and of the transitions. Our results indicate that perturbation theory does not necessarily break in well-known models proposed to account for all the dark matter in the form of primordial black holes.</description>

Abstract: Here we prove a global gauge-invariant radiation estimates for the perturbations of the $3+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime in the presence of Yang-Mills sources. In particular, we obtain a novel gauge invariant estimate for the Yang-Mills fields coupled to gravity in a double null framework in the Causal complement of a compact set of a Cauchy slice. A consequence of our result is the global exterior stability of the Minkowski space under coupled Yang-Mills perturbations. A special structure present both in the null Bianchi equations and the null Yang-Mills equations is utilized crucially to obtain the dispersive estimates necessary to conclude the global existence property. Direct use of Bel-Robinson and Yang-Mills stress-energy tensor to obtain the energy estimates is avoided in favor of weighted integration by parts taking advantage of the manifestly symmetric hyperbolic characteristics of null Bianchi and null Yang-Mills equations. Our result holds for any compact semi-simple gauge group. This is the first stability result of Minkowski space including a non-linear source.</description>

      <title>Constraining the attractive fifth force in the general free scalar-tensor gravity with solar system experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the general free scalar-tensor gravity with three free coupling functions, which in the near-field region looks like general relativity (GR) plus a fifth force of Yukawa-type induced by the scalar field. We show that the fifth force is always attractive in the theory. We investigate the effects of the attractive fifth force and calculate in detail the fifth force-induced orbital precession rate $\delta\omega/\omega$ and the parameterized post-Newtonian parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$, all of which depend on the fifth force parameters and the interaction distance. It turns out that, due to the attractive fifth force, $\delta\omega/\omega$ is always greater than zero, $\gamma$ is always less than one, $\beta$ is greater than one at large distances, and additionally this class of theories is ruled out as an alternative theory to dark matter. We place stringent constraints on the fifth force parameters by combining the lunar laser ranging (LLR), Cassini, and Mercury precession experiments, and derive the upper bounds on the strength ratio of the fifth force to gravitational force at different scales from the LLR observation. We find that the Mercury constraint is not competitive with the LLR and Cassini constraints and the LLR observation imposes much more stringent bounds on the strength ratio on large scales than on small scales. Our results show that this theory is sufficiently close to GR for a small enough fifth force strength and can reduce to GR with a minimally coupled scalar field in the absence of fifth force.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a modification in the energy-momentum conservation violating Rastall's theory of gravity and obtain a Reissner-Nordstr\"om-type black hole solution in spacetime surrounded by a cloud of strings and charge fields. We examine the horizons of the black hole along with the influence of the parameters of the model on it. The scalar quasinormal modes (QNMs) of oscillations of the black hole are also computed using the 6th order WKB approximation method. It is seen that the Rastall parameter $\beta$ and the newly introduced energy-momentum tensor trace parameter $\alpha$ as well as the charge parameter $q$ and strings field parameter $a$ influence the amplitude and damping of the QNMs. From the metric function, we obtain the temperature of the black hole and study the effects of the four model parameters $\beta$, $\alpha$, $q$ and $a$ on the temperature. We then examine the greybody factors associated with the black hole and the corresponding total absorption cross-section for it. It is seen that the modification we introduced in the Rastall theory has a drastic effect on various properties of the black hole and may lead to interesting outcomes in future when the better detection techniques will be available with the LISA and the Einstein Telescope.</description>

Abstract: Null cosmic strings are shown to disturb gravitational fields of massive bodies and create outgoing gravitational waves (GW). Perturbations of the metric caused by a straight null string and a point-like massive source are found as solutions to linearized Einstein equations on a flat space-time. An analytic approximation for their asymptotic at future null infinity is derived. A space-time created by the source and the string is shown to have asymptotically polyhomogeneous form. We calculate GW flux in such space-times and demonstrate that the averaged intensity of the radiation is maximal in the direction of the string motion. Opportunities to detect null string generated gravity waves are briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: Gravity models given by higher-order scalar curvature corrections are believed to bear important consequences. The Einstein-Bel-Robinson gravity, with quartic curvature modification, motivated Sajadi et al to explore static spherically symmetric black hole solutions with perturbative methods. In this paper, inspired by their work, we investigate AdS black hole shadows in EBR gravity. Moreover, we demonstrate how the gravity parameter alters the energy emission rate. Finally, we handle the same problem in the presence of plasma, since the black holes are thought to be surrounded by a medium that changes the geodesic of photons.</description>

Abstract: Effective models of gravitational collapse in loop quantum gravity for the Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi spacetime predict that collapsing matter reaches a maximum finite density, bounces, and then expands outwards. We show that in the marginally bound case, shell-crossing singularities commonly occur for inhomogeneous initial profiles of the dust energy density; this is the case in particular for all profiles that are continuous and of compact support, including configurations arbitrarily close to the Oppenheimer-Snyder model. When a shell-crossing singularity occurs, it is necessary to seek weak solutions to the dynamics; we argue that weak solutions typically contain shock waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a new action formulation of hyperfluids, fluids with intrinsic hypermomentum. Brown's Lagrangian for a relativistic perfect fluid is generalised by incorporating the degrees of freedom encoded in the hypermomentum tensor, namely by including connection-matter couplings. Quite interestingly, generic hyperfluids are imperfect, since hypermomentum induces such effects as bulk and shear viscosities as well as heat fluxes. The various coefficients that appear in the first order expansion of hydrodynamics can now be deduced from a Lagrangian formulation, given a geometrical interpretation and a suggested microscopic description in terms of hypermomentum. This connection between hypermomentum and dissipative fluids could shed new light on the physics of relativistic hydrodynamics. The applicability of the new formalism is demonstrated by exact cosmological solutions.</description>

Abstract: {In (Sci. Rep. \textbf{12}, 8516 (2022)), Campos et al studied} the quasinormal modes and shadows of noncommutative Schwarzschild black holes. Since we know that the quintessence matter surrounding black holes has { significant effects} on the black hole quantities, {in this study, we aimed to show this influence by revisiting the same problem in the presence of quintessence matter field. To this end, we first examined the thermodynamics of noncommutative Schwarzschild black holes embedded in quintessence matter using Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat functions. After that,} we discussed phase transition and stability { features. We then investigated} the shadow images in the presence of plasma. After visualizing these results qualitatively, we calculated the quasinormal modes in WKB and Mashhoon approximations and we demonstrated the impacts of quintessence matter and noncommutative spacetime on the whole quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We proceed to obtain an exact analytical solution of the Brans-Dicke (BD) equations for the spatially flat ($k=0$) Friedmann-Lamaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological model in both cases of the absence and presence of the cosmological constant. The solution method that we use to solve the field equations of the BD equations is called the "invariants of symmetry groups method" (ISG-method). This method is based on the extended Prelle-Singer (PS) method and it employs the Lie point symmetry, $\lambda$-symmetry, and Darboux polynomials (DPs). Indeed, the ISG-method tries to provide two independent first-order invariants associated to the one-parameter Lie groups of transformations keeping ordinary differential equations (ODEs) invariant, as solutions. It should be noted for integrable ODEs, the ISG-method guarantees the extraction of these two invariants. In this work for the BD equations in FLRW cosmological model, we find the Lie point symmetries, $\lambda$-symmetries and DPs, and obtain the basic quantities of the extended PS method (which are the null forms and the integrating factors). By making use of the extended PS method we find two independent first-order invariants, in such a way appropriate cosmological solutions from solving these invariants as a system of algebraic equations are simultaneously obtained. These solutions are wealthy so that they include many known special solutions, such as O'Hanlon-Tupper vacuum solutions, Nariai's solutions, Brans-Dicke dust solutions, inflationary solutions, and etc.</description>

      <title>Source Confusion from Neutron Star Binaries in Ground-Based Gravitational Wave Detectors is Minimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upgrades beyond the current second generation of ground-based gravitational wave detectors will allow them to observe tens of thousands neutron star and black hole binaries. Given the typical minute-to-hour duration of neutron star signals in the detector frequency band, a number of them will overlap in the time-frequency plane resulting in a nonzero cross-correlation. We examine source confusion arising from overlapping signals whose time-frequency tracks cross. Adopting the median observed merger rate of $100$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, each neutron star binary signal overlaps with an average of 42(4)[0.5] other signals when observed from 2(5)[10] Hz. The vast majority of overlaps occur at low frequencies where the inspiral evolution is slow: 91% of time-frequency overlaps occur in band below 5 Hz. The combined effect of overlapping signals does not satisfy the central limit theorem and source confusion cannot be treated as stationary, Gaussian noise: on average 0.91(0.17)[0.05] signals are present in a single adaptive time-frequency bin centered at 2(5)[10] Hz. We quantify source confusion under a realistic neutron star binary population and find that parameter uncertainty typically increases by less than 1% unless there are overlapping signals whose detector-frame chirp mass difference is $\lesssim 0.01 M_{\odot}$ and the overlap frequency is $\gtrsim$ 40 Hz. Out of $1\times10^6$ simulated signals, 0.14% fall within this region of detector-frame chirp mass differences, but their overlap frequencies are typically lower than 40 Hz. Source confusion for ground-based detectors, where events overlap instantaneously is significantly milder than the equivalent LISA problem, where many classes of events overlap for the lifetime of the mission.</description>

      <title>Forecasts for Constraining Lorentz-violating Damping of Gravitational Waves from Compact Binary Inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Violation of Lorentz symmetry can result in two distinct effects in the propagation of the gravitational waves (GWs). One is a modified dispersion relation and another is a frequency-dependent damping of GWs. While the former has been extensively studied in the literature, in this paper we concentrate on the frequency-dependent damping effect that arises from several specific Lorentz-violating theories, such as spatial covariant gravities, Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravities, etc. This Lorentz-violating damping effect changes the damping rate of GWs at different frequencies and leads to an amplitude correction to the GW waveform of compact binary inspiral systems. With this modified waveform, we then use the Fisher information matrix to investigate the prospects of constraining the Lorentz-violating damping effect with GW observations. We consider both ground-based and space-based GW detectors, including the advanced LIGO, Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer (CE), Taiji, TianQin, and LISA. Our results indicate that the ground-based detectors in general give tighter constraints than those from the space-based detectors. Among the considered three ground-based detectors, CE can give the tightest constraints on the Lorentz-violating damping effect, which improves the current constraint from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA events by about 8 times.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and bound states of massive scalar fields in wormhole spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we explore the propagation of massive scalar fields on some wormhole backgrounds. On one side, we consider the Bronnikov-Ellis wormhole solution and wormhole geometries with a non-constant redshift function by introducing a gravitational mass $M$, which goes over into the Bronnikov-Ellis wormhole when the gravitational mass parameter vanishes. We employ the continued fraction method to calculate accurately the quasinormal frequencies of massive scalar fields, particularly focusing on low values of the angular number, and we show an anomalous behaviour of the decay rate of the quasinormal frequencies, for $n \geq \ell$. Also, we show that for a massive scalar field and $M \neq 0$ the effective potential allows potential wells for some values of the parameters which support bound states, which are obtained using the continued fraction method and they are characterized by having only a frequency of oscillation and they do not decay; however, for the Bronnikov-Ellis wormhole the effective potential do not support bound states. On the other side, we consider a wormhole geometry which is an exact solution of $f(R)$ modified gravity. For this geometry the quasinormal frequencies can be obtained analytically, being the longest-lived modes the ones with lowest angular number $\ell$. So, in this wormhole background the anomalous behaviour is avoided.</description>

Abstract: Utilizing recent mathematical advances in proving stability of Minkowski spacetime with minimal decay rates and nonlinear stability of Kerr black holes with small angular momentum, we investigate the detailed asymptotic behaviors of gravitational waves generated in these spacetimes. Here we report and propose a new angular momentum memory effect along future null infinity. This accompanies Christodoulou's nonlinear displacement memory effect and the spin memory effect. The connections and differences to these effects are also addressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider interstellar light transmission facilitated by gravitational lensing. We study axially-symmetric lensing configurations where the transmitter, lens, and receiver are nearly aligned. With the transmitter positioned in the focal region of the lens, we investigate the caustic formed by a diffraction-limited beam of light emitted by the transmitter. We evaluated the impact of the lens's point spread function (PSF) on the received beam. We estimate the power delivered to a receiver at interstellar distances, evaluate the major noise sources, and determine the detection sensitivity in both the noise- and signal-dominated regimes. Considering realistic assumptions about the transmitter's performance, we explore signal detection strategies enhanced by the spatial broadening of the received beam, a result of the PSF from the transmitting lens. We find that detection of the lensed optical signals from nearby stars may be done relying on established optical engineering technologies. Furthermore, a network of astronomical facilities capable of observations in multiple narrow spectral bands will benefit the search. Our results support the feasibility of interstellar power transmission via gravitational lensing, directly contributing to the ongoing optical SETI efforts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of $f(R,L_m,T)$ gravity on the internal structure of compact stars, expecting this theory to manifest prominently in the high-density cores of such stars. In this study, we begin by considering the algebraic function $f(R,L_m,T) = R + \alpha T L_m$, where $\alpha$ represents the matter-geometry coupling constant. We specifically choose the matter Lagrangian density $L_m= -\rho$ to explore compact stars with anisotropic pressure. To this end, we employ the MIT bag model as an equation of state. We then numerically solve the hydrostatic equilibrium equations to obtain mass-radius relations for quark stars, examining static stability criteria, the adiabatic index, and the speed of sound. Finally, we use recent astrophysical data to constrain the coupling parameter $\alpha$, which may lead to either larger or smaller masses for quark stars compared to their counterparts in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Warp Drive Spacetimes with Warp Factory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of warp research has been dominated by analytical methods to investigate potential solutions. However, these approaches often favor simple metric forms that facilitate analysis but ultimately limit the range of exploration of novel solutions. So far the proposed solutions have been unphysical, requiring energy condition violations and large energy requirements. To overcome the analytical limitations in warp research, we introduce Warp Factory: a numerical toolkit designed for modeling warp drive spacetimes. By leveraging numerical analysis, Warp Factory enables the examination of general warp drive geometries by evaluating the Einstein field equations and computing energy conditions. Furthermore, this comprehensive toolkit provides the determination of metric scalars and insightful visualizations in both 2D and 3D, offering a deeper understanding of metrics and their corresponding stress-energy tensors. The paper delves into the methodology employed by Warp Factory in evaluating the physicality of warp drive spacetimes and highlights its application in assessing commonly modeled warp drive metrics. By leveraging the capabilities of Warp Factory, we aim to further warp drive research and hopefully bring us closer to realizing physically achievable warp drives.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the gravitational lensing by a Lorentz-violating (LV) black hole inspired by the recent contribution [1]. Explicitly, we concentrate on a specific application: we perform the computation of gravitational lensing effects under the strong field limit. In particular, we analytically derive the deflection angle so that the lens equation can also be addressed. This methodological approach yields physically measurable outcomes, including the determination of relativistic image positions and their corresponding magnifications. As an application of this methodology, we consider the gravitational lensing by Sagittarius A${}^*$ and obtain the corresponding observables expressed as functions of the LV parameter.</description>

Abstract: We study hairy black hole solutions in Einstein(--Maxwell)--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet theory. The scalar coupling function includes quadratic and quartic terms, so the gravitational action has a U(1) symmetry. We argued that when the effective mass of the scalar field is at the critical value, the non-hairy black holes transform into hairy black holes in a symmetry-broken vacuum via spontaneous symmetry breaking. These hairy black holes are stable under scalar perturbations, and the Goldstone bosons are trivial. Moreover, we found that the spontaneous symmetry breaking associated with local U(1) is unlikely to occur in this theory.</description>

      <title>A gravitational constant transition within cepheids as supernovae calibrators can solve the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local universe measurements of the Hubble constant (H0) using SNe Ia with Cepheids as calibrators yield a value of H0 which is in tension with the value inferred from the CMB and other higher redshift probes. In ref. [1], the authors proposed a rapid transition in the value of the effective Newtonian gravitational constant G in order to alleviate the Hubble tension. The transition point was chosen so as to only affect distance estimates to Hubble flow SNe. However, in this study, the authors made the assumption that SNe Ia peak luminosity $L$ increases with Chandrashekhar mass $M_c$. This hypothesis contradicts a previous semi-analytic study of SN light curves in the presence of G-transition [2] which found that $L\propto M_c^{-0.97}$. Motivated by the results of refs. [1] and [2], we propose a hypothesis of a sudden recent change in the effective G at an epoch which corresponds to a look-back distance between $\sim$ 7 - 80 Mpc. A transition in G at these distances would affect both our estimate of the distances to Cepheids in calibrator galaxies, as well as to the Hubble flow supernovae. Upon fitting the observational data to this hypothesis, we find three interesting results: (i) we find mild evidence for a G-transition at 22.4 Mpc (73 million years ago) which is preferred (using certain estimators) by the calibrator type Ia SNe data over no G-transition, (ii) the H0 parameter inferred under this hypothesis is in good agreement with the value obtained from the CMB for a 4% larger value of G at earlier times, thus potentially resolving the Hubble tension, (iii) we obtain a fit to the scaling relationship between SN peak luminosity $L$ and Chandrasekhar mass $M_c$, as $L\propto M_c^{-1.68 \pm 0.68}$, which is in good agreement with the prediction of the theoretical study of ref. [2]. We also discuss how other probes could be used to verify this transition in the value of G.</description>

      <title>The torsion of stellar streams and the overall shape of galactic gravity's source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat rotation curves v(r) are naturally explained by elongated (prolate) Dark Matter (DM) distributions, and we have provided competitive fits to the SPARC database. To further probe the geometry of the halo one needs out-of-plane observables. Stellar streams, poetically analogous to airplane contrails, but caused by tidal dispersion of massive substructures such as satellite dwarf galaxies, would lie on a plane should the DM-halo gravitational field be spherically symmetric. We aim at establishing stellar stream torsion, a local observable that measures the deviation from planarity in differential curve geometry. We perform small-scale simulations of tidally distorted star clusters to check that indeed a central force center produces negligible torsion. Turning to observational data, we identify among the known streams those that are at largest distance from the galactic center and likely not affected by the Magellanic clouds, as most promising for the study, and by means of polynomial fits we extract their differential torsion. We find that the torsion of the few known streams that should be sensitive to most of the Milky Way's DM Halo is much larger than expected for a central spherical bulb alone. This is consistent with non-sphericity of the halo. Future studies of stellar stream torsion with larger samples and further out of the galactic plane should be able to extract the ellipticity of the halo to see whether it is just a slight distortion of a spherical shape or rather ressembles a more elongated cigar.</description>

Abstract: Can new cosmic physics be uncovered through tensions amongst datasets? Tensions in parameter determinations amongst different types of cosmological observation, especially the `Hubble tension' between probes of the expansion rate, have been invoked as possible indicators of new physics, requiring extension of the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm to resolve. Within a fully Bayesian framework, we show that the standard tension metric gives only part of the updating of model probabilities, supplying a data co-dependence term that must be combined with the Bayes factors of individual datasets. This shows that, on its own, a reduction of dataset tension under an extension to $\Lambda$CDM is insufficient to demonstrate that the extended model is favoured. Any analysis that claims evidence for new physics {\it solely} on the basis of alleviating dataset tensions should be considered incomplete and suspect. We describe the implications of our results for the interpretation of the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Algebras and Hilbert spaces from gravitational path integrals: Understanding Ryu-Takayanagi/HRT as entropy without invoking holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works by Chandrasekaran, Penington, and Witten have shown in various special contexts that the quantum-corrected Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) entropy (or its covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) generalization) can be understood as computing an entropy on an algebra of bulk observables. These arguments do not rely on the existence of a holographic dual field theory. We show that analogous-but-stronger results hold in any UV-completion of asymptotically anti-de Sitter quantum gravity with a Euclidean path integral satisfying a simple and familiar set of axioms. We consider a quantum context in which a standard Lorentz-signature classical bulk limit would have Cauchy slices with asymptotic boundaries $B_L \sqcup B_R$ where both $B_L$ and $B_R$ are compact manifolds without boundary. Our main result is then that (the UV-completion of) the quantum gravity path integral defines type I von Neumann algebras ${\cal A}^{B_L}_L$, ${\cal A}^{B_R}_{R}$ of observables acting respectively at $B_L$, $B_R$ such that ${\cal A}^{B_L}_L$, ${\cal A}^{B_R}_{R}$ are commutants. The path integral also defines entropies on ${\cal A}^{B_L}_L, {\cal A}^{B_R}_R$. Positivity of the Hilbert space inner product then turns out to require the entropy of any projection operator to be quantized in the form $\ln N$ for some $N \in {\mathbb Z}^+$ (unless it is infinite). As a result, our entropies can be written in terms of standard density matrices and standard Hilbert space traces. Furthermore, in appropriate semiclassical limits our entropies are computed by the RT-formula with quantum corrections. Our work thus provides a Hilbert space interpretation of the RT entropy. Since our axioms do not severely constrain UV bulk structures, they may be expected to hold equally well for successful formulations of string field theory, spin-foam models, or any other approach to constructing a UV-complete theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Redshift Constraints on the Effective Theory of Interacting Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14425</link>

Abstract: Upcoming galaxy surveys provide the necessary sensitivity to measure gravitational redshift, a general relativistic effect that generates a dipole in galaxy clustering data when correlating two distinct populations of galaxies. Here, we study the constraining power of gravitational redshift within the framework of the effective theory of interacting dark energy. This formalism describes linear cosmological perturbations in scalar-tensor theories of gravity with a limited number of free functions, and allows each particle species to be coupled differently to the gravitational sector. In this work, we focus on Horndeski theories with a non-minimal coupling of dark matter to the scalar degree of freedom, yielding a breaking of the weak equivalence principle for this cosmic component, a scenario that is yet untested. We show that the dipole generated by gravitational redshift significantly breaks degeneracies and tightens the constraints on the parameters of the effective theory compared to the standard redshift-space distortion analysis solely based on the even multipoles in the galaxy correlation function, with an improvement of up to $\sim 50\%$ for populations with a galaxy bias difference equal to 1. We make the Python package EF-TIGRE (Effective Field Theory of Interacting dark energy with Gravitational REdshift) developed for this work publicly available.</description>

      <title>New construction of a charged dipole black ring by Harrison transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact solution for a non-BPS charged rotating black ring endowed with a dipole charge in the bosonic sector of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. Utilizing the electric Harrison transformation, we derive this solution by converting a five-dimensional vacuum solution into a charged solution within the realm of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. As the seed solution for the Harrison transformation, we use a vacuum solution of a rotating black ring possessing a Dirac-Misner string singularity. The resulting solution exhibits regularity, indicating the absence of curvature singularities, conical singularities, orbifold singularities, Dirac-Misner string singularities, and closed timelike curves both on and outside the horizon. This obtained solution carries mass, two angular momenta, an electric charge, and a dipole charge, with only three of these quantities being independent, similar to the charged rotating dipole black ring found previously by Elvang, Emparan and Figueras. However, aside from the vacuum case, these two solutions do not coincide. We discuss the difference between them in the phase space.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on 11-dimensional Superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>

      <title>Flows in the Space of Interacting Chiral Boson Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study interacting theories of $N$ left-moving and $\overline{N}$ right-moving Floreanini-Jackiw bosons in two dimensions. A parameterized family of such theories is shown to enjoy (non-manifest) Lorentz invariance if and only if its Lagrangian obeys a flow equation driven by a function of the energy-momentum tensor. We discuss the canonical quantization of such theories along classical stress tensor flows, focusing on the case of the root-$T \overline{T}$ deformation, where we obtain perturbative results for the deformed spectrum in a certain large-momentum limit. In the special case $N = \overline{N}$, we consider the quantum effective action for the root-$T \overline{T}$-deformed theory by expanding around a general classical background, and we find that the one-loop contribution vanishes for backgrounds with constant scalar gradients. Our analysis can also be interpreted via dual $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theories in three dimensions, which might be used to describe deformations of charged $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ black holes or quantum Hall systems.</description>

      <title>Cosmological singularities, holographic complexity and entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study holographic volume complexity for various families of holographic cosmologies with Kasner-like singularities, in particular with $AdS$, hyperscaling violating and Lifshitz asymptotics. We find through extensive numerical studies that the complexity surface always bends in the direction away from the singularity and transitions from spacelike near the boundary to lightlike in the interior. As the boundary anchoring time slice approaches the singularity, the transition to lightlike is more rapid, with the spacelike part shrinking. The complexity functional has vanishing contributions from the lightlike region so in the vicinity of the singularity, complexity is vanishingly small, indicating a dual Kasner state of vanishingly low complexity, suggesting an extreme thinning of the effective degrees of freedom dual to the near singularity region. We also develop further previous studies on extremal surfaces for holographic entanglement entropy, and find that in the IR limit they reveal similar behaviour as complexity.</description>
