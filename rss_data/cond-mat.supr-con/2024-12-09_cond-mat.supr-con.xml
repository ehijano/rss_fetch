      <title>Superconductor-Insulator Transition in Weakly Monitored Josephson Junction Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control and manipulation of quantum states by measurements and bath engineering in open quantum systems, and associated phenomena, such as measurement-induced phase transitions, have emerged as new paradigms in many-body physics. Here, taking a prototypical example of Josephson junction arrays (JJAs), we show how repetitive monitoring can transform an insulating state in these systems to a superconductor and vice versa. To this end, we study the effects of continuous weak measurements and feedback control on isolated JJAs in the absence of any external thermal bath. The monitoring due to combined effect of measurements and feedback, inducing non-unitary evolution and dissipation, leads to a long-time steady state characterized by an effective temperature in a suitably defined semiclassical limit. However, we show that the quantum dissipation due to monitoring has fundamental differences with equilibrium quantum and/or thermal dissipation in the well-studied case of JJAs in contact with an Ohmic bath. In particular, using a variational approximation, and by considering the semiclassical, strong measurement/feedback and weak-coupling limits, we demonstrate that this difference can give rise to re-entrant steady-state phase transitions, resulting in transition from an effective low-temperature insulating normal state to superconducting state at intermediate temperature. Our work emphasizes the role of quantum feedback, that acts as an additional knob to control the effective temperature of non-equilibrium steady state leading to a phase diagram, not explored in earlier works on monitored and open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous reduction-annealing effects on the electron-doped cuprate superconductor revealed by micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of the protect-annealing method has extended the superconductivity of the electron-doped cuprate \PLCCO ~(PLCCO) into lower Ce concentrations, while the superconducting volume fraction decreases with underdoping. Employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a micro-focused beam, we investigated the electronic structure of protect-annealed PLCCO ($x=0.08$) with small superconducting volume fraction. Significant spatial variation of Fermi surface area and shape was observed, suggesting inhomogeneity in electron concentrations and the pseudogap that competes with superconductivity. By performing measurements at dozens of different sample positions, negative and non-monotonic correlation was found between the electron concentration and pseudogap magnitude. The established correlation illustrates a systematic annealing dependence of the electronic structure where a pseudogap abruptly opens with insufficient oxygen reduction.</description>

      <title>Two-photon coupling via Josephson element I: Breaking the symmetry with magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a coupling element based on a symmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and show that it mediates a two-photon interaction. This and other inductive interactions can be switched off in situ. We derive the system Hamiltonian for coupled resonator and rf SQUID. The rf SQUID dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of energy states and acts as an artificial atom. We discuss how the Josephson symmetry breaks owing to magnetic fields in the superconducting loops. We assess that the two-photon coupling strength reaches 18 MHz which can exceed the single-photon capacitive interaction in the coupler.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory magnetic field-dependent critical temperatures of ultraclean Type-II superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of the Zeeman energy and the Landau levels (LLs) arising from an applied magnetic field ${\bf B}$ upon the critical temperature $T_c$ is studied using a fully quantum mechanical method within the framework of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity that forms from an ultraclean metal. As in semiclassical treatments, we found that two electrons can form Cooper pairs with opposite spins and momenta in the ${\bf B}$ direction while either in the same or in neighboring LLs. However, the fully quantum mechanical treatment of the LLs causes $T_c({\bf B})$ for electrons paired on the same LL to oscillate about the critical temperature of the BCS theory, similar to that of the de Haas-van Alphen effect. The Zeeman energy causes $T_c({\bf B})$ to decrease in an oscillatory fashion with increasing ${\bf B}$ for electrons paired either on the same or on neighboring LLs. For the Zeeman $g &gt; 1$, pairing on neighboring LLs results in the highest $T_c({\bf B})$. For $g &lt; 1$, pairing on the same LLs gives the highest $T_c({\bf B})$. In addition, $T_c({\bf B})$ for electrons paired on neighboring LLs exhibits an apparent symmetry around $g=2$, as the oscillatory critical temperature behaviors are nearly identical for $g=2\pm\delta$.</description>

      <title>Multi-quanta Abrikosov vortices as the micro spin batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of our paper is to study the multi-quanta Abrikosov vortices injected into a superconductor layer by the twisted light impulses. We predict that the condensate circulating around the core of a multi-quanta vortex may differ in nature from that of the bulk superconductor. Special attention is paid to possibility of appearance of the quasi angular momentum of Cooper pairs and its compensation via their recombination to the fermion quartets. We show potential applications of the multi-quanta vortices as massive memories as well as spin, angular momentum and energy batteries. Finally, we predict the emergence of half-quantum multi-quanta Josephson vortices under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Artificial topological insulator realized in a two-terminal Josephson junction with Rashba spin-orbit interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two-terminal Josephson junction with conventional superconductors and a normal region with Rashba spin-orbit interaction, characterized by two Aharonov-Casher (AC) fluxes. When the superconducting phase difference equals $\pi$, the Andreev subgap spectrum may host zero-energy Weyl singularities associated with a vanishing normal-state reflection eigenvalue. With one of the AC fluxes playing the role of a quasimomentum, the junction can be viewed as an artificial one-dimensional chiral topological insulator. Its topological phase can be tuned by crossing a Weyl singularity by means of varying the remaining AC flux. By associating an additional component of the quasimomentum with the superconducting phase difference, an artificial Chern insulator is realized.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Superconducting Magnetoelectric Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18616v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supercurrent flow can induce a nonvanishing spin magnetization in noncentrosymmetric superconductors with spin-orbit interaction. Often known as the non-dissipative magnetoelectric effect, these are most commonly found at linear order in supercurrent flow. Here, we propose that a {\it nonlinear} superconducting magnetoelectric (NSM) effect can naturally manifest in magnet/superconductor heterostructures. In such platforms, NSM manifests as the spin polarization generated as a second-order response to a driving supercurrent. Strikingly, we find NSM survives centrosymmetry and is the leading order magnetic response in a variety of magnetic materials that include both collinear magnets [e.g., $d$-wave planar altermagnet thin film/superconductor (ALM/SC)] as well as noncollinear magnets (e.g., Kagome/SC systems). This renders NSM a powerful electric and non-dissipative means of controlling magnetization in magnet/superconductor heterostructures, a promising platform for superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Temperature evolution of the Fermi surface of the FeSe monolayer on SrTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of superconductivity in the FeSe monolayer on SrTiO$_3$ remains one of the unresolved mysteries in condensed-matter physics. Here by investigation of the temperature evolution of the dynamic charge response of FeSe/SrTiO$_3$ we infer that the response of the monolayer itself is nearly temperature independent. This indicates a constant Fermi surface over a wide range of temperature, in stark contrast to that of the bulk FeSe and other Fe-based superconductors. Our results, which manifest the peculiarity of the electronic structure of the FeSe monolayer, may help for a microscopic understanding of the superconductivity in Fe-chalcogenide monolayers on oxide surfaces in general.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quasiparticle Relaxation in a Superconductor via the Proximity Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiparticle relaxation in pure superconductors is thought to be determined by the intrinsic inelastic scattering rate in the material. In certain applications, i.e. superconducting qubits and circuits, excess quasiparticles exist at densities far beyond the thermal equilibrium level, potentially leading to dephasing and energy loss. In order to engineer superconductors with shorter overall quasiparticle lifetimes, we consider the impact of a proximity layer on the transport of quasiparticles in a superconductor. We find that a normal metal layer can be used to significantly increase the relaxation rate of quasiparticles in a superconductor, as seen by a large reduction in the quasiparticle charge imbalance in a fully proximitized Cu/Al bilayer wire. The mechanism for this effect may be useful for preventing quasiparticle poisoning of qubits using carefully chosen proximity bilayers consisting of clean superconductors and disordered normal metals.</description>

      <title>Magnetically-controlled Vortex Dynamics in a Ferromagnetic Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic superconductors are exceptionally rare because the strong ferromagnetic exchange field usually destroys singlet superconductivity. EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$, an iron-based superconductor with a maximum critical temperature of $\sim$25 K, is a unique material that exhibits full coexistence with ferromagnetic order below $T_\mathrm{FM} \approx 19$ K. The interplay between the two leads to a narrowing of ferromagnetic domains at higher temperatures and the spontaneous nucleation of vortices/antivortices at lower temperatures. Here we demonstrate how the underlying magnetic structure directly controls the superconducting vortex dynamics in applied magnetic fields. Just below $T_\mathrm{FM}$ we observe a pronounced temperature-dependent peak in both the coercivity and the creep activation energy, the latter becoming rapidly suppressed in large applied magnetic fields. We attribute this behaviour to the formation of vortex polarons arising from the unique interaction between free vortices and magnetic stripe domains. We present a theoretical description of the properties of vortex polarons that explains our main observations, showing how they lead to vortex trapping and an attractive vortex-vortex interaction at short distances. In stark contrast, strong magnetic irreversibility at low temperatures is linked to a critical current governed by giant flux creep over an activation barrier for vortex-antivortex annihilation near domain walls. Our work reveals unexplored new routes for the magnetic enhancement of vortex pinning with particularly important applications in high-current conductors for operation at high magnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15553v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In superconductors that lack inversion symmetry, a supercurrent flow can lead to nondissipative magnetoelectric effects. We offer a straightforward formalism to obtain a supercurrent-induced magnetization in superconductors with broken inversion symmetry, which may have orbital, layer, sublattice, or valley degrees of freedom, multiband noncentrosymmetric superconductors. The nondissipative magnetoelectric effect may find applications in fabricating quantum computation platforms or efficient superconducting spintronic devices. We explore how the current-induced magnetization can be employed to create and manipulate Majorana zero modes in a simple hybrid structure.</description>
