      <title>Casimir Forces Across Magnetic Plasmas at Nuclear Separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory and numerical findings are presented on the magnetic Casimir interaction that arises from vacuum fluctuations of the quantized field and its effects at the nuclear scale. We investigate how the zero-temperature Casimir effect at nuclear scales can generate the black-body temperatures required to induce a magnetic electron-positron plasma. The magnetic permeability of the plasma and any magnetic fields present influence the screened Casimir-Yukawa potentials between perfect conducting surfaces. We discuss implications for the magnetic Casimir-Yukawa potential, its screening length, and a magnetic permeability-dependent quantity that resembles the meson mass.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Structure-Based Virtual Drug Screening Using Classical Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure-based virtual screening must address a combinatorial explosion arising from up to 10^60 drug-like molecules, multiple conformations of proteins and ligands, and all possible spatial translations and rotations of ligands within the binding pocket. Although these calculations are inherently parallelizable, their sheer volume remains prohibitive for classical CPU/GPU resources. Quantum computing offers a promising solution: by using n qubits to compute the binding energy of a single protein-ligand pair and m additional qubits to encode different configurations, the algorithm can simultaneously evaluate 2^m combinations in a single quantum execution. To realize this potential, we propose a quantum algorithm that integrates classical force field models to compute electrostatic and van der Waals interactions on discretized grid points. Binding energy calculations are reformulated as matrix-based inner products, while ligand translations and rotations are encoded using unitary operations. This approach circumvents explicit distance calculations and provides a scalable, quantum-enhanced framework for efficient and high-dimensional binding energy estimation in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Fermion Doubling in Quantum Cellular Automaton Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA) is essentially an operator driving the evolution of particles on a lattice, through local unitaries. Because $\Delta_x=\Delta_t=\varepsilon$, QCA constitute a privileged framework to cast the digital quantum simulation of relativistic quantum particles, e.g. $(3+1)$-QED. But before they can be adopted, simulation schemes for high energy physics need prove themselves against specific numerical issues -- of which the most infamous in Fermion Doubling (FD). FD is well-understood in the discrete-space continuous-time setting of Lattice Gauge Theories as the appearance of spurious solutions for all $\Delta_x=\varepsilon\neq 0$. We rigorously extend its analysis to discrete-space discrete-time. We demonstrate the existence of FD issues in QCA. By applying a covering map on the Brillouin zone, we provide a flavouring-without-staggering way of fixing FD that does not break linearity nor the chiral symmetry. We explain how this method coexists with Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem, and illustrate this with a neutrino-like QCA.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism Indistinguishability Relations induced by Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homomorphism indistinguishability is a way of characterising many natural equivalence relations on graphs. Two graphs $G$ and $H$ are called homomorphism indistinguishable over a graph class $\mathcal{F}$ if for each $F \in \mathcal{F}$, the number of homomorphisms from $F$ to $G$ equals the number of homomorphisms from $F$ to $H$. Examples of such equivalence relations include isomorphism and cospectrality, as well as equivalence with respect to many formal logics. Quantum groups are a generalisation of topological groups that describe "non-commutative symmetries" and, inter alia, have applications in quantum information theory. An important subclass are the easy quantum groups, which enjoy a combinatorial characterisation and have been fully classified by Raum and Weber. A recent connection between these seemingly distant concepts was made by Man\v{c}inska and Roberson, who showed that quantum isomorphism, a relaxation of classical isomorphism that can be phrased in terms of the quantum symmetric group, is equivalent to homomorphism indistinguishability over the class of planar graphs. We generalise Man\v{c}inska and Roberson's result to all orthogonal easy quantum groups. We obtain for each orthogonal easy quantum group a graph isomorphism relaxation $\approx$ and a graph class $\mathcal{F}$, such that homomorphism indistinguishability over $\mathcal{F}$ coincides with $\approx$. Our results include a full classification of the $(0, 0)$-intertwiners of the graph-theoretic quantum group obtained by adding the adjacency matrix of a graph to the intertwiners of an orthogonal easy quantum group.</description>

      <title>Orchestrating Multi-Zone Shuttling in Trapped-Ion Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped-ion quantum computers are a promising platform, offering high-quality qubits with long coherence times and high-fidelity gate operations. The Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) architecture provides a scalable blueprint by leveraging the ability to shuttle ions between distinct zones. However, realizing such architectures in practice requires software support to manage ion movement across multi-zone layouts. In this work, we propose a compilation strategy for QCCD architectures with multiple processing zones located outside a grid-type memory zone. Unlike previous approaches that treat processing zones as black-boxes, our method explicitly models their structural constraints, enabling optimized ion movement to and through them. It combines qubit partitioning with dependency-aware gate selection to reduce inter-zone shuttling while enabling simultaneous gate execution. We implemented the method in an open-source tool and empirically demonstrated its effectiveness across several QCCD layouts, laying a foundation for the compilation of multi-zone trapped-ion systems.</description>

      <title>Evidence that the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm Optimizes the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model Efficiently in the Average Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model serves as a foundational framework for understanding disordered systems. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum optimization algorithm whose performance monotonically improves with its depth $p$. We analyze QAOA applied to the SK model in the infinite-size limit and provide numerical evidence that it obtains a $(1-\epsilon)$ approximation to the optimal energy with circuit depth $\mathcal{O}(n/\epsilon^{1.13})$ in the average case. Our results are enabled by mapping the task of evaluating QAOA energy onto the task of simulating a spin-boson system, which we perform with modest cost using matrix product states. We optimize QAOA parameters and observe that QAOA achieves $\varepsilon\lesssim2.2\%$ at $p=160$ in the infinite-size limit. We then use these optimized QAOA parameters to evaluate the QAOA energy for finite-sized instances with up to $30$ qubits and find convergence to the ground state consistent with the infinite-size limit prediction. Our results provide strong numerical evidence that QAOA can efficiently approximate the ground state of the SK model in the average case.</description>

      <title>Quantum Keyless Private Communication under intense background noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution relies on quantum mechanics to securely distribute cryptographic keys, offering security but necessitating complex infrastructure and significant resources for practical implementation. Quantum keyless private communication ensures information-theoretic security in free-space communication, with simpler setups, and without the need for secret keys by leveraging the wiretap channel model. Here we propose a variant of quantum keyless private communication using polarization encoding and experimentally validate both the original on-off keying method and the polarization-multiplexed approach using time-multiplexed threshold single-photon detectors as photon counting detectors. Our analysis highlights the advantages of polarization-multiplexed schemes for daylight operation. This work paves the way towards practical and scalable quantum communication systems, with potential applications extending to space-based communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantitative relationship between operator spreading and classical information propagation in quantum systems. Focusing on a bi-partite quantum channel, we derive new upper and lower bounds on the Holevo capacity, a typical information measure, in terms of the trace norm distance between output states, sharpening earlier results by Bravyi \textit{et al}. Our results clarify the extent to which operator growth governs information flow.</description>

      <title>Physically motivated extrapolation for quantum error mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation techniques are essential for the current NISQ and emerging Megaquop-era machines, which, despite their noise, are capable of performing utility-scale quantum computations. However, most QEM methods incur exponential sampling overhead to achieve unbiased estimates, limiting their practical applicability. Recently, it was shown that by using error mitigation by restricted evolution (EMRE), expectation values of a physical observable can be obtained in constant sampling overhead at the cost of a non-zero bias, which grows as the circuit size or hardware noise increases. To overcome this problem, we introduce the Physics-Inspired Extrapolation (PIE) method, built upon the EMRE framework, to achieve enhanced accuracy and robustness. Unlike traditional zero-noise extrapolation, our method assigns operational interpretation to the parameters in the extrapolation function used in PIE. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method on IBMQ hardware and apply it to simulate 84-qubit quantum dynamics efficiently. Our technique yields accurate results with significantly smaller variance, establishing PIE as a practical and scalable error mitigation strategy for near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Optimizing quantum battery performance by reducing battery influence in charging dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries have emerged as promising devices that work within the quantum regime and provide energy storage and power delivery. We investigate the interplay between the battery and charger Hamiltonians, with a particular focus on minimizing the battery s influence during the charging dynamics. To achieve this, we introduce a control parameter that allows us to suppress the battery s contribution during the charging dynamics. We explore various configurations, including a non-interacting many-body battery with an interacting many-body charger, an interacting battery with a non-interacting charger, and systems where both the battery and charger are interacting many-body systems. Our results reveal a notable enhancement in stored energy and charging power when the battery s influence is suppressed, underscoring the pivotal role of the charger in optimizing performance. Remarkably, across all scenarios, we observe that the presence of the battery s countereffect within the charger Hamiltonian consistently leads to improved storage characteristics, highlighting a fresh direction in designing efficient quantum batteries</description>

      <title>QubitLens: An Interactive Learning Tool for Quantum State Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a fundamental task in quantum computing, involving the reconstruction of an unknown quantum state from measurement outcomes. Although essential, it is typically introduced at the graduate level due to its reliance on advanced concepts such as the density matrix formalism, tensor product structures, and partial trace operations. This complexity often creates a barrier for students and early learners. In this work, we introduce QubitLens, an interactive visualization tool designed to make quantum state tomography more accessible and intuitive. QubitLens leverages maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), a classical statistical method, to estimate pure quantum states from projective measurement outcomes in the X, Y, and Z bases. The tool emphasizes conceptual clarity through visual representations, including Bloch sphere plots of true and reconstructed qubit states, bar charts comparing parameter estimates, and fidelity gauges that quantify reconstruction accuracy. QubitLens offers a hands-on approach to learning quantum tomography without requiring deep prior knowledge of density matrices or optimization theory. The tool supports both single- and multi-qubit systems and is intended to bridge the gap between theory and practice in quantum computing education.</description>

      <title>Process Tomography for Clifford Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for performing quantum process tomography on an unknown $n$-qubit unitary $C$ from the Clifford group. Our algorithm uses Bell basis measurements to deterministically learn $C$ with $4n + 3$ queries, which is the asymptotically optimal query complexity. In contrast to previous algorithms that required access to $C^\dagger$ to achieve optimal query complexity, our algorithm achieves the same performance without querying $C^\dagger$. Additionally, we show the algorithm is robust to perturbations and can efficiently learn the closest Clifford to an unknown non-Clifford unitary $U$ using query overhead that is logarithmic in the number of qubits.</description>

      <title>QUEST: QUantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ``Windbreaking-as-a-Service'' (WaaS) as an innovative approach to shared transportation in which larger ``windbreaker'' vehicles provide aerodynamic shelter for ``windsurfer'' vehicles, thereby reducing drag and fuel consumption. As a computational framework to solve the large-scale matching and assignment problems that arise in WaaS, we present \textbf{QUEST} (Quantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation). Specifically, we formulate the pairing of windbreakers and windsurfers -- subject to timing, speed, and vehicle-class constraints -- as a mixed-integer quadratic problem (MIQP). Focusing on a single-segment prototype, we verify the solution classically via the Hungarian Algorithm, a Gurobi-based solver, and brute-force enumeration of binary vectors. We then encode the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and map it to an Ising Hamiltonian, enabling the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and other quantum and classical annealing technologies. Our quantum implementation successfully recovers the optimal assignment identified by the classical methods, confirming the soundness of the QUEST pipeline for a controlled prototype. While QAOA and other quantum heuristics do not guarantee a resolution of the fundamental complexity barriers, this study illustrates how the WaaS problem can be systematically translated into a quantum-ready model. It also lays the groundwork for addressing multi-segment scenarios and potentially leveraging quantum advantage for large-scale shared-transportation instances.</description>

      <title>Building a global quantum internet using a satellite constellation with inter-satellite links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum internet is a global network to distribute entanglement and communicate quantum information with applications in cybersecurity, quantum computing, and quantum sensing. Here, we propose building a quantum internet using a constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites equipped with inter-satellite laser links. Our proposal is based on the downlink model of photon transmission, where satellites carry entangled photon sources and/or have a mirror relay system to redirect the photon path in space. We show that few MHz entanglement distribution rates are possible between the US, Europe, and Asia, with a multiplexed entangled-photon source generating pairs at 10 GHz. Our proposal demonstrates the importance of passive optics in realizing a satellite-based quantum internet, which reduces dependency on quantum memory and repeater technologies.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlation scheme for quantum optical coherence tomography based on Michelson interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optical coherence tomography (QOCT) offers a simple way to cancel dispersion broadening in a sample while also providing twice the resolution compared to classical OCT. However, to achieve these advantages, a bright and broadband source of entangled photon pairs is required. A simple implementation uses collinear spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a Michelson interferometer (MI), yet this autocorrelation scheme suffers from parasitic terms and sensitivity to phase noise. Here, we introduce a cross-correlation MI-based QOCT that overcomes these drawbacks, significantly advancing QOCT toward practical applications.</description>

      <title>Recovery dynamics of a gap-engineered transmon after a quasiparticle burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionizing radiation impacts create bursts of quasiparticle density in superconducting qubits. These bursts severely degrade qubit coherence for a prolonged period of time and can be detrimental for quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally resolve quasiparticle bursts in 3D gap-engineered transmon qubits by continuously monitoring qubit transitions. Gap engineering allowed us to reduce the burst detection rate by a factor of a few. This modest reduction falls several orders of magnitude short of the reduction expected if the quasiparticles quickly thermalize to the cryostat temperature. We associate the limited effect of gap engineering with the slow thermalization of the phonons in our chips after the burst.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in ultrastrongly light-matter coupled system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a scheme for engineering quantum entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering with Gaussian measurements based on the quantum Hopfield model that incorporates a common thermal reservoir. We begin by examining quantum correlations, specifically quantum entanglement and EPR steering, in the ground state. These quantum correlations primarily stem from squeezing interactions in weak and normal strong coupling regimes. As the coupling strength increases, especially upon entering the ultrastrong coupling regime, the correlations emerge from the combined effect of squeezing and mix-mode interactions. Importantly, this scenario enables the realization of two-way EPR steering. Moreover, lower optical frequencies enhance both quantum entanglement and EPR steering. Further, when considering thermal effects, the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes, paired with lower optical frequencies, lead to improved entanglement. The one-way EPR steering for resonant case can be effectively controlled in the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes which originates from the asymmetry of subsystem and reservoir coupling induced by the diamagnetic term. Additionally, one-way EPR steering can also be produced for nonresonant case. In this case, the asymmetry of the subsystem and reservoir originates from the combined effect of nonresonant frequencies and diamagnetic term. Our findings have the potential to inspire further research into quantum information processing that leverages light-matter entanglement and EPR steering.</description>

      <title>Saturation of the Cram\'er-Rao Bound for the Atomic Resonance Frequency with Phased Array of Hyperbolic Secant Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise estimation of the atomic resonance frequency is fundamental for the characterization and control of quantum systems. The resonance experiment is a standard method for this measurement, wherein the drive field frequency is swept to invert the system population. We analyze the classical and quantum Fisher information for the resonance experiment driven by hyperbolic secant shaped $\pi$-pulses; setting a fundamental limit on the precision obtainable using the resonance method. We show that measurements using sequences of pulses with alternating phases globally saturates the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound, achieving the theoretical limit of precision for atomic resonance frequency estimation.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Fermionic System Simulation on Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A potential approach for demonstrating quantum advantage is using quantum computers to simulate fermionic systems. Quantum algorithms for fermionic system simulation usually involve the Hamiltonian evolution and measurements. However, in the second quantization representation, the number of terms in many fermion-system Hamiltonians, such as molecular Hamiltonians, is substantial, approximately $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$, where $N$ is the number of molecular orbitals. Due to this, the computational resources required for Hamiltonian evolution and expectation value measurements could be excessively large. To address this, we introduce a grouping strategy that partitions these $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ Hamiltonian terms into $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ groups, with the terms in each group mutually commuting. Based on this grouping method, we propose a parallel Hamiltonian evolution scheme that reduces the circuit depth of Hamiltonian evolution by a factor of $N$. Moreover, our grouping measurement strategy reduces the number of measurements needed to $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, whereas the current best grouping measurement schemes require $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ measurements. Additionally, we find that measuring the expectation value of a group of Hamiltonian terms requires fewer repetitions than measuring a single term individually, thereby reducing the number of quantum circuit executions. Our approach saves a factor of $N^3$ in the overall time for Hamiltonian evolution and measurements, significantly decreasing the time required for quantum computers to simulate fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Bang-bang preparation of a quantum many-body ground state in a finite lattice: optimization of the algorithm with a tensor network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bang-bang (BB) algorithm prepares the ground state of a lattice quantum many-body Hamiltonian $H=H_1+H_2$ by evolving an initial product state alternating between $H_1$ and $H_2$. We optimize the algorithm with tensor networks in one and two dimensions. The optimization has two stages. In stage one, a shallow translationally-invariant circuit is optimized in an infinite lattice. In stage two, the infinite-lattice gate sequence is used as a starting point for a finite lattice where it remains optimal in the bulk. The prepared state requires optimization only at its boundary, within a healing length from lattice edges, and the gate sequence needs to be modified only within the causal cone of the boundary. We test the procedure in the 1D and 2D quantum Ising model near its quantum critical point employing, respectively, the matrix product state (MPS) and the pair-entangled projected state (PEPS). At the boundary already the infinite-lattice sequence turns out to provide a more accurate state than in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Quantum Time Crystal Clock and its Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding different aspects of time is at the core of many areas in theoretical physics. Minimal models of continuous stochastic and quantum clocks have been proposed to explore fundamental limitations on the performance of timekeeping devices. Owing to the level of complexity in the clock structure and its energy consumption, such devices show trade-offs whose characterization remains an open challenge. Indeed, even conceptual designs for thermodynamically efficient quantum clocks are not yet well understood. In condensed matter theory, time-crystals were found as an exciting new phase of matter, featuring oscillations in (pseudo)-equilibrium with first experimental observations appearing recently. This naturally prompts the question: \textit{can time crystals be used as quantum clocks and what is their performance from a thermodynamic perspective?} We answer this question and find that quantum crystals are indeed genuine quantum clocks with a performance enhanced by the spontaneous breaking of time-translation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum metrology of hopping strength in a one-dimensional electronic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron hopping between the two sites in a lattice is of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics. Precise control of the hopping strength allows for the prospect of manipulating the properties of electronic materials, such as topological properties, superconductivity, etc. In this framework, measuring the hopping strength of an electronic lattice with high precision is perhaps the most relevant step in controlling the properties of electronic materials. Here, we design a critical quantum metrological protocol to measure the hopping strength in a cavity electronic chain coupling system featuring a pseudo-superradiant phase transition. We show that the cavity ground state, which is initially a squeezed vacuum state, can be utilized as a quantum probe to achieve a high quantum precision of the hopping strength, which can be optimally saturated in either the loss or lossless case. Remarkably, in the presence of chain loss, we find that increasing the electron current in the chain is beneficial for enhancing precision, and the arbitrarily large precision could be obtained by increasing the chain size, in principle. Our results provide an effective method to measure the hopping strength in the electronic chain with high precision, so it has potential applications in critical quantum metrology, condensed matter physics, etc.</description>

      <title>Multireference error mitigation for quantum computation of chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) strategies are essential for improving the precision and reliability of quantum chemistry algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Reference-state error mitigation (REM) is a cost-effective chemistry-inspired QEM method that performs exceptionally well for weakly correlated problems. However, the effectiveness of REM is often limited when applied to strongly correlated systems. Here, we introduce multireference-state error mitigation (MREM), an extension of REM that systematically captures quantum hardware noise in strongly correlated ground states by utilizing multireference states. A pivotal aspect of MREM is using Givens rotations to efficiently construct quantum circuits to generate multireference states. To strike a balance between circuit expressivity and noise sensitivity, we employ compact wavefunctions composed a few dominant Slater determinants. These truncated multireference states, engineered to exhibit substantial overlap with the target ground state, can effectively enhance error mitigation in variational quantum eigensolver experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MREM through comprehensive simulations of molecular systems $\mathrm{H_2O, ~N_2, ~and ~F_2}$, underscoring its ability to realize significant improvements in computational accuracy compared to the original REM method. MREM broadens the scope of error mitigation to encompass a wider variety of molecular systems, including those exhibiting pronounced electron correlation.</description>

      <title>Quantum computational speedup and retrocausality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Involving only the measurements of commuting observables (the setting and the corresponding solution of the problem), quantum algorithms should be subject to classical logic. Under this assumption, their customary quantum description can be flunked by a classical logic description. This creates a new perspective under which to see them. The classical logic description of an optimal quantum algorithm shows that the sheer existence of its quantum speedup logically implies the mutually exclusive or of causal loops. In each of them, it is as if the problem-solver knew in advance, before beginning her problem-solving action, one of the possible halves of the information that specifies the solution of the problem she will produce and measure in the future. Then, she can use this knowledge in the best logical way to produce the solution with exactly the number of computation steps of the optimal quantum algorithm. Since the quantum and classical logic descriptions of the quantum algorithm must go along, this tells us that their customary quantum description, which says nothing of the sort, must be incomplete. It is indeed completed by time-symmetrizing it. This leaves the unitary part of the customary quantum description mathematically unaltered but changes the description of the behavior of causality along it. Its single causal process is replaced by the quantum superposition of the causal loops whose mutually exclusive or is logically implied by the sheer existence of the quantum speedup.</description>

      <title>On the first quantization and quantum diversity of photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum theory of photons based on the first quantization technique, similar to that used by Schroedinger in the formulation of quantum mechanics, is considered. First, scalar quantum mechanics of photons operating with the photon wave functions is discussed. Using the first quantization, the wave equation, the Schroedinger-like equations, and the Dirac equation for photons are derived. Then, vector quantum mechanics of photons is introduced, which defines the electromagnetic vector fields. Using the first quantization, the Maxwell equations for photons in magneto-dielectric medium are obtained. Since the photon electric and magnetic fields satisfy the Maxwell equations, all what is known about the classical optical fields can be directly transferred to photons demonstrating their quantum diversity. Relationships between the scalar and vector quantum mechanics of photons and between the Dirac and Maxwell equations are analyzed. To describe the propagation of photons in dispersive media novel equations are introduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of qubit channels is known since 2002. However, that of rebit channels has never been studied so far, maybe because of the scarcity of concrete rebit examples. In this paper we point out that the strategy used to classify qubit channels cannot be pursued in the rebit case and we propose an alternative which allows us to complete the rebit channel classification. This mathematical result has not only a purely abstract interest: as we shall briefly mention, it may have applications in the analysis of local properties and temporal evolution of real quantum systems and also in a recent color vision model based on quantum information.</description>

      <title>An effcient variational quantum Korkin-Zolotarev algorithm for solving shortest vector problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noisy intermediate-scale quantum cryptanalysis focuses on the capability of near-term quantum devices to solve the mathematical problems underlying cryptography, and serves as a cornerstone for the design of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. For the shortest vector problem (SVP), which is one of the computationally hard problems in lattice-based cryptography, existing near-term quantum cryptanalysis algorithms map the problem onto a fully-connected quantum Ising Hamiltonian, and obtain the solution by optimizing for the first excited state. However, as the quantum system scales with the problem size, determining the first excited state becomes intractable due to the exponentially increased complexity for large-scale SVP instances. In this paper, we propose a variational quantum Korkin-Zolotarev (VQKZ) algorithm, which significantly reduces the qubit requirement for solving the SVP. Specifically, by transforming the original SVP into a series of subproblems on projected sublattices, the proposed VQKZ algorithm enables near-term quantum devices to solve SVP instances with lattice dimensions 61.39% larger than those solvable by previous methods. Furthermore, numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed VQKZ algorithm can significantly outperform existing methods in terms of the length of solution vectors.</description>

      <title>Engineering long-range and multi-body interactions via global kinetic constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range and multi-body interactions are crucial for quantum simulation and quantum computation. Yet, their practical realization using elementary pairwise interactions remains an outstanding challenge. We propose an experimental scheme based on the Bose-Hubbard system with a periodic driving of the on-site energy and global-range density-density interactions, a setup readily implementable via cold atoms in optical lattices with cavity-mediated interactions. Optimally chosen driving parameters can induce global kinetic constraints, where tunneling rates are selectively suppressed depending on the particle number imbalance between all even and odd sites. This mechanism, together with the flexible tunability of local tunneling rates, provides efficient implementation schemes of a family of global controlled gates for quantum computation. We illustrate this scheme for the $N$-qubit Toffoli gate, circumventing the need for a two-body gate decomposition, and elaborate on the efficient preparation of entangled many-body states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose schemes to extract arbitrary graph states from two-dimensional cluster states by locally manipulating the qubits solely via single-qubit measurements. We introduce graph state manipulation tools that allow one to increase the local vertex degree and to merge subgraphs. We utilize these tools together with the previously introduced zipper scheme that generates multiple edges between distant vertices to extract the desired graph state from a two-dimensional cluster state. We show how to minimize overheads by avoiding multiple edges, and compare with a local manipulation strategy based on measurement-based quantum computation together with transport. These schemes have direct applications in entanglement-based quantum networks, sensor networks, and distributed quantum computing in general.</description>

      <title>Improved delta-kick cooling with multiple non-ideal kicks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delta-kick cooling is a technique employed to achieve low kinetic temperatures by decreasing momentum width at the cost of increased position width. In an ideal implementation, this method uses a harmonic potential to deliver a single near-instantaneous momentum kick. In practice, potentials that are approximately harmonic near their center are commonly used. As a result, the breakdown of the harmonic approximation far from the center limits the cooling performance. Inspired by aberration cancellation in optics, we propose to use compound matter-wave lens systems for $\delta-$kick cooling with Gaussian potentials. By strategically combining attractive and repulsive kicks, we show that it is possible to mimic the effect of a harmonic potential. For a test case with reasonable experimental parameters, our method suggests a reduction in kinetic temperature by a factor of $2.5$ using a 2-pulse sequence and by a factor of $3.2$ using a 3-pulse sequence.</description>

Abstract: We present the results of an industry-grade fabrication of superconducting qubits on 200 mm wafers utilizing CMOS-established processing methods. By automated waferprober resistance measurements at room temperature, we demonstrate a Josephson junction fabrication yield of 99.7% (shorts and opens) across more than 10000 junctions and a qubit frequency prediction accuracy of 1.6%. In cryogenic characterization, we provide statistical results regarding energy relaxation times of the qubits with a median T1 of up to 100 us and individual devices consistently approaching 200 us in long-term measurements. This represents the best performance reported so far for superconducting qubits fabricated by industry-grade, wafer-level subtractive processes.</description>

      <title>Landau levels in a time-dependent magnetic field: the Madelung fluid perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to revisit a fundamental quantum problem, namely the evolution of an electron's wave function under a time-dependent magnetic field, with the dual perspective of the Madelung fluid. First we present an analysis of the problem in a quantum mechanistic fashion, based on a perturbation theory of the Landau levels, and next address the same problem with the Madelung equations. We show that the latter formulation does not only provide an intuitive derivation of the solution, but it also allows us to understand the diabatic character of quantum evolution in terms of mechanical energy transfers. The sloshing oscillations of the wave function can be then interpreted as the consequence of deviations from the balance between the magnetic force and the gradient of the Bohm potential in the Landau levels. This study shows that the Madelung fluid approach reveals analogies between a priori unrelated concepts from quantum mechanics and geophysical fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum gyroscope based on the cavity magnomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision rotational angle measurement in noise-prone environments holds critical impor tance in aerospace engineering, military navigation, and related domains. In this paper, we propose
  a quantum gyroscope scheme based on a cavity magnomechanical system, which enables high precision rotation angle detection by harnessing hybrid light-magnon interactions. Central to this
  framework is the employment of a two-mode squeezed coherent state, generated via parametric
  coupling of dual quantized optical fields with collective spin excitations (magnons), serving as the
  quantum metrological probe. We demonstrate that this scheme can significantly reduce quantum
  noise to levels far below the shot-noise limit. Furthermore, in the non-Markovian case, the per formance of the quantum gyroscope in a dissipative environment does not deteriorate over time,
  provided that the environmental spectral density satisfies certain conditions. These findings provide
  critical insights for advancing miniaturized quantum gyroscopes with sub-microradian precision,
  addressing long-standing challenges in inertial navigation systems under strong ambient noise.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Neural Networks on Distributed Photonic Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a distributed quantum-classical framework that synergizes photonic quantum neural networks (QNNs) with matrix-product-state (MPS) mapping to achieve parameter-efficient training of classical neural networks. By leveraging universal linear-optical decompositions of $M$-mode interferometers and photon-counting measurement statistics, our architecture generates neural parameters through a hybrid quantum-classical workflow: photonic QNNs with $M(M+1)/2$ trainable parameters produce high-dimensional probability distributions that are mapped to classical network weights via an MPS model with bond dimension $\chi$. Empirical validation on MNIST classification demonstrates that photonic QT achieves an accuracy of $95.50\% \pm 0.84\%$ using 3,292 parameters ($\chi = 10$), compared to $96.89\% \pm 0.31\%$ for classical baselines with 6,690 parameters. Moreover, a ten-fold compression ratio is achieved at $\chi = 4$, with a relative accuracy loss of less than $3\%$. The framework outperforms classical compression techniques (weight sharing/pruning) by 6--12\% absolute accuracy while eliminating quantum hardware requirements during inference through classical deployment of compressed parameters. Simulations incorporating realistic photonic noise demonstrate the framework's robustness to near-term hardware imperfections. Ablation studies confirm quantum necessity: replacing photonic QNNs with random inputs collapses accuracy to chance level ($10.0\% \pm 0.5\%$). Photonic quantum computing's room-temperature operation, inherent scalability through spatial-mode multiplexing, and HPC-integrated architecture establish a practical pathway for distributed quantum machine learning, combining the expressivity of photonic Hilbert spaces with the deployability of classical neural networks.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamic Framework for Coherently Driven Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The laws of thermodynamics are a cornerstone of physics. At the nanoscale, where fluctuations and quantum effects matter, there is no unique thermodynamic framework because thermodynamic quantities such as heat and work depend on the accessibility of the degrees of freedom. We derive a thermodynamic framework for coherently driven systems, where the output light is assumed to be accessible. The resulting second law of thermodynamics is strictly tighter than the conventional one and it demands the output light to be more noisy than the input light. We illustrate our framework across several well-established models and we show how the three-level maser can be understood as an engine that reduces the noise of a coherent drive. Our framework opens a new avenue for investigating the noise properties of driven-dissipative quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Photocurrent Enhancement in a Generalized Quantum Photocell with Multi-Donor Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a generalized quantum photocell model inspired by biological light-harvesting complexes, designed to probe the influence of donor multiplicity on photovoltaic performance. Building upon earlier two and three-donor systems, we introduce a scalable architecture comprising N independent donor molecules symmetrically arranged around a central acceptor. By modeling the system as a quantum heat engine and solving the master equation under the Born-Markov approximation, we uncover that increasing the number of donors leads to a superlinear enhancement in photocurrent and output power. Specifically, the current does not merely scale linearly with the number of donors but exhibits a marked increase due to collective excitation dynamics and enhanced charge transport. Our results reveal the critical role of donor network topology and aggregation in optimizing quantum photovoltaic efficiency and underscore the potential of biomimetic quantum architectures for next-generation solar energy conversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers the potential to solve certain complex problems, yet, scaling monolithic processors remains a major challenge. Modular and distributed architectures are proposed to build large-scale quantum systems while bringing the security advantages of quantum communication. At present, this requires accurate and computationally efficient models of quantum links across different scales to advance system design and guide experimental prototyping. In this work, we review protocols and models for estimating latency, losses, and fidelity in quantum communication primitives relying on quantum state distribution via microwave photons. We also propose a scalable simulation framework to support the design and evaluation of future distributed quantum computing systems.</description>

      <title>Probing the Universe's Topology through a Quantum System?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global topology of the Universe could, in principle, affect quantum systems through boundary condition constraints. We investigate this connection by analyzing how compact, flat, cosmologically inspired topologies, specifically the $3-$Torus ($E_1$) and half turn space ($E_2$), influence the energy eigenvalues of a quantum particle in the bound state of a 3D Dirac delta potential. Using rigorous renormalization techniques, we derive the equations satisfied by the energy eigenvalues in each topology and develop a systematic method to compute spectral shifts. Our results reveal that each topology induces characteristic deviations in the energy spectrum. In the large$-L$ limit ($L &gt;&gt; g_R$), to leading order, the energy eigenvalues for both the $E_1$ and $E_2$ spaces can be written in the unified form $E\simeq -\frac{\hbar^2}{2mg_R^2}(1 + C_\Gamma\,\frac{2g_R}{L}\,e^{-L/g_R})$, where the topology dependent coefficient is $C_\Gamma = 6$ for the $E_1$ space and $C_\Gamma = 4$ for the $E_2$ space, $g_R$ is the characteristic length scale of the quantum system, and $L$ is the side physical length of the fundamental cubic region. Using the three dimensional Dirac potential as a toy model, we show that at the current cosmic epoch ($a=1$), these topological effects are exponentially suppressed, rendering direct observation infeasible. However, such effects may become measurable in the early Universe, when the physical size of the particle horizon is comparable to the characteristic scale of the quantum system. While immediate experimental verification remains impractical, our work offers theoretical insight into how global cosmic topology might manifest in quantum bound states and may inform future studies of early Universe quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>High-contrast interaction between remote superconducting qubits mediated by multimode cable coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors offer a promising path towards practical quantum computing. However, building a fault-tolerant quantum computer with millions of superconducting qubits is hindered by wiring density, packaging constraints and fabrication yield. Interconnecting medium-scale processors via low-loss superconducting links provides a promising alternative. Yet, achieving high-fidelity two-qubit gates across such channels remains difficult. Here, we show that a multimode coaxial cable can mediate high-contrast interaction between spatially separated super-conducting qubits. Leveraging interference between cable modes, we can implement high-fidelity controlled-Z and ZZ-free iSWAP gates by simply modulating qubit frequencies. Numerical simulations under realistic coherence and coupling parameters predict fidelities above 99% for both gate schemes. Our approach provides a versatile building block for modular superconducting architectures and facilitates distributed quantum error correction and large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of logical quantum phase estimation for X-ray absorption spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employed Fourier-based quantum phase estimation (QPE) to calculate X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) spectra. The primary focus of this study is the calculation of the XAS spectra of transition metal $L_{2,3}$-edges, which are dominated by strong correlation effects. First, the Fe $L_{2,3}$-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure of FePO$_4$ is calculated using a noiseless simulator. The present computation involves a comparison of three types of input states: a uniform superposition state, optimal entangled input state, and Slater function state. Subsequently, we investigated the resolution error of the QPE and statistical error attributed to the measurements. It was revealed that post-processing to introduce Lorentzian broadening reduces the statistical error, which becomes a significant problem for a large number of qubits. Subsequently, we implemented QPE on a trapped-ion quantum computer, encompassing three orbitals within the active space. To this end, we implemented QPE using dynamic circuits to reduce ancilla qubits and [[k+2, k, 2]] quantum error detection code to mitigate the quantum noise inherent in current quantum computers. As a result, it was demonstrated that hardware noise was reduced, and spectra close to the noiseless ones were obtained.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Readout via Overlap-Based Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a method for quantum state readout and feature extraction is developed using quantum overlap-based fitting of function expansions. The approach involves the quantum calculation of quantum overlaps between a target quantum state and a linear combination of basis functions, such as Lorentzian functions, via measurements, and classical optimization of the parameters in the function expansion. This method is particularly effective in scenarios where the quantum state is approximately represented as a continuous function and expressed as a combination of localized functions. The proposed method involves a quantum state readout for both the raw and absolute values of the amplitudes in the quantum state. Preliminary numerical simulations were performed to reconstruct the grid-based wave function and X-ray absorption spectra from a quantum state, and the results show that our proposed method requires fewer measurements compared to conventional quantum state measurement techniques.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Density Matrix Renormalization Group with Matchgates and Clifford circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matchgates and Clifford circuits are two types of quantum circuits which can be efficiently simulated classically, though the underlying reasons are quite different. Matchgates are essentially the single particle basis transformations in the Majorana fermion representation which can be easily handled classically, while the Clifford circuits can be efficiently simulated using the tableau method according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. In this work, we propose a new wave-function ansatz in which matrix product states are augmented with the combination of Matchgates and Clifford circuits (dubbed MCA-MPS) to take advantage of the representing power of all of them. Moreover, the optimization of MCA-MPS can be efficiently implemented within the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method. Our benchmark results on one-dimensional hydrogen chain show that MCA-MPS can improve the accuracy of the ground-state calculation by several orders of magnitude over MPS with the same bond dimension. This new method provides us a useful approach to study quantum many-body systems. The MCA-MPS ansatz also expands our understanding of classically simulatable quantum many-body states.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum noise deconvolution with partial knowledge of noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new quantum noise deconvolution technique that does not rely on the complete knowledge of noise and does not require partial noise tomography. In this new method, we construct a set of observables with completely correctable expectation values despite our incomplete knowledge of noise. This task is achieved just by classical post-processing without extra quantum resources. We show that the number of parameters in the subset of observables with correctable expectation values is the same for all unitary quantum channels. For random unitary channels and the assumption that the probability distribution of unitary errors is unknown, we instruct the construction of the set of observables with correctable expectation values. For a particular case where the random unitary channel is made of just two random unitary operators acting on $d$-dimensional Hilbert-space, we show that the observable with correctable expectation value belongs to a set with at least $d$ parameters. We extend our method by considering observables for which the partial recovery of the expectation value is possible, at the cost of having partial knowledge about the noise-free initial state.</description>

      <title>Runtime Quantum Advantage with Digital Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate experimentally that the bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (BF-DCQO) algorithm on IBM's 156-qubit devices can outperform simulated annealing (SA) and CPLEX in time-to-approximate solutions for specific higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problems. We suitably select problem instances that are challenging for classical methods, running in fractions of minutes even with multicore processors. On the other hand, our counterdiabatic quantum algorithms obtain similar or better results in at most a few seconds on quantum hardware, achieving runtime quantum advantage. Our analysis reveals that the performance improvement becomes increasingly evident as the system size grows. Given the rapid progress in quantum hardware, we expect that this improvement will become even more pronounced, potentially leading to a quantum advantage of several orders of magnitude. Our results indicate that available digital quantum processors, when combined with specific-purpose quantum algorithms, exhibit a runtime quantum advantage even in the absence of quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Near-unity quantum interference of transverse spatial modes in an ultra-compact inverse-designed photonic device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse spatial mode of photons is an untapped resource for scaling up integrated photonic quantum computing. To be practically useful for improving scalability, reliable and high-visibility quantum interference between transverse spatial modes on-chip needs to be demonstrated. We show repeatable quantum interference using inverse-designed transverse mode beamsplitters that have an ultra-compact footprint of 3 $\mu m$ $\times$ 3 $\mu m$ -- the smallest transverse mode beamsplitters for 1550 nm photons to date. We measure a Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility of up to 99.56$\pm$0.64 % from a single device, with an average visibility across three identical devices of 99.38$\pm$0.41 %, indicating a high degree of reproducibility. Our work demonstrates that inverse-designed components are suitable for engineering quantum interference on-chip of multimode devices, paving the way for future compact integrated quantum photonic devices that exploit the transverse spatial mode of photons for high-dimensional quantum information.</description>

      <title>Performance of rotation-symmetric bosonic codes in the presence of random telegraph noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoherence in quantum devices, such as qubits and resonators, is often caused by bistable fluctuators modeled as random telegraph noise (RTN), leading to significant dephasing. We analyze the impact of individual and multiple fluctuators on a bosonic mode in continuous variable systems, identifying non-Markovian behavior governed by two timescales: the fluctuator switching rate ($\xi$) and coupling strength ($\nu$). Using the Breuer-Piilo-Laine (BLP) measure, we show that for Gaussian states, squeezing and thermal fluctuations do not enhance non-Markovianity. In contrast, for non-Gaussian states, the measure becomes unbounded. For rotation-symmetric bosonic (RSB) codes, known for their error correction advantages, non-Markovianity grows linearly with code symmetry. We evaluate the performance of RSB codes under simultaneous loss and RTN dephasing. For a teleportation-based Knill error-correction circuit, the codes perform robustly in the Markovian limit. In the non-Markovian regime, the performance depends on the time the error correction is performed for a given codeword. The average gate fidelity of the error-corrected state in this case exhibits oscillations as a function of time due to the oscillatory nature of the dephasing function of the RTN noise; however, for most of the parameter ranges, the values stay above the break-even point. Extending to multiple fluctuators that produce $1/f$ noise, we observe that non-Markovianity decays with increasing fluctuator count, while the performance of RSB codes remains effective with increasing number of fluctuators.</description>

      <title>Constructor theory of time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructor theory asserts that the laws of physics are expressible as specifications of which transformations of physical systems can or cannot be brought about with unbounded accuracy by devices capable of operating in a cycle ('constructors'). Hence, in particular, such specifications cannot refer to time. Thus, laws expressed in constructor-theoretic form automatically avoid the anomalous properties of time in traditional formulations of fundamental theories. But that raises the problem of how they can nevertheless give meaning to duration and dynamics, and thereby be compatible with traditionally formulated laws. Here we show how.</description>

      <title>An algebraic solution of Dirac equation on a static curved space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present exact solutions of the Dirac equation in static curved space-time using two distinct algebraic approaches. The first method employs $su(1,1)$ algebra operators together with the tilting transformation, enabling the derivation of the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions for both the Hydrogen atom and the Dirac-Morse oscillator. The second approach, based on the Schr\"odinger factorization method, extends the analysis to three representative potentials: the hydrogen atom, the Dirac-Morse oscillator, and a linear radial potential. Although structurally different from those obtained in the first method, the resulting operators in this approach also close the $su(1,1)$ algebra and, through representation theory, yield the corresponding energy spectra and eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Designing open spin-boson models for enabling quantum enhanced sensing through classical measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body models consisting of spin degrees of freedom that interact collectively with bosonic modes capture the physics of a broad range of experimental platforms, including trapped-ion or cavity QED setups. Despite being conceptually simple, they feature rich phase diagrams and emergent critical behavior, particularly under nonequilibrium conditions where coherent interactions compete with dissipation. These collective effects, together with the continuous observation of quanta dissipated into the environment -- typically photons -- allow to realize quantum enhanced parameter estimation. However, protocols for tapping this enhancement typically involve intricate measurements on the combined system-environment state. Here we show that for certain classes of spin-boson models many-body quantum enhancement can in fact be achieved by classical measurements, such as photon counting. Our findings therefore highlight a route towards the design of systems that enable a practical implementation of quantum enhanced metrology through continuous measurements.</description>

      <title>Statistical models of barren plateaus and anti-concentration of Pauli observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce statistical models for each of the three main sources of barren plateaus: non-locality of the observable, entanglement of the initial state, and circuit expressivity. For instance, non-local observables are modeled by random Pauli operators, which lead to barren plateaus with probability exponentially close to one. These models are complementary to the conventional deterministic ones, and often simpler to analyze. Using this framework, we show that in the barren plateau regime any two Pauli observables are anti-concentrated with high probability in the following sense. While each of the observables is localized in an exponentially small parameter subspace, these regions are essentially independent, so that their overlap is yet exponentially smaller than each subspace. This invites to rethink the structure of quantum landscapes with barren plateaus and approaches to their optimization, including warm-start strategies.</description>

      <title>Regularizing quantum loss landscapes by noise injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The difficulty of training variational quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning models is well established. In particular, quantum loss landscapes are often highly non-convex and dominated by poor local minima. While this renders their training NP-hard in general, efficient heuristics that work well for typical instances may still exist. Here, we propose a protocol that uses a targeted noise injection to smooth and regularize quantum loss landscapes. It works by exponentially suppressing the high-frequency components in the Fourier expansion of the quantum loss function. The protocol can be efficiently implemented both in hardware and in simulations. We observe significant and robust improvements of solution quality across various problem types. Our method can be combined with existing techniques mitigating the local minima, such as the quantum natural gradient optimizer, and adds to the toolbox of methods for optimizing quantum loss functions.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous sweet-spot locking of gradiometric fluxonium qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efforts to scale up superconducting processors that employ flux-qubits face numerous challenges, among which is the crosstalk created by neighboring flux lines, which are necessary to bias the qubits at the zero-field and $\Phi_0/2$ sweet spots. A solution to this problem is to use symmetric gradiometric loops, which incorporate a flux locking mechanism that, once a fluxon is trapped during cooldown, holds the device at the sweet spot and limits the need for active biasing. We demonstrate this technique by simultaneously locking multiple gradiometric fluxonium qubits in which an aluminum loop retains the trapped fluxon indefinitely. By compensating the inductive asymmetry between the two loops of the design, we are able to lock the effective flux-bias within $\Phi_{eff} = -3 \times 10^{-4} \Phi_0$ from the target, corresponding to only 15 % degradation in $T_{2,E}$ when operated in zero external field. The design strategy demonstrated here reduces integration complexity for flux qubits by minimizing cross-talk and potentially eliminating the need for local flux bias.</description>

      <title>Divisible and indivisible Stochastic-Quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a complete geometrical characterisation of divisible and indivisible time-evolution at the level of probabilities for systems with two configurations, open or closed. Our new geometrical construction in the space of stochastic matrices shows the existence of conical bounds separating divisible and indivisible dynamics, bearing analogy with the relativistic causal structure, with an emerging time pointing towards information erasure when the dynamics are divisible. Indivisible dynamics, which include quantum dynamics, are characterised by a time-flow against the information-erasure time coordinate or by being tachyonic with respect to the cones in the stochastic matrix space. This provides a geometric counterpart of other results in the literature, such as the equivalence between information-decreasing and divisible processes. The results apply under minimal assumptions: (i) the system has two configurations, (ii) one can freely ascribe initial probabilities to both and (iii) probabilities at other times are linearly related to the initial ones through conditional probabilities. The optional assumption of (iv) continuity places further constraints on the system, removing one of the past cones. Discontinuous stochastic dynamics in continuous time include cases with divisible blocks of evolution which are not themselves divisible. We show that the connection between continuity and multiplicity of divisors holds for any dimension. We extend methods of coarse graining and dilations by incorporating dynamics and uncertainty, connecting them with divisibility criteria. This is a first step towards a full geometric characterisation of indivisible stochastic dynamics for any number of configurations which, as they cannot at the level of probabilities be reduced to a composition of evolution operators, constitute fundamental elements of probabilistic time-evolution.</description>

      <title>Lie symmetries and ghost-free representations of the Pais-Uhlenbeck model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Pais-Uhlenbeck (PU) model, a paradigmatic example of a higher time-derivative theory, by identifying the Lie symmetries of its associated fourth-order dynamical equation. Exploiting these symmetries in conjunction with the model's Bi-Hamiltonian structure, we construct distinct Poisson bracket formulations that preserve the system's dynamics. Amongst other possibilities, this allow us to recast the PU model in a positive definite manner, offering a solution to the long-standing problem of ghost instabilities. Furthermore, we systematically explore a family of transformations that reduce the PU model to equivalent first-order, higher-dimensional systems. Finally we examine the impact on those transformations by adding interaction terms of potential form to the PU model and demonstrate how they usually break the Bi-Hamiltonian structure. Our approach yields a unified framework for interpreting and stabilising higher time-derivative dynamics through a symmetry analysis in some parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Observation of Near-Critical Kibble-Zurek Scaling in Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek scaling reveals the universal dynamics when a system is linearly ramped across a symmetry-breaking phase transition. However, in reality, inevitable finite-size effects or symmetrybreaking perturbations can often smear out the critical point and render the phase transition into a smooth crossover. In this letter, we show experimentally that the precise Kibble-Zurek scaling can be retained in the near-critical crossover regime, not necessarily crossing the critical point strictly. The key ingredient to achieving this near-critical Kibble-Zurek scaling is that the system size and the symmetry-breaking field must be appropriately scaled following the variation of ramping speeds. The experiment is performed in a reconfigurable Rydberg atom array platform, where the Rydberg blockade effect induces a Z2 symmetry-breaking transition. The atom array platform enables precise control of the system size and the zigzag geometry as a symmetry-breaking field. Therefore, we can demonstrate notable differences in the precision of the Kibble-Zurek scaling with or without properly scaling the system size and the zigzag geometry. Our results strengthen the Kibble-Zurek scaling as an increasingly valuable tool for investigating phase transition in quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Short-Range Magnetic Correlations in Amorphous Nb$_2$O$_5$ and Ta$_2$O$_5$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used muon spin rotation/relaxation/resonance ($\mu$SR) to investigate the magnetic properties of niobium pentoxide (Nb$_2$O$_5$) and tantalum pentoxide (Ta$_2$O$_5$) thin films. In their amorphous phase (sputter-deposited), both oxides exhibit magnetic behavior down to 2.8 K. However, the magnetic response is strongly structure-dependent: thermally-oxidized, poly-crystalline Ta$_2$O$_5$ shows suppressed magnetism, while amorphous Ta$_2$O$_5$ demonstrates local static magnetism. In contrast, amorphous Nb$_2$O$_5$ is significantly more magnetically disordered. These results suggest that magnetic inhomogeneity in the native oxides of Ta and Nb may be a key factor in the performance of superconducting devices, particularly limiting T$_1$ for qubits and resonators.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum quench of the Yukawa Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and one of its lattice extensions with $q$ fermions and one boson. Several equilibrium properties are computed for general $q$ with different parameter scaling within the large-$N$ dynamical mean field scheme. The non-Fermi liquid quench dynamics are studied by integrating the Kadanoff-Baym equations for switching off the lattice term with constant Yukawa coupling or quenching to different final Yukawa couplings. The post-quench oscillations and relaxation dynamics are insensitive to the quench amplitudes deep inside the non-Fermi liquid phase. With weak lattice coupling quenches, we find universal thermalization dynamics similar to the SYK model; however, with two temperatures and two distinct relaxation rates for bosons and fermions, both signal Planckian relaxations without quasiparticles, as in strange metals.</description>

Abstract: We study the existence of real state transfer in edge-perturbed graphs having generalised clusters, where the Hamiltonian is taken to be either the adjacency matrix, the Laplacian matrix, or the signless Laplacian matrix associated with a weighted graph. This approach establishes a unified framework for constructing new graphs exhibiting perfect real state transfer by leveraging known examples with this property. The results presented herein generalise several previously established findings on real state transfer. In particular, we construct an infinite family of graphs with maximum valency five that exhibit perfect pair state transfer with respect to each of the aforementioned matrices, between the same pair states and at the same transfer time, despite the fact that these graphs are not regular.</description>

Abstract: Dynamics of exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensate is examined by means of the stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation including non-Markovian coupling to the excitonic reservoir. Attention is concentrated on properties of the condensate lattice created by laser beams providing incoherent pumping of the reservoir. It is shown that phase ordering of the lattice depends on temperature. The crossover between the in-phase (``ferromagnetic'') and the checkboard (``antiferromagnetic'') orders is accompanied by variation of the steady-state condensate density. Also it is shown that the condensate lattices can retain ordered pattern for temperatures which are much higher than the critical temperature of a single spot, probably due to suppression of the modulational instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Avoided level crossings, commonly associated with quantum chaos, are typically interpreted as signatures of eigenstate hybridization and spatial delocalization, often viewed as ergodic spreading. We show that, contrary to this expectation, increasing chaos in quantum billiards enhances mutual information between conjugate phase space variables, revealing nontrivial correlations. Using an information-theoretic decomposition of eigenstate entropy, we demonstrate that spatial delocalization may coincide with increased mutual information between position and momentum. These correlations track classical invariant structures in phase space and persist beyond the semiclassical regime, suggesting a robust information-theoretic manifestation of quantum-classical correspondence.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Pseudo-Ratchet for Brownian Computers through One-Dimensional Quantum Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brownian computers utilize thermal fluctuations as a resource for computation and hold promise for achieving ultra-low-energy computations. However, the lack of a statistical direction in Brownian motion necessitates the incorporation of ratchets that facilitate the speeding up and completion of computations in Brownian computers. To make the ratchet mechanism work effectively, an external field is required to overcome thermal fluctuations, which has the drawback of increasing energy consumption. As a remedy for this drawback, we introduce a new approach based on one-dimensional (1D) quantum Brownian motion, which exhibits intrinsic unidirectional transport even in the absence of external forces or asymmetric potential gradients, thereby functioning as an effective pseudo-ratchet. Specifically, we exploit that quantum resonance effects in 1D systems divide the momentum space of particles into subspaces. These subspaces have no momentum inversion symmetry, resulting in the natural emergence of unidirectional flow. We analyze this pseudo-ratchet mechanism without energy dissipation from an entropic perspective and show that it remains consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Weak coupling limit for quantum systems with unbounded weakly commuting system operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is devoted to a rigorous analysis of the weak coupling limit (WCL) for the reduced dynamics of an open infinite-dimensional quantum system interacting with electromagnetic field or a reservoir formed by Fermi or Bose particles in the dipole approximation. The free system Hamiltonian and the system part of the Hamiltonian describing interaction with the reservoir are considered as unbounded operators with continuous spectrum which are commuting in a weak sense. We derive in the weak coupling limit the reservoir statistics, which is determined by whose terms in the multi-point correlation functions of the reservoir which are non-zero in the WCL. Then we prove that the resulting reduced system dynamics converges to unitary dynamics (such behavior sometimes called as Quantum Cheshire Cat effect) with a modified Hamiltonian which can be interpreted as a Lamb shift to the original Hamiltonian. We obtain exact form of the modified Hamiltonian and estimate the rate of convergence to the limiting dynamics. For Fermi reservoir, we prove the convergence of the full Dyson series. For Bose case the convergence is understood term by term.</description>

      <title>Controllable creation of topological boundary states in topological-insulator-based Josephson corner junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in condensed matter systems have attracted great attention in the past two decades, due to their interesting physics and potential application in topological quantum computing (TQC). However, the topologically protected nature of MZMs still need more experimental verifications. In this study, we have realized controllable creation of a topological boundary state at the corner of topological insulator (TI)-based Josephson corner junctions. This state demonstrates protected existence across a broad region in parametric space, and exhibits a non-2{\pi}-period but 4{\pi}-period-compatible energy-phase relation. Our study suggests that TI-based Josephson junctions, as proposed in the Fu-Kane scheme of TQC, may provide a promising platform for hosting and braiding MZMs.</description>

      <title>Metal-Insulator Transition described by Natural Orbital Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metal-insulator transition (MIT) is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics and a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. Hydrogen-based systems offer a simple yet powerful model for investigating the MIT, as their insulating behavior arises purely from electron-electron interactions. In this work, we study finite hydrogen clusters with cubic geometries using Natural Orbital Functional Theory (NOFT), a method capable of accurately describing correlated systems beyond mean-field approaches. We focus on two key signatures of the MIT: the fundamental energy gap and the harmonic average of the atomic one-particle reduced density matrix. Our results show that NOFT captures the transition from insulating to metallic behavior as the interatomic distance decreases. By extrapolating the energy gap to the thermodynamic limit, we estimate a critical distance rc ~ 1.2 Ang, in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo benchmarks. These findings demonstrate the reliability of NOFT for describing strong correlation effects in large-scale models.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violating axion mediated interactions in RaOH molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If axion simultaneously has the scalar couplings to the nucleons and pseudo-scalar couplings to the electrons, they may mediate a $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$ violating interaction between the electronic shell and nuclei in the molecules. The polyatomic molecule RaOH, which is considered as a promising platform for the $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$ violation searches, is studied for its sensitivity to such interactions. Due to the long-range nature (on molecular scales) of the axion-mediated interaction, it is interesting whether the enhancement parameter would be sensitive to the vibration of the molecule. Our results imply that the impact of the vibrations on the axion-mediated electron-nucleon interaction in the molecule is similar to the impact on the short-range electron-nucleon scalar-pseudoscalar interaction studied earlier.</description>

      <title>Quantum confinement theory of ultra-thin films: electronic, thermal and superconducting properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of ultra-thin films with a thickness ranging from a few tens of nanometers to just about 1-2 nanometers. While these materials are still effectively 3D in many respects, traditional theories as well as ab initio methods struggle to describe their properties as measured in experiments. In particular, standard approaches to quantum confinement rely on hard-wall boundary conditions, which neglect the unavoidable, ubiquitous, atomic-scale irregularities of the interface. Recently, a unified theoretical approach to quantum confinement has been proposed which is able to effectively take the real nature of the interface into account, and can efficiently be implemented in synergy with microscopic theories. Its predictions for the electronic properties such as electrical conductivity of semiconductor thin films or critical temperature of superconducting thin films, have been successfully verified in comparison with experimental data. The same confinement principles lead to new laws for the phonon density of states and for the heat capacity of thin films, again in agreement with the available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Extreme Loss Suppression and Wide Tunability of Dipolar Interactions in an Ultracold Molecular Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold dipolar molecules hold great promise for the creation of novel quantum states of matter, but the realization of long-lived molecular bulk samples with strong dipole-dipole interactions has remained elusive. Here, we realize a collisionally stable gas of ultracold ground state molecules with a lifetime of several seconds. Utilizing double microwave dressing, we achieve an extreme suppression of inelastic two- and three-body losses by factors of more than 10,000 and 1,000, respectively. We find that losses remain suppressed across a wide range of dipole-dipole interactions, allowing the continuous tuning of the dipolar length from 0 to 1 um $\sim$ 20,000 $a_0$. Combined with the recent realization of Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules, our findings open the door to the exploration of strongly dipolar quantum liquids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11304v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for quantifying the complexity of quantum channels, grounded in a suitably chosen resource set. This class of convex functions is designed to analyze the complexity of both open and closed quantum systems. By leveraging Lipschitz norms inspired by quantum optimal transport theory, we rigorously establish the fundamental properties of this complexity measure. The flexibility in selecting the resource set allows us to derive effective lower bounds for gate complexities and simulation costs of both Hamiltonian simulations and dynamics of open quantum systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that this complexity measure exhibits linear growth for random quantum circuits and finite-dimensional quantum simulations, up to the Brown-Susskind threshold.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Model for Mode-Pairing Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mode-pairing (MP) quantum key distribution (QKD) eliminates the requirements of phase locking and phase tracking compared with twin-field (TF) QKD while still surpassing the fundamental rate-distance limit of QKD. The complexity of the experimental implementation is reduced while the efficiency can still be guaranteed. In MP-QKD, two communication parties need to pair two effective rounds according to the announced results by the third party. Therefore, it is not intuitive how to provide an entanglement protocol equivalent to the prepare-and-measure protocol for proving security. At present, the security of MP-QKD is rigorously proven by examining the consistency of the states detailly between MP-QKD and the fixed-pairing scheme under all of Eve's possible interference to obtain the equivalence, and verifying the security of the latter. Here, we directly present an entanglement model for MP-QKD by proposing a free-pairing entanglement scheme that is equivalent to MP-QKD. This entanglement model simplifies the security proof and provides a clearer insight into the foundation of MP-QKD. Besides, it could provide a theoretical framework for the comprehensive analysis of MP-QKD, such as facilitating practical security analysis. Additionally, we propose an optimized pairing strategy based on the entanglement model. The simulation results show an enhancement of 163\% in pairing efficiency with a reasonable pairing interval $2 \times 10^5$.</description>

      <title>Trainability and Expressivity of Hamming-Weight Preserving Quantum Circuits for Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15547v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has become a promising area for real world applications of quantum computers, but near-term methods and their scalability are still important research topics. In this context, we analyze the trainability and controllability of specific Hamming weight preserving variational quantum circuits (VQCs). These circuits use qubit gates that preserve subspaces of the Hilbert space, spanned by basis states with fixed Hamming weight $k$. In this work, we first design and prove the feasibility of new heuristic data loaders, performing quantum amplitude encoding of $\binom{n}{k}$-dimensional vectors by training an $n$-qubit quantum circuit. These data loaders are obtained using controllability arguments, by checking the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM)'s rank. Second, we provide a theoretical justification for the fact that the rank of the QFIM of any VQC state is almost-everywhere constant, which is of separate interest. Lastly, we analyze the trainability of Hamming weight preserving circuits, and show that the variance of the $l_2$ cost function gradient is bounded according to the dimension $\binom{n}{k}$ of the subspace. This proves conditions of existence/lack of Barren Plateaus for these circuits, and highlights a setting where a recent conjecture on the link between controllability and trainability of variational quantum circuits does not apply.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Unoptimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization of circuits is an essential task for both quantum and classical computers to improve their efficiency. In contrast, classical logic optimization is known to be difficult, and a lot of heuristic approaches have been developed so far. In this study, we define and construct a quantum algorithmic primitive called quantum circuit unoptimization, which makes a given quantum circuit complex by introducing some redundancies while preserving circuit equivalence, i.e., the inverse operation of circuit optimization. Using quantum circuit unoptimization, we propose the quantum circuit equivalence test, a decision problem contained both in the NP and BQP classes but is not trivially included in the P class. Furthermore, as a practical application, we construct concrete unoptimization recipes to generate compiler benchmarks and evaluate circuit optimization performance using Qiskit and Pytket. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that quantum circuit unoptimizer systematically generates redundant circuits that are challenging for compilers to optimize, which can be used to compare the performance of different compilers and improve them. We also offer potential applications of quantum circuit unoptimization, such as generating quantum advantageous machine learning datasets and quantum computer fidelity benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Is gauge symmetry vacuous or physical ? : Lessons from the Landau problem as a solvable quantum gauge theoretical system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gauge symmetry is one of the most important concepts in modern physics, but there are two conflicting views on its meaning or interpretation. The standard view is that local gauge symmetry is the basis of the pursue of fundamental particles and forces in nature. Another view is that the gauge symmetry is not a symmetry of nature but just a redundancy in description. Naturally, both statements are nothing wrong, but one might feel that there is a slight conceptual conflict between the two points of view. Due to the subtlety of the subject, however, little literature exists that discusses the root of such an anxiety. In the present paper, by making full use of the analytically solvable nature of the quantum Landau problem, we argue that the familiar gauge principle plays a critical role in unraveling a subtle mismatch between the two viewpoints above. We reveal that there exist two types of quantities in gauge theories, which should clearly be discriminated. The first are quantities, which look seemingly gauge-invariant but actually not, whereas the second are genuinely gauge-invariant quantities, which correspond to direct experimental observables.</description>

      <title>Spectral anomalies and broken symmetries in maximally chaotic quantum maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral statistics such as the level spacing statistics and spectral form factor (SFF) are widely expected to accurately identify ``ergodicity'', including the presence of underlying macroscopic symmetries, in generic quantum systems ranging from quantized chaotic maps to interacting many-body systems. By studying various quantizations of maximally chaotic maps that break a discrete classical symmetry upon quantization, we demonstrate that this approach can be misleading and fail to detect macroscopic symmetries. Notably, the same classical map can exhibit signatures of different random matrix symmetry classes in short-range spectral statistics depending on the quantization. While the long-range spectral statistics encoded in the early time ramp of the SFF are more robust and correctly identify macroscopic symmetries in several common quantizations, we also demonstrate analytically and numerically that the presence of Berry-like phases in the quantization leads to spectral anomalies, which break this correspondence. Finally, we provide numerical evidence that long-range spectral rigidity remains directly correlated with ergodicity in the quantum dynamical sense of visiting a complete orthonormal basis.</description>

      <title>Reducing classical communication costs in multiplexed quantum repeaters using hardware-aware quasi-local policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future quantum networks will have nodes equipped with multiple quantum memories, allowing for multiplexing and entanglement distillation strategies in order to increase fidelities and reduce waiting times for end-to-end entanglement distribution. In this work, we introduce \textit{quasi-local} policies for multiplexed quantum repeater chains. In fully-local policies, nodes make decisions based only on knowledge of their own states. In our quasi-local policies, nodes have increased knowledge of the state of the repeater chain, but not necessarily full, global knowledge. Our policies exploit the observation that for most decisions the nodes have to make, they only need to have information about the connected region of the chain they belong to, and not the entire chain. In this way, we not only obtain improved performance over local policies, but we reduce the classical communication (CC) costs inherent to global-knowledge policies. Our policies also outperform the well-known and widely studied nested purification and doubling swapping policy in practically relevant parameter regimes. We also carefully examine the role of entanglement distillation. Via analytical and numerical results, we identify the parameter regimes in which distillation makes sense and is useful. In these regimes, we also address the question: "Should we distill before swapping, or vice versa?" Finally, to provide further practical guidance, we propose an experimental implementation of a multiplexing-based repeater chain, and experimentally demonstrate the key element, a high-dimensional biphoton frequency comb. We then evaluate the anticipated performance of our multiplexing-based policies in such a real-world network through simulation results for two concrete memory platforms, namely rare-earth ions and diamond vacancies.</description>

      <title>Tsirelson's Inequality for the Precession Protocol is Maximally Violated by Quantum Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precession protocol involves measuring $P_3$, the probability that a uniformly precessing observable (like the position of a harmonic oscillator or a coordinate undergoing spatial rotation) is positive at one of three equally spaced times. Tsirelson's inequality, which states that $P_3 \leq 2/3$ in classical theory, is violated in quantum theory by certain states. In this Letter, we address some open questions about the inequality: What is the maximum violation of Tsirelson's inequality possible in quantum theory? Might other theories do better? By considering the precession protocol in a theory-independent manner for systems with finitely many outcomes, we derive a general bound for the maximum possible violation. This theory-independent bound must be satisfied by any theory whose expectation values are linear functions of observables -- which includes classical, quantum, and all general probabilistic theories -- and depends only on the minimum positive and negative measurement outcomes. Given any such two values, we prove by construction that quantum theory always saturates this bound. Some notable examples include the angular momentum of a spin-$3/2$ particle and a family of observables that outperform the quantum harmonic oscillator in the precession protocol. Finally, we also relate our findings to the recently introduced notion of constrained conditional probabilities.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel input scheme for general second-quantized Hamiltonians of relativistic or non-relativistic many-fermion systems. This input scheme incorporates the fermionic anticommutation relations, particle number variations, and respects the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. Based on our input scheme, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical framework for spectral calculations on future quantum hardwares. We provide explicit circuit designs and the associated gate cost. We demonstrate our hybrid framework by solving the low-lying spectra of ${^{42}}$Ca and ${^{46}}$Ca.

      <title>Thermodynamics of ancilla-assisted erasure of quantum information</title>

Abstract: Landauer's principle sets a fundamental limit on the heat dissipated when one classical bit of information is erased from a memory, thereby establishing a direct link between information theory and thermodynamics. With the advent of quantum technologies, a natural question arises: how does Landauer's principle extend to the quantum regime? In this work, we study the thermodynamics of a quantum channel that erases an arbitrary state of a qubit memory in contact with a reservoir composed of a thermal qubit and a pure ancilla qubit. The channel is based only on CNOT gates, and the introduction of the ancilla makes it capable of operating beyond Landauer's limit, when the temperature of the thermal qubit is above a given limit temperature. However, we observe that, since the introduction of the ancilla does not correspond to a strict Landauer's scenario, our protocol does not represent a violation of Landauer's principle.</description>

      <title>Realizing non-trivial doublon formation using a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical formation of doublons or onsite repulsively bound pairs of particles on a lattice is a highly non-trivial phenomenon. In this work, we show the signatures of doublon formation in a quantum computer by simulating the continuous time quantum walk in the framework of the one dimensional extended Fermi-Hubbard model. By considering two up-component and one down-component particles initially created at the three neighbouring sites at the middle of the lattice and allowing intra- (inter-) component nearest neighbour (onsite) interactions we show the formation a stable onsite doublon in the quantum walk. The probability of such doublon formation is more (less) if the hopping strength of the down particle is weaker (stronger) compared to the up particle. On the contrary, for an initial doublon along with a free up particle, the stability of the doublon is more prominent than the doublon dissociation in the dynamics irrespective of the hopping asymmetry between the two components. We first numerically obtain the signatures of the stable doublon formation in the dynamics and then observe them using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.</description>

Abstract: Continuing our analysis of quantum machine learning applied to our use-case of malware detection, we investigate the potential of quantum convolutional neural networks. More precisely, we propose a new architecture where data is uploaded all along the quantum circuit. This allows us to use more features from the data, hence giving to the algorithm more information, without having to increase the number of qubits that we use for the quantum circuit. This approach is motivated by the fact that we do not always have great amounts of data, and that quantum computers are currently restricted in their number of logical qubits.</description>

      <title>Trade-off between Gradient Measurement Efficiency and Expressivity in Deep Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) require an efficient training algorithm to achieve practical quantum advantages. A promising approach is gradient-based optimization, where gradients are estimated by quantum measurements. However, QNNs currently lack general quantum algorithms for efficiently measuring gradients, which limits their scalability. To elucidate the fundamental limits and potentials of efficient gradient estimation, we rigorously prove a trade-off between gradient measurement efficiency (the mean number of simultaneously measurable gradient components) and expressivity in deep QNNs. This trade-off indicates that more expressive QNNs require higher measurement costs per parameter for gradient estimation, while reducing QNN expressivity to suit a given task can increase gradient measurement efficiency. We further propose a general QNN ansatz called the stabilizer-logical product ansatz (SLPA), which achieves the trade-off upper bound by exploiting the symmetric structure of the quantum circuit. Numerical experiments show that the SLPA drastically reduces the sample complexity needed for training while maintaining accuracy and trainability compared to well-designed circuits based on the parameter-shift method.</description>

Abstract: All-photonic quantum repeaters are essential for establishing long-range quantum entanglement. Within repeater nodes, reliably performing entanglement swapping is a key component of scalable quantum communication. To tackle the challenge of probabilistic Bell state measurement in linear optics, which often leads to information loss, various approaches have been proposed to ensure the loss tolerance of distributing a single ebit. We have generalized previous work regarding repeater graph states with elaborate connectivity, enabling the efficient establishment of exploitable ebits at a finite rate with high probability. We demonstrate that our new scheme significantly outperforms the previous work with much flexibility and discuss the generation overhead of such resource states. These findings offer new insights into the scalability and reliability of loss-tolerant quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel variational quantum approach for solving a class of nonlinear optimal control problems. Our approach integrates Dirac's canonical quantization of dynamical systems with the solution of the ground state of the resulting non-Hermitian Hamiltonian via a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We introduce a new perspective on the Dirac bracket formulation for generalized Hamiltonian dynamics in the presence of constraints, providing a clear motivation and illustrative examples. Additionally, we explore the structural properties of Dirac brackets within the context of multidimensional constrained optimization problems.
  Our approach for solving a class of nonlinear optimal control problems employs a VQE-based approach to determine the eigenstate and corresponding eigenvalue associated with the ground state energy of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Assuming access to an ideal VQE, our formulation demonstrates excellent results, as evidenced by selected computational examples. Furthermore, our method performs well when combined with a VQE-based approach for non-Hermitian Hamiltonian systems. Our VQE-based formulation effectively addresses challenges associated with a wide range of optimal control problems, particularly in high-dimensional scenarios. Compared to standard classical approaches, our quantum-based method shows significant promise and offers a compelling alternative for tackling complex, high-dimensional optimization challenges.</description>

      <title>Minimally Entangled Typical Thermal States for Classical and Quantum Simulation of 1+1-Dimensional $\mathbb Z_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory at Finite Temperature and Density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating strongly coupled gauge theories at finite temperature and density is a longstanding challenge in nuclear and high-energy physics that also has fundamental implications for condensed matter physics. In this work, we use minimally entangled typical thermal state (METTS) approaches to facilitate both classical and quantum computational studies of such systems. METTS techniques combine classical random sampling with imaginary time evolution, which can be performed on either a classical or a quantum computer, to estimate thermal averages of observables. We study 1+1-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled to spinless fermionic matter, which maps onto a local quantum spin chain. We benchmark both a classical matrix-product-state implementation of METTS and a recently proposed adaptive variational approach that is a promising candidate for implementation on near-term quantum devices, focusing on the equation of state as well as on various measures of fermion confinement. Of particular importance is the choice of basis for obtaining new METTS samples, which impacts both the classical sampling complexity (a key factor in both classical and quantum simulation applications) and complexity of circuits used in the quantum computing approach. Our work sets the stage for future studies of strongly coupled gauge theories with both classical and quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Classical Benchmarks for Variational Quantum Eigensolver Simulations of the Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating the Hubbard model is of great interest to a wide range of applications within condensed matter physics, however its solution on classical computers remains challenging in dimensions larger than one. The relative simplicity of this model, embodied by the sparseness of the Hamiltonian matrix, allows for its efficient implementation on quantum computers, and for its approximate solution using variational algorithms such as the variational quantum eigensolver. While these algorithms have been shown to reproduce the qualitative features of the Hubbard model, their quantitative accuracy in terms of producing true ground state energies and other properties, and the dependence of this accuracy on the system size and interaction strength, the choice of variational ansatz, and the degree of spatial inhomogeneity in the model, remains unknown. Here we present a rigorous classical benchmarking study, demonstrating the potential impact of these factors on the accuracy of the variational solution of the Hubbard model on quantum hardware, for systems with up to $32$ qubits. We find that even when using the most accurate wavefunction ans\"{a}tze for the Hubbard model, the error in its ground state energy and wavefunction plateaus for larger lattices, while stronger electronic correlations magnify this issue. Concurrently, spatially inhomogeneous parameters and the presence of off-site Coulomb interactions only have a small effect on the accuracy of the computed ground state energies. Our study highlights the capabilities and limitations of current approaches for solving the Hubbard model on quantum hardware, and we discuss potential future avenues of research.</description>

      <title>Block encoding bosons by signal processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Block Encoding (BE) is a crucial subroutine in many modern quantum algorithms, including those with near-optimal scaling for simulating quantum many-body systems, which often rely on Quantum Signal Processing (QSP). Currently, the primary methods for constructing BEs are the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) and the sparse oracle approach. In this work, we demonstrate that QSP-based techniques, such as Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) and Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation for Unitary Matrices (QETU), can themselves be efficiently utilized for BE implementation. Specifically, we present several examples of using QSVT and QETU algorithms, along with their combinations, to block encode Hamiltonians for lattice bosons, an essential ingredient in simulations of high-energy physics. We also introduce a straightforward approach to BE based on the exact implementation of Linear Operators Via Exponentiation and LCU (LOVE-LCU). We find that, while using QSVT for BE results in the best asymptotic gate count scaling with the number of qubits per site, LOVE-LCU outperforms all other methods for operators acting on up to $\lesssim11$ qubits, highlighting the importance of concrete circuit constructions over mere comparisons of asymptotic scalings. Using LOVE-LCU to implement the BE, we simulate the time evolution of single-site and two-site systems in the lattice $\varphi^4$ theory using the Generalized QSP algorithm and compare the gate counts to those required for Trotter simulation.</description>

Abstract: The phenomenon of synchronization, where entities exhibit stable oscillations with aligned frequencies and phases, has been detected in diverse areas of natural science. It plays a crucial role in achieving frequency locking in multiple applications such as microwave communication and signal processing. The study of synchronization in quantum systems has gained significant interest, particularly in developing robust methods for synchronizing distant objects. Here, we demonstrate that synchronization between the boundary sites of one-dimensional generalized Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models can be induced through applying dissipation on the central sites. Two types of synchronization, stemming from the topological edge states, are characterized by the off-diagonal or diagonal correlations between the boundary sites. We analyze the relaxation rate to realize the synchronization and its acceleration with bulk dissipation. Remarkably, the synchronous oscillations maintain steady amplitude and frequency in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, we show that the synchronization is robust against the perturbations in the Hamiltonian and initial states, highlighting its potential for practical implementation in quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum query complexity studies the number of queries needed to learn some property of a black box. A closely related question is how well an algorithm can succeed with this learning task using only a fixed number of queries. In this work, we propose measuring an algorithm's performance using the mutual information between the output and the actual value. The task of optimizing this mutual information using a single query, is similar to a basic task of quantum communication, where one attempts to maximize the mutual information of the sender and receiver. We make this analogy precise by splitting the algorithm between two agents, obtaining a communication protocol. The oracle's target property plays the role of a message that Alice encodes into a quantum state, which is subsequently sent over to Bob. The first part of the algorithm performs this encoding, and the second part measures the state and aims to deduce the message from the outcome. Moreover, we formally consider the oracle as a separate subsystem, whose state records the unknown oracle identity. Within this construction, Bob's optimal measurement basis minimizes the quantum correlations between the two subsystems. We also find a lower bound on the mutual information, which is related to quantum coherence. These results extend to multiple-query algorithms. As a result, we describe the optimal non-adaptive algorithm that uses at most a fixed number of queries, for any oracle classification problem. We demonstrate our results by studying several well-known algorithms through the proposed framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e lattices created in two-dimensional heterostructures exhibit rich many-body physics of interacting electrons and excitons and, at the same time, suggest promising optoelectronic applications. Here, we study the cooperative radiance of moir\'e excitons that is demonstrated to emerge from the deep subwavelength nature of the moir\'e lattice and the strong excitonic on-site interaction. In particular, we show that the static dipole-dipole interaction between interlayer excitons can strongly affect their cooperative optical properties, suppressing superradiance of disordered states while enhancing superradiance of ordered phases of moir\'e excitons. Moreover, we show that doping permits direct control of optical cooperativity, e.g., by generating supperradiant dynamics of otherwise subradiant states of excitons. Our results show that interlayer moir\'e excitons offer a unique platform for exploring cooperative optical phenomena in strongly interacting many-body systems, thus, holding promise for applications in quantum nonlinear optics.</description>

Abstract: We show that states obtained from deep random Clifford circuits doped with non-Clifford phase gates (including T-gates and $\sqrt{\mathrm{T}}$-gates) can be disentangled completely, provided the number of non-Clifford gates is smaller or approximately equal to the number of qubits. This implies that Pauli expectation values of such states can be efficiently simulated classically, despite them exhibiting both extensive entanglement and extensive nonstabilizerness. We prove this result analytically using a quantum error correction formulation, demonstrate its applicability numerically, and discuss consequences for the disentanglability of states generated through Hamiltonian dynamics. We show that this result implies a novel representation of approximate state designs that can also facilitate their efficient generation, and we propose a novel quantum circuit compression scheme for Clifford circuits doped with non-Clifford phase gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emission characteristics of a measurement-driven quantum emitter in a continuously monitored optical environment. The quantum emitter is stimulated by observing the Pauli spin along its transition dipole that maximally noncommutes with the Hamiltonian of the emitter. It also exchanges energy resonantly with the optical environment, observable as quantum jumps corresponding to the absorption or emission of a photon and the null events where the quantum emitter did not make a jump. We characterize the finite-time statistics of quantum jumps and estimate their covariance and precision using the large deviation principle. While the statistics of absorption and emission events are generically sub-Poissonian with an improved precision by at most a factor of two compared to Poissonian jumps, our analysis also reveals a spin-measurement-induced transition from super-Poissonian to sub-Poissonian in their sum. We conclude by describing generalized quantum measurement strategies using mode-entangled optical beams to access the predicted counting statistics in experiments, with implications extending to optimal quantum clocks.</description>

Abstract: Manipulating the electromagnetic spectrum at the single-photon level is fundamental for quantum experiments. In the visible and infrared range, this can be accomplished with atomic quantum emitters, and with superconducting qubits such control is extended to the microwave range (below 10 GHz). Meanwhile, the region between these two energy ranges presents an unexplored opportunity for innovation. We bridge this gap by scaling up a superconducting qubit to the millimeter-wave range (near 100 GHz). Working in this energy range greatly reduces sensitivity to thermal noise compared to microwave devices, enabling operation at significantly higher temperatures, up to 1 K. This has many advantages by removing the dependence on rare $^3$He for refrigeration, simplifying cryogenic systems, and providing orders of magnitude higher cooling power, lending the flexibility needed for novel quantum sensing and hybrid experiments. Using low-loss niobium trilayer junctions, we realize a qubit at 72 GHz cooled to 0.87 K using only $^4$He. We perform Rabi oscillations to establish control over the qubit state, and measure relaxation and dephasing times of 15.8 and 17.4 ns respectively. This demonstration of a millimeter-wave quantum emitter offers exciting prospects for enhanced sensitivity thresholds in high-frequency photon detection, provides new options for quantum transduction and for scaling up and speeding up quantum computing, enables integration of quantum systems where $^3$He refrigeration units are impractical, and importantly paves the way for quantum experiments exploring a novel energy range.</description>

      <title>Achieving computational gains with quantum error-correction primitives: Generation of long-range entanglement enhanced by error detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resource overhead required to achieve net computational benefits from quantum error correction (QEC) limits its utility while current systems remain constrained in size, despite exceptional progress in experimental demonstrations. In this paper, we demonstrate that the strategic application of QEC primitives without logical encoding can yield significant advantages on superconducting processors--relative to any alternative error-reduction strategy--while only requiring a modest overhead. We first present a novel protocol for implementing long-range CNOT gates that relies on a unitarily prepared Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as well as a unitary disentangling step; the protocol natively introduces an error-detection process using the disentangled qubits as flags. We demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art gate fidelities of over 85% across up to 40 lattice sites, significantly and consistently outperforming the best alternative measurement-based protocol without introducing any additional ancilla qubits. We then apply sparse stabilizer measurements to generate large GHZ states by detecting bit-flip and amplitude-damping errors. Employing this technique in combination with deterministic error suppression, we generate a 75-qubit GHZ state exhibiting genuine multipartite entanglement, the largest reported to date. The generation requires no more than 9 ancilla qubits and the fraction of samples discarded due to errors grows no higher than 78%, far lower than previous discard fractions required for tests using comparable numbers of fully encoded qubits. This work in total represents compelling evidence that adopting QEC primitives on current-generation devices can deliver substantial net benefits.</description>

      <title>Operator formulation of Classical mechanics: Levi-Civita map and equivalence of central forces in 2-dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the operator formulation of classical mechanics by explicitly applying it to two central potentials in 2 dimensions. After constructing the classical Hamiltonian operators and corresponding Schr\"odinger like equations, we solve for the corresponding classical wave functions associated with these two potentials, viz; Kepler and harmonic potentials. While satisfying continuity equations, these classical wave functions are shown to be renormalizable only in a finite region of the 2D plane. We also derive the well-known equivalence between these two models within the operator formulation of classical mechanics. This equivalence is shown by relating the Schr\"odinger-like equations and corresponding classical wave functions of these two systems, using the Levi-Civita map and a reparametrizaton of time(Sundman map).</description>

      <title>Simulating lossy and partially distinguishable quantum optical circuits: theory, algorithms and applications to experiment validation and state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To understand quantum optics experiments, we must perform calculations that consider the principal sources of noise, such as losses, spectral impurity and partial distinguishability. In both discrete and continuous variable systems, these can be modeled as mixed Gaussian states over multiple modes. The modes are not all resolved by photon-number measurements and so require calculations on coarse-grained photon-number distribution. Existing methods can lead to a combinatorial explosion in the time complexity, making this task unfeasible for even moderate sized experiments of interest. In this work, we prove that the computation of this type of distributions can be done in exponential time, providing a combinatorial speedup. We develop numerical techniques that allow us to determine coarse-grained photon number distributions of Gaussian states, as well as density matrix elements of heralded non-Gaussian states prepared in the presence of spectral impurity and partial distinguishability. These results offer significant speed-up and accuracy improvements to validation tests of both Fock and Gaussian boson samplers that rely on binned probability distributions. Moreover, they pave the way to a more efficient simulation of realistic photonic circuits, unlocking the ability to perform exact calculations at scales which were previously out of reach. In addition to this, our results, including loop Hafnian master theorems, may be of interest to the fields of combinatorics and graph theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the recently introduced particle interpretation of the double-slit experiment for light fields [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 13360 (2025)], all related interference phenomena can be reinterpreted in terms of light particle states that either couple (bright) or do not couple (dark) with detectors. Here, we apply this approach to multimode pulsed lasers, unifying the description of their generation inside optical cavities and propagation outside them, now relying solely on quantum mechanics, i.e., without invoking wave superposition to explain pulse shaping. Specifically, we demonstrate that multimode interference presents a dominance of particle dark states over the bright ones and mode-locked pulsed lasers consist of a continuous photon beam, with photons forming bright states during pulses and dark states in between. Additionally, we analyze mode-locked pulsed lasers, showing that the theoretical bright-to-dark state ratio matches the experimental pulse-to-interval duration ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous collapse models aim to solve the long-standing measurement problem in quantum mechanics by modifying the theory's dynamics to include objective wave function collapses. These collapses occur randomly in space, bridging the gap between quantum and classical behavior. A central feature of these models is their dependence on mass density, which directly influences how and when collapse events occur. In this work, we explore a generalized framework in which the collapse dynamics depend on arbitrary functions of the mass density, extending previous models. We analyze the theoretical consistency of these generalizations, investigate their predictions, and compare them with experimental data. Our findings show that only a limited range of mass-dependence functions are viable, with significant implications for the future development and empirical testability of collapse-based models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between nonstabilizerness and entanglement is crucial for uncovering the fundamental origins of quantum complexity. Recent studies have proposed entanglement spectral quantities, such as antiflatness of the entanglement spectrum and entanglement capacity, as effective complexity measures, establishing direct connections to stabilizer R\'enyi entropies. In this work, we systematically investigate quantum complexity across a diverse range of spin models, analyzing how entanglement structure and nonstabilizerness serve as distinctive signatures of quantum phases. By studying entanglement spectra and stabilizer entropy measures, we demonstrate that these quantities consistently differentiate between distinct phases of matter. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of spin chains including the XXZ model, the transverse-field XY model, its extension with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, as well as the Cluster Ising and Cluster XY models. Our findings reveal that entanglement spectral properties and magic-based measures serve as intertwined, robust indicators of quantum phase transitions, highlighting their significance in characterizing quantum complexity in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>QEA: An Accelerator for Quantum Circuit Simulation with Resources Efficiency and Flexibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The area of quantum circuit simulation has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. However, due to the exponentially increasing computational costs, assessing and validating these models on large datasets poses significant obstacles. Despite plenty of research in quantum simulation, issues such as memory management, system adaptability, and execution efficiency remain unresolved. In this study, we introduce QEA, a state vector-based hardware accelerator that overcomes these difficulties with four key improvements: optimized memory allocation management, open PE, flexible ALU, and simplified CX swapper. To evaluate QEA's capabilities, we implemented and evaluated it on the AMD Alveo U280 board, which uses only 0.534 W of power. Experimental results show that QEA is extremely flexible, supporting a wide range of quantum circuits, has excellent fidelity, making it appropriate for standard quantum emulators, and outperforms powerful CPUs and related works up to 153.16x better in terms of normalized gate speed. This study has considerable potential as a useful approach for quantum emulators in future works.</description>

      <title>Space-time tradeoff in networked virtual distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to monolithic devices, modular, networked quantum architectures are based on interconnecting smaller quantum hardware nodes using quantum communication links, and offer a promising approach to scalability. Virtual distillation (VD) is a technique that can, under ideal conditions, suppress errors exponentially as the number of quantum state copies increases. However, additional gate operations required for VD introduce further errors, which may limit its practical effectiveness. In this work, we analyse three practical implementations of VD that correspond to edge cases that maximise space-time tradeoffs. Specifically, we consider an implementation that minimises the number of qubits but introduces significantly deeper quantum circuits, and contrast it with implementations that parallelise the preparation of copies using additional qubits, including a constant-depth implementation. We rigorously characterise their circuit depth and gate count requirements, and develop explicit architectures for implementing them in networked quantum systems -- while also detailing implementations in early fault-tolerant quantum architectures. We numerically compare the performance of the three implementations under realistic noise characteristics of networked ion trap systems and conclude the following. Firstly, VD effectively suppresses errors even for very noisy states. Secondly, the constant-depth implementation consistently outperforms the implementation that minimises the number of qubits. Finally, the approach is highly robust to errors in remote entangling operations, with noise in local gates being the main limiting factor to its performance.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Algorithms in the era of Early Fault Tolerance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing roadmaps predict the availability of 10,000 qubit devices within the next 3-5 years. With projected two-qubit error rates of 0.1%, these systems will enable certain operations under quantum error correction (QEC) using lightweight codes, offering significantly improved fidelities compared to the NISQ era. However, the high qubit cost of QEC codes like the surface code (especially at near-threshold physical error rates) limits the error correction capabilities of these devices. In this emerging era of Early Fault Tolerance (EFT), it will be essential to use QEC resources efficiently and focus on applications that derive the greatest benefit. In this work, we investigate the implementation of Variational Quantum Algorithms in the EFT regime (EFT-VQA). We introduce partial error correction (pQEC), a strategy that error-corrects Clifford operations while performing Rz rotations via magic state injection instead of the more expensive T-state distillation. Our results show that pQEC can improve VQA fidelities by 9.27x over standard approaches. Furthermore, we propose architectural optimizations that reduce circuit latency by ~2x, and achieve qubit packing efficiency of 66% in the EFT regime.</description>

      <title>Universal Structure of Computing Moments for Exact Quantum Dynamics: Application to Arbitrary System-Bath Couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general procedure for computing higher-order moments of correlation functions in open quantum systems, extending the scope of our recent work on Memory Kernel Coupling Theory (MKCT) [W. Liu, Y. Su, Y. Wang, and W. Dou, arXiv:2407.01923 (2024)]. This approach is demonstrated for arbitrary system-bath coupling that can be expressed as polynomial, $H_{SB} = \hat{V} (\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \hat{q} + \alpha_2 \hat{q}^2+ \dots)$, where we show that the recursive commutators of a system operator obey a universal hierarchy. Exploiting this structure, the higher-order moments are obtained by evaluating the expectation values of the system and bath operators separately, with bath expectation values derived from the derivatives of a generating function. We further apply MKCT to compute the dipole autocorrelation function for the spin-boson model with both linear and quadratic coupling, achieving agreement with the hierarchical equations of motion approach. Our findings suggest a promising path toward accurate dynamics for complex open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem with Quantum Annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem (STSP) is a variant of the classical Traveling Salesman Problem. The STSP involves incorporating steiner nodes, which are extra nodes not originally part of the required visit set but that can be added to the route to enhance the overall solution and minimize the total travel cost. Given the NP-hard nature of the STSP, we propose a quantum approach to address it. Specifically, we employ quantum annealing using D-Wave's hardware to explore its potential for solving this problem. To enhance computational feasibility, we develop a preprocessing method that effectively reduces the network size. Our experimental results demonstrate that this reduction technique significantly decreases the problem complexity, making the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation, the standard input for quantum annealers, better suited for existing quantum hardware. Furthermore, the results highlight the potential of quantum annealing as a promising and innovative approach for solving the STSP.</description>

      <title>Time Advance and Probability Conservation in PT-Symmetric Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When excited states decay the time evolution operator $U(t)=e^{-iHt}$ does not obey $U^{\dagger}(t)U(t)=I$. Nonetheless, probability conservation is not lost if one includes both excitation and decay, though it takes a different form. Specifically, if the eigenspectrum of a Hamiltonian is complete, then due to $CPT$ symmetry, a symmetry that holds for all physical systems, there must exist an operator $V$ that effects $VHV^{-1}=H^{\dagger}$, so that $V^{-1}U^{\dagger}(t)VU(t)=I$. In consequence, the time delay associated with decay must be accompanied by an equal and opposite time advance for excitation. Thus when a photon excites an atom the spontaneous emission of a photon from the excited state must occur without any decay time delay at all. An effect of this form together with an associated negative time delay appear to have recently been reported by Sinclair et. al., PRX Quantum \textbf{3}, 010314 (2022) and Angulo et. al., arXiv:2409.03680 [quant-ph].</description>

      <title>The Sponge is Quantum Indifferentiable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sponge is a cryptographic construction that turns a public permutation into a hash function. When instantiated with the Keccak permutation, the sponge forms the NIST SHA-3 standard. SHA-3 is a core component of most post-quantum public-key cryptography schemes slated for worldwide adoption.
  While one can consider many security properties for the sponge, the ultimate one is indifferentiability from a random oracle, or simply indifferentiability. The sponge was proved indifferentiable against classical adversaries by Bertoni et al. in 2008. Despite significant efforts in the years since, little is known about sponge security against quantum adversaries, even for simple properties like preimage or collision resistance beyond a single round. This is primarily due to the lack of a satisfactory quantum analog of the lazy sampling technique for permutations.
  In this work, we develop a specialized technique that overcomes this barrier in the case of the sponge. We prove that the sponge is in fact indifferentiable from a random oracle against quantum adversaries. Our result establishes that the domain extension technique behind SHA-3 is secure in the post-quantum setting. Our indifferentiability bound for the sponge is a loose $O(\mathsf{poly}(q) 2^{-\mathsf{min}(r, c)/4})$, but we also give bounds on preimage and collision resistance that are tighter.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a flowchart-based description of the decoy-state BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol and provide a step-by-step, self-contained information-theoretic security proof for this protocol within the universal composable security framework. As a result, our proof yields a key rate consistent with previous findings. Importantly, unlike all the prior security proofs, our approach offers a fully rigorous and mathematical justification for achieving the key rate with the claimed correctness and secrecy parameters, thereby representing a significant step toward the formal certification of QKD systems.</description>

      <title>Cryptography without Long-Term Quantum Memory and Global Entanglement: Classical Setups for One-Time Programs, Copy Protection, and Stateful Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how oracles which only allow for classical query access can be used to construct a variety of quantum cryptographic primitives which do not require long-term quantum memory or global entanglement. Specifically, if a quantum party can execute a semi-quantum token scheme (Shmueli 2022) with probability of success $1/2 + \delta$, we can build powerful cryptographic primitives with a multiplicative logarithmic overhead for the desired correctness error. Our scheme makes no assumptions about the quantum party's noise model except for a simple independence requirement: noise on two sets of non-entangled hardware must be independent.
  Using semi-quantum tokens and oracles which can only be queried classically, we first show how to construct a "short-lived" semi-quantum one-time program (OTP) which allows a classical sending party to prepare a one-time program on the receiving party's quantum computer. We then show how to use this semi-quantum OTP to construct a semi-quantum "stateful obfuscation" scheme (which we term "RAM obfuscation"). Importantly, the RAM obfuscation scheme does not require long-term quantum memory or global entanglement. Finally, we show how RAM obfuscation can be used to build long-lived one-time programs and copy-protection schemes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Support Vector Regression for Robust Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) is critical in data analysis, particularly within the domain of IT security. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as a powerful tool for AD in large-scale data. In this study, we explore the potential of quantum ML approaches, specifically quantum kernel methods, for the application to robust AD. We build upon previous work on Quantum Support Vector Regression (QSVR) for semisupervised AD by conducting a comprehensive benchmark on IBM quantum hardware using eleven datasets. Our results demonstrate that QSVR achieves strong classification performance and even outperforms the noiseless simulation on two of these datasets. Moreover, we investigate the influence of - in the NISQ-era inevitable - quantum noise on the performance of the QSVR. Our findings reveal that the model exhibits robustness to depolarizing, phase damping, phase flip, and bit flip noise, while amplitude damping and miscalibration noise prove to be more disruptive. Finally, we explore the domain of Quantum Adversarial Machine Learning and demonstrate that QSVR is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and that noise does not improve the adversarial robustness of the model.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Quantum Mpemba Effect in Isolated System by Initial State Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) in isolated, non-integrable quantum systems, where relaxation dynamics depend on structure of the initial states. By analyzing the distribution of initial states across symmetrical subspaces, we identify a tunable mechanism that influences the emergence of QME, showing faster relaxation from certain out-of-equilibrium states. Additionally, we propose an experimentally realizable quantum circuit, which requires no complex controls on quantum simulator platforms and serves to verify our theoretical predictions. These results establish symmetry-resolved state engineering as a practical tool for manipulating non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a two-particle collective measurement proposed as the optimal solution to a quantum state estimation game. Our results suggest that, in practice, the collective measurement strategy is at least as good as the best local approach, and it achieves a higher average fidelity when accounting for systematic errors. This photonic implementation uses a recently developed universal two-photon projective measurement based on Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, polarization-dependent loss, and unitary operations. We compare the performance to the case where the entangling component of the measurement is suppressed. We further apply the collective measurement to quantum state tomography, observing a near-optimal scaling of the infidelity with the total number of samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement processes that are traditionally described within the realm of non-relativistic quantum mechanics are transcribed into the covariant framework of Cartan's space, the four-valued representation space of the restricted conformal group for special relativity. It is assumed that the non-relativistic quantum measurement mechanisms of state reductions as well as the definition of Born probabilities should remain unaltered when the passage to the covariant framework is worked out. The correlations between observations registered in different spacetime frames, concerning intermediate steps and outcomes of microscopic measurements, are attained through the implementation of the orthochronous proper Poincar\'e subgroup of an appropriate realization of SU(2,2). It appears that the work may supply an elementary theoretical background to the construction of relativistic quantum computational gates.</description>

      <title>Identifying optimal magnetic field configurations for decoherence mitigation of boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy center in 2D hexagonal boron nitride has emerged as a promising quantum sensor. However, its sensitivity is constrained due to ubiquitous nuclear spins in the environment. The nuclear spins, hyperfine coupled with the central electron spin, effectively behave as magnetic field fluctuators, leading to rapid decoherence. Here, we explore the effectiveness of static magnetic field strength and orientation in realizing peculiar subspaces that can lead to enhanced spin coherence. Specifically, using detailed numerical simulations of the spin Hamiltonian, we identify specific field configurations that minimize energy gradients and, consequently, are expected to facilitate decoherence suppression. We also develop an approximate analytical model based on the perturbation theory that accurately predicts these low-gradient subspaces for magnetic fields aligned with the electron spin quantization axis, applicable not only to boron vacancies but to any spin-1 electronic system coupled to nearby nuclear spins. Furthermore, to stimulate experimental validation, we estimate coherence lifetimes as a function of various bias field configurations and demonstrate that significant decoherence suppression can indeed be achieved in certain regions. These findings and the developed methodology offer valuable insights for mitigating decoherence in a low-field regime.</description>

      <title>The next gap in the subrank of 3-tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works of Costa-Dalai, Christandl-Gesmundo-Zuiddam, Blatter-Draisma-Rupniewski, and Bri\"et-Christandl-Leigh-Shpilka-Zuiddam have investigated notions of discreteness and gaps in the possible values that asymptotic tensor ranks can take. In particular, it was shown that the asymptotic subrank and asymptotic slice rank of any nonzero 3-tensor is equal to 1, equal to 1.88, or at least 2 (over any field), and that the set of possible values of these parameters is discrete (in several regimes). We determine exactly the next gap, showing that the asymptotic subrank and asymptotic slice rank of any nonzero 3-tensor is equal to 1, equal to 1.88, equal to 2, or at least 2.68.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the superconducting penetration depth $\lambda$ in aluminum thin films of varying thickness. The range of thicknesses chosen spans from the thin-film regime to the regime approaching bulk behavior. The penetration depths observed range from $\lambda = 163.3\pm0.4~\rm{nm}$ for the thinnest $20~\rm{nm}$ samples down to $\lambda = 53.6\pm0.4~\rm{nm}$ for the $200~\rm{nm}$-thick ones. In order to accurately determine $\lambda$, we performed complementary measurements using the frequency of superconducting $LC$ resonators as well as the resistance of normal-state meanders. Both methods yield comparable results, providing a well-characterized set of values of $\lambda$ in aluminum in the relevant range for applications in fields such as quantum computing and microwave radiation detector technologies.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic particle creation from $T-$vacuum in the radiation dominated universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We further investigate novel features of the $T-$vacuum state, originally defined in the context of quantum field theory in a (1+1) dimensional radiation dominated universe [Modak, JHEP 12, 031 (2020)]. Here we extend the previous work to a realistic (3+1) dimensional set up and show that $T-$vacuum gives rise to an anisotropic particle creation phenomena in the radiation dominated early universe. Unlike the Hawking or Unruh effect, where the particle content is thermal and asymptotically defined, here it is non-thermal and instantaneous. This novel example of particle creation is interesting because these particles are detected in the frame of physical/cosmological observers, who envision $T-$vacuum as a particle excited state. Such results comes with a potential to be eventually compared with the observed anisotropies from the early universe and may provide new insights on cosmological particle creation.</description>

      <title>Fractional Wannier Orbitals and Tight-Binding Gauge Fields for Kitaev Honeycomb Superlattices with Flat Majorana Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional excitations hold immense promise for both fundamental physics and quantum technologies. However, constructing lattice models for their dynamics under gauge fields remains a formidable challenge due to inherent obstructions. Here, we introduce a novel and systematic framework for deriving low-energy lattice models of fractional orbitals coupled to tight-binding gauge fields. Departing from conventional geometric approaches, our method systematically eliminates the high-energy states via virtual hopping, thereby deriving the gauge potential and quantum metric through a superexchange-like mechanism. We demonstrate the framework by constructing Wannier orbitals for Majorana states and a tight-binding $Z_2$ gauge field across various flux crystalline phases in the Kitaev spin model on a honeycomb lattice. Our study reveals a striking phase transition between two non-trivial topological phases characterized by gapless flat-band with extensive degeneracy. Furthermore, we develop a gauge-invariant mean-field theory for interacting Majorana orbitals, leading to a correlation-induced fractional Chern state. Our work establishes a general framework for gauge-mediated tight-binding models and a gauge-invariant mean-field theory for interacting fractional orbitals that can be readily extended to $U(1)$, $SU(N)$ lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Radio-frequency cascade readout of coupled spin qubits fabricated using a 300~mm wafer process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01241v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced semiconductor manufacturing offers a promising path to scaling up silicon-based quantum processors by improving yield, uniformity, and integration. Individual spin qubit control and readout have been demonstrated in quantum dots fabricated on 300 mm wafer metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) processes, yet quantum processors require two-qubit interactions to operate. Here, we use a 300 mm natural silicon MOS process customised for spin qubits and demonstrate coherent control of two electron spins using the exchange interaction, forming the basis for entangling gates such as $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We measure gate dephasing times of up to $T_2^{*}\approx500$ ns with a quality factor of 10. For readout, we introduce a novel dispersive readout technique, the radio-frequency electron cascade, that simplifies the qubit unit cell while providing high gain. This method achieves a signal-to-noise ratio of 6 within an integration time of 46 ${\mu}$s, the highest-performing dispersive readout demonstration in a planar MOS process. The combination of sensitive dispersive readout with industrial-grade manufacturing marks a crucial step towards large-scale integration of silicon quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Schwinger pair production in counterpropagating laser pulses: Identifying volume factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonperturbative process of vacuum pair production in a combination of two counterpropagating linearly polarized laser pulses of a finite spatial extent. By means of the locally-constant field approximation (LCFA), we calculate the total particle yield for the corresponding four-dimensional setup and compare it with the estimates obtained for simplified low-dimensional scenarios. Within the domain where the LCFA is well justified, we examine a combination of two plane-wave pulses, a standing electromagnetic wave, and a spatially uniform oscillating field and demonstrate that at each of these three levels of approximation, one can accurately predict the actual particle number by multiplying the results by properly chosen volume factors depending on the field parameters. We present closed-form expressions for these factors providing universal prescriptions for evaluating the particle yield. Our final formula connecting the spatially uniform setup with the four-dimensional scenario has a relative uncertainty of the level of $10\%$. The explicit correspondences deduced in this study not only prove the relevance of the approximate predictions, but also allow one to quickly estimate the number of pairs for various realistic scenarios without performing multidimensional LCFA integrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The realization of electron-spin resonance at the single-atom level using scanning tunneling microscopy has opened new avenues for coherent quantum sensing and quantum state manipulation at the ultimate size limit. This allows to build many-body Hamiltonians and the study of their complex physical behavior. Recently, a novel qubit platform has emerged from this field, raising questions about the driving mechanism from single-atom magnets. In this work, we demonstrate how single-atom magnets can be used to drive a nearby single spin qubit efficiently. We show that the modulation of exchange coupling is the primary driving force, which successfully reproduces Rabi rates in the tens of MHz range, consistent with experimental data, while also addressing critical aspects related to the optimization of experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Edge modes and boundary impurities in the anisotropic Heisenberg spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of boundary phenomena in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain (XXZ-$\frac{1}{2}$) in the gapped antiferromagnetic phase, with a particular focus on the interplay between fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{4} $ edge modes and a coupled spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity at the edge. Employing a combination of Bethe Ansatz, exact diagonalization, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, we explore the intricate phase diagram that emerges when the impurity is coupled either integrably or non-integrably to the chain. For integrable antiferromagnetic impurity couplings, we identify two distinct phases: the Kondo phase, where the impurity is screened by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and the antiferromagnetic bound mode phase, where an exponentially localized bound state screens the impurity in the ground state. When coupled ferromagnetically while maintaining integrability, the impurity behaves as a free spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, leading to either a ferromagnetic bound mode phase, where the impurity remains free in the ground state but may be screened at higher energy excitations or an unscreened (or local moment) phase where impurity remains unscreened in every eigenstate whereas for non-integrable ferromagnetic coupling, the impurity is not free. In the case of non-integrable antiferromagnetic coupling, a third phase emerges, characterized by mid-gap excitations with two degenerate states below the mass gap on top of the Kondo and antiferromagnetic bound mode phases, further enriching the phase diagram. Our findings highlight the nuanced behavior of boundary impurities in gapped antiferromagnetic systems, offering new insights into Kondo effects and impurity screening in the presence of fractionalized edge modes and bulk antiferromagnetic order.</description>

Abstract: The significant progress of quantum sensing technologies offer numerous radical solutions for measuring a multitude of physical quantities at an unprecedented precision. Among them, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) emerge as an eminent solution for detecting the electric field of radio frequency (RF) signals, exhibiting great potential in assisting classical wireless communications and sensing. So far, most experimental studies have aimed for the proof of physical concepts to reveal its promise, while the practical signal model of RAQR-aided wireless communications and sensing remained under-explored. Furthermore, the performance of RAQR-based wireless receivers and their advantages over classical RF receivers have not been fully characterized. To fill these gaps, we introduce the RAQR to the wireless community by presenting an end-to-end reception scheme. We then develop a corresponding equivalent baseband signal model relying on a realistic reception flow. Our scheme and model provide explicit design guidance to RAQR-aided wireless systems. We next study the performance of RAQR-aided wireless systems based on our model, and compare them to classical RF receivers. The results show that the RAQR is capable of achieving a substantial received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of over $27$ decibel (dB) and $40$ dB in the photon shot limit regime and the standard quantum limit regime, respectively.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional real space renormalization group with well-controlled approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make Kadanoff's block idea into a reliable three-dimensional (3D) real space renormalization group (RG) method. Kadanoff's idea, expressed in spin representation, offers a qualitative intuition for clarifying scaling behavior in criticality, but has difficulty as a quantitative tool due to uncontrolled approximations. A tensor-network reformulation equips the block idea with a measure of RG errors. In 3D, we propose an entanglement filtering scheme to enhance such a block-tensor map, with the lattice reflection symmetry exploited. When the proposed RG is applied to the cubic-lattice Ising model, the RG errors are reduced to about 2% by retaining more couplings. The estimated scaling dimensions of the two relevant fields have errors 0.4% and 0.1% in the best case, compared with the accepted values. The proposed RG is promising as a systematically-improvable real space RG method in 3D. The unique feature of our method is its ability to numerically obtain a 3D critical fixed point in a high-dimensional tensor space. A fixed-point tensor contains much more information than a handful of observables estimated in conventional techniques for analyzing critical systems.</description>

      <title>Interleaved dual-species arrays of single atoms using a passive optical element and one trapping laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate trapping of individual rubidium (Rb) and cesium (Cs) atoms in an interleaved array of bright tweezers and dark bottle-beam traps, using a microfabricated optical element illuminated by a single laser beam and a 4F system with spatial filtering. Our approach exploits the opposite-sign dynamic polarizabilities of Rb and Cs, ensuring each species is exclusively trapped in either bright or dark sites. The passive optical mask creates optimal trap depths for both species using three transmittance levels while minimizing the optical phase difference, implemented using a variable-thickness absorbing layer of amorphous germanium. This trapping architecture achieves atom loading rates close to 50% while reducing system complexity compared to conventional methods using active optoelectronic components and/or multiple laser wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories: emergent properties from Tensor Network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This thesis develops advanced Tensor Network (TN) methods to address Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), overcoming limitations in real-time dynamics and finite-density regimes. A novel dressed-site formalism is introduced, enabling efficient truncation of gauge fields while preserving gauge invariance for both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. This formalism is successfully applied to SU(2) Yang-Mills LGTs in two dimensions, providing the first TN simulations of this system and revealing critical aspects of its phase diagram and non-equilibrium behavior, such as a Quantum Many-Body (QMB) scarring dynamics. A generalization of the dressed-site formalism is proposed through a new fermion-to-qubit mapping for general lattice fermion theories, revealing powerful for classical and quantum simulations. Numerical innovations, including the use of optimal space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve to preserve locality in high-dimensional simulations, further enhance the efficiency of these methods. Together with high-performance computing techniques, these advances open current and future development pathways toward optimized, efficient, and faster simulations on scales comparable to Monte Carlo state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Detuning-symmetric laser cooling of many mechanical modes with a photothermally modified cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simultaneously cool $\gtrsim$100 mechanical modes of a membrane with a photothermally modified optical cavity driven by a single blue-detuned laser. In contrast to radiation pressure and bolometric forces applied directly to the mechanical system, this cooling effect does not depend on the sign of detuning, allowing for single-laser stabilization (i.e., simultaneous positive optical spring and damping) that is especially effective at room temperature and high laser power. We also provide intuition about the competing thermal processes, and propose two simple modifications to the mirror coatings that can strongly enhance this effect.</description>

      <title>Anomalous current-electric field characteristics in transport through a nanoelectromechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A deep understanding of the correlation between electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom is crucial to the development of quantum devices in a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS). In this work, we first establish a fully quantum mechanical approach for transport through a NEMS device, which is valid for arbitrary bias voltages, temperatures, and electro-mechanical couplings. We find an anomalous current-electric field characteristics at a low bias, where the current decreases with a rising electric field, associated with the backward tunneling of electrons for a weak mechanical damping. We reveal that this intriguing behavior arises from a combined effect of mechanical motion and Coulomb blockade, where the rapid increase of backward tunneling events at a large oscillation amplitude suppresses the forward current due to prohibition of double occupation. In the opposite limit of strong damping, the oscillator dissipates its energy to the environment and relaxes to the ground state rapidly. Electrons then transport via the lowest vibrational state such that the net current and its corresponding noise have a vanishing dependence on the electric field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This document explores the potential of quantum computing in Thermal Science. Conceived as a living document, it will be continuously updated with experimental findings and insights for the research community in Thermal Science. By experiments, we refer both to the search for the most effective algorithms and to the performance of real quantum hardware. Those are fields that are evolving rapidly, driving a technological race to define the best architectures. The development of novel algorithms for engineering problems aims at harnessing the unique strengths of quantum computing. Expectations are high, as users seek concrete evidence of quantum supremacy - a true game changer for engineering applications. Among all heat transfer mechanisms (conduction, convection, radiation), we start with conduction as a paradigmatic test case in the field being characterized by a rich mathematical foundation for our investigations.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Constraint Generation Framework for Binary Linear Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to utilize quantum computers for binary linear programming (BLP), which can be extended to general integer linear programs (ILP). Quantum optimization algorithms, hybrid or quantum-only, are currently general purpose, standalone solvers for ILP. However, to consider them practically useful, we expect them to overperform the current state of the art classical solvers. That expectation is unfair to quantum algorithms: in classical ILP solvers, after many decades of evolution, many different algorithms work together as a robust machine to get the best result. This is the approach we would like to follow now with our quantum 'solver' solutions. In this study we wrap any suitable quantum optimization algorithm into a quantum informed classical constraint generation framework. First we relax our problem by dropping all constraints and encode it into an Ising Hamiltonian for the quantum optimization subroutine. Then, by sampling from the solution state of the subroutine, we obtain information about constraint violations in the initial problem, from which we decide which coupling terms we need to introduce to the Hamiltonian. The coupling terms correspond to the constraints of the initial binary linear program. Then we optimize over the new Hamiltonian again, until we reach a feasible solution, or other stopping conditions hold. Since one can decide how many constraints they add to the Hamiltonian in a single step, our algorithm is at least as efficient as the (hybrid) quantum optimization algorithm it wraps. We support our claim with results on small scale minimum cost exact cover problem instances.</description>

      <title>Interface-Bound States and Majorana Zero Modes in Lateral Heterostructures of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$ with Proximity-Induced Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation into the emergence of interface-bound states, particularly Majorana zero modes (MZMs), in a lateral heterostructure composed of two three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs), Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$, under the influence of proximity-induced superconductivity from niobium (Nb) contacts. We develop an advanced two-dimensional Dirac model for the topological surface states (TSS), incorporating spatially varying chemical potentials and s-wave superconducting pairing. Using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism, we derive analytical solutions for the bound states and compute the local density of states (LDOS) at the interface, revealing zero-energy modes characteristic of MZMs. The topological nature of these states is rigorously analyzed through winding numbers and Pfaffian invariants, and their robustness is explored under various physical perturbations, including gating effects. Our findings highlight the potential of this heterostructure as a platform for topological quantum computing, with detailed predictions for experimental signatures via tunneling spectroscopy.</description>
