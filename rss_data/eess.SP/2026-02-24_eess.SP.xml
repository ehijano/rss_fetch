      <title>ZUNA: Flexible EEG Superresolution with Position-Aware Diffusion Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present \texttt{ZUNA}, a 380M-parameter masked diffusion autoencoder trained to perform masked channel infilling and superresolution for arbitrary electrode numbers and positions in EEG signals. The \texttt{ZUNA} architecture tokenizes multichannel EEG into short temporal windows and injects spatiotemporal structure via a 4D rotary positional encoding over (x,y,z,t), enabling inference on arbitrary channel subsets and positions. We train ZUNA on an aggregated and harmonized corpus spanning 208 public datasets containing approximately 2 million channel-hours using a combined reconstruction and heavy channel-dropout objective. We show that \texttt{ZUNA} substantially improves over ubiquitous spherical-spline interpolation methods, with the gap widening at higher dropout rates. Crucially, compared to other deep learning methods in this space, \texttt{ZUNA}'s performance \emph{generalizes} across datasets and channel positions allowing it to be applied directly to novel datasets and problems. Despite its generative capabilities, \texttt{ZUNA} remains computationally practical for deployment. We release Apache-2.0 weights and an MNE-compatible preprocessing/inference stack to encourage reproducible comparisons and downstream use in EEG analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity-agnostic AI/ML-assisted beam selection for multi-panel arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI/ML-based beam selection methods coupled with location information effectively reduce beam training overhead. Unfortunately, heterogeneous antenna hardware with varying dimensions, orientations, codebooks, element patterns, and polarization angles limits their feasibility and generalization. This challenge requires either a heterogeneity-agnostic model functional under these variations, or developing many models for each configuration, which is infeasible and expensive in practice. In this paper, we propose a unifying AI/ML-based beam selection algorithm supporting antenna heterogeneity by predicting wireless propagation characteristics independent of antenna configuration. We derive a reference signal received power (RSRP) model that decouples propagation characteristics from antenna configuration. We propose an optimization framework to extract propagation variables consisting of angle-of-arrival (AoA), angle-of-departure (AoD), and a matrix incorporating path gain and channel depolarization from beamformed RSRP measurements. We develop a three-stage autoregressive network to predict these variables from user location, enabling RSRP calculation and beam selection for arbitrary antenna configurations without retraining or having a separate model for each configuration. Simulation results show our heterogeneity-agnostic method provides spectral efficiency close to that of genie-aided selection both with and without antenna heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Channel-Correlation-Based Access Point Selection and Pilot Power Allocation for Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a dynamic access point (AP) selection and pilot power allocation (DAPPA) framework for uplink cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems, aiming to mitigate inter-user interference and improve overall spectral efficiency (SE). A hierarchical correlation-based clustering algorithm is developed to group APs according to their channel correlation, enabling each user to be associated with APs that simultaneously provide strong channel gains and low mutual correlation. This association ensures reliable connectivity, maximizes coherent combining gains, and reduces inter-user interference, while also allowing the number of AP clusters to be adjusted flexibly, without the need to reorganize the network completely. By maintaining links to low-correlated APs, the proposed scheme reduces the need for frequent channel state information (CSI) estimation and minimizes network-wide update overhead. To enhance scalability, a user-capacity constraint per AP is incorporated, preventing hardware overload and alleviating the effects of pilot reuse. Furthermore, an effective pilot power allocation strategy is introduced to boost the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) during channel training. This is formulated as a weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRM) problem and solved iteratively using a quadratic transform, which enables efficient optimization while ensuring fairness and high-quality service across all users. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method delivers significant SE gains, maintains performance in high-density multi-user scenarios, and converges faster than benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>A Spatial Similarity-Guided Pilot Assignment and Access Point Selection for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates pilot assignment and access point (AP) selection strategies for uplink cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems. We propose channel similarity-aware pilot assignment (CAPA) and AP selection schemes to improve interference management and, consequently, spectral efficiency (SE). The pilot assignment strategy dynamically allocates pilot sequences by evaluating inter-user channel similarity, ensuring that users (UEs) with high channel similarity are assigned orthogonal pilots to mitigate pilot contamination. Subsequently, an AP selection algorithm is introduced that prioritizes the selection of low-correlation APs to reduce interference and enhance spatial diversity. This selection process maintains robust UE-AP links while minimizing inter-AP redundancy. The combined approach significantly improves SE, particularly in dense network deployments. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies under dynamic UE scenarios.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Gossip for Distributed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While distributed learning offers a new learning paradigm for distributed network with no central coordination, it is constrained by communication bottleneck between nodes.
  We develop a new event-triggered gossip framework for distributed learning to reduce inter-node communication overhead. The framework introduces an adaptive communication control mechanism that enables each node to autonomously decide in a fully decentralized fashion when to exchange model information with its neighbors based on local model deviations. We analyze the ergodic convergence of the proposed framework under noconvex objectives and interpret the convergence guarantees under different triggering conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed framework achieves substantially lower communication overhead than the state-of-the-art distributed learning methods, reducing cumulative point-to-point transmissions by \textbf{71.61\%} with only a marginal performance loss, compared with the conventional full-communication baseline.</description>

      <title>Downlink Beamforming Design for NOMA Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and beamforming are well-established techniques for enabling massive connectivity in future wireless networks. However, many optimal beamforming solutions rely on highly complex iterative algorithms and optimization methods, resulting in an increase in computational burden and latency, making them less suitable for delay-sensitive applications and services. To address these challenges, we propose an effective convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for beamforming design in downlink NOMA systems to solve the transmit power minimization problem. The proposed method utilizes two representations of channel state information as input features to produce normalized beamforming vectors. Simulation results show that the CNN-based solution closely approximates the optimal label performance while significantly reducing computational time compared to conventional high-complexity algorithms, enhancing its practicality for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>A data-driven model-free physical-informed deep operator network for solving nonlinear dynamic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existing physical-informed Deep Operator Networks are mostly based on either the well-known mathematical formula of the system or huge amounts of data for different scenarios. However, in some cases, it is difficult to get the exact mathematical formula and vast amounts of data in some dynamic systems, we can only get a few experimental data or limited mathematical information. To address the cases, we propose a data-driven model-free physical-informed Deep Operator Network (DeepOnet) framework to learn the nonlinear dynamic systems from few available data. We first explore the short-term dependence of the available data and use a surrogate machine learning model to extract the short-term dependence. Then, the surrogate machine learning model is incorporated into the DeepOnet as the physical information part. Then, the constructed DeepOnet is trained to simulate the system's dynamic response for given control inputs and initial conditions. Numerical experiments on different systems confirm that our DeepOnet framework learns to approximate the dynamic response of some nonlinear dynamic systems effectively.</description>

      <title>Elevation-Aware Supplementary Uplink for Direct Satellite-to-Device Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct satellite-to-device (DS2D) communication enables standard mobile devices to connect directly to low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, providing global coverage without reliance on terrestrial infrastructure. However, the DS2D uplink is fundamentally constrained by long propagation distances, severe path loss, and stringent user equipment (UE) power limits, making uplink reliability particularly challenging at low elevation angles and beam edges. This paper investigates the integration of supplementary uplink (SUL) technology into DS2D systems to enhance uplink robustness while preserving UE power efficiency. Leveraging the predictable geometry of LEO satellite orbits, we develop an elevation-aware SUL framework that adapts uplink operation across frequency bands based on elevation-dependent link margin estimates. The proposed approach schedules the UE to transmit on either a primary uplink carrier or a lower-frequency SUL carrier. An elevation-aware SUL activation algorithm with hysteresis is introduced to guide uplink carrier selection while preventing frequent switching. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SUL framework extends effective uplink coverage toward low-elevation and beam-edge regions, improves uplink availability over a satellite pass, and achieves stable operation with a minimal number of uplink transitions under realistic UE power constraints.</description>

      <title>An LLM-Enabled Frequency-Aware Flow Diffusion Model for Natural-Language-Guided Power System Scenario Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diverse and controllable scenario generation (e.g., wind, solar, load, etc.) is critical for robust power system planning and operation. As AI-based scenario generation methods are becoming the mainstream, existing methods (e.g., Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets) mainly rely on a fixed-length numerical conditioning vector to control the generation results, facing challenges in user conveniency and generation flexibility. In this paper, a natural-language-guided scenario generation framework, named LLM-enabled Frequency-aware Flow Diffusion (LFFD), is proposed to enable users to generate desired scenarios using plain human language. First, a pretrained LLM module is introduced to convert generation requests described by unstructured natural languages into ordered semantic space. Second, instead of using standard diffusion models, a flow diffusion model employing a rectified flow matching objective is introduced to achieve efficient and high-quality scenario generation, taking the LLM output as the model input. During the model training process, a frequency-aware multi-objective optimization algorithm is introduced to mitigate the frequency-bias issue. Meanwhile, a dual-agent framework is designed to create text-scenario training sample pairs as well as to standardize semantic evaluation. Experiments based on large-scale photovoltaic and load datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Sensor Scheduling Based on Node Partitioning of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a dynamic sensor scheduling method for sensor networks. In sensor network applications, we often need multiple equally-informative node subsets that are activated sequentially to make a sensor network robust against concentrated battery consumption and sensor failures. In addition, quality of these subsets changes dynamically and thus we must adapt those changes. To find those node subsets, we propose a graph node partitioning method based on sampling theory for graph signals. We aim to minimize the average reconstruction error for signals obtained at all node subsets, in contrast to conventional single subset selection. The graph node partitioning problem is formulated as a difference-of-convex (DC) optimization based on a subspace prior of graph signals, and is solved by the proximal DC algorithm. It guarantees convergence to a critical point. To accommodate the online scenario where the signal subspace and optimal partitioning may change over time, we adaptively estimate the signal subspace from historical data and sequentially update the prior for our partitioning method. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world sensor network data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower average mean squared errors compared to alternative methods.</description>

      <title>Extracting Patterns of Chemical Information from Differential Mobility Spectrometry Measurements under Varying Conditions of Humidity and Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential Mobility Spectrometry (DMS), also known as Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry, is a rapid and affordable technology for extracting information from gas phase samples containing complex volatile organic compounds, and can therefore be used for analyzing surgical smoke. One obstacle to its widespread application is the dependence of DMS measurements on humidity and, to a lesser degree, temperature, making comparison of data measured under different environmental conditions arbitrary. The commonly used solution is to regulate these environmental conditions to some predefined humidity and temperature levels. However, this approach is often unfeasible or even impossible. Therefore, in this paper we analyzed a dataset of 1,852 DMS measurements of surgical smoke evaporated from porcine adipose and muscle tissue to get an understanding of the impact of varying humidity and temperature on DMS measurements. Our analysis confirmed clear dependence of the measurements on these two factors. To overcome this challenge, we fitted regression models to raw and normalized DMS measurement data. Subsequently, these models were used for estimating DMS measurements for known tissue types based on recorded humidity and temperatures. Our test suggests that it is possible to estimate DMS measurements of surgical smoke from porcine adipose and muscle tissue under specific environmental conditions by standardizing DMS measurements separation voltage-wise and training multivariate regression models on the normalized data, which is the first step in removing the need for standardized measurement conditions.</description>

      <title>Active IoT User Detection in Near-Field with Location Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address active users detection (AUD) in near-field Internet of Things (IoT) networks by exploring prior knowledge of users' locations. We consider a scenario where users are distributed in a semi-circular area within the Rayleigh distance of a multi-antenna base station (BS). We propose the BS to use location estimates of the users to reconstruct their line-of-sight (LoS) channel components, hence assisting the AUD process. For this, the BS combines these reconstructed channels with users' pilot sequences, enhancing the correlation between received signals and active users. We formulate the location-aided AUD as a convex optimization problem, solved via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). {Our proposal has a higher computational complexity compared to the baseline ADMM approach where location information is not used. Moreover, the proposal requires location information of users, which can be readily informed if users are static, or inferred via established localization algorithms if they are mobile.} Simulation results compare our proposal against the baseline across varying systems parameters, such as number of users, pilot length and LoS component strength. We demonstrate that under perfect location estimation and strong LoS, our proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline. Furthermore, robustness analysis shows that performance gains persist under imperfect location estimation, provided the estimation error remains within bounds determined by the system parameters.</description>

      <title>Topological Signal Processing for 3D Point Cloud Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is to apply the topological signal processing (TSP) framework to the analysis of 3D Point Clouds (PCs) represented on simplicial complexes. Building on Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC) theory for vector fields, we introduce higher-order Laplacian operators that enable the processing of signals over triangular meshes. Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed approach allows us to characterize both color attributes, modeled as 3D vectors on nodes, and geometry, modeled as 3D vectors on the barycenter of each triangle. Then, we show as TSP tools may efficiently be used to sample, recover and filter PCs attributes treating them as edge signals. Numerical results on synthetic PCs demonstrate accurate color reconstruction with robustness to sparse data and geometry refinement in the case of noisy PC coordinates. The proposed approach provides a topology-based representation to characterize the geometry and attributes of PCs.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Accelerated Geometrical Simulation of Biological and Engineered In-Air Ultrasonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of in-air acoustic sensors for industrial monitoring and autonomous robotics has grown significantly, often drawing inspiration from biological echolocation. However, developing and validating these systems in existing simulation frameworks remains challenging due to the computational cost of simulating high-frequency wave propagation in large, dynamic, and complex environments. While wave-based methods offer high accuracy, they scale poorly with frequency and volume. Conversely, existing geometric acoustic solvers often lack support for dynamic scenes, complex diffraction, or closed-loop robotic integration. In this work, we introduce SonoTraceUE, a high-fidelity acoustic simulation framework built as a plugin for Unreal Engine. By using a hardware-accelerated ray tracing-based specular reflection model, and a curvature-based Monte Carlo diffraction model, the system enables near real-time simulation of active and passive acoustic sensing in dynamic, multi-material environments. We validate the framework through two distinct experimental domains: a bioacoustic study and a robotics experiment. Our results demonstrate that SonoTraceUE achieves high correlation with real-world spectral and spatial data. The framework provides a versatile platform for synthetic data generation, hypothesis testing in bioacoustics, and the rapid prototyping of closed-loop robotic systems that use acoustic sensing.</description>

      <title>Breaking the CP Limit: Robust Long-Range OFDM Sensing via Interference Cleaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based radar and integrated sensing and communication systems, the sensing range is traditionally limited by the round-trip time corresponding to the cyclic prefix duration. Targets whose echoes arrive after this duration induce intersymbol interference (ISI) and associated intercarrier interference (ICI), which significantly degrade detection performance, elevate the interference-noise floor in the radar image, and reduce the useful signal power due to window mismatch. Existing methods face a trade-off between recovering useful signal and suppressing interference, particularly in multi-target scenarios. This paper proposes two frameworks to resolve this dilemma, offering a flexible trade-off between computational cost and target detection performance. First, a signal model is derived, demonstrating that ISI and ICI-oriented interference often dominates thermal noise in high-dynamic-range scenarios. To combat the ISI and ICI-based interference-noise floor increase, joint-interference cancellation with coherent compensation is proposed. This approach is an efficient evolution of the successive-interference cancellation algorithm, utilizing high-precision chirp Z-transform estimation and frequency-domain coherent compensation to recover weak distant targets. For scenarios requiring maximum precision, the full reconstruction-based sliding window scheme is presented, which shifts the receive window to capture optimal signal energy while performing full-signal reconstruction for all detected targets. Numerical results show that both methods outperform state-of-the-art benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Chronological Causal Discovery with Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal discovery problems use a set of observations to deduce causality between variables in the real world, typically to answer questions about biological or physical systems. These observations are often recorded at regular time intervals, determined by a user or a machine, depending on the experiment design. There is generally no guarantee that the timing of these recordings matches the timing of the underlying biological or physical events. In this paper, we examine the sensitivity of causal discovery methods to this potential mismatch. We consider empirical and theoretical evidence to understand how causal discovery performance is impacted by changes of sampling rate and window length. We demonstrate that both classical and recent causal discovery methods exhibit sensitivity to these hyperparameters, and we discuss how ideas from signal processing may help us understand these phenomena.</description>

      <title>From High-Level Requirements to KPIs: Conformal Signal Temporal Logic Learning for Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Softwarized radio access networks (RANs), such as those based on the Open RAN (O-RAN) architecture, generate rich streams of key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be leveraged to extract actionable intelligence for network optimization. However, bridging the gap between low-level KPI measurements and high-level requirements, such as quality of experience (QoE), requires methods that are both relevant, capturing temporal patterns predictive of user-level outcomes, and interpretable, providing human-readable insights that operators can validate and act upon. This paper introduces conformal signal temporal logic learning (C-STLL), a framework that addresses both requirements. C-STLL leverages signal temporal logic (STL), a formal language for specifying temporal properties of time series, to learn interpretable formulas that distinguish KPI traces satisfying high-level requirements from those that do not. To ensure reliability, C-STLL wraps around existing STL learning algorithms with a conformal calibration procedure based on the Learn Then Test (LTT) framework. This procedure produces a set of STL formulas with formal guarantees: with high probability, the set contains at least one formula achieving a user-specified accuracy level. The calibration jointly optimizes for reliability, formula complexity, and diversity through principled acceptance and stopping rules validated via multiple hypothesis testing. Experiments using the ns-3 network simulator on a mobile gaming scenario demonstrate that C-STLL effectively controls risk below target levels while returning compact, diverse sets of interpretable temporal specifications that relate KPI behavior to QoE outcomes.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin--Driven Adaptive Wavelet Strategy for Efficient 6G Backbone Network Telemetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical orthogonal wavelets guarantee perfect reconstruction but rely on fixed bases optimized for polynomial smoothness, achieving suboptimal compression on signals with fractal spectral signatures. Conversely, learned methods offer adaptivity but typically enforce orthogonality via soft penalties, sacrificing structural guarantees.
  This work establishes a rigorous equivalence between Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA) tensor networks and paraunitary filter banks. The resulting framework learns adaptive wavelets while enforcing exact orthogonality through manifold-constrained optimization, guaranteeing perfect reconstruction and energy conservation throughout training.
  Validation on Long-Range Dependent (LRD) network traffic demonstrates that learned filters outperform classical wavelets by 0.5--3.8~dB PSNR on six MAWI backbone traces (2020--2025, 314~Mbps--1.75~Gbps) while preserving the Hurst exponent within estimation uncertainty ($|\Delta H| \le 0.03$). These results establish MERA-inspired wavelets as a principled approach for telemetry compression in 6G digital twin synchronization.</description>

      <title>On the Spatial Consistency of Sub-Terahertz Channel Characteristics for Beyond-6G Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ray tracing is a versatile approach for precise sub-terahertz (sub-THz, 100-300 GHz) channel modeling when designing new mechanisms for beyond-6G cellular systems. Theoretically, wireless channels may exhibit variations over wavelength distances. In the sub-THz band, close-to-millimeter wavelengths thus require extremely large computational efforts for ray-tracing modeling. However, in practice, channel characteristics may remain quantitatively similar over much larger distances, which can drastically decrease computational efforts. The aim of this study is to experimentally characterize the degree of spatial consistency in sub-THz channel characteristics. To this end, we performed a large-scale measurement campaign in the 140-150 GHz frequency band in an indoor-hall (InH) environment and characterized the channel at separation distances from 2.5 mm up to 1 m. Our results show that channel characteristics including delay spread, angular delay spread, and K-factor change only slightly over multiple tens of centimeter distances. This implies that, in the considered InH environment, the mesh grid can be in the range of 10-50 wavelengths (at 145 GHz) along stable line-of-sight (LoS) directions, while a finer resolution is needed in regions not dominated by LoS. For coarser grids, advanced interpolation is required to capture rapidly varying scattered components.</description>

      <title>Dual Security for MIMO-OFDM ISAC Systems: Artificial Ghosts or Artificial Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables the efficient sharing of wireless resources to support emerging applications, but it also gives rise to new sensing-based security vulnerabilities. Here, potential communication security threats whereby confidential messages intended for legitimate users are intercepted, but also unauthorized receivers (Eves) can passively exploit target echoes to infer sensing parameters without users being aware. Despite these risks, the joint protection of sensing and communication security in ISAC systems remains unexplored. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a two-layer dual-secure ISAC framework that simultaneously protects sensing and communication against passive sensing Eves and communication Eves, without requiring their channel state information (CSI). Specifically, transmit beamformers are jointly designed to inject artificial noise (AN) to introduce interference to communication Eves, while deliberately distorting the reference signal available to sensing Eves to impair their sensing capability. Furthermore, the proposed design generates artificial ghosts (AGs) with fake angle-range-velocity profiles observable by all receivers. Legitimate receivers can suppress these AGs, whereas sensing Eves cannot, thereby significantly reducing their probability of correctly detecting the true targets. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively enhances both communication and sensing security, while preserving the performance of communication users and legitimate sensing receivers.</description>

      <title>Support Vector Data Description for Radar Target Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical radar detection techniques rely on adaptive detectors that estimate the noise covariance matrix from target-free secondary data. While effective in Gaussian environments, these methods degrade in the presence of clutter, which is better modeled by heavy-tailed distributions such as the Complex Elliptically Symmetric (CES) and Compound-Gaussian (CGD) families. Robust covariance estimators like M-estimators or Tyler's estimator address this issue, but still struggle when thermal noise combines with clutter. To overcome these challenges, we investigate the use of Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) and its deep extension, Deep SVDD, for target detection. These one-class learning methods avoid direct noise covariance estimation and are adapted here as CFAR detectors. We propose two novel SVDD-based detection algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness on simulated radar data.</description>

      <title>DCInject: Persistent Backdoor Attacks via Frequency Manipulation in Personal Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) creates client-specific models to handle data heterogeneity. Previously, PFL has been shown to be naturally resistant to backdoor attack propagation across clients. In this work, we reveal that PFL remains vulnerable to backdoor attacks through a novel frequency-domain approach. We propose DCInject, an adaptive frequency-domain backdoor attack for PFL, which removes portions of the zero-frequency (DC) component and replaces them with Gaussian-distributed samples in the frequency domain. Our attack achieves superior attack success rates while maintaining clean accuracy across four datasets (CIFAR-10/100, GTSRB, SVHN) compared to existing spatial-domain attacks, evaluated under parameter decoupling based personalization. DCInject achieves superior performance with ASRs of 96.83% (CIFAR-10), 99.38% (SVHN), and 100% (GTSRB) while maintaining clean accuracy. Under I-BAU defense, DCInject demonstrates strong persistence, retaining 90.30% ASR vs BadNet's 58.56% on VGG-16, exposing critical vulnerabilities in PFL security assumptions.

      <title>Shift-invariant spaces on finite undirected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shift-invariant spaces (SISs) on the real line provide a natural framework for representing, analyzing and processing signals with inherent shift-invariant structure. In this paper, we extend this framework to the finite undirected graph setting by introducing the concept of graph shift-invariant spaces (GSISs). We examine several properties of GSISs, including their characterization via range functions and fiber functions in the Fourier domain, their connections to shift-invariant filters and polynomial filters, the frame and Riesz basis structures of finitely generated GSISs, and their intricate relationships with bandlimited spaces, finitely generated GSISs, and graph reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces with shift-invariant reproducing kernels (SIGRKHSs). Our analysis reveals several distinctions between SISs on the line and GSISs, such as the shift-invariance of the frame operator, the existence of shift-invariant dual frames, the emergence of fractional shift-invariance, and the interrelationships among GSISs, finitely generated GSISs, SIGRKHSs and bandlimited spaces.
  In this paper, we also introduce a spectral decomposition of the identity associated with graph shifts and propose a novel definition of the graph Fourier transform (GFT) of spectral type, together with explicit formulations for the GFTs on complete graphs and circulant graphs. In addition, we establish a clear connection between polynomial filters and shift-invariant filters, and we derive a graph uncertainty principle governing the essential supports of a nonzero graph signal and its GFT.</description>

      <title>Metasurfaces-Integrated Wireless Neural Networks for Lightweight Over-The-Air Edge Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming sixth Generation (6G) of wireless networks envisions ultra-low latency and energy efficient Edge Inference (EI) for diverse Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, traditional digital hardware for machine learning is power intensive, motivating the need for alternative computation paradigms. Over-The-Air (OTA) computation is regarded as an emerging transformative approach assigning the wireless channel to actively perform computational tasks. This article introduces the concept of Metasurfaces-Integrated Neural Networks (MINNs), a physical-layer-enabled deep learning framework that leverages programmable multi-layer metasurface structures and Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels to realize computational layers in the wave propagation domain. The MINN system is conceptualized as three modules: Encoder, Channel (uncontrollable propagation features and metasurfaces), and Decoder. The first and last modules, realized respectively at the multi-antenna transmitter and receiver, consist of conventional digital or purposely designed analog Deep Neural Network (DNN) layers, and the metasurfaces responses of the Channel module are optimized alongside all modules as trainable weights. This architecture enables computation offloading into the end-to-end physical layer, flexibly among its constituent modules, achieving performance comparable to fully digital DNNs while significantly reducing power consumption. The training of the MINN framework, two representative variations, and performance results for indicative applications are presented, highlighting the potential of MINNs as a lightweight and sustainable solution for future EI-enabled wireless systems. The article is concluded with a list of open challenges and promising research directions.</description>

      <title>Physics-Compliant Modeling and Optimization of MIMO Systems Aided by Microwave Linear Analog Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave linear analog computer (MiLAC) has emerged as a promising architecture for implementing linear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing in the analog domain, with radio frequency (RF) signals. Existing studies on MiLAC-aided communications rely on idealized channel models and neglect antenna mutual coupling. However, since MiLAC performs processing at RF, mutual coupling becomes critical and alters the implemented operation, not only the channel characteristics. In this paper, we develop a physics-compliant model for MiLAC-aided MIMO systems accounting for mutual coupling with multiport network theory. We derive end-to-end system models for scenarios with MiLACs at the transmitter, the receiver, or both, showing how mutual coupling impacts the linear transformation implemented by the MiLACs. Furthermore, we formulate and solve a mutual coupling aware MiLAC optimization problem, deriving a closed-form globally optimal solution that maximizes the received signal power. We establish the fundamental performance limits of MiLAC with mutual coupling, and derive three analytical results. First, mutual coupling is beneficial in MiLAC-aided systems, on average. Second, with mutual coupling, MiLAC performs as digital architectures equipped with a matching network, while having fewer RF chains. Third, with mutual coupling, MiLAC always outperforms digital architectures with no matching network. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>DECAF: Dynamic Envelope Context-Aware Fusion for Speech-Envelope Reconstruction from EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the speech audio envelope from scalp neural recordings (EEG) is a central task for decoding a listener's attentional focus in applications like neuro-steered hearing aids. Current methods for this reconstruction, however, face challenges with fidelity and noise. Prevailing approaches treat it as a static regression problem, processing each EEG window in isolation and ignoring the rich temporal structure inherent in continuous speech. This study introduces a new, dynamic framework for envelope reconstruction that leverages this structure as a predictive temporal prior. We propose a state-space fusion model that combines direct neural estimates from EEG with predictions from recent speech context, using a learned gating mechanism to adaptively balance these cues. To validate this approach, we evaluate our model on the ICASSP 2023 Stimulus Reconstruction benchmark demonstrating significant improvements over static, EEG-only baselines. Our analyses reveal a powerful synergy between the neural and temporal information streams. Ultimately, this work reframes envelope reconstruction not as a simple mapping, but as a dynamic state-estimation problem, opening a new direction for developing more accurate and coherent neural decoding systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Learning using Time-Resolved Measurement Data and its Application to Gene Regulatory Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new Hamiltonian-learning framework based on time-resolved measurement data from a fixed local IC-POVM and its application to inferring gene regulatory networks. We introduce the quantum Hamiltonian-based gene-expression model (QHGM), in which gene interactions are encoded as a parameterized Hamiltonian that governs gene expression evolution over pseudotime. We derive finite-sample recovery guarantees and establish upper bounds on the number of time and measurement samples required for accurate parameter estimation with high probability, scaling polynomially with system size. To recover the QHGM parameters, we develop a scalable variational learning algorithm based on empirical risk minimization. Our method recovers network structure efficiently on synthetic benchmarks and reveals novel, biologically plausible regulatory connections in Glioblastoma single-cell RNA sequencing data, highlighting its potential in cancer research. This framework opens new directions for applying quantum-like modeling to biological systems beyond the limits of classical inference.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Underwater Acoustic Communications with Limited Feedback: An AoI-Aware Hierarchical Bandit Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater Acoustic (UWA) networks are vital for remote sensing and ocean exploration but face inherent challenges such as limited bandwidth, long propagation delays, and highly dynamic channels. These constraints hinder real-time communication and degrade overall system performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a bilevel Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework. At the fast inner level, a Contextual Delayed MAB (CD-MAB) jointly optimizes adaptive modulation and transmission power based on both channel state feedback and its Age of Information (AoI), thereby maximizing throughput. At the slower outer level, a Feedback Scheduling MAB dynamically adjusts the channel-state feedback interval according to throughput dynamics: stable throughput allows longer update intervals, while throughput drops trigger more frequent updates. This adaptive mechanism reduces feedback overhead and enhances responsiveness to varying network conditions. The proposed bilevel framework is computationally efficient and well-suited to resource-constrained UWA networks. Simulation results using the DESERT Underwater Network Simulator demonstrate throughput gains of up to 20.61% and energy savings of up to 36.60% compared with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) baselines reported in the existing literature.</description>

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a potential candidate for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) 2.0 technology due to its low cost, ease of deployment, energy efficiency and extended coverage. This chapter investigates the slot-by-slot IRS reflection pattern design and two-timescale reflection pattern design schemes, respectively. For the slot-by-slot reflection optimization, we propose exploiting an IRS to improve the propagation channel rank in mmWave massive MIMO systems without need to increase the transmit power budget. Then, we analyze the impact of the distributed IRS on the channel rank. To further reduce the heavy overhead of channel training, channel state information (CSI) estimation, and feedback in time-varying MIMO channels, we present a two-timescale reflection optimization scheme, where the IRS is configured relatively infrequently based on statistical CSI (S-CSI) and the active beamformers and power allocation are updated based on quickly outdated instantaneous CSI (I-CSI) per slot. The achievable average sum-rate (AASR) of the system is maximized without excessive overhead of cascaded channel estimation. A recursive sampling particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed to optimize the large-timescale IRS reflection pattern efficiently with reduced samplings of channel samples.</description>

      <title>Topographic Temperature: A Maximum-Entropy State Description of Running-In Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface topography governs tribological performance, yet conventional parameters describe either amplitude statistics or spectral content in isolation. We introduce a scale-dependent framework that represents surface height and directional gradient as conjugate coordinates of a structural phase space. The elastic reference energy derived from Persson's contact mechanics theory defines a metric that couples surface geometry to the elastic half-space response. A maximum-entropy formulation yields a canonical state density. In the Gaussian limit this formulation recovers Persson's spectral description exactly, showing that the power spectral density is a complete contact mechanical descriptor only under Gaussian statistics. The associated Lagrange multiplier defines a topographic temperature in the sense of Grmela's multiscale thermodynamics and embeds the areal subsystem within a scale-dependent boundary potential. The framework is validated experimentally using ground and honed AISI 52100 steel discs before and after running in. The ground surface contracts toward lower entropy and elastic energy, whereas the honed surface expands into previously unoccupied states. These opposite trajectories become transparent only in the coupled height-gradient representation and highlight the role of the principal directional gradient for scale-aware surface metrology.</description>

      <title>The Mean of Multi-Object Trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of a mean for trajectories and multi-object trajectories (defined as sets or multi-sets of trajectories) along with algorithms for computing them. Specifically, we use the Fr\'{e}chet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fr\'{e}chet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.</description>

      <title>Localized kernel method for separation of linear chirps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of separating a superposition of signals into its individual components is a common challenge encountered in various signal processing applications, especially in domains such as audio and radar signals. A previous paper by Chui and Mhaskar proposes a method called Signal Separation Operator (SSO) to find the instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes of such superpositions where both of these change continuously and slowly over time. In this paper, we amplify and modify this method in order to separate chirp signals in the presence of crossovers, a very low SNR, and discontinuities. We give a theoretical analysis of the behavior of SSO in the presence of noise to examine the relationship between the minimal separation, minimal amplitude, SNR, and sampling frequency. Our method is illustrated with a few examples, and numerical results are reported on a simulated dataset comprising 7 simulated signals.</description>

      <title>Compressed Multiband Sensing in FR3 Using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint detection and localization of users and scatterers in multipath-rich channels on multiple bands is critical for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G. Existing multiband sensing methods are limited by classical beamforming or computationally expensive approaches. This paper introduces alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-assisted compressed multiband sensing (CMS), hereafter referred to as ADMM-CMS, which is a novel framework for multiband sensing using uplink quadrature amplitude modulation-modulated pilot symbols. To solve the CMS problem, we develop an adaptive ADMM algorithm that adjusts to noise and ensures automatic stopping if converged. ADMM combines the decomposability of dual ascent with the robustness of augmented Lagrangian methods, making it suitable for large-scale structured optimization. Simulations show that ADMM-CMS achieves higher spatial resolution and improved denoising compared to Bartlett-type beamforming, yielding a 34 dB gain in per-antenna transmit power for achieving a 0.9 successful recovery probability (SRP). Moreover, compared to performing compressed sensing separately on the constituent 7 GHz and 10 GHz sub-bands, ADMM-CMS achieves reductions in delay root mean squared error of 34.46% and 40.76%, respectively, at -41 dBm per-antenna transmit power, while also yielding improved SRP. Our findings demonstrate ADMM-CMS as an efficient enabler of ISAC in frequency range 3 (FR3, 7-24 GHz) for 6G systems.</description>

      <title>RFI Detection and Identification at OVRO Using Pseudonymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protecting passive radio astronomy observatories from unintended radio-frequency interference (RFI) is increasingly challenging as wireless activity expands near protected bands. While radio quiet zones, database-driven coordination, and post-processing mitigation can reduce interference risk, they often lack the ability to attribute detected RFI to a specific transmitter, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes where conventional demodulation is infeasible. This paper presents the first over-the-air field demonstration of Pseudonymetry at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO), evaluating an accountable coexistence approach between heterogeneous systems: an SDR-based narrowband OFDM transmitter and a wideband radio telescope backend. The transmitter embeds a pseudonym watermark on a dedicated OFDM subcarrier using coded power modulation, while OVRO passively extracts the watermark from standard backend spectrogram (power) products without IQ access. We develop a spectrogram-only receiver that performs correlation-based packet alignment, compensates timing resolution mismatch via resampling, and decodes pseudonym bits using energy-domain template matching. Field results across -20 to -5 dB SNR show that pseudonym watermarks can be recovered at low SNR, enabling practical transmitter attribution using only passive backend measurements. These findings suggest that observatories can support lightweight accountability mechanisms that complement dynamic protection and enforcement-oriented spectrum sharing frameworks.</description>

      <title>Mutual Coupling Aware Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided Multi-User mmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a three-stage uplink channel estimation protocol for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multi-user (MU) millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, where both the base station (BS) and the RIS are equipped with uniform planar arrays (UPAs). The proposed approach explicitly accounts for the mutual coupling (MC) effect, modeled via scattering parameter multiport network theory. In Stage~I, a dimension-reduced subspace-based method is proposed to estimate the common angle of arrival (AoA) at the BS using the received signals across all users. In Stage~II, MC-aware cascaded channel estimation is performed for a typical user. The equivalent measurement vectors for each cascaded path are extracted and the reference column is reconstructed using a compressed sensing (CS)-based approach. By leveraging the structure of the cascaded channel, the reference column is rearranged to estimate the AoA at the RIS, thereby reducing the computational complexity associated with estimating other columns. Additionally, the common angle of departure (AoD) at the RIS is also obtained in this stage, which significantly reduces the pilot overhead for estimating the cascaded channels of other users in Stage~III. The RIS phase shift training matrix is designed to optimize performance in the presence of MC and outperforms random phase scheme. Simulation results validate that the proposed method yields better performance than the MC-unaware and existing approaches in terms of estimation accuracy and pilot efficiency.</description>

      <title>PalpAid: Multimodal Pneumatic Tactile Sensor for Tissue Palpation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tactile properties of tissue, such as elasticity and stiffness, often play an important role in surgical oncology when identifying tumors and pathological tissue boundaries. Though extremely valuable, robot-assisted surgery comes at the cost of reduced sensory information to the surgeon, with vision being the primary. Sensors proposed to overcome this sensory desert are often bulky, complex, and incompatible with the surgical workflow. We present PalpAid, a multimodal pneumatic tactile sensor to restore touch in robot-assisted surgery. PalpAid is equipped with a microphone and pressure sensor, converting contact force into an internal pressure differential. The pressure sensor acts as an event detector, while the acoustic signature assists in tissue identification. We show the design, fabrication, and assembly of sensory units with characterization tests for robustness to use, repetition cycles, and integration with a robotic system. Finally, we demonstrate the sensor's ability to classify 3D-printed hard objects with varying infills and soft ex vivo tissues. We envision PalpAid to be easily retrofitted with existing surgical/general robotic systems, allowing soft tissue palpation.</description>

      <title>NeuroSleep: Neuromorphic Event-Driven Single-Channel EEG Sleep Staging for Edge-Efficient Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective. Reliable, continuous neural sensing on wearable edge platforms is fundamental to long-term health monitoring; however, for electroencephalography (EEG)-based sleep monitoring, dense high-frequency processing is often computationally prohibitive under tight energy budgets. Approach. To address this bottleneck, this paper proposes NeuroSleep, an integrated event-driven sensing and inference system for energy-efficient sleep staging. NeuroSleep first converts raw EEG into complementary multi-scale bipolar event streams using Residual Adaptive Multi-Scale Delta Modulation (R-AMSDM), enabling an explicit fidelity-sparsity trade-off at the sensing front end. Furthermore, NeuroSleep adopts a hierarchical inference architecture that comprises an Event-based Adaptive Multi-scale Response (EAMR) module for local feature extraction, a Local Temporal-Attention Module (LTAM) for context aggregation, and an Epoch-Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ELIF) module to capture long-term state persistence. Main results. Experimental results using subject-independent 5-fold cross-validation on the Sleep-EDF Expanded sleep-cassette (SC) subset with single-channel EEG demonstrate that NeuroSleep achieves a mean accuracy of 74.2% with only 0.932 M parameters while reducing sparsity-adjusted effective operations by approximately 53.6% relative to dense processing. Compared to the representative dense Transformer baseline, NeuroSleep improves accuracy by 7.5% with a 45.8% reduction in computational load. Significance. By coupling neuromorphic event encoding with state-aware context modeling, NeuroSleep offers a deployment-oriented framework for single-channel sleep staging that reduces redundant high-rate processing and improves energy scalability for wearable and edge platforms.</description>

      <title>Model Selection and Parameter Estimation of One-Dimensional Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of learning one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) with a specific focus on estimating both the model order and the mixing distribution from independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. This paper establishes the optimal sampling complexity for model order estimation in one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models. We prove a fundamental lower bound on the number of samples required to correctly identify the number of components with high probability, showing that this limit depends critically on the separation between component means and the total number of components.
  We then propose a Fourier-based approach to estimate both the model order and the mixing distribution. Our algorithm utilizes Fourier measurements constructed from the samples, and our analysis demonstrates that its sample complexity matches the established lower bound, thereby confirming its optimality. Numerical experiments further show that our method outperforms conventional techniques in terms of efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Interpretability with Sparse Autoencoder Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce sparse autoencoder neural operators (SAE-NOs), a new class of sparse autoencoders that operate directly in infinite-dimensional function spaces. We generalize the linear representation hypothesis to a functional representation hypothesis, enabling concept learning beyond vector-valued representations. Unlike standard SAEs that employ multi-layer perceptrons (SAE-MLP) to each concept with a scalar activation, we introduce and formalize sparse autoencoder neural operators (SAE-NOs), which extend vector-valued representations to functional ones. We instantiate this framework as SAE Fourier neural operators (SAE-FNOs), parameterizing concepts as integral operators in the Fourier domain. We show that this functional parameterization fundamentally shapes learned concepts, leading to improved stability with respect to sparsity level, robustness to distribution shifts, and generalization across discretizations. We show that SAE-FNO is more efficient in concept utilization across data population and more effective in extracting localized patterns from data. We show that convolutional SAEs (SAE-CNNs) do not generalize their sparse representations to unseen input resolutions, whereas SAE-FNOs operate across resolutions and reliably recover the underlying representations. Our results demonstrate that moving from fixed-dimensional to functional representations extends sparse autoencoders from detectors of concept presence to models that capture the underlying structure of the data, highlighting parameterization as a central driver of interpretability and generalization.</description>
