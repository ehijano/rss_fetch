      <title>Integral formulas for under/overdetermined differential operators via recovery on curves and the finite-dimensional cokernel condition I: General theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new versatile method for constructing solution operators (i.e., right-inverses up to a finite rank operator) for a wide class of underdetermined PDEs $P u = f$, which are regularizing of optimal order and, more interestingly, whose integral kernels have certain prescribed support properties. By duality, we simultaneously obtain integral representation formulas (i.e., left-inverses up to a finite rank operator) for overdetermined PDEs $P^{\ast} v = g$ with analogous properties, which lead to Poincar\'e- or Korn-type inequalities. Our method applies to operators such as the divergence, linearized scalar curvature, and linearized Einstein constraint operators (which are underdetermined), as well as the gradient, Hessian, trace-free part of the Hessian, Killing, and conformal Killing operators (which are overdetermined).
  The starting point for our construction is a condition - dubbed the recovery on curves condition (RC) - that leads to Green's functions for $P$ supported on prescribed curves. Then the desired integral solution operators (and, by duality, integral representation formulas) are obtained by taking smooth averages over a suitable family of curves. This procedure generalizes the previous constructions of Bogovskii, Oh-Tataru, and Reshetnyak. We furthermore identify a simple algebraic sufficient condition for (RC), namely, that the principal symbol $p(x, \xi)$ of $P$ is full-rank for all non-zero complex vectors $\xi$ (as opposed to real, as in ellipticity). When the principal symbol has constant coefficients, this is equivalent to (RC) and also to the condition that the formal cokernel of $P$ (without any boundary conditions) is finite-dimensional; for this reason, we call it the finite-dimensional cokernel condition (FC). We give a short proof that all operators above satisfy (FC), and thus (RC).
  Various applications will be considered in subsequent papers.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Games of Controls with Fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a fractional mean field game of controls system, showing existence of solutions when the order of the fractional Laplacian is $s\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$. Here the running cost depends on the distribution $\mu$ of not only the states but also optimal strategies. The coupling is assumed to satisfy the Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition. We derive three types of a priori estimates on solutions. First, we use the monotonicity condition to derive moment estimates on $\mu$. Second, we derive abstract estimates on fractional parabolic equations and apply them to the mean field game. Third, we derive new estimates on the time regularity of the distribution $\mu$ by analyzing the associated L\'evy process. We apply these estimates and the Leray-Schauder fixed point theorem to establish existence of solutions.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Solvability of the Parabolic $L^p$ Dirichlet Problem on Lipschitz Graph Domains Via Carleson Measure Estimates of Bounded Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that if the bounded solutions to the parabolic Dirichlet problem on a Lipshitz-$\left[1,\frac{1}{2}\right]$ domain obey a Carleson measure estimate, then the corresponding parabolic measure on the boundary will belong to class $A^\infty$, which is equivalent to $L^p$ solvability for some $p&lt;\infty$. This improves the existing literature which places additional assumptions on the parabolic uniform rectifiability or, equivalently, on the half-order time derivative of the function whose graph defines the boundary of the domain.</description>

      <title>Stability and Self-Organized Patterns in Coupled Ecohydrological--Fire Dynamics: A Model of Vegetation--Rainfall--Bushfire Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the conditions for the stability and emergence of patterns in a new three-component reaction-diffusion system. The system describes the coexistence and interaction of water reservoirs, vegetation, and bushfire activity in a given ecosystem.
  We perform a detailed stability analysis to determine the parameter space where an unstable homogeneous equilibrium becomes stable with respect to spatially nonuniform perturbations.
  We also use diffusion to generate traveling trains in the form of periodic orbits of the linearized system. These orbits are remnants of an unstable equilibrium in the absence of diffusion and arise from a nonsingular eigenvalue crossing of the imaginary axis, while a third eigenvalue remains real and negative, thereby ensuring linear stability for monocromatic waves.
  These phenomena differ from ``classical'' Turing and Hopf bifurcations, as the model does not involve distinct ``activators'' and ``inhibitors'', and the effects observed are not the byproduct of diffusion with necessarily differing speeds. Also, differently from the classical Turing pattern, the role of diffusion in this context is to stabilize, rather than destabilize, homogeneous equilibria.
  We also consider the case of plant competition, showing a suitable form of Turing instability for slow-frequency oscillations in a small rainfall regime.</description>

      <title>Regularity and existence for a mixed local-nonlocal parabolic equation with variable singularities and measure data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proves the existence, non-existence, regularity and asymptotic behavior of weak solutions for a class of mixed local-nonlocal parabolic problems involving singular nonlinearities and measure data extending the works of \cite{sanjitgarain,lazermc}. A central contribution of this work is the inclusion of a variable singular exponent. We examine both the purely singular and perturbed singular cases in the context of measure-valued data, where the source terms can simultaneously take the form of measures. To the best of our knowledge, this phenomenon is new, even in the case of a constant singular exponent involving only a local operator. Further, all our results are also true for the operator being local only.</description>

      <title>Determining a parabolic-elliptic-elliptic system by boundary observation of its non-negative solutions under chemotaxis background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a profoundly challenging inverse problem that has remained largely unexplored due to its mathematical complexity: the unique identification of all unknown coefficients in a coupled nonlinear system of mixed parabolic-elliptic-elliptic type using only boundary measurements. The system models attraction-repulsion chemotaxis--an advanced mathematical biology framework for studying sophisticated cellular processes--yet despite its significant practical importance, the corresponding inverse problem has never been investigated, representing a true frontier in the field. The mixed-type nature of this system introduces significant theoretical difficulties that render conventional methodologies inadequate, demanding fundamental extensions beyond existing techniques developed for simpler, purely parabolic models. Technically, the problem presents formidable obstacles: the coupling between parabolic and elliptic components creates inherent analytical complications, while the nonlinear structure resists standard approaches. From an applied perspective, the biological relevance adds another layer of complexity, as solutions must maintain physical interpretability through non-negativity constraints. Our work provides a complete theoretical framework for this challenging problem, establishing rigorous unique identifiability results that create a one-to-one correspondence between boundary data and the model's parameters. We demonstrate the power of our general theory through a central biological application: the full parameter recovery for an attraction-repulsion chemotaxis model with logistic growth, thus opening new avenues for quantitative analysis in mathematical biology.</description>

      <title>Spectral scheme for an energetic Fokker-Planck equation with $\kappa$-distribution steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concern of the present paper is the design of efficient numerical schemes for a specific Fokker-Planck equation describing the dynamics of energetic particles occurring in thermonuclear fusion plasmas (runaway electrons for example). In the long-time limit, the velocity distribution function of these particles tends towards a thermal non-equilibrium $\kappa$-distribution function which is a steady-state of the considered Fokker-Planck equation. These $\kappa$-distribution functions have the particularity of being only algebraically decaying for large velocities, thus describing very well suprathermal particle populations. Our aim is to present two efficient spectral methods for the simulation of such energetic particle dynamics. The first method will be based on rational Chebyshev basis functions, rather than on Hermite basis sets, which are the basis of choice for Maxwellian steady states. The second method is based on a different polynomial basis set, constructed via the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalisation process. These two new spectral schemes, specifically adapted to the here considered physical context, shall permit to cope with the long-time asymptotics without significant numerical costs.</description>

      <title>Blowup of solutions for compressible viscoelastic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove finite-time blowup of classical solutions for the compressible Upper Convective Maxwell (UCM) viscoelastic fluid system. By establishing a key energy identity and adapting Sideris' method for compressible flows, we derive a Riccati-type inequality for a momentum functional. For initial data with compactly supported perturbations satisfying a sufficiently large condition, all classical solutions lose regularity in finite time. This constitutes the first rigorous blowup result for multidimensional compressible viscoelastic fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a multi--particle model including a kinetic energy and a non linear local self-interaction, both in the bosonic and fermionic cases. In both cases, we prove that the model is well-posed if the number of particles is large enough. In particular, we show that there is a nonlinearity for which the model with $N=2$ particles is well-posed, while the model with $N=1$ is not.</description>

      <title>A Formal Derivation of the Thick Spray Model from the Enskog-Boltzmann System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a specific scaling that formally derives the Euler-Vlasov model for thick sprays which is widely adopted in engineering from the Boltzmann-Enskog model. Beyond validating the kinetic-fluid equations underlying this model, we also identify higher-order corrections of the viscous force (of the order of the volume of the dispersed phase), which is neglected due to the incorporation of the volume fraction (void) function. Our approach builds on the work [Laurent Desvillettes, Fran\c{c}ois Golse, and Valeria Ricci. A formal passage from a system of Boltzmann equations for mixtures towards a Vlasov-Euler system of compressible fluids. Acta Mathematicae Applicatae Sinica, English Series, 35(1):158-173, Jan 2019.], who formally connected a system of coupled Boltzmann equations for binary mixtures to a Vlasov-Euler system for thin sprays.</description>

      <title>Serrin's overdetermined theorem within Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$ be a Lipschitz domain, $K$ be a (bounded) ellipsoid centered at the origin and $H$ be the associated Wulff potential. We prove that, % under a $L^2$-Dini-VMO condition and a non-degeneracy condition on $|Du|$ near the boundary, $\Omega$ satisfies the following Serrin-type overdetermined system
  $$u \in W^{1,2}(\mathbb R^n), \quad u=0\ \text{ a.e. in }\R^n\setminus \Omega,\quad \Delta_H u=\mathbf{c}\mathscr{H}^{n-1}|_{\partial^*\Omega} - \mathbf{1}_{\Omega}\,dx,$$
  in the weak sense if and only if $\Omega$ is homothetic to $K$. Here $\Delta_H$ denotes the anisotropic Laplacian associated to $H$, and $\mathscr H^{n-1}$ denotes the $(n-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure. % Furthermore, the two conditions on $|Du|$ become redundant when $\Delta_H$ reduces to the standard Euclidean Laplacian. Our approach offers an alternative proof to [11] in the case of Lipschitz domains, introducing a novel viewpoint to settle [13, Question 7.1].</description>

      <title>Saddle Point Configurations for Spherical Ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate saddle point configurations in spherical ferromagnets with perpendicular anisotropy. These are modeled by a micromagnetic energy functional on the unit sphere that leads to the emergence of the so-called curvature induced Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction. For this functional we establish the existence of two distinct types of saddle points with zero mapping degree. We use a parabolic flow approach inspired by the harmonic map heat flow where for certain highly symmetric initial conditions we can rule out finite and infinite time blowup. Hence, we obtain solutions of the underlying Euler--Lagrange equation in the long time limit. This is in contrast to harmonic maps between two-spheres, where every map is a local minimizer of the energy functional.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gutzwiller trace formula relates the asymptotic spacing of quantum-mechanical energy levels in the semiclassical limit to the dynamics of periodic classical particle trajectories. We generalize this result to the case of non-smooth potentials, for which there is partial reflection of energy from derivative discontinuities of the potential. It is the periodic trajectories of an associated branching dynamics that contribute to the trace asymptotics in this more general setting; we obtain a precise description of their contribution.</description>

We use a functional calculus for the latter type of operators to construct a general class of bounded linear operators that in particular contains the propagators (solution operators) of the considered equations.

      <title>Geometry of wave damping on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy decay rates of damped waves on the torus depend on the behavior of the damping near the undamped region and on the geometry of the damped set. In this paper we refine these geometric considerations, by introducing the concept of order of a glancing undamped point, and estimating decay rates in terms of this order. The proof is based on generalizing an averaging argument due to Sun. We also show that damping sets which attain these improvements are generic among polygons and smooth curves.</description>

      <title>Compactness for the Hardy-Sobolev equation on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M, g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $n \geq 3$, and let $h \in C^1(M)$ be such that the operator $\Delta_g + h$ is coercive. Fix $x_0 \in M$ and $s \in (0, 2)$. We obtain uniform bounds on the solutions of the critical \emph{Hardy-Sobolev equation}: \begin{equation}\label{HS0} \tag{{\color{MainRed}HS}} \left\{\begin{array}{ll} \Delta_{g}u + hu = \frac{u^{\crits-1}}{d_{g}(\xo,x)^{s}} &amp; \hbox{ in }M\setminus\{\xo\}, \\ \qquad u &gt; 0 &amp;\hbox{ in }M\setminus\{\xo\}, \end{array}\right. \end{equation} where $\Delta_{g}:=-\diver_{g}(\nabla)$ and $\crits:=2(n-s)/(n-2)$. More precisely, we assume $h(x_0)&lt;\frac{(n-2)(6-s)}{12(2n-2-s)}\mathrm{Scal}_g(x_0),$ when $n \geq 4$, and $h\le\frac{1}{8}\sg$, $h(\xo)&lt;\frac{1}{8}\sg(\xo)$ when $n = 3$. Here, $\mathrm{Scal}_g$ denotes the scalar curvature of $(M, g)$. These conditions were introduced in \cite{HCA4}, and shown to be optimal in \cite{CAR} for a single bubble configuration when $n\ge7$ .
  \noindent We do not assume any bounds on the energy or the Sobolev norm of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Existence and Non-existence for Continuous Generalized Exchange-Driven Growth model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous generalized exchange-driven growth model (CGEDG) is a coagulation-fragmentation equation that describes the evolution of the macroscopic cluster size distribution induced by a microscopic dynamic of binary exchanges of masses between clusters. It models droplet formation, migration dynamics, and asset exchanges in various scientific and socio-economic contexts. It can also be viewed as a generalization of the continuous Smoluchowski equations. In this work, we show the existence and uniqueness of solutions for kernels with superlinear growth at infinity and singularity at the origin and show the non-existence of solutions for kernels with sufficiently rapid growth. The latter result is shown via the finite-time gelation and instantaneous gelation in the sense of moment blow-up.</description>

      <title>Solving Inverse Acoustic Obstacle Scattering Problem with Phaseless Far-Field Measurement Using Deep Neural Network Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) as surrogates for solving the inverse acoustic scattering problem of recovering a sound-soft obstacle from phaseless far-field measurements. We approximate the forward maps from the obstacle to the far-field data using DNNs, and for star-shaped domains in two and three dimensions, we establish the expression rates for fully connected feedforward neural networks with the ReLU activation for approximating the forward maps. The analysis is based on the weak formulation of the direct problem, and can handle variable coefficients. Numerically we validate the accuracy of the DNN surrogates of the forward maps, and demonstrate the use of DNN surrogates in the Bayesian treatment of the inverse obstacle scattering problem. Numerical experiments indicate that the surrogates are effective in both two- and three-dimensional cases, and can significantly speed up the exploration of the posterior distribution of the shape parameters using Markov chain Monte Carlo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an abstract infinite dimensional KAM theorem, which could be applied to prove the existence and linear stability of small-amplitude quasi-periodic solutions for one dimensional forced Kirchhoff equations with periodic boundary conditions
  \[ u_{tt}-(1+\int_{0}^{2\pi} |u_x|^2 dx)u_{xx}+
  M_\xi u+\epsilon g(\bar{\omega}t,x) =0,\quad u(t,x+2\pi)=u(t,x),\]
  where $M_\xi$ is a real Fourier multiplier, $g(\bar{\omega}t,x)$ is real analytic with forced Diophantine frequencies $\bar\omega$, $\epsilon$ is a small parameter.
  The paper generalizes the previous results from the simple eigenvalue to the double eigenvalues under the quasi-linear perturbation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work by Hintz--Vasy provides a partial asymptotic analysis of the low-energy limit of scattering for Schr\"odinger operators with a short-range potential. Using a slight refinement of Hintz's algorithm, we complete the asymptotic analysis by providing full asymptotic expansions in every possible asymptotic regime. Moreover, the analysis is done in any dimension $d\geq 3$, for any asymptotically conic manifold, and we keep track of partial multipole expansions. Applications include full asymptotic analyses of the Schr\"odinger, wave, and Klein--Gordon equations, one of these being described in a companion paper. Using previous work, only partial asymptotic analyses were possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the gradient flow of the Allen-Cahn equation with fixed boundary contact angle in Euclidean domains for initial data with bounded energy. Under general assumptions, we establish both interior and boundary convergence properties for the solutions and associated energy measures. Under various boundary non-concentration assumptions, we show that, for almost every time, the associated limiting varifolds satisfy generalised contact angle conditions and have bounded first variation, as well as deducing that the trace of the limit of the solutions coincides with the limit of their traces. Moreover, we derive an Ilmanen type monotonicity formula, for initial data with bounded energy, valid for the associated energy measures up to the boundary.</description>

Abstract: We study geometrically constrained magnetic walls in a three dimensional geometry where two bulks are connected by a thin neck. Without imposing any symmetry assumption on the domain, we investigate the scaling of the energy as the size of the neck vanishes. We identify five significant scaling regimes, for all of which we characterise the energy scaling and identify the asymptotic behaviour of the domain wall. Finally, we notice the emergence of sub-regimes that are not present in the previous works due to restrictive symmetry assumptions.</description>

      <title>A Liouville theorem for supercritical Fujita equation and its applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Liouville theorem for ancient solutions to the supercritical Fujita equation \[\partial_tu-\Delta u=|u|^{p-1}u, \quad -\infty &lt;t&lt;0, \quad p&gt;\frac{n+2}{n-2},\] which says if $u$ is close to the ODE solution $u_0(t):=(p-1)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}}(-t)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}}$ at large scales, then it is an ODE solution (i.e. it depends only on $t$). This implies a stability property for ODE blow ups in this problem.
  As an application of these results, we show that for a suitable weak solution, its singular set at the end time can be decomposed into two parts: one part is relatively open and $(n-1)$-rectifiable, and it is characterized by the property that tangent functions at these points are the two constants $\pm(p-1)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}}$; the other part is relatively closed and its Hausdorff dimension is not larger than $n-\left[2\frac{p+1}{p-1}\right]-1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) derived from the Fokker-Planck equation associated with Score-based Generative Models. We modify the standard Fokker-Planck equation to better represent practical SGMs and introduce noise to mitigate potential discretization issues. The primary goal is to prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions for this SPDE. This aspect requires careful consideration due to the time-dependent operator and unbounded domain. To overcome these hurdles, we employ a variational approach and introduce a novel space inspired by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operators. By demonstrating that this space and its subspace satisfy the necessary assumptions, they establish the existence of a solution for the given SPDE.</description>

Abstract: We study the existence of weak solutions and the corresponding sharp interface limit of an anisotropic Cahn-Hilliard equation with disparate mobility, i.e., the mobility is degenerate in one of the two pure phases, making the diffusion in that phase vanish. The double-well potential is polynomial and is weighted by a spatially inhomogeneous coefficient. In the limit when the parameter of the interface width tends to zero, and under an energy convergence assumption, we prove that the weak solutions converge to BV solutions of a weighted anisotropic Hele-Shaw flow. We also add some numerical simulations to analyze the effects of anisotropy on the Cahn-Hilliard equation.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with a threshold phenomenon for the existence of scattering states for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. The nonlinearity includes a non-oscillatory term of the order lower than the Strauss exponent. We show that no scattering states exist for the equation in a weighted Sobolev space. It is emphasized that our method admits initial data with good properties, such as compactly supported smooth functions. The result indicates that the Strauss exponent acts as a threshold for the power of the nonlinearity that determines whether solutions scatter or not in the weighted space.</description>

      <title>Monotone solutions to mean field games master equation in the L2-monotone setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with extending the notion of monotone solution to the mean field game (MFG) master equation to situations in which the coefficients are displacement monotone, instead of the previously introduced notion in the flat monotone regime. To account for this new setting, we work directly on the equation satisfied by the controls of the MFG. Following previous works, we define an appropriate notion of solution under which uniqueness and stability results hold for solutions without any differentiability assumption with respect to probability measures. Thanks to those properties, we show the existence of a monotone solution to displacement monotone mean field games under local regularity assumptions on the coefficients and sufficiently strong monotonicity. Albeit they are not the focus of this article, results presented are also of interest for mean field games of control and general mean field forward backward systems. In order to account for this last setting, we use the notion of L2--monotonicity instead of displacement monotonicity, those two notions being equivalent in the particular case of MFG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the global regularity of large solutions with vacuum to the two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{T}^{2}=\mathbb{R}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, when the volume (bulk) viscosity coefficient $\nu$ is sufficiently large. It firstly fixes a flaw in \cite[Proposition 3.3]{Danchin2023}, which concerns the $\nu$-independent global $t$-weighted estimates of the solutions. Amending the proof requires non-trivially mathematical analysis. As a by-product, the incompressible limit with an explicit rate of convergence is shown, when the volume viscosity tends to infinity. In contrast to \cite[Theorem 1.3]{Danchin2019} and \cite[Corollary 1.1]{DM2017} where vacuum was excluded, the convergence rate of the incompressible limit is obtained for the global solutions with vacuum, based on some $t$-growth and singular $t$-weighted estimates.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of nonlinear Ginzburg-Landau SPDEs in infinite volume. We show that under a weakly asymmetric scaling, their solutions converge to that of the KPZ equation. The result holds for a large class of potentials, nonlinearities, and essentially any (non-equilibrium) initial data for the limit KPZ equation. The main technical innovation is the analysis of a stochastic heat kernel for the SPDE of interest.</description>

      <title>The Mathematical Theory of Behavioural Swarms: Towards Modelling the Collective Dynamics of Living Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical swarm models, exemplified by the Cucker--Smale framework, provide foundational insights into collective alignment but exhibit fundamental limitations in capturing the adaptive, heterogeneous behaviours intrinsic to living systems. This paper formalises the mathematical theory of \textit{Behavioural Swarms}, a comprehensive framework where each particle's state incorporates a dynamic internal variable, the \textit{activity} that co-evolves with position and velocity through nonlocal interactions. We demonstrate how this approach transcends prior models by integrating adaptive decision-making mechanisms and heterogeneous behavioural states into rigorous differential systems. Through applications in behavioural economics and crowd dynamics, we establish the theory's capacity to predict emergent macroscopic patterns from individual behavioural states. Our critical analysis positions this framework against kinetic theories of active particles and agent-based approaches, revealing distinct advantages for modelling systems where individual agency drives collective outcomes.</description>
