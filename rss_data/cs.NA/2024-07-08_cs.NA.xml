      <title>FFT-acceleration and stabilization of the 3D Marching-on-in-Time Contrast Current Density Volume Integral Equation for scattering from high contrast dielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An implicit causal space-time Galerkin scheme applied to the contrast current density volume integral equation gives rise to a marching-on-in-time scheme known as the MOT-JVIE, which is accelerated and stabilized via a fully embedded FIR filter to compute the electromagnetic scattering from high permittivity dielectric objects discretized with over a million voxels. A review of two different acceleration approaches previously developed for two-dimensional time-domain surface integral equations based on fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), leads to an understanding why these schemes obtain the same order of acceleration and the extension of this FFT-acceleration to the three-dimensional MOT-JVIE. The positive definite stability analysis (PDSA) for the MOT-JVIE shows that the number of voxels for a stable MOT-JVIE discretization is restricted by the finite precision of the matrix elements. The application of the PDSA provides the insight that stability can be enforced through regularization, at the cost of accuracy. To minimize the impact in accuracy, FIR-regularization is introduced, which is based on low group-delay linear-phase high-pass FIR-filters. We demonstrate the capabilities of the FFT-accelerated FIR-regularized MOT-JVIE for a number of numerical experiments with high permittivity dielectric scatterers.</description>

      <title>On the accuracy and efficiency of reduced order models: towards real-world applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter provides an extended overview about Reduced Order Models (ROMs), with a focus on their features in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In particular, the aim is to browse the more common ROM frameworks, considering both intrusive and data-driven approaches. We present the validation of such techniques against several test cases. The first one is an academic benchmark, the thermal block problem, where a Poisson equation is considered. Here a classic intrusive ROM framework based on a Galerkin projection scheme is employed. The second and third test cases come from real-world applications, the one related to the investigation of the blood flow patterns in a patient specific coronary arteries configuration where the Navier Stokes equations are addressed and the other one concerning the granulation process within pharmaceutical industry where a fluid-particle system is considered. Here we employ two data-driven ROM approaches showing a very relevant trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. In the last part of the contribution, two novel technological platforms, ARGOS and ATLAS, are presented. They are designed to provide a user-friendly access to data-driven models for real-time predictions for complex biomedical and industrial problems.</description>

      <title>An optimal method for high order mixed derivatives of bivariate functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of optimal recovering high-order mixed derivatives of bivariate functions with finite smoothness is studied. Based on the truncation method, an algorithm for numerical differentiation is constructed, which is order-optimal both in the sense of accuracy and in terms of the amount of involved Galerkin information. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the fact that our approach can be implemented successfully.</description>

      <title>The kernel polynomial method based on Jacobi polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kernel polynomial method based on Jacobi polynomials $P_n^{\alpha,\beta}(x)$ is proposed. The optimal-resolution positivity-preserving kernels and the corresponding damping factors are obtained. The results provide a generalization of the Jackson damping factors for arbitrary Jacobi polynomials. For $\alpha =\pm 1/2$, $\beta =\pm 1/2$ (Chebyshev polynomials of the first to fourth kinds), explicit trigonometric expressions for the damping factors are obtained. The resulting algorithm can be easily introduced into existing implementations of the kernel polynomial method.</description>

      <title>$L^{p}$-convergence of Kantorovich-type Max-Min Neural Network Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Kantorovich variant of max-min neural network operators, in which the operator kernel is defined in terms of sigmoidal functions. Our main aim is to demonstrate the $L^{p}$-convergence of these nonlinear operators for $1\leq p&lt;\infty$, which makes it possible to obtain approximation results for functions that are not necessarily continuous. In addition, we will derive quantitative estimates for the rate of approximation in the $L^{p}$-norm. We will provide some explicit examples, studying the approximation of discontinuous functions with the max-min operator, and varying additionally the underlying sigmoidal function of the kernel. Further, we numerically compare the $L^{p}$-approximation error with the respective error of the Kantorovich variants of other popular neural network operators. As a final application, we show that the Kantorovich variant has advantages compared to the sampling variant of the max-min operator and Kantorovich variant of the max-product operator when it comes to approximate noisy functions as for instance biomedical ECG signals.</description>

      <title>Linear model reduction using SPOD modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of model reduction approaches use an efficient representation of the state and then derive equations to temporally evolve the coefficients that encode the state in the representation. In this paper, we instead employ an efficient representation of the entire trajectory of the state over some time interval and solve for the coefficients that define the trajectory on the interval. We use spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) modes, in particular, which possess properties that make them suitable for model reduction and are known to provide an accurate representation of trajectories. In fact, with the same number of total coefficients, the SPOD representation is substantially more accurate than any representation formed by specifying the coefficients in a spatial (e.g., POD) basis for the many time steps that make up the interval. We develop a method to solve for the SPOD coefficients that encode the trajectories in forced linear dynamical systems given the forcing and initial condition, thereby obtaining the accurate representation of the trajectory. We apply the method to two examples, a linearized Ginzburg-Landau problem and an advection-diffusion problem. In both, the error of the proposed method is orders of magnitude lower than both POD-Galerkin and balanced truncation applied to the same problem, as well as the most accurate solution within the span of the POD modes. The method is also fast, with CPU time comparable to or lower than both benchmarks in the examples we present.</description>

      <title>Dual-Domain Deep D-bar Method for Solving Electrical Impedance Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regularized D-bar method is one of the most prominent methods for solving Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) problems due to its efficiency and simplicity. It provides a direct approach by applying low-pass filtering to the scattering data in the non-linear Fourier domain, thereby yielding a smoothed conductivity approximation. However, D-bar images often present low contrast and low resolution due to the absence of accurate high-frequency information and ill-posedness of the problem. In this paper, we proposed a dual-domain neural network architecture to retrieve high-contrast D-bar image sequences from low-contrast D-bar images. To further accentuate the spatial features of the conductivity distribution, the widely adopted U-net has been tailored for conductivity image calibration from the predicted D-bar image sequences. We call such a hybrid approach by Dual-Domain Deep D-bar method due to the consideration of both scattering data and image information. Compared to the single-scale structure, our proposed multi-scale structure exhibits superior capabilities in reducing artifacts and refining conductivity approximation. Additionally, solving discrete D-bar systems using the GMRES algorithm entails significant computational complexity, which is extremely time-consuming on CPU-based devices. To remedy this, we designed a surrogate GPU-based Richardson iterative method to accelerate the data enhancement process by D-bar. Numerical results are presented for simulated EIT data from the KIT4 and ACT4 systems to demonstrate notable improvements in absolute EIT imaging quality when compared to existing methodologies.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Precise Calculation of the Confluent Hypergeometric Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kummer's function, also known as the confluent hypergeometric function (CHF), is an important mathematical function, in particular due to its many special cases, which include the Bessel function, the incomplete Gamma function and the error function (erf). The CHF has no closed form expression, but instead is most commonly expressed as an infinite sum of ratios of rising factorials, which makes its precise and efficient calculation challenging. It is a function of three parameters, the first two being the rising factorial base of the numerator and denominator, and the third being a scale parameter. Accurate and efficient calculation for large values of the scale parameter is particularly challenging due to numeric underflow and overflow which easily occur when summing the underlying component terms. This work presents an elegant and precise mathematical algorithm for the calculation of the CHF, which is of particular advantage for large values of the scale parameter. This method massively reduces the number and range of component terms which need to be summed to achieve any required precision, thus obviating the need for the computationally intensive transformations needed by current algorithms.</description>

      <title>Error Inhibiting Methods for Finite Elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite Difference methods (FD) are one of the oldest and simplest methods for solving partial differential equations (PDE). Block Finite Difference methods (BFD) are FD methods in which the domain is divided into blocks, or cells, containing two or more grid points, with a different scheme used for each grid point, unlike the standard FD method.
  It was shown in recent works that BFD schemes might be one to three orders more accurate than their truncation errors. Due to these schemes' ability to inhibit the accumulation of truncation errors, these methods were called Error Inhibiting Schemes (EIS).
  This manuscript shows that our BFD schemes can be viewed as a particular type of Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. Then, we prove the BFD scheme's stability using the standard DG procedure while using a Fourier-like analysis to establish its optimal convergence rate.
  We present numerical examples in one and two dimensions to demonstrate the efficacy of these schemes.</description>

      <title>Stabilized Time Series Expansions for High-Order Finite Element Solutions of Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, Finite Element Method (FEM) has served as a foundational numerical framework for approximating the terms of Time Series Expansion (TSE) as solutions to transient Partial Differential Equation (PDE). However, the application of high-order Finite Element (FE) to certain classes of PDEs, such as diffusion equations and the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, often leads to numerical instabilities. These instabilities limit the number of valid terms in the series, though the efficiency of time series integration even when resummation techniques like the Borel-Pad\'e-Laplace (BPL) integrators are employed. In this study, we introduce a novel variational formulation for computing the terms of a TSE associated with a given PDE using higher-order FEs. Our approach involves the incorporation of artificial diffusion terms on the left-hand side of the equations corresponding to each power in the series, serving as a stabilization technique. We demonstrate that this method can be interpreted as a minimization of an energy functional, wherein the total variations of the unknowns are considered. Furthermore, we establish that the coefficients of the artificial diffusion for each term in the series obey a recurrence relation, which can be determined by minimizing the condition number of the associated linear system. We highlight the link between the proposed technique and the Discrete Maximum Principle (DMP) of the heat equation. We show, via numerical experiments, how the proposed technique allows having additional valid terms of the series that will be substantial in enlarging the stability domain of the BPL integrators.</description>

      <title>Accurate close interactions of Stokes spheres using lubrication-adapted image systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stokes flows with near-touching rigid particles induce near-singular lubrication forces under relative motion, making their accurate numerical treatment challenging. With the aim of controlling the accuracy with a computationally cheap method, we present a new technique that combines the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) with the method of images. For rigid spheres, we propose to represent the flow using Stokeslet proxy sources on interior spheres, augmented by lines of image sources adapted to each near-contact to resolve lubrication. Source strengths are found by a least-squares solve at contact-adapted boundary collocation nodes. We include extensive numerical tests, and validate against reference solutions from a well-resolved boundary integral formulation. With less than 60 image sources per particle per contact, we show controlled uniform accuracy to three relative digits in surface velocities, and up to five digits in particle forces and torques, for all separations down to a thousandth of the radius. In the special case of flows around fixed particles, the proxy sphere alone gives controlled accuracy. A one-body preconditioning strategy allows acceleration with the fast multipole method, hence close to linear scaling in the number of particles. This is demonstrated by solving problems of up to 2000 spheres on a workstation using only 700 proxy sources per particle.</description>

      <title>Factorial Series Representation of Stieltjes Series Converging Factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The practical usefulness of Levin-type nonlinear sequence transformations as numerical tools for the summation of divergent series or for the convergence acceleration of slowly converging series, is nowadays beyond dispute. Weniger's transformation, in particular, is able to accomplish spectacular results when used to overcome resummation problems, often outperforming better known resummation techniques, the most known being Pad\'e approximants. However, our understanding of its theoretical features is still far from being satisfactory and particularly bad as far as the decoding of factorially divergent series is concerned.
  Stieltjes series represent a class of power series of fundamental interest in mathematical physics. In the present paper, it is shown how the Stieltjes series converging factor of any order is expressible as an inverse factorial series, whose terms can be analytically retrieved through a simple recursive algorithm. A few examples of applications of our algorithm are presented, in order to show its effectiveness and implementation ease. We believe the results presented here could constitute an important, preliminary step for the development of a general convergence theory of Weniger's transformation on Stieltjes series. A rather ambitious project, but worthy of being pursued in the future.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev Spectral Neural Networks for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to utilize the Chebyshev spectral method neural network(CSNN) model to solve differential equations. This approach employs a single-layer neural network wherein Chebyshev spectral methods are used to construct neurons satisfying boundary conditions. The study uses a feedforward neural network model and error backpropagation principles, utilizing automatic differentiation (AD) to compute the loss function. This method avoids the need to solve non-sparse linear systems, making it convenient for algorithm implementation and solving high-dimensional problems. The unique sampling method and neuron architecture significantly enhance the training efficiency and accuracy of the neural network. Furthermore, multiple networks enables the Chebyshev spectral method to handle equations on more complex domains. The numerical efficiency and accuracy of the CSNN model are investigated through testing on elliptic partial differential equations, and it is compared with the well-known Physics-Informed Neural Network(PINN) method.</description>

      <title>Jacobi Set Simplification for Tracking Topological Features in Time-Varying Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jacobi set of a bivariate scalar field is the set of points where the gradients of the two constituent scalar fields align with each other. It captures the regions of topological changes in the bivariate field. The Jacobi set is a bivariate analog of critical points, and may correspond to features of interest. In the specific case of time-varying fields and when one of the scalar fields is time, the Jacobi set corresponds to temporal tracks of critical points, and serves as a feature-tracking graph. The Jacobi set of a bivariate field or a time-varying scalar field is complex, resulting in cluttered visualizations that are difficult to analyze. This paper addresses the problem of Jacobi set simplification. Specifically, we use the time-varying scalar field scenario to introduce a method that computes a reduced Jacobi set. The method is based on a stability measure called robustness that was originally developed for vector fields and helps capture the structural stability of critical points. We also present a mathematical analysis for the method, and describe an implementation for 2D time-varying scalar fields. Applications to both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for tracking features.</description>

      <title>Recursive construction of biorthogonal polynomials for handling polynomial regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An adaptive procedure for constructing a series of biorthogonal polynomials to a basis of monomials spanning the same finite-dimensional inner product space is proposed. By taking advantage of the orthogonality of the original basis, our procedure circumvents the well-known instability problem arising from the matrix inversion involved in classical polynomial regression. Moreover, the recurrent generation of biorthogonal polynomials in our framework facilitates the upgrading of all polynomials to include one additional element in the set whilst also allowing for a natural downgrading of the polynomial regression approximation. This is achieved by the posterior removal of any basis element leading to a straightforward approach for reducing the approximation order. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach through a series of examples where we derive the resulting biorthogonal polynomials from Legendre, Laguerre, and Chebyshev orthogonal bases.</description>

Abstract: Electromagnetic waves interacting with three--dimensional periodic structures occur in many applications of great scientific and engineering interest. These three dimensional interactions are extremely complicated and subtle, so it is unsurprising that practitioners find their rapid, robust, and accurate numerical simulation to be of paramount interest. Among the wide array of possible numerical approaches, the High--Order Spectral algorithms are often preferred due to their surpassing fidelity with a moderate number of unknowns, and here we describe an algorithm that fits into this class. In addition, we take a perturbative approach to the problem which views the deviation of the permittivity from a reference value as the deformation and we conduct a regular perturbation theory. This work concludes a line of research on these methods which began with two-dimensional problems governed by the Helmholtz equation and moved to small perturbations in the fully three-dimensional vector Maxwell equations. We now extend these latter results to large (real) perturbations constituting a rigorous analytic continuation.</description>

      <title>Is there an optimal choice of configuration space for Lie group integration schemes applied to constrained MBS?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently various numerical integration schemes have been proposed for numerically simulating the dynamics of constrained multibody systems (MBS) operating. These integration schemes operate directly on the MBS configuration space considered as a Lie group. For discrete spatial mechanical systems there are two Lie group that can be used as configuration space: $SE\left( 3\right) $ and $SO\left( 3\right) \times \mathbb{R}^{3}$. Since the performance of the numerical integration scheme clearly depends on the underlying configuration space it is important to analyze the effect of using either variant. For constrained MBS a crucial aspect is the constraint satisfaction. In this paper the constraint violation observed for the two variants are investigated. It is concluded that the $SE\left( 3\right) $ formulation outperforms the $SO\left( 3\right) \times \mathbb{R}^{3}$ formulation if the absolute motions of the rigid bodies, as part of a constrained MBS, belong to a motion subgroup. In all other cases both formulations are equivalent. In the latter cases the $SO\left( 3\right) \times \mathbb{R}^{3}$ formulation should be used since the $SE\left( 3\right) $ formulation is numerically more complex, however.</description>

      <title>A novel direct imaging method for passive inverse obstacle scattering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse scattering problem of recovering a sound-soft obstacle using passive measurements taken from randomly distributed point sources. The randomness introduced by these sources poses significant challenges, leading to the failure of classical direct sampling methods that rely on scattered field measurements. To address this issue, we introduce the Doubly Cross-Correlating Method (DCM), a novel direct imaging scheme that consists of two major steps. Initially, DCM creates a cross-correlation between two passive measurements. This specially designed cross-correlation effectively handles the uncontrollability of incident sources and connects to the active scattering model via the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff identity. Subsequently, this cross-correlation is used to create a correlation-based imaging function that can qualitatively identify the obstacle. The stability and resolution of DCM are theoretically analyzed. Extensive numerical examples, including scenarios with two closely positioned obstacles and multiscale obstacles, demonstrate that DCM is computationally efficient, stable, and fast.</description>

      <title>Low-rank plus diagonal approximations for Riccati-like matrix differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing tractable approximations of time-dependent d x d large positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices defined as solutions of a matrix differential equation. We propose to use "low-rank plus diagonal" PSD matrices as approximations that can be stored with a memory cost being linear in the high dimension d. To constrain the solution of the differential equation to remain in that subset, we project the derivative at all times onto the tangent space to the subset, following the methodology of dynamical low-rank approximation. We derive a closed-form formula for the projection, and show that after some manipulations it can be computed with a numerical cost being linear in d, allowing for tractable implementation. Contrary to previous approaches based on pure low-rank approximations, the addition of the diagonal term allows for our approximations to be invertible matrices, that can moreover be inverted with linear cost in d. We apply the technique to Riccati-like equations, then to two particular problems. Firstly a low-rank approximation to our recent Wasserstein gradient flow for Gaussian approximation of posterior distributions in approximate Bayesian inference, and secondly a novel low-rank approximation of the Kalman filter for high-dimensional systems. Numerical simulations illustrate the results.</description>

Abstract: We present a geometric framework for the processing of SPD-valued data that preserves subspace structures and is based on the efficient computation of extreme generalized eigenvalues. This is achieved through the use of the Thompson geometry of the semidefinite cone. We explore a particular geodesic space structure in detail and establish several properties associated with it. Finally, we review a novel inductive mean of SPD matrices based on this geometry.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Iterative Deblurring: No Explicit Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative deblurring, notably the Richardson-Lucy algorithm with and without regularization, is analyzed in the context of nuclear and high-energy physics applications. In these applications, probability distributions may be discretized into a few bins, measurement statistics can be high, and instrument performance can be well understood. In such circumstances, it is essential to understand the deblurring first without any explicit noise considerations. We employ singular value decomposition for the blurring matrix in a low-count pixel system. A strong blurring may yield a null space for the blurring matrix. Yet, a nonnegativity constraint for images built into the deblurring may help restore null-space content in a high-contrast image with zero or low intensity for a sufficient number of pixels. For low-contrast images, the control over null-space content may be gained through regularization. When the regularization is applied, the blurred image is, in practice, restored to an image that is still blurred but less than the starting one.</description>

      <title>An adaptive Newton-based free-boundary Grad-Shafranov solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibriums in magnetic confinement devices result from force balancing between the Lorentz force and the plasma pressure gradient. In an axisymmetric configuration like a tokamak, such an equilibrium is described by an elliptic equation for the poloidal magnetic flux, commonly known as the Grad--Shafranov equation. It is challenging to develop a scalable and accurate free-boundary Grad--Shafranov solver, since it is a fully nonlinear optimization problem that simultaneouly solves for the magnetic field coil current outside the plasma to control the plasma shape. In this work, we develop a Newton-based free-boundary Grad--Shafranov solver using adaptive finite elements and preconditioning strategies. The free-boundary interaction leads to the evaluation of a domain-dependent nonlinear form of which its contribution to the Jacobian matrix is achieved through shape calculus. The optimization problem aims to minimize the distance between the plasma boundary and specified control points while satisfying two non-trivial constraints, which correspond to the nonlinear finite element discretization of the Grad--Shafranov equation and a constraint on the total plasma current involving a nonlocal coupling term. The linear system is solved by a block factorization, and AMG is called for subblock elliptic operators. The unique contributions of this work include the treatment of a global constraint, preconditioning strategies, nonlocal reformulation, and the implementation of adaptive finite elements. It is found that the resulting Newton solver is robust, successfully reducing the nonlinear residual to 1e-6 and lower in a small handful of iterations while addressing the challenging case to find a Taylor state equilibrium where conventional Picard-based solvers fail to converge.</description>

      <title>Towards the Use of Anderson Acceleration in Coupled Transport-Gyrokinetic Turbulence Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the behavior of a magnetically confined fusion plasma over long time periods requires methods that can bridge the difference between transport and turbulent time scales. The nonlinear transport solver, Tango, enables simulations of very long times, in particular to steady state, by advancing each process independently with different time step sizes and couples them through a relaxed iteration scheme. We examine the use of Anderson Acceleration (AA) to reduce the total number of coupling iterations required by interfacing Tango with the AA implementation, including several extensions to AA, provided by the KINSOL nonlinear solver package in SUNDIALS. The ability to easily enable and adjust algorithmic options through KINSOL allows for rapid experimentation to evaluate different approaches with minimal effort. Additionally, we leverage the GPTune library to automate the optimization of algorithmic parameters within KINSOL. We show that AA can enable faster convergence in stiff and very stiff tests cases without noise present and in all cases, including with noisy fluxes, increases robustness and reduces sensitivity to the choice of relaxation strength.</description>

      <title>Green Multigrid Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GreenLearning networks (GL) directly learn Green's function in physical space, making them an interpretable model for capturing unknown solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs). For many PDEs, the corresponding Green's function exhibits asymptotic smoothness. In this paper, we propose a framework named Green Multigrid networks (GreenMGNet), an operator learning algorithm designed for a class of asymptotically smooth Green's functions.
  Compared with the pioneering GL, the new framework presents itself with better accuracy and efficiency, thereby achieving a significant improvement. GreenMGNet is composed of two technical novelties. First, Green's function is modeled as a piecewise function to take into account its singular behavior in some parts of the hyperplane. Such piecewise function is then approximated by a neural network with augmented output(AugNN) so that it can capture singularity accurately. Second, the asymptotic smoothness property of Green's function is used to leverage the Multi-Level Multi-Integration (MLMI) algorithm for both the training and inference stages. Several test cases of operator learning are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method. On average, GreenMGNet achieves $3.8\%$ to $39.15\%$ accuracy improvement. To match the accuracy level of GL, GreenMGNet requires only about $10\%$ of the full grid data, resulting in a $55.9\%$ and $92.5\%$ reduction in training time and GPU memory cost for one-dimensional test problems, and a $37.7\%$ and $62.5\%$ reduction for two-dimensional test problems.</description>

      <title>Gaussian process regression with log-linear scaling for common non-stationary kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a fast algorithm for Gaussian process regression in low dimensions, applicable to a widely-used family of non-stationary kernels. The non-stationarity of these kernels is induced by arbitrary spatially-varying vertical and horizontal scales. In particular, any stationary kernel can be accommodated as a special case, and we focus especially on the generalization of the standard Mat\'ern kernel. Our subroutine for kernel matrix-vector multiplications scales almost optimally as $O(N\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of regression points. Like the recently developed equispaced Fourier Gaussian process (EFGP) methodology, which is applicable only to stationary kernels, our approach exploits non-uniform fast Fourier transforms (NUFFTs). We offer a complete analysis controlling the approximation error of our method, and we validate the method's practical performance with numerical experiments. In particular we demonstrate improved scalability compared to to state-of-the-art rank-structured approaches in spatial dimension $d&gt;1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the sufficient and necessary conditions for constructing $C^r$ conforming finite element spaces from a superspline spaces on general simplicial triangulations. We introduce the concept of extendability for the pre-element spaces, which encompasses both the superspline space and the finite element space. By examining the extendability condition for both types of spaces, we provide an answer to the conditions regarding the construction. A corollary of our results is that constructing $C^r$ conforming elements in $d$ dimensions should in general require an extra $C^{2^{s}r}$ continuity on $s$-codimensional simplices, and the polynomial degree is at least $(2^d r + 1)$.</description>

      <title>A second-order direct Eulerian GRP scheme for ten-moment Gaussian closure equations with source terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a second-order accurate direct Eulerian generalized Riemann problem (GRP) scheme for the ten-moment Gaussian closure equations with source terms. The generalized Riemann invariants associated with the rarefaction waves, the contact discontinuity and the shear waves are given, and the 1D exact Riemann solver is obtained. After that, the generalized Riemann invariants and the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions are directly used to resolve the left and right nonlinear waves (rarefaction wave and shock wave) of the local GRP in Eulerian formulation, and then the 1D direct Eulerian GRP scheme is derived. They are much more complicated, technical and nontrivial due to more physical variables and elementary waves. Some 1D and 2D numerical experiments are presented to check the accuracy and high resolution of the proposed GRP schemes, where the 2D direct Eulerian GRP scheme is given by using the Strang splitting method for simplicity. It should be emphasized that several examples of 2D Riemann problems are constructed for the first time.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and analyze numerical companion matrix methods for the reconstruction of hypersurfaces with crossings from smooth interpolants given unordered or, without loss of generality, value-sorted data. The problem is motivated by the desire to machine learn potential energy surfaces arising in molecular excited state computational chemistry applications. We present simplified models which reproduce the analytically predicted convergence and stability behaviors as well as two application-oriented numerical experiments: the electronic excited states of Graphene featuring Dirac conical cusps and energy surfaces corresponding to a sulfur dioxide ($SO_2$) molecule in different configurations.</description>

      <title>Monolithic convex limiting and implicit pseudo-time stepping for calculating steady-state solutions of the Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we use the monolithic convex limiting (MCL) methodology to enforce relevant inequality constraints in implicit finite element discretizations of the compressible Euler equations. In this context, preservation of invariant domains follows from positivity preservation for intermediate states of the density and internal energy. To avoid spurious oscillations, we additionally impose local maximum principles on intermediate states of the density, velocity components, and specific total energy. For the backward Euler time stepping, we show the invariant domain preserving (IDP) property of the fully discrete MCL scheme by constructing a fixed-point iteration that is IDP and converges under a strong time step restriction. Our iterative solver for the nonlinear discrete problem employs a more efficient fixed-point iteration. The matrix of the associated linear system is a robust low-order Jacobian approximation that exploits the homogeneity property of the flux function. The limited antidiffusive terms are treated explicitly. We use positivity preservation as a stopping criterion for nonlinear iterations. The first iteration yields the solution of a linearized semi-implicit problem. This solution possesses the discrete conservation property but is generally not IDP. Further iterations are performed if any non-IDP states are detected. The existence of an IDP limit is guaranteed by our analysis. To facilitate convergence to steady-state solutions, we perform adaptive explicit underrelaxation at the end of each time step. The calculation of appropriate relaxation factors is based on an approximate minimization of nodal entropy residuals. The performance of proposed algorithms and alternative solution strategies is illustrated by the convergence history for standard two-dimensional test problems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear compressive reduced basis approximation for multi-parameter elliptic problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced basis methods for approximating the solutions of parameter-dependant partial differential equations (PDEs) are based on learning the structure of the set of solutions - seen as a manifold ${\mathcal S}$ in some functional space - when the parameters vary. This involves investigating the manifold and, in particular, understanding whether it is close to a low-dimensional affine space. This leads to the notion of Kolmogorov $N$-width that consists of evaluating to which extent the best choice of a vectorial space of dimension $N$ approximates ${\mathcal S}$ well enough. If a good approximation of elements in ${\mathcal S}$ can be done with some well-chosen vectorial space of dimension $N$ -- provided $N$ is not too large -- then a ``reduced'' basis can be proposed that leads to a Galerkin type method for the approximation of any element in ${\mathcal S}$. In many cases, however, the Kolmogorov $N$-width is not so small, even if the parameter set lies in a space of small dimension yielding a manifold with small dimension. In terms of complexity reduction, this gap between the small dimension of the manifold and the large Kolmogorov $N$-width can be explained by the fact that the Kolmogorov $N$-width is linear while, in contrast, the dependency in the parameter is, most often, non-linear. There have been many contributions aiming at reconciling these two statements, either based on deterministic or AI approaches. We investigate here further a new paradigm that, in some sense, merges these two aspects:  the nonlinear compressive reduced basisapproximation. We focus on a simple multiparameter problem and illustrate rigorously that the complexity associated with the approximation of the solution to the parameter dependant PDE is  directly related to the number of parameters rather than the Kolmogorov $N$-width.</description>

Abstract: This paper discusses lowest-order nonstandard finite element methods for space discretization and explicit and implicit schemes for time discretization of the biharmonic wave equation with clamped boundary conditions. A modified Ritz projection operator defined on $H^2_0(\Omega)$ ensures error estimates under appropriate regularity assumptions on the solution. Stability results and error estimates of optimal order are established in suitable norms for the semidiscrete and explicit/implicit fully-discrete versions of the proposed schemes. Finally, we report on numerical experiments using explicit and implicit schemes for time discretization and Morley, discontinuous Galerkin, and {C$^0$ interior} penalty schemes for space discretization, that validate the theoretical error estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of computing the eigenvalue backward error of the Rosenbrock system matrix under various types of block perturbations. We establish computable formulas for these backward errors using a class of minimization problems involving the Sum of Two generalized Rayleigh Quotients (SRQ2). For computational purposes and analysis, we reformulate such optimization problems as minimization of a rational function over the joint numerical range of three Hermitian matrices. This reformulation eliminates certain local minimizers of the original SRQ2 minimization and allows for convenient visualization of the solution. Furthermore, by exploiting the convexity within the joint numerical range, we derive a characterization of the optimal solution using a Nonlinear Eigenvalue Problem with Eigenvector dependency (NEPv). The NEPv characterization enables a more efficient solution of the SRQ2 minimization compared to traditional optimization techniques. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the benefits and effectiveness of the NEPv approach for SRQ2 minimization in computing eigenvalue backward errors of Rosenbrock systems.</description>

      <title>A Preconditioned Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Biharmonic Equation with $C^0$-Reconstructed Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a high-order finite element method based on a reconstructed approximation to the biharmonic equation. In our construction, the space is reconstructed from nodal values by solving a local least squares fitting problem per element. It is shown that the space can achieve an arbitrarily high-order accuracy and share the same nodal degrees of freedom with the $C^0$ linear space. The interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin scheme can be directly applied to the reconstructed space for solving the biharmonic equation. We prove that the numerical solution converges with optimal orders under error measurements. More importantly, we establish a norm equivalence between the reconstructed space and the continuous linear space. This property allows us to precondition the linear system arising from the high-order space by the linear space on the same mesh. This preconditioner is shown to be optimal in the sense that the condition number of the preconditioned system admits a uniform upper bound independent of the mesh size. Numerical examples in two and three dimensions are provided to illustrate the accuracy of the scheme and the efficiency of the preconditioning method.</description>

      <title>Solving the inverse source problem of the fractional Poisson equation by MC-fPINNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we effectively solve the inverse source problem of the fractional Poisson equation using MC-fPINNs. We construct two neural networks $ u_{NN}(x;\theta )$ and $f_{NN}(x;\psi)$ to approximate the solution $u^{*}(x)$ and the forcing term $f^{*}(x)$ of the fractional Poisson equation. To optimize these two neural networks, we use the Monte Carlo sampling method mentioned in MC-fPINNs and define a new loss function combining measurement data and the underlying physical model. Meanwhile, we present a comprehensive error analysis for this method, along with a prior rule to select the appropriate parameters of neural networks. Several numerical examples are given to demonstrate the great precision and robustness of this method in solving high-dimensional problems up to 10D, with various fractional order $\alpha$ and different noise levels of the measurement data ranging from 1$\%$ to 10$\%$.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of generalized kernel-based interpolation by greedy data selection algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Besides standard Lagrange interpolation, i.e., interpolation of target functions from scattered point evaluations, positive definite kernel functions are well-suited for the solution of more general reconstruction problems. This is due to the intrinsic structure of the underlying reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In fact, kernel-based interpolation has been applied to the reconstruction of bivariate functions from scattered Radon samples in computerized tomography (cf. Iske, 2018) and, moreover, to the numerical solution of elliptic PDEs (cf. Wenzel et al., 2022). As shown in various previous contributions, numerical algorithms and theoretical results from kernel-based Lagrange interpolation can be transferred to more general interpolation problems. In particular, greedy point selection methods were studied in (Wenzel et al., 2022), for the special case of Sobolev kernels. In this paper, we aim to develop and analyze more general kernel-based interpolation methods, for less restrictive settings. To this end, we first provide convergence results for generalized interpolation under minimalistic assumptions on both the selected kernel and the target function. Finally, we prove convergence of popular greedy data selection algorithms for totally bounded sets of functionals. Supporting numerical results are provided for illustration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sequential version of the multilinear Nystr\"om algorithm which is suitable for the low-rank Tucker approximation of tensors given in a streaming format. Accessing the tensor $\mathcal{A}$ exclusively through random sketches of the original data, the algorithm effectively leverages structures in $\mathcal{A}$, such as low-rankness, and linear combinations. We present a deterministic analysis of the algorithm and demonstrate its superior speed and efficiency in numerical experiments including an application in video processing.</description>

      <title>Parallel-in-time solution of hyperbolic PDE systems via characteristic-variable block preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the parallel-in-time solution of hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) systems in one spatial dimension, both linear and nonlinear. In the nonlinear setting, the discretized equations are solved with a preconditioned residual iteration based on a global linearization. The linear(ized) equation systems are approximately solved parallel-in-time using a block preconditioner applied in the characteristic variables of the underlying linear(ized) hyperbolic PDE. This change of variables is motivated by the observation that inter-variable coupling for characteristic variables is weak relative to intra-variable coupling, at least locally where spatio-temporal variations in the eigenvectors of the associated flux Jacobian are sufficiently small. For an $\ell$-dimensional system of PDEs, applying the preconditioner consists of solving a sequence of $\ell$ scalar linear(ized)-advection-like problems, each being associated with a different characteristic wave-speed in the underlying linear(ized) PDE. We approximately solve these linear advection problems using multigrid reduction-in-time (MGRIT); however, any other suitable parallel-in-time method could be used. Numerical examples are shown for the (linear) acoustics equations in heterogeneous media, and for the (nonlinear) shallow water equations and Euler equations of gas dynamics with shocks and rarefactions.</description>

      <title>A fast neural hybrid Newton solver adapted to implicit methods for nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of implicit time-stepping schemes for the numerical approximation of solutions to stiff nonlinear time-evolution equations brings well-known advantages including, typically, better stability behaviour and corresponding support of larger time steps, and better structure preservation properties. However, this comes at the price of having to solve a nonlinear equation at every time step of the numerical scheme. In this work, we propose a novel operator learning based hybrid Newton's method to accelerate this solution of the nonlinear time step system for stiff time-evolution nonlinear equations. We propose a targeted learning strategy which facilitates robust unsupervised learning in an offline phase and provides a highly efficient initialisation for the Newton iteration leading to consistent acceleration of Newton's method. A quantifiable rate of improvement in Newton's method achieved by improved initialisation is provided and we analyse the upper bound of the generalisation error of our unsupervised learning strategy. These theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical results, demonstrating the efficiency of our proposed neural hybrid solver both in one- and two-dimensional cases.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Oracle: A general-purpose Riemannian optimizer to solve nearness problems in matrix theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extremely versatile approach to address a large family of matrix nearness problems, possibly with additional linear constraints. Our method is based on splitting a matrix nearness problem into two nested optimization problems, of which the inner one can be solved either exactly or cheaply, while the outer one can be recast as an unconstrained optimization task over a smooth real Riemannian manifold. We observe that this paradigm applies to many matrix nearness problems of practical interest appearing in the literature, thus revealing that they are equivalent in this sense to a Riemannian optimization problem. We also show that the objective function to be minimized on the Riemannian manifold can be discontinuous, thus requiring regularization techniques, and we give conditions for this to happen. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our method by implementing it for a number of matrix nearness problems that are relevant for applications and are currently considered very demanding in practice. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our method often greatly outperforms its predecessors, including algorithms specifically designed for those particular problems.</description>

      <title>Total Lagrangian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics with An Improved Bond-Based Deformation Gradient for Large Strain Solid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total Lagrangian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (TLSPH) is one variant of SPH where the variables are described using the fixed reference configuration and a Lagrangian smoothing kernel. TLSPH elevates the computational efficiency of the standard SPH when no topological change is involved, and it alleviates the stability of SPH scheme with respect to tensile loading. However, instabilities associated with spurious mode, or hourglass/zero-energy mode, persists and often affects the simulation of solids undergoing extremely large strain. This work proposes an alternative formulation to compute deformation gradient with improved accuracy and therefore minimising the possibility of encountering the zero-energy mode. Specifically, we leverage the local discrete computation of bond-based (or pairwise) deformation gradient smoothed by the kernel. Additionally, the bond of a particle with itself is considered to preserve the polynomial reproducibility imposed by the kernel correction scheme. We showcase the convergence of the approach using a two-dimensional benchmark example. Furthermore, the accuracy, robustness, and stability of the proposed approach are assessed in various two- and three-dimensional examples, highlighting on the stability improvement that allows for solid dynamic simulations with more extreme elongation.</description>

      <title>Computational Graph Representation of Equations System Constructors in Hierarchical Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equations system constructors of hierarchical circuits play a central role in device modeling, nonlinear equations solving, and circuit design automation. However, existing constructors present limitations in applications to different extents. For example, the costs of developing and reusing device models -- especially coarse-grained equivalent models of circuit modules -- remain high while parameter sensitivity analysis is complex and inefficient. Inspired by differentiable programming and leveraging the ecosystem benefits of open-source software, we propose an equations system constructor using the computational graph representation, along with its JSON format netlist, to address these limitations. This representation allows for runtime dependencies between signals and subcircuit/device parameters. The proposed method streamlines the model development process and facilitates end-to-end computation of gradients of equations remainders with respect to parameters. This paper discusses in detail the overarching concept of hierarchical subcircuit/device decomposition and nested invocation by drawing parallels to functions in programming languages, and introduces rules for parameters passing and gradient propagation across hierarchical circuit modules. The presented numerical examples, including (1) an uncoupled CMOS model representation using "equivalent circuit decomposition+dynamic parameters" and (2) operational amplifier (OpAmp) auto device sizing, have demonstrated that the proposed method supports circuit simulation and design and particularly subcircuit modeling with improved efficiency, simplicity, and decoupling compared to existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Crouzeix-Raviart elements on simplicial meshes in $d$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce Crouzeix-Raviart elements of general polynomial order $k$ and spatial dimension $d\geq2$ for simplicial finite element meshes. We give explicit representations of the non-conforming basis functions and prove that the conforming companion space, i.e., the conforming finite element space of polynomial order $k$ is contained in the Crouzeix-Raviart space. We prove a direct sum decomposition of the Crouzeix-Raviart space into (a subspace of) the conforming companion space and the span of the non-conforming basis functions.
  Degrees of freedom are introduced which are bidual to the basis functions and give rise to the definition of a local approximation/interpolation operator. In two dimensions or for $k=1$, these freedoms can be split into simplex and $\left( d-1\right) $ dimensional facet integrals in such a way that, in a basis representation of Crouzeix-Raviart functions, all coefficients which belong to basis functions related to lower-dimensional faces in the mesh are determined by these facet integrals. It will also be shown that such a set of degrees of freedom does \textbf{not} exist in higher space dimension and $k&gt;1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04364v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the constraint energy minimization generalized multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) to solve Helmholtz equations in heterogeneous medium. This novel multiscale method is specifically designed to overcome problems related to pollution effect, high-contrast coefficients, and the loss of hermiticity of operators. We establish the inf-sup stability and give an a priori error estimate for this method under a number of established assumptions and resolution conditions. The theoretical results are validated by a set of numerical tests, which further show that the multiscale technique can effectively capture pertinent physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Theoretical analysis of a finite-volume scheme for a stochastic Allen-Cahn problem with constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this contribution is to address the convergence study of a time and space approximation scheme for an Allen-Cahn problem with constraint and perturbed by a multiplicative noise of It\^o type. The problem is set in a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^d$ (with $d=2$ or $3$) and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions are considered. The employed strategy consists in building a numerical scheme on a regularized version \`a la Moreau-Yosida of the constrained problem, and passing to the limit simultaneously with respect to the regularization parameter and the time and space steps, denoted respectively by $\epsilon$, $\Delta t$ and $h$. Combining a semi-implicit Euler-Maruyama time discretization with a Two-Point Flux Approximation (TPFA) scheme for the spatial variable, one is able to prove, under the assumption $\Delta t=\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{2+\theta})$ for a positive $\theta$, the convergence of such a $(\epsilon, \Delta t, h)$ scheme towards the unique weak solution of the initial problem, \textit{ a priori} strongly in $L^2(\Omega;L^2(0,T;L^2(\Lambda)))$ and \textit{a posteriori} also strongly in $L^{p}(0,T; L^2(\Omega\times \Lambda))$ for any finite $p\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>High-order WENO finite-difference methods for hyperbolic nonconservative systems of Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to extend the well-known high-order WENO finite-difference methods for systems of conservation laws to nonconservative hyperbolic systems. The main difficulty of these systems both from the theoretical and the numerical points of view comes from the fact that the definition of weak solution is not unique: according to the theory developed by Dal Maso, LeFloch, and Murat in 1995, it depends on the choice of a family of paths. A general strategy is proposed here in which WENO operators are not only used to reconstruct fluxes but also the nonconservative products of the system. Moreover, if a Roe linearization is available, the nonconservative products can be computed through matrix-vector operations instead of path-integrals. The methods are extended to problems with source terms and two different strategies are introduced to obtain well-balanced schemes. These numerical schemes will be then applied to the two-layer shallow water equations in one- and two- dimensions to obtain high-order methods that preserve water-at-rest steady states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a wavenumber-explicit analysis of FEM-BEM coupling methods for time-harmonic Helmholtz problems proposed in arXiv:2004.03523 for conforming discretizations and in arXiv:2105.06173 for discontinuous Galerkin (DG) volume discretizations. We show that the conditions that $kh/p$ be sufficiently small and that $\log(k) / p$ be bounded imply quasi-optimality of both conforming and DG-method, where $k$ is the wavenumber, $h$ the mesh size, and $p$ the approximation order. The analysis relies on a $k$-explicit regularity theory for a three-field coupling formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop energy-stable parametric finite element approximations for a sharp-interface model with strong surface energy anisotropy, which is derived from the first variation of an energy functional composed of film/vapor interfacial energy, substrate energy, and regularized Willmore energy. By introducing two geometric relations, we innovatively establish an equivalent regularized sharp-interface model and further construct an energy-stable parametric finite element algorithm for this equivalent model. We provide a detailed proof of the energy stability of the numerical scheme, addressing a gap in the relevant theory. Additionally, we develop another structure-preserving parametric finite element scheme that can preserve both area conservation and energy stability. Finally, we present several numerical simulations to show accuracy and efficiency as well as some structure-preserving properties of the proposed numerical methods. More importantly, extensive numerical simulations reveal that our schemes provide better mesh quality and are more suitable for long-term computations.</description>

      <title>Ultra-weak least squares discretizations for unique continuation and Cauchy problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, conditional stability estimates are derived for unique continuation and Cauchy problems associated to the Poisson equation in ultra-weak variational form. Numerical approximations are obtained as minima of regularized least squares functionals. The arising dual norms are replaced by discretized dual norms, which leads to a mixed formulation in terms of trial- and test-spaces. For stable pairs of such spaces, and a proper choice of the regularization parameter, the $L_2$-error on a subdomain in the obtained numerical approximation can be bounded by the best possible fractional power of the sum of the data error and the error of best approximation. Compared to the use of a standard variational formulation, the latter two errors are measured in weaker norms. To avoid the use of $C^1$-finite element test spaces, nonconforming finite element test spaces can be applied as well. They either lead to the qualitatively same error bound, or in a simplified version, to such an error bound modulo an additional data oscillation term. Numerical results illustrate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A randomized small-block Lanczos method for large-scale null space computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the null space of a large sparse matrix $A$ is a challenging computational problem, especially if the nullity -- the dimension of the null space -- is large. When using a block Lanczos method for this purpose, conventional wisdom suggests to use a block size $d$ that is not smaller than the nullity. In this work, we show how randomness can be utilized to allow for smaller $d$ without sacrificing convergence or reliability. Even $d = 1$, corresponding to the standard single-vector Lanczos method, becomes a safe choice. This is achieved by using a small random diagonal perturbation, which moves the zero eigenvalues of $A^{\mathsf{T}} A$ away from each other, and a random initial guess. We analyze the effect of the perturbation on the attainable quality of the null space and derive convergence results that establish robust convergence for $d=1$. As demonstrated by our numerical experiments, a smaller block size combined with restarting and partial reorthogonalization results in reduced memory requirements and computational effort. It also allows for the incremental computation of the null space, without requiring a priori knowledge of the nullity.</description>

      <title>Strongly consistent low-dissipation WENO schemes for finite elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a way to maintain strong consistency and facilitate error analysis in the context of dissipation-based WENO stabilization for continuous and discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of conservation laws. Following Kuzmin and Vedral (J. Comput. Phys. 487:112153, 2023) and Vedral (arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.12019), we use WENO shock detectors to determine appropriate amounts of low-order artificial viscosity. In contrast to existing WENO methods, our approach blends candidate polynomials using residual-based nonlinear weights. The shock-capturing terms of our stabilized Galerkin methods vanish if residuals do. This enables us to achieve improved accuracy compared to weakly consistent alternatives. As we show in the context of steady convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equations, nonlinear local projection stabilization terms can be included in a way that preserves the coercivity of local bilinear forms. For the corresponding Galerkin-WENO discretization of a CDR problem, we rigorously derive a priori error estimates. Additionally, we demonstrate the stability and accuracy of the proposed method through one- and two-dimensional numerical experiments for hyperbolic conservation laws and systems thereof. The numerical results for representative test problems are superior to those obtained with traditional WENO schemes, particularly in scenarios involving shocks and steep gradients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article aims to present the $AT$ algorithm, a novel two-step iterative approach for approximating fixed points of weak contractions within complete normed linear spaces. The article demonstrates the convergence of $AT$ algorithm towards fixed points of weak contractions. Notably, it establishes the algorithm's strong convergence properties, highlighting its faster convergence compared to established iterative methods such as $S$, normal-$S$, Varat, Mann, Ishikawa, $F^{*} $, and Picard algorithms. Additionally, the study explores the $AT$ algorithm's almost stable behavior for weak contractions. Emphasizing practical applicability, the paper offers data-dependent results through the $AT$ algorithm and substantiates findings with illustrative numerical examples</description>

      <title>A Bistatic Sensing System in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensing is anticipated to have wider extensions in communication systems with the boom of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) during the past years. In this paper, we study a bistatic sensing system by maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ration (SINR) from the target aircraft in the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). We formulate a joint optimization problem for the transmit beamforming of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite and the receive filtering of ground base station. To tackle this problem, we decompose the original problem into two sub-problems and use the alternating optimization to solve them iteratively. Using techniques of fractional programming and generalized Rayleigh quotient, the closed-form solution for each sub-problem is returned. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has good convergence performance.Moreover, the optimization of receive filtering dominates the optimality, especially when the satellite altitude becomes higher, which provides valuable network design insights.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Reduction to Random Spectral Submanifolds in Random Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems in engineering and physics are often subject to irregular excitations that are best modeled as random. Monte Carlo simulations are routinely performed on such random models to obtain statistics on their long-term response. Such simulations, however, are prohibitively expensive and time consuming for high-dimensional nonlinear systems. Here we propose to decrease this numerical burden significantly by reducing the full system to very low-dimensional, attracting, random invariant manifolds in its phase space and performing the Monte Carlo simulations on that reduced dynamical system. The random spectral submanifolds (SSMs) we construct for this purpose generalize the concept of SSMs from deterministic systems under uniformly bounded random forcing. We illustrate the accuracy and speed of random SSM reduction by computing the SSM-reduced power spectral density of the randomly forced mechanical systems that range from simple oscillator chains to finite-element models of beams and plates.</description>

      <title>Treatment of near-incompressibility and volumetric locking in higher order material point methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel projection method to treat near-incompressibility and volumetric locking in small- and large-deformation elasticity and plasticity within the context of higher order material point methods. The material point method is well known to exhibit volumetric locking due to the presence of large numbers of material points per element that are used to decrease the quadrature error. Although there has been considerable research on the treatment of near-incompressibility in the traditional material point method, the issue has not been studied in depth for higher order material point methods. Using the Bbar and Fbar methods as our point of departure we develop an appropriate projection technique for material point methods that use higher order shape functions for the background discretization. The approach is based on the projection of the dilatational part of the appropriate strain rate measure onto a lower dimensional approximation space, according to the traditional Bbar and Fbar techniques, but tailored to the material point method. The presented numerical examples exhibit reduced stress oscillations and are free of volumetric locking and hourglassing phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study convergence rates of the Trotter-Kato splitting $e^{A+L} = \lim_{n \to \infty} (e^{L/n} e^{A/n})^n$ in the strong operator topology. In the first part, we use complex interpolation theory to treat generators $L$ and $A$ of contraction semigroups on Banach spaces, with $L$ relatively $A$-bounded. In the second part, we study unitary dynamics on Hilbert spaces and develop a new technique based on the concept of energy constraints. Our results provide a complete picture of the convergence rates for the Trotter splitting for all common types of Schr\"odinger and Dirac operators, including singular, confining and magnetic vector potentials, as well as molecular many-body Hamiltonians in dimension $d=3$. Using the Brezis-Mironescu inequality, we derive convergence rates for the Schr\"odinger operator with $V(x)=\pm |x|^{-a}$ potential. In each case, our conditions are fully explicit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sometimes only some digits of a numerical product or some terms of a polynomial or series product are required. Frequently these constitute the most significant or least significant part of the value, for example when computing initial values or refinement steps in iterative approximation schemes. Other situations require the middle portion. In this paper we provide algorithms for the general problem of computing a given span of coefficients within a product, that is the terms within a range of degrees for univariate polynomials or range digits of an integer. This generalizes the "middle product" concept of Hanrot, Quercia and Zimmerman. We are primarily interested in problems of modest size where constant speed up factors can improve overall system performance, and therefore focus the discussion on classical and Karatsuba multiplication and how methods may be combined.</description>

Abstract: This review paper highlights the main aspects of the development of research related to the solution of extreme problems in the theory of approximation in the spaces ${\mathcal S}^p$ and $B{\mathcal S}^p$ of periodic and almost periodic summable functions, respectively, where the $l_p$-norms of the sequences of Fourier coefficients are finite. In particular, the review contains the results known so far concerning the best, best $n$-term approximations and widths of classes of functions of one and many variables defined by means of $\psi$-derivatives and generalized moduli of smoothness in the spaces ${\mathcal S}^p$ and $B{\mathcal S}^p$. Particular attention is paid to the development of studies related to the derivation of direct and inverse approximation theorems in these spaces.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with a novel nonlinear coupled nonlocal reaction-diffusion system proposed for image restoration, characterized by the advantages of preserving low gray level features and textures.The gray level indicator in the proposed model is regularized using a new method based on porous media type equations, which is suitable for recovering noisy blurred images. The well-posedness, regularity, and other properties of the model are investigated, addressing the lack of theoretical analysis in those existing similar types of models. Numerical experiments conducted on texture and satellite images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in denoising and deblurring tasks.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Channel Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of an optimal mapping between Hilbert spaces $IN$ and $OUT$, based on a series of density matrix mapping measurements $\rho^{(l)} \to \varrho^{(l)}$, $l=1\dots M$, is formulated as an optimization problem maximizing the total fidelity $\mathcal{F}=\sum_{l=1}^{M} \omega^{(l)} F\left(\varrho^{(l)},\sum_s B_s \rho^{(l)} B^{\dagger}_s\right)$ subject to probability preservation constraints on Kraus operators $B_s$. For $F(\varrho,\sigma)$ in the form that total fidelity can be represented as a quadratic form with superoperator $\mathcal{F}=\sum_s\left\langle B_s\middle|S\middle| B_s \right\rangle$ (either exactly or as an approximation) an iterative algorithm is developed to find the global maximum. The result comprises in $N_s$ operators $B_s$ that collectively form an $IN$ to $OUT$ quantum channel $A^{OUT}=\sum_s B_s A^{IN} B_s^{\dagger}$. The work introduces two important generalizations of unitary learning: 1. $IN$/$OUT$ states are represented as density matrices. 2. The mapping itself is formulated as a general quantum channel. This marks a crucial advancement from the commonly studied unitary mapping of pure states $\phi_l=\mathcal{U} \psi_l$ to a general quantum channel, what allows us to distinguish probabilistic mixture of states and their superposition. An application of the approach is demonstrated on unitary learning of density matrix mapping $\varrho^{(l)}=\mathcal{U} \rho^{(l)} \mathcal{U}^{\dagger}$, in this case a quadratic on $\mathcal{U}$ fidelity can be constructed by considering $\sqrt{\rho^{(l)}} \to \sqrt{\varrho^{(l)}}$ mapping, and on a general quantum channel of Kraus rank $N_s$, where quadratic on $B_s$ fidelity is an approximation -- a quantum channel is then built as a hierarchy of unitary mappings. The approach can be applied to study decoherence effects, spontaneous coherence, synchronizing, etc.</description>

      <title>G-Adaptive mesh refinement -- leveraging graph neural networks and differentiable finite element solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel, and effective, approach to the long-standing problem of mesh adaptivity in finite element methods (FEM). FE solvers are powerful tools for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but their cost and accuracy are critically dependent on the choice of mesh points. To keep computational costs low, mesh relocation (r-adaptivity) seeks to optimise the position of a fixed number of mesh points to obtain the best FE solution accuracy. Classical approaches to this problem require the solution of a separate nonlinear "meshing" PDE to find the mesh point locations. This incurs significant cost at remeshing and relies on certain a-priori assumptions and guiding heuristics for optimal mesh point location. Recent machine learning approaches to r-adaptivity have mainly focused on the construction of fast surrogates for such classical methods. Our new approach combines a graph neural network (GNN) powered architecture, with training based on direct minimisation of the FE solution error with respect to the mesh point locations. The GNN employs graph neural diffusion (GRAND), closely aligning the mesh solution space to that of classical meshing methodologies, thus replacing heuristics with a learnable strategy, and providing a strong inductive bias. This allows for rapid and robust training and results in an extremely efficient and effective GNN approach to online r-adaptivity. This method outperforms classical and prior ML approaches to r-adaptive meshing on the test problems we consider, in particular achieving lower FE solution error, whilst retaining the significant speed-up over classical methods observed in prior ML work.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal hierarchical matrix approximation from matrix-vector products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a randomized algorithm for producing a near-optimal hierarchical off-diagonal low-rank (HODLR) approximation to an $n\times n$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$, accessible only though matrix-vector products with $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{A}^{\mathsf{T}}$. We prove that, for the rank-$k$ HODLR approximation problem, our method achieves a $(1+\beta)^{\log(n)}$-optimal approximation in expected Frobenius norm using $O(k\log(n)/\beta^3)$ matrix-vector products. In particular, the algorithm obtains a $(1+\varepsilon)$-optimal approximation with $O(k\log^4(n)/\varepsilon^3)$ matrix-vector products, and for any constant $c$, an $n^c$-optimal approximation with $O(k \log(n))$ matrix-vector products. Apart from matrix-vector products, the additional computational cost of our method is just $O(n \operatorname{poly}(\log(n), k, \beta))$. We complement the upper bound with a lower bound, which shows that any matrix-vector query algorithm requires at least $\Omega(k\log(n) + k/\varepsilon)$ queries to obtain a $(1+\varepsilon)$-optimal approximation.
  Our algorithm can be viewed as a robust version of widely used "peeling" methods for recovering HODLR matrices and is, to the best of our knowledge, the first matrix-vector query algorithm to enjoy theoretical worst-case guarantees for approximation by any hierarchical matrix class. To control the propagation of error between levels of hierarchical approximation, we introduce a new perturbation bound for low-rank approximation, which shows that the widely used Generalized Nystr\"om method enjoys inherent stability when implemented with noisy matrix-vector products. We also introduced a novel randomly perforated matrix sketching method to further control the error in the peeling algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We prove weak convergence of order one for a class of exponential based integrators for SDEs with non-globally Lipschtiz drift. Our analysis covers tamed versions of Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) based methods as well as the standard exponential schemes. The numerical performance of both the GBM and exponential tamed methods through four different multi-level Monte Carlo techniques are compared. We observe that for linear noise the standard exponential tamed method requires severe restrictions on the stepsize unlike the GBM tamed method.</description>

      <title>Hybrid hyperinterpolation over general regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05863v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an $\ell^2_2+\ell_1$-regularized discrete least squares approximation over general regions under assumptions of hyperinterpolation, named hybrid hyperinterpolation. Hybrid hyperinterpolation, using a soft thresholding operator and a filter function to shrink the Fourier coefficients approximated by a high-order quadrature rule of a given continuous function with respect to some orthonormal basis, is a combination of Lasso and filtered hyperinterpolations. Hybrid hyperinterpolation inherits features of them to deal with noisy data once the regularization parameter and the filter function are chosen well. We derive $L_2$ errors in theoretical analysis for hybrid hyperinterpolation to approximate continuous functions with noise data on sampling points. Numerical examples illustrate the theoretical results and show that well chosen regularization parameters can enhance the approximation quality over the unit-sphere and the union of disks.</description>

      <title>A second-order exponential integration constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale method for parabolic problems</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates an efficient exponential integrator generalized multiscale finite element method for solving a class of time-evolving partial differential equations in bounded domains. The proposed method first performs the spatial discretization of the model problem using constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM). This approach consists of two stages. First, the auxiliary space is constructed by solving local spectral problems, where the basis functions corresponding to small eigenvalues are captured. The multiscale basis functions are obtained in the second stage using the auxiliary space by solving local energy minimization problems over the oversampling domains. The basis functions have exponential decay outside the corresponding local oversampling regions. We shall consider the first and second-order explicit exponential Runge-Kutta approach for temporal discretization and to build a fully discrete numerical solution. The exponential integration strategy for the time variable allows us to take full advantage of the CEM-GMsFEM as it enables larger time steps due to its stability properties. We derive the error estimates in the energy norm under the regularity assumption. Finally, we will provide some numerical experiments to sustain the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Right preconditioned GMRES for arbitrary singular systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brown and Walker (1997) showed that GMRES determines a least squares solution of $ A x = b $ where $ A \in {\bf R}^{n \times n} $ without breakdown for arbitrary $ b, x_0 \in {\bf R}^n $ if and only if $A$ is range-symmetric, i.e. $ {\cal R} (A^{\rm T}) = {\cal R} (A) $, where $ A $ may be singular and $ b $ may not be in the range space ${\cal R} A)$ of $A$. In this paper, we propose applying GMRES to $ A C A^{\rm T} z = b $, where $ C \in {\bf R}^{n \times n} $ is symmetric positive definite. This determines a least squares solution $ x = CA^{\rm T} z $ of $ A x = b $ without breakdown for arbitrary (singular) matrix $A \in {\bf R}^{n \times n}$ and $ b \in {\bf R}^n $. To make the method numerically stable, we propose using the pseudoinverse with an appropriate threshold parameter to suppress the influence of tiny singular values when solving the severely ill-conditioned Hessenberg systems which arise in the Arnoldi process of GMRES when solving inconsistent range-symmetric systems. Numerical experiments show that the method taking $C$ to be the identity matrix and the inverse matrix of the diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the diagonal of $A A^{\rm T}$ gives a least squares solution even when $A$ is not range-symmetric, including the case when $ {\rm index}(A) &gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Algorithm-agnostic low-rank approximation of operator monotone matrix functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-rank approximation of a matrix function, $f(A)$, is an important task in computational mathematics. Most methods require direct access to $f(A)$, which is often considerably more expensive than accessing $A$. Persson and Kressner (SIMAX 2023) avoid this issue for symmetric positive semidefinite matrices by proposing funNystr\"om, which first constructs a Nystr\"om approximation to $A$ using subspace iteration, and then uses the approximation to directly obtain a low-rank approximation for $f(A)$. They prove that the method yields a near-optimal approximation whenever $f$ is a continuous operator monotone function with $f(0) = 0$.
  We significantly generalize the results of Persson and Kressner beyond subspace iteration. We show that if $\widehat{A}$ is a near-optimal low-rank Nystr\"om approximation to $A$ then $f(\widehat{A})$ is a near-optimal low-rank approximation to $f(A)$, independently of how $\widehat{A}$ is computed. Further, we show sufficient conditions for a basis $Q$ to produce a near-optimal Nystr\"om approximation $\widehat{A} = AQ(Q^T AQ)^{\dagger} Q^T A$. We use these results to establish that many common low-rank approximation methods produce near-optimal Nystr\"om approximations to $A$ and therefore to $f(A)$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic convergence of restarted Anderson acceleration for certain normal linear systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anderson acceleration (AA) is widely used for accelerating the convergence of an underlying fixed-point iteration $\bm{x}_{k+1} = \bm{q}( \bm{x}_{k} )$, $k = 0, 1, \ldots$, with $\bm{x}_k \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $\bm{q} \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$. Despite AA's widespread use, relatively little is understood theoretically about the extent to which it may accelerate the underlying fixed-point iteration. To this end, we analyze a restarted variant of AA with a restart size of one, a method closely related to GMRES(1). We consider the case of $\bm{q}( \bm{x} ) = M \bm{x} + \bm{b}$ with matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ either symmetric or skew-symmetric. For both classes of $M$ we compute the worst-case root-average asymptotic convergence factor of the AA method, partially relying on conjecture in the symmetric setting, proving that it is strictly smaller than that of the underlying fixed-point iteration. For symmetric $M$, we show that the AA residual iteration corresponds to a fixed-point iteration for solving an eigenvector-dependent nonlinear eigenvalue problem (NEPv), and we show how this can result in the convergence factor strongly depending on the initial iterate, which we quantify exactly in certain special cases. Conversely, for skew-symmetric $M$ we show that the AA residual iteration is closely related to a power iteration for $M$, and how this results in the convergence factor being independent of the initial iterate. Supporting numerical results are given, which also indicate the theory is applicable to the more general setting of nonlinear $\bm{q}$ with Jacobian at the fixed point that is symmetric or skew symmetric.</description>

      <title>New High-Order Numerical Methods for Hyperbolic Systems of Nonlinear PDEs with Uncertainties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop new high-order numerical methods for hyperbolic systems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with uncertainties. The new approach is realized in the semi-discrete finite-volume framework and is based on fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) interpolations in (multidimensional) random space combined with second-order piecewise linear reconstruction in physical space. Compared with spectral approximations in the random space, the presented methods are essentially non-oscillatory as they do not suffer from the Gibbs phenomenon while still achieving high-order accuracy. The new methods are tested on a number of numerical examples for both the Euler equations of gas dynamics and the Saint-Venant system of shallow-water equations. In the latter case, the methods are also proven to be well-balanced and positivity-preserving.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider the numerical solution of fractional terminal value problems (FDE-TVPs). In particular, the proposed procedure uses a Newton-type iteration which is particularly efficient when coupled with a recently-introduced step-by-step procedure for solving fractional initial value problems (FDE-IVPs), able to produce spectrally accurate solutions of FDE problems. Some numerical tests are reported to make evidence of its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A three-grid high-order immersed finite element method for the analysis of CAD models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The automated finite element analysis of complex CAD models using boundary-fitted meshes is rife with difficulties. Immersed finite element methods are intrinsically more robust but usually less accurate. In this work, we introduce an efficient, robust, high-order immersed finite element method for complex CAD models. Our approach relies on three adaptive structured grids: a geometry grid for representing the implicit geometry, a finite element grid for discretising physical fields and a quadrature grid for evaluating the finite element integrals. The geometry grid is a sparse VDB (Volumetric Dynamic B+ tree) grid that is highly refined close to physical domain boundaries. The finite element grid consists of a forest of octree grids distributed over several processors, and the quadrature grid in each finite element cell is an octree grid constructed in a bottom-up fashion. We discretise physical fields on the finite element grid using high-order Lagrange basis functions. The resolution of the quadrature grid ensures that finite element integrals are evaluated with sufficient accuracy and that any sub-grid geometric features, like small holes or corners, are resolved up to a desired resolution. The conceptual simplicity and modularity of our approach make it possible to reuse open-source libraries, i.e. openVDB and p4est for implementing the geometry and finite element grids, respectively, and BDDCML for iteratively solving the discrete systems of equations in parallel using domain decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach by solving the Poisson equation on domains given by complex CAD models and discretised with tens of millions of degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Sharp Lower Bounds on the Manifold Widths of Sobolev and Besov Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04407v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of determining the manifold $n$-widths of Sobolev and Besov spaces with error measured in the $L_p$-norm. The manifold widths control how efficiently these spaces can be approximated by general non-linear parametric methods with the restriction that the parameter selection and parameterization maps must be continuous. Existing upper and lower bounds only match when the Sobolev or Besov smoothness index $q$ satisfies $q\leq p$ or $1 \leq p \leq 2$. We close this gap and obtain sharp lower bounds for all $1 \leq p,q \leq \infty$ for which a compact embedding holds. A key part of our analysis is to determine the exact value of the manifold widths of finite dimensional $\ell^M_q$-balls in the $\ell_p$-norm when $p\leq q$. Although this result is not new, we provide a new proof and apply it to lower bounding the manifold widths of Sobolev and Besov spaces. Our results show that the Bernstein widths, which are typically used to lower bound the manifold widths, decay asymptotically faster than the manifold widths in many cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose, analyze and demonstrate a dynamic momentum method to accelerate power and inverse power iterations with minimal computational overhead. The method can be applied to real diagonalizable matrices, is provably convergent with acceleration in the symmetric case, and does not require a priori spectral knowledge. We review and extend background results on previously developed static momentum accelerations for the power iteration through the connection between the momentum accelerated iteration and the standard power iteration applied to an augmented matrix. We show that the augmented matrix is defective for the optimal parameter choice. We then present our dynamic method which updates the momentum parameter at each iteration based on the Rayleigh quotient and two previous residuals. We present convergence and stability theory for the method by considering a power-like method consisting of multiplying an initial vector by a sequence of augmented matrices. We demonstrate the developed method on a number of benchmark problems, and see that it outperforms both the power iteration and often the static momentum acceleration with optimal parameter choice. Finally, we present and demonstrate an explicit extension of the algorithm to inverse power iterations.</description>

      <title>ROM inversion of monostatic data lifted to full MIMO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lippmann--Schwinger--Lanczos (LSL) algorithm has recently been shown to provide an efficient tool for imaging and direct inversion of synthetic aperture radar data in multi-scattering environments [17], where the data set is limited to the monostatic, a.k.a. single input/single output (SISO) measurements. The approach is based on constructing data-driven estimates of internal fields via a reduced-order model (ROM) framework and then plugging them into the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation. However, the approximations of the internal solutions may have more error due to missing the off diagonal elements of the multiple input/multiple output (MIMO) matrix valued transfer function. This, in turn, may result in multiple echoes in the image. Here we present a ROM-based data completion algorithm to mitigate this problem. First, we apply the LSL algorithm to the SISO data as in [17] to obtain approximate reconstructions as well as the estimate of internal field. Next, we use these estimates to calculate a forward Lippmann-Schwinger integral to populate the missing off-diagonal data (the lifting step). Finally, to update the reconstructions, we solve the Lippmann-Schwinger equation using the original SISO data, where the internal fields are constructed from the lifted MIMO data. The steps of obtaining the approximate reconstructions and internal fields and populating the missing MIMO data entries can be repeated for complex models to improve the images even further. Efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated on 2D and 2.5D numerical examples, where we see reconstructions are improved substantially.</description>

Abstract: We consider systematic numerical approximation of a viscoelastic phase separation model that describes the demixing of a polymer solvent mixture. An unconditionally stable discretisation method is proposed based on a finite element approximation in space and a variational time discretization strategy. The proposed method preserves the energy-dissipation structure of the underlying system exactly and allows to establish a fully discrete nonlinear stability estimate in natural norms based on the concept of relative energy. These estimates are used to derive order optimal error estimates for the method under minimal smoothness assumptions on the problem data, despite the presence of various strong nonlinearities in the equations. The theoretical results and main properties of the method are illustrated by numerical simulations which also demonstrate the capability to reproduce the relevant physical effects observed in experiments.</description>

Abstract: A new, more efficient, numerical method for the SDOF problem is presented. Its construction is based on the weak form of the equation of motion, as obtained in part I of the paper, using piece-wise polynomial functions as interpolation functions. The approximation rate can be arbitrarily high, proportional to the degree of the interpolation functions, tempered only by numerical instability. Moreover, the mechanical energy of the system is conserved. Consequently, all significant drawbacks of existing algorithms, such as the limitations imposed by the Dahlqvist Barrier theorem and the need for introduction of numerical damping, have been overcome.</description>

Abstract: The article concerns low-rank approximation of matrices generated by sampling a smooth function of two $m$-dimensional variables. We refute an argument made in the literature that, for a specific class of analytic functions, such matrices admit accurate entrywise approximation of rank that is independent of $m$. We provide a theoretical explanation of the numerical results presented in support of this argument, describing three narrower classes of functions for which $n \times n$ function-generated matrices can be approximated within an entrywise error of order $\varepsilon$ with rank $\mathcal{O}(\log(n) \varepsilon^{-2} \mathrm{polylog}(\varepsilon^{-1}))$ that is independent of the dimension $m$: (i) functions of the inner product of the two variables, (ii) functions of the squared Euclidean distance between the variables, and (iii) shift-invariant positive-definite kernels. We extend our argument to low-rank tensor-train approximation of tensors generated with functions of the multi-linear product of their $m$-dimensional variables. We discuss our results in the context of low-rank approximation of attention in transformer neural networks.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Moreau-Yosida Tensor Train Approximation of State-constrained Optimization Problems under Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm to solve optimization problems constrained by partial (ordinary) differential equations under uncertainty, with almost sure constraints on the state variable. To alleviate the computational burden of high-dimensional random variables, we approximate all random fields by the tensor-train decomposition. To enable efficient tensor-train approximation of the state constraints, the latter are handled using the Moreau-Yosida penalty, with an additional smoothing of the positive part (plus/ReLU) function by a softplus function. In a special case of a quadratic cost minimization constrained by linear elliptic partial differential equations, and some additional constraint qualification, we prove strong convergence of the regularized solution to the optimal control. This result also proposes a practical recipe for selecting the smoothing parameter as a function of the penalty parameter. We develop a second order Newton type method with a fast matrix-free action of the approximate Hessian to solve the smoothed Moreau-Yosida problem. This algorithm is tested on benchmark elliptic problems with random coefficients, optimization problems constrained by random elliptic variational inequalities, and a real-world epidemiological model with 20 random variables. These examples demonstrate mild (at most polynomial) scaling with respect to the dimension and regularization parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamic behaviour of a power system can be described by a system of differential-algebraic equations. Time-domain simulations are used to simulate the evolution of these dynamics. They often require the use of small time step sizes and therefore become computationally expensive. To accelerate these simulations, we propose a simulator - PINNSim - that allows to take significantly larger time steps. It is based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for the solution of the dynamics of single components in the power system. To resolve their interaction we employ a scalable root-finding algorithm. We demonstrate PINNSim on a 9-bus system and show the increased time step size compared to a trapezoidal integration rule. We discuss key characteristics of PINNSim and important steps for developing PINNSim into a fully fledged simulator. As such, it could offer the opportunity for significantly increasing time step sizes and thereby accelerating time-domain simulations.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Boundary Integral Networks (PIBI-Nets): A Data-Driven Approach for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used to describe relevant phenomena in dynamical systems. In real-world applications, we commonly need to combine formal PDE models with (potentially noisy) observations. This is especially relevant in settings where we lack information about boundary or initial conditions, or where we need to identify unknown model parameters. In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have become a popular tool for this kind of problems. In high-dimensional settings, however, PINNs often suffer from computational problems because they usually require dense collocation points over the entire computational domain. To address this problem, we present Physics-Informed Boundary Integral Networks (PIBI-Nets) as a data-driven approach for solving PDEs in one dimension less than the original problem space. PIBI-Nets only require points at the computational domain boundary, while still achieving highly accurate results. Moreover, PIBI-Nets clearly outperform PINNs in several practical settings. Exploiting elementary properties of fundamental solutions of linear differential operators, we present a principled and simple way to handle point sources in inverse problems. We demonstrate the excellent performance of PIBI- Nets for the Laplace and Poisson equations, both on artificial datasets and within a real-world application concerning the reconstruction of groundwater flows.</description>

      <title>Monotone Generative Modeling via a Gromov-Monge Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01375</link>

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are popular for generative tasks; however, they often require careful architecture selection, extensive empirical tuning, and are prone to mode collapse. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel model that identifies the low-dimensional structure of the underlying data distribution, maps it into a low-dimensional latent space while preserving the underlying geometry, and then optimally transports a reference measure to the embedded distribution. We prove three key properties of our method: 1) The encoder preserves the geometry of the underlying data; 2) The generator is $c$-cyclically monotone, where $c$ is an intrinsic embedding cost employed by the encoder; and 3) The discriminator's modulus of continuity improves with the geometric preservation of the data. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating high-quality images and exhibiting robustness to both mode collapse and training instability.</description>

      <title>$L^\infty$-error bounds for approximations of the Koopman operator by kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is a well-established method to generate a data-driven approximation of the Koopman operator for analysis and prediction of nonlinear dynamical systems. Recently, kernel EDMD (kEDMD) has gained popularity due to its ability to resolve the challenging task of choosing a suitable dictionary by using the kernel's canonical features and, thus, data-informed observables. In this paper, we provide the first pointwise bounds on the approximation error of kEDMD. The main idea consists of two steps. First, we show that the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of Wendland functions are invariant under the Koopman operator. Second, exploiting that the learning problem given by regression in the native norm can be recast as an interpolation problem, we prove our novel error bounds by using interpolation estimates. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments.</description>
