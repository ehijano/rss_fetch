      <title>Machine learning methods for subpixel trajectory reconstruction in discretized position detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate that compared with traditional centroid-based methods, machine learning methods (particularly transformer-based architectures) achieve superior subpixel position and therefore angular resolution in discretized particle detectors. Using Geant4 Monte Carlo simulated cosmic ray muon data from an 8x8 segmented scintillator detector array, we compare four reconstruction approaches: transformer neural networks, convolutional neural networks, linear regression, and energy-weighted centroids. The transformer architecture achieves the best angular reconstruction with a root mean square error of 1.14{\deg} and a position mean absolute error of 0.24 cm, representing improvements of 2.22x and 6.33x, respectively, over the centroid method. These results enable precise particle trajectory reconstruction for applications in muon tomography and cosmic ray detection.</description>

      <title>Synchromodulametry: A Hardware-First, Metric-Aware Measurement Interface for Multimessenger Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Synchromodulametry, a hardware-first and metric-aware measurement interface intended to make coherence, rather than coincidence, a native object of multimessenger sensor networks. The framework is organized around two derived constructs: (i) an effective observable that restores continuity of information flow under non-ideal detector liveness, including deadtime, saturation, and veto conditions; and (ii) a metric-aware delay and phase alignment layer that treats timing as a geometry-modulated control variable rather than a flat-time nuisance.
  We present a derivation-complete pipeline from raw digitized streams to normalized observables, from liveness-aware gating to causal persistence kernels implementable in firmware, from proper-time and null propagation to latency corrections, and from cross-covariance structure to a log-determinant coherence functional suitable for real-time triggering and informational tomography. In contrast to coincidence-based pipelines that collapse timing into a binary window, Synchromodulametry exposes coherence as a continuous, hardware-native state variable that persists under detector liveness gaps and metric-modulated delays.</description>

      <title>Design of a high-resolution ion pulse ionization chamber for 222Rn decays detection in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that contributes significantly to human radiation exposure and must be controlled to avoid concentrations harmful to health.
  The paper presents an impulse-proportional ionization chamber that is suitable for the direct measurement of low radon concentrations in ambient air and achieves spectroscopic resolutions of 2-3%.
  This accuracy can be achieved through two novel principles. Firstly, the double-cylindrical, coaxial design of the IC allows for efficient, nearly complete detection of $\alpha$-radiation. Secondly, a customized measurement method for spectroscopic evaluation was developed to discriminate between the proportions of 222Rn, 218Po, and 214Po and extract their concentrations. Particular attention was paid to the energy resolution of the detection system by suppressing the effects of acoustic and vibration noise on the detector's operation.
  The high spectral resolution of the developed ionization chamber, with working volumes of 7.7l and 8.7l, enables measurements with uncertainties of less than 5\% at 15-minute measurement times in ambient air with $50\,\mathrm{Bq/m^3}$ radon activity.</description>

      <title>Calibration of an Irradiated Prototype for the EIC Zero-Degree Calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the response of a prototype Zero-Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) detector to irradiation equivalent to 10$^{11}$ 1-MeV protons/cm$^2$, which matches the expected exposure after one year of operation at full nominal luminosity at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The prototype consists of 563 channels and represents about 10 percent of the final ZDC design in terms of both channel count and detector volume. It was irradiated at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) with a dose equivalent to 10$^{11}$ protons/cm$^2$. We demonstrate that, despite significant radiation damage to the SiPMs and non-uniform degradation across the detector volume, the detector can be successfully calibrated on a channel-by-channel basis using cosmic-ray data. The damage profile, similar to what is expected in the experiment, varies by an order of magnitude or more across the detector. Even for the most heavily damaged channels, the signal-to-noise ratio for a MIP signal remains above 5. This study provides a realistic test of the system's performance under irradiation. It complements previous SiPM-specific irradiation studies and will inform the future operation of the ZDC and other detectors that use SiPM-on-tile technology.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of VUV luminescence in dual-phase xenon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic measurements of xenon luminescence in a time projection chamber operated in a dual-phase (liquid-gas) configuration. Thorium-228 $\alpha$ decays excited the liquid, resulting in the formation of singlet and triplet excimers that emit vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) scintillation. Ionisation electrons were drifted to the liquid surface and extracted into the vapour, where they produced VUV electroluminescence. A time-resolved photon-counting technique was used to obtain the scintillation spectrum in the liquid, which exhibited a peak wavelength of $177.1\pm0.1_\mathrm{stat} \pm0.1_\mathrm{sys}\,\textrm{nm}$ and a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of $11.3\pm0.2_\mathrm{stat} \pm0.0_\mathrm{sys}\,\textrm{nm}$. The data were also used to obtain distinct singlet and triplet emission models, with the singlet emission peaking $1.8\pm0.3_{\mathrm{stat}}\pm 0.3_{\mathrm{sys}}\,\textrm{nm}$ shorter than the triplet. The gas electroluminescence spectrum was obtained simultaneously, while under conditions of thermal equilibrium. It remained consistent across vapour pressures of $1.3$-$2.2\,\textrm{bar}$, with a peak of $173.28\pm0.02_\mathrm{stat} {_{-0.1}^{+0.2}}{}_\mathrm{sys}\,\textrm{nm}$, a FWHM of $10.59\pm0.03_\mathrm{stat} {_{-0.2}^{+0.0}}{}_\mathrm{sys}\,\textrm{nm}$, and a small short-wavelength tail that constitutes $(0.6\pm0.1)$% of the total spectrum. These are the only spectroscopic measurements of liquid scintillation and gas electroluminescence acquired simultaneously to date, and the first such measurements of singlet and triplet emission in the liquid phase. They are important for precisely characterising dual-phase xenon detectors used to search for dark matter particle interactions and other rare events.</description>

      <title>The throttling refrigeration system for the large cooling power recovery of the PandaX-xT cryogenic distillation system for radon removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to solve the continuous large cooling power supply problem (20 kW) for the radon-removal cryogenic distillation system, which operates at high liquid ffow rate of 856 kg/h (5 LPM) for the dark matter detector PandaX-xT of the next-generation, a throttling refrigeration system based on carbon tetraffuoride (R14) refrigerant for cooling power recovery is designed and developed. According to this system, the cooling power of the liquid xenon in the reboiler of 178K could be transferred to the product xenon cryostat to liquefy the gaseous product xenon by the R14 circulation, thus the liqueffed xenon could return to the detector with the same condition of which extracted from the detector to form a stable cooling cycle and prevent the instability of the detector. A research and development experiment is implemented to validate the feasibility of this large cooling recovery system, using the ethanol to simulate the liquid xenon. Experimental results show that the cooling power recovery of this system could achieve 17 kW with the efffciency of 76.5%, and the R14 ffow rate is 0.16 kg/s. This study realizes the online radon removal distillation with large ffow rate while eliminating the dependence of liquid nitrogen or cryocoolers, which means saving 2414 m3 liquid nitrogen per year or the power consumption of 230 kW. Furthermore, process simulation and optimization of the throttling refrigeration cycle is studied using Aspen Hysys to reveal the inffuences of the key parameters to the system, and the deviation between the simulation and experimental results is &lt; 2.52%.</description>

      <title>Operation of a tunable Power over Fiber system for light detectors down to 4.6 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Power over Fiber (PoF) technology delivers electrical power by transmitting laser light through a lightweight, non-conductive fiber optic cable to a remote photovoltaic optical converter, which in turn powers sensors or electrical devices. Among the several advantages offered by this solution are spark-free operation in the presence of electric fields, elimination of noise induced by power lines, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and high robustness in hostile environments. The R\&amp;D for the application of PoF in cryogenic environments started at FNAL and BNL (USA) in 2020 to power the Photon Detection System of the DUNE Vertical Drift module. This paper presents the results obtained in the framework of Cryo-PoF project where we developed a single-laser input line system to power an electronic amplifier and the photosensors at cryogenic temperatures. Unlike the DUNE solution, our system allows tuning of the photosensor bias by adjusting the input laser power. We also demonstrate the operation of the optical converter at temperatures down to 4.6 K, opening the possibility of using this technology in a much broader range of applications.</description>

      <title>Applications of silicon carbide as window materials in atomic cells and atomic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic cells made by anodically bonding silicon and borosilicate glasses are widely used in atomic devices.
  One inherent problem in these cells is that the silicon material blocks beams with wavelengths shorter than
  1000 nm, which limits available optical accesses when alkali metal atoms are involved. In this work, we
  investigate the possibility of the silicon carbide material as an alternative of silicon materials in fabricating
  anodically bonded cells. We demonstrate that the optical, thermal and mechanical properties of silicon carbide
  help to improve the performance of atomic devices in certain applications.</description>

      <title>Electron spectral shape of the third-forbidden $\beta$-decay of $^{87}$Rb measured using a Rb$_2$ZrCl$_6$ crystal scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, interest in experimental studies of $\beta$-decay electron spectra -- often referred to as $\beta$ spectra -- has been growing. This is particularly true for $\beta$ transitions where the electron spectra are sensitive to the effective value of the weak axial coupling, $g_{\rm A}$. Such measurements serve as important benchmarks for nuclear physics calculations and can also be used to characterize background in astroparticle physics experiments. In this work, a dedicated experiment has been carried out to investigate the spectral shape of the third-forbidden $^{87}$Rb $\beta$-decays, with the goal of estimating the effective $g_{\rm A}$ value for this transition and of deriving the T$_{1/2}$ value. This was done by comparing the experimental spectral shape with the estimates from various phenomenological models. The $^{87}$Rb source was embedded directly within the detector material of a new Rb$_2$ZrCl$_6$ crystal scintillator; the data taking was performed deep underground at Gran Sasso National Laboratory. The obtained experimental half-life value for the studied process is T$_{1/2} = 5.08(13) \times$ 10$^{10}$ yr; while a $g_{\rm A}$ value in the range 0.4 to 0.6 is obtained when accounting for uncertainties and depending on the model adopted as discussed in detail in the text.</description>

      <title>Study of laser-beam arrival time synchronization towards sub-picosecond stability level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A precise synchronization between laser pulse and electron beam arrival time is essential for achieving sub-picosecond stability in modern accelerator facilities. In this work, a Low-Level RF system architecture combined with White Rabbit based timing system has been tested through a collaboration between KEK (Japan) and CNRS/IN2P3, IJClab (France). The setup combines a frequency standard generator, an IDROGEN carrier board with an embedded White Rabbit node, and SkyWorks synthesizers of different form factors to distribute phase-locked clock signals over telecommunication fiber. Phase noise power spectral density measurements were performed at several RF sub-harmonics to confirm synchronization performance. These results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the White Rabbit-IDROGEN synchronization scheme for large-scale accelerators, including applications to laser-based diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Supernova Pointing Capabilities of DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The determination of the direction of a stellar core collapse via its neutrino emission is crucial for the identification of the progenitor for a multimessenger follow-up. A highly effective method of reconstructing supernova directions within the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is introduced. The supernova neutrino pointing resolution is studied by simulating and reconstructing electron-neutrino charged-current absorption on 40Ar and elastic scattering of neutrinos on electrons. Procedures to reconstruct individual interactions, including a newly developed technique called ``brems flipping'', as well as the burst direction from an ensemble of interactions are described. Performance of the burst direction reconstruction is evaluated for supernovae happening at a distance of 10 kpc for a specific supernova burst flux model. The pointing resolution is found to be 3.4 degrees at 68% coverage for a perfect interaction-channel classification and a fiducial mass of 40 kton, and 6.6 degrees for a 10 kton fiducial mass respectively. Assuming a 4% rate of charged-current interactions being misidentified as elastic scattering, DUNE's burst pointing resolution is found to be 4.3 degrees (8.7 degrees) at 68% coverage.</description>

      <title>Large volume 'chunk' lift out for 3D tomographic analysis using analytical plasma focussed ion beam -- scanning electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterization of the structure and properties of materials in three dimensions, including grains and the residual pattern of deformation, provides necessary information required to guide materials design as well as support materials modelling efforts. In this work, we present an overview of site-specific large volume 'chunk' lift out and 3D serial sectioning of substantive volumes (e.g. 200 x 200 x 400 um3), where sectioning is optimized for 3D electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) based crystallographic analysis, using a plasma (Xe) focussed ion beam scanning electron microscope (plasma FIB-SEM) equipped to perform EBSD using a 'static' configuration (i.e. slicing and EBSD-mapping are performed without moving the sample). This workflow is demonstrated through the 3D plasma FIB-SEM based EBSD analysis of an indent made within a polycrystal of pure magnesium. The lift out approach is suitable for a wide range of materials, and we offer a step-by-step guide within the present work to provide opportunity for others to more easily enter this field and collect valuable data.</description>

      <title>Identification of tau leptons using a convolutional neural network with domain adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A tau lepton identification algorithm, DeepTau, based on convolutional neural network techniques, has been developed in the CMS experiment to discriminate reconstructed hadronic decays of tau leptons ($\tau_\mathrm{h}$) from quark or gluon jets and electrons and muons that are misreconstructed as $\tau_\mathrm{h}$ candidates. The latest version of this algorithm, v2.5, includes domain adaptation by backpropagation, a technique that reduces discrepancies between collision data and simulation in the region with the highest purity of genuine $\tau_\mathrm{h}$ candidates. Additionally, a refined training workflow improves classification performance with respect to the previous version of the algorithm, with a reduction of 30$-$50% in the probability for quark and gluon jets to be misidentified as $\tau_\mathrm{h}$ candidates for given reconstruction and identification efficiencies. This paper presents the novel improvements introduced in the DeepTau algorithm and evaluates its performance in LHC proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 and 13.6 TeV collected in 2018 and 2022 with integrated luminosities of 60 and 35 fb$^{-1}$, respectively. Techniques to calibrate the performance of the $\tau_\mathrm{h}$ identification algorithm in simulation with respect to its measured performance in real data are presented, together with a subset of results among those measured for use in CMS physics analyses.</description>
