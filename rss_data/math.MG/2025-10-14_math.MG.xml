      <title>Quasi-conformal VS quasi-isometric equivalence in spaces with controlled growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study conditions under which quasi-conformal homeomorphisms are quasi-isometries. We show that if two nilpotent geodesic Lie groups are quasi-conformally homeomorphic, then they are quasi-isometrically equivalent. We also give more general results beyond the nilpotent case. In particular, we show that quasi-conformal homeomorphisms between geodesic Lie groups are quasi-isometries whenever the spaces have strict parabolic or hyperbolic conformal type. As a consequence, quasi-conformal homeomorphisms between geodesic Lie groups with infinite fundamental group are quasi-isometries. The statements for Lie groups are deduced from a more general study on metric measure spaces with uniformly locally bounded geometry.</description>

      <title>Collapsibility and Near Universality for Vertex Minimal Paper Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A paper torus is a piecewise linear isometric embedding of a flat
  torus into $\R^3$.
  Following up on the $8$-vertex paper tori discovered
  by the second author, we prove universality and collapsibility results
  about these objects. One corollary
  is that any flat torus without reflection
  symmetry is realized as an $8$-vertex paper torus. Another
  corollary is that, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, there is an $8$-vertex
  paper torus within $\epsilon$ of a unit equilateral triangle
  in the Hausdorff metric.</description>

      <title>Outer length billiards on polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical inner and outer billiards can be formulated in variational terms, with length and area as the respective generating functions. The other two combinations, ``inner with area'' and ``outer with length,'' are more recently described. Here, we consider the latter system in the special case of polygonal tables. We describe the behavior of orbits far away from the table and pose conjectures regarding an escaping orbit when the table is a square. This paper is meant to complement arXiv:2510.08370 which handles smooth tables with positive curvature.</description>

      <title>Metric Sobolev spaces II: dual energies and divergence measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second of two works concerning the Sobolev calculus on metric measure spaces and its applications. In this work, we focus on several approaches to vector calculus in the non-smooth setting of complete and separable metric spaces equipped with a boundedly-finite Borel measure. More precisely, we study different notions of (co)vector fields and derivations appearing in the literature, as well as their mutual relation. We also carry forward a thorough investigation of gradients, divergence measures, and Laplacian measures, together with their applications in potential analysis (for example, regarding the condenser capacity) and in the study of duality properties of Sobolev spaces. Most of the results are obtained for the full range of exponents $p\in[1,\infty)$ and without finiteness assumption on the measure.</description>

      <title>Metric Poincar\'e inequalities for graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article considers embeddings of bounded degree graphs into general metric spaces. Our first main result is a metric analogue of Matou\v{s}ek's extrapolation that relates the Poincar\'e constants $\gamma(G,\varrho^p)$ and $\gamma(G,\varrho^q)$ for any pair of exponents $0 &lt; p,q &lt; \infty$, any bounded degree expander graph $G$, and any metric space $\mathcal{M}=(M,\varrho)$. Our second main result provides a sharp estimate of the Poincar\'e constant $\gamma(G,\varrho)$ in terms of the cardinalities of the vertex set of $G$ and the target metric space $\mathcal{M}=(M,\varrho)$, in the setting of \textit{random} graphs. Both theorems utilize a novel structural dichotomy for metric embeddings of graphs.
  These results lead to the resolution of several problems within the theory of metric embeddings. Among the applications are estimates on the nonlinear spectral gap of metric snowflakes, optimal estimates on the minimum cardinality of (bi-Lipschitz) universal metric spaces for graphs, and sharp lower bounds on the bi-Lipschitz distortion of random regular graphs into arbitrary metric spaces of large cardinality.</description>

      <title>Exponential polynomials and identification of polygonal regions from Fourier samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the set $E(D, N)$ of all bivariate exponential polynomials $$ f(\xi, \eta) = \sum_{j=1}^n p_j(\xi, \eta) e^{2\pi i (x_j\xi+y_j\eta)}, $$ where the polynomials $p_j \in \mathbb{C}[\xi, \eta]$ have degree $&lt;D$, $n\le N$ and where $x_j, y_j \in \mathbb{T} = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$. We find a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2$ that depends on $N$ and $D$ only and is of size $O(D^2 N \log N)$ such that the values of $f$ on $A$ determine $f$. Notice that the size of $A$ is only larger by a logarithmic quantity than the number of parameters needed to write down $f$.
  We use this in order to prove some uniqueness results about polygonal regions given a small set of samples of the Fourier Transform of their indicator function. If the number of different slopes of the edges of the polygonal region is $\le k$ then the region is determined from a predetermined set of Fourier samples that depends only on $k$ and the maximum number of vertices $N$ and is of size $O(k^2 N \log N)$. In the particular case where all edges are known to be parallel to the axes the polygonal region is determined from a set of $O(N \log N)$ Fourier samples that depends on $N$ only.
  Our methods are non-constructive.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Riemannian Lie groups with nilpotency step 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive sharp estimates comparing asymptotic Riemannian or sub-Riemannian metrics in 2-step nilpotent Lie groups. For each metric, we construct a Carnot metric whose square remains at bounded distance from the square of the original metric. In particular, we deduce the analogue of a conjectire by Burago-Margulis: every 2-step nilpotent Riemannian Lie group is at bounded distance from its asymptotic cone. As a consequence, we obtain a refined estimate of the error term in the asymptotic expansion of the volume of the (sub-)Riemannian metric balls. To achive this, we develop a novel technique to efficiently perturb rectifiable curves modifying their endpoints in a prescribed vertical direction.</description>

      <title>Canonical Ramsey: triangles, rectangles and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a seminal work, Cheng and Xu showed that if $S$ is a square or a triangle with a certain property, then for every positive integer $r$ there exists $n_0(S)$ independent of $r$ such that every $r$-coloring of $\mathbb{E}^n$ with $n\ge n_0(S)$ contains a monochromatic or a rainbow congruent copy of $S$. Geh\'{e}r, Sagdeev, and T\'{o}th formalized this dimension independence as the canonical Ramsey property and proved it for all hypercubes, thereby covering rectangles whose squared aspect ratio $(a/b)^2$ is rational. They asked whether this property holds for all triangles and for all rectangles.
  (1) We resolve both questions. More precisely, for triangles we confirm the property in $\mathbb{E}^4$ by developing a novel rotation-sphereical chaining argument. For rectangles, we introduce a structural reduction to product configurations of bounded color complexity, enabling the use of the simplex Ramsey theorem together with product Ramsey theorem.
  (2) Beyond this, we develop a concise perturbation framework based on an iterative embedding coupled with the Frankl-R\"{o}dl simplex super-Ramsey theorem, which yields the canonical Ramsey property for a natural class of 3-dimensional simplices and also furnishes an alternative proof for triangles.</description>
