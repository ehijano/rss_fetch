      <title>A Khintchine inequality for central Fourier series on non-Kac compact quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of Khintchin inequalities has a long history in abstract harmonic analysis. While there is almost no possibility of non-trivial Khintchine inequality for central Fourier series on compact connected semisimple Lie groups, we demonstrate a strong contrast within the framework of compact quantum groups. Specifically, we establish a Khintchine inequality with operator coefficients for arbitrary central Fourier series in a large class of non-Kac compact quantum groups. The main examples include the Drinfeld-Jimbo $q$-deformations $G_q$, the free orthogonal quantum groups $O_F^+$, and the quantum automorphism group $G_{aut}(B,\psi)$ with a $\delta$-form $\psi$.</description>

      <title>Universal covering groups of unitary groups of von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a short and simple proof, utilizing the pre-determinant of P. de la Harpe and G. Skandalis, that the universal covering group of the unitary group of a II$_1$ von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{M}$, when equipped with the norm topology, splits algebraically as the direct product of the self-adjoint part of its center and the unitary group $U(\mathcal{M})$. Thus, when $\mathcal{M}$ is a II$_1$ factor, the universal covering group of $U(\mathcal{M})$ is algebraically isomorphic to the direct product $\mathbb{R} \times U(\mathcal{M})$. In particular, the question of P. de la Harpe and D. McDuff of whether the universal cover of $U(\mathcal{M})$ is a perfect group is answered in the negative.</description>

      <title>Conditional representation stability, classification of $*$-homomorphisms, and eta invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quasi-representation of a group is a map from the group into a matrix algebra (or similar object) that approximately satisfies the relations needed to be a representation. Work of many people starting with Kazhdan and Voiculescu, and recently advanced by Dadarlat, Eilers-Shulman-S\o{}rensen and others, has shown that there are topological obstructions to approximating unitary quasi-representations of groups by honest representations, where `approximation' is understood to be with respect to the operator norm.
  The purpose of this paper is to explore whether approximation is possible if the known obstructions vanish, partially generalizing work of Gong-Lin and Eilers-Loring-Pedersen for the free abelian group of rank two, and the Klein bottle group. We show that this is possible, at least in a weak sense, for some `low-dimensional' groups including fundamental groups of closed surfaces, certain Baumslag-Solitar groups, free-by-cyclic groups, and many fundamental groups of three manifolds.
  The techniques used in the paper are $K$-theoretic: they have their origin in Baum-Connes-Kasparov type assembly maps, and in the Elliott program to classify $C^*$-algebras; Kasparov's bivariant KK-theory is a crucial tool. The key new technical ingredients are: a stable uniqueness theorem in the sense of Dadarlat-Eilers and Lin that works for non-exact $C^*$-algebras; and an analysis of maps on $K$-theory with finite coefficients in terms of the relative eta invariants of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer. Despite the proofs going through $K$-theoretic machinery, the main theorems can be stated in elementary terms that do not need any $K$-theory.</description>

      <title>The inter-relationship between isomorphisms of commutative and isomorphisms of non-commutative $\log$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for the coincidence of non-commutative $\log$-algebras constructed from different exact normal semifinite traces. Consequently, we provide a criterion for the isomorphism of $\log$-algebras built on non-commutative von Neumann algebras with different exact normal semifinite traces. Additionally, we demonstrate a connection between the isomorphism of non-commutative $\log$-algebras and the isomorphism of the corresponding $\log$-algebras constructed on the center of these von Neumann algebras. Furthermore, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for the isomorphism of $\log$-algebras derived from different von Neumann algebras of type $I_n$.</description>

Abstract: We prove a Hankel-variant commutant lifting theorem. This also uncovers the complete structure of the Beurling-type reducing and invariant subspaces of Hankel operators. Kernel spaces of Hankel operators play a key role in the analysis.</description>

      <title>Emergence of brain function from structure: an algebraic quantum model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental paradigm in neuroscience is that cognitive functions -- such as perception, learning, memory, and locomotion -- are governed by the brain's structural organization. Yet, the theoretical principles explaining how the physical architecture of the nervous system shapes its function remain elusive. Here, we combine concepts from quantum statistical mechanics and graph C*-algebras to introduce a theoretical framework where functional states of a structural connectome emerge as thermal equilibrium states of the underlying directed network. These equilibrium states, defined from the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger states formalism (KMS states), quantify the relative contribution of each neuron to the information flow within the connectome. Using the prototypical connectome of the nematode {\em Caenorhabditis elegans}, we provide a comprehensive description of these KMS states, explore their functional implications, and establish the predicted functional network based on the nervous system's anatomical connectivity. Ultimately, we present a model for identifying the potential functional states of a detailed structural connectome and for conceptualizing the structure-function relationship.</description>

      <title>Controlled KK-theory, and a Milnor exact sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.10906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce controlled $KK$-theory groups associated to a pair $(A,B)$ of separable $C^*$-algebras. Roughly, these consist of elements of the usual $K$-theory group $K_0(B)$ that approximately commute with elements of $A$. Our main results show that these groups are related to Kasparov's $KK$-groups by a Milnor exact sequence, in such a way that R\o{}rdam's $KL$-group is identified with an inverse limit of our controlled $KK$-groups.
  In the case that the $C^*$-algebras involved satisfy the UCT, our Milnor exact sequence agrees with the Milnor sequence associated to a $KK$-filtration in the sense of Schochet, although our results are independent of the UCT. Applications to the UCT will be pursued in subsequent work.</description>

      <title>Equivariant homotopy classification of graph C*-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that shift equivalence of essential adjacency matrices coincides with gauge-equivariant homotopy equivalence of their stabilized graph C*-algebras. This provide the first equivalent formulation of shift equivalence of essential matrices in terms of gauge actions on graph C*-algebras. Our proof uses bicategory theory for C*-bimodules developed by Meyer and Sehnem, allowing us to avoid the use of K-theory classification of C*-algebras.</description>
