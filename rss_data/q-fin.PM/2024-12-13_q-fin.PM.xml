      <title>LLMs for Time Series: an Application for Single Stocks and Statistical Arbitrage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, LLMs (Large Language Models) have been adapted for time series prediction with significant success in pattern recognition. However, the common belief is that these models are not suitable for predicting financial market returns, which are known to be almost random. We aim to challenge this misconception through a counterexample. Specifically, we utilized the Chronos model from Ansari et al.(2024) and tested both pretrained configurations and fine-tuned supervised forecasts on the largest American single stocks using data from Guijarro-Ordonnez et al.(2022). We constructed a long/short portfolio, and the performance simulation indicates that LLMs can in reality handle time series that are nearly indistinguishable from noise, demonstrating an ability to identify inefficiencies amidst randomness and generate alpha. Finally, we compared these results with those of specialized models and smaller deep learning models, highlighting significant room for improvement in LLM performance to further enhance their predictive capabilities.</description>

      <title>Geometric Deep Learning for Realized Covariance Matrix Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional methods employed in matrix volatility forecasting often overlook the inherent Riemannian manifold structure of symmetric positive definite matrices, treating them as elements of Euclidean space, which can lead to suboptimal predictive performance. Moreover, they often struggle to handle high-dimensional matrices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for forecasting realized covariance matrices of asset returns using a Riemannian-geometry-aware deep learning framework. In this way, we account for the geometric properties of the covariance matrices, including possible non-linear dynamics and efficient handling of high-dimensionality. Moreover, building upon a Fr\'echet sample mean of realized covariance matrices, we are able to extend the HAR model to the matrix-variate. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using daily realized covariance matrices for the 50 most capitalized companies in the S&amp;P 500 index, showing that our method outperforms traditional approaches in terms of predictive accuracy.</description>
