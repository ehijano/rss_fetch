      <title>Assembly in Directed Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assembly theory has received considerable attention in the recent past. Here we analyze the formal framework of this model and show that assembly pathways coincide with certain minimal hyperpaths in B-hypergraphs. This makes it possible to generalize the notion of assembly to general chemical reaction systems and to make explicit the connection to rule based models of chemistry, in particular DPO graph rewriting. We observe, furthermore, that assembly theory is closely related to retrosynthetic analysis in chemistry. The assembly index fits seamlessly into a large family of cost measures for directed hyperpath problems that also encompasses cost functions used in computational synthesis planning. This allows to devise a generic approach to compute complexity measures derived from minimal hyperpaths in rule-derived directed hypergraphs using integer linear programming.</description>

      <title>Large induced subgraph with a given pathwidth in outerplanar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing conjecture by Albertson and Berman states that every planar graph of order $n$ has an induced forest with at least $\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$ vertices. As a variant of this conjecture, Chappell conjectured that every planar graph of order $n$ has an induced linear forest with at least $\lceil \frac{4n}{9} \rceil$ vertices. Pelsmajer proved that every outerplanar graph of order $n$ has an induced linear forest with at least $\lceil \frac{4n+2}{7}\rceil$ vertices and this bound is sharp. In this paper, we investigate the order of induced subgraphs of outerplanar graphs with a given pathwidth. The above result by Pelsmajer implies that every outerplanar graph of order $n$ has an induced subgraph with pathwidth one and at least $\lceil \frac{4n+2}{7}\rceil$ vertices. We extend this to obtain a result on the maximum order of any outerplanar graph with at most a given pathwidth. We also give its upper bound which generalizes Pelsmajer's construction.</description>

      <title>Certified algorithms for numerical semigroups in Rocq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical semigroup is a co-finite submonoid of the monoid of non-negative integers under addition. Many properties of numerical semigroups rely on some fundamental invariants, such as, among others, the set of gaps (and its cardinality), the Ap\'ery set or the Frobenius number. Algorithms for calculating invariants are currently based on computational tools, such as GAP, which lack proofs (either formal or informal) of their correctness. In this paper we introduce a Rocq formalization of numerical semigroups. Given the semigroup generators, we provide certified algorithms for computing some of the fundamental invariants: the set of gaps, of small elements, the Ap\'ery set, the multiplicity, the conductor and the Frobenius number. To the best of our knowledge this is the first formalization of numerical semigroups in any proof assistant.</description>

      <title>From Signed Networks to Group Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I show that when there is a symmetry in a process defined on the nodes of a network, this can be captured by a new structure, the ``group graph'', in which group elements label the links of a network. I show that group graphs are a generalisation of signed networks which are an example of a $Z_2$ group graph. I also show that the concept of balance in signed networks can be generalised to group graphs. Finally, I show how the dynamics of processes on a consistent group graph are completely controlled by the topology of the underlying network, not by the symmetry group. This generalises recent results on signed networks (Tian and Lambiotte, 2024a) and complex networks (Tian and Lambiotte, 2024b).</description>

      <title>Monotone Bounded-Depth Complexity of Homomorphism Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every fixed graph $H$, it is known that homomorphism counts from $H$ and colorful $H$-subgraph counts can be determined in $O(n^{t+1})$ time on $n$-vertex input graphs $G$, where $t$ is the treewidth of $H$. On the other hand, a running time of $n^{o(t / \log t)}$ would refute the exponential-time hypothesis. Komarath, Pandey and Rahul (Algorithmica, 2023) studied algebraic variants of these counting problems, i.e., homomorphism and subgraph $\textit{polynomials}$ for fixed graphs $H$. These polynomials are weighted sums over the objects counted above, where each object is weighted by the product of variables corresponding to edges contained in the object. As shown by Komarath et al., the $\textit{monotone}$ circuit complexity of the homomorphism polynomial for $H$ is $\Theta(n^{\mathrm{tw}(H)+1})$.
  In this paper, we characterize the power of monotone $\textit{bounded-depth}$ circuits for homomorphism and colorful subgraph polynomials. This leads us to discover a natural hierarchy of graph parameters $\mathrm{tw}_\Delta(H)$, for fixed $\Delta \in \mathbb N$, which capture the width of tree-decompositions for $H$ when the underlying tree is required to have depth at most $\Delta$. We prove that monotone circuits of product-depth $\Delta$ computing the homomorphism polynomial for $H$ require size $\Theta(n^{\mathrm{tw}_\Delta(H^{\dagger})+1})$, where $H^{\dagger}$ is the graph obtained from $H$ by removing all degree-$1$ vertices. This allows us to derive an optimal depth hierarchy theorem for monotone bounded-depth circuits through graph-theoretic arguments.</description>

      <title>The only Class 0 Flower snark is the smallest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph pebbling is a game played on graphs with pebbles on their vertices. A pebbling move removes two pebbles from one vertex and places one pebble on an adjacent vertex. The pebbling number is the smallest $t$ so that from any initial configuration of $t$ pebbles it is possible, after a sequence of pebbling moves, to place a pebble on any given target vertex. Graphs whose pebbling number is equal to the number of vertices are called Class~$0$ and provide a challenging set of graphs that resist being characterized. In this note, we answer a question recently proposed by the pioneering study on the pebbling number of snark graphs: we prove that the smallest Flower snark $J_3$ is Class~$0$, establishing that $J_3$ is in fact the only Class~$0$ Flower snark.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hilbert Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hilbert transform has been one of the foundational transforms in signal processing, finding it's way into multiple disciplines from cryptography to biomedical sciences. However, there does not exist any quantum analogue for the Hilbert transform. In this work, we introduce a formulation for the quantum Hilbert transform (QHT)and apply it to a quantum steganography protocol. By bridging classical phase-shift techniques with quantum operations, QHT opens new pathways in quantum signal processing, communications, sensing, and secure information hiding.</description>

      <title>Generalized saturation game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the following game version of the generalized graph Tur\'an problem. For two fixed graphs F and H, two players, Max and Mini, alternately claim unclaimed edges of the complete graph Kn such that the graph G of the claimed edges must remain F-free throughout the game. The game ends when no further edges can be claimed, i.e. when G becomes F-saturated. The H-score of the game is the number of copies of H in G. Max aims to maximize the H-score, while Mini wants to minimize it. The H-score of the game when both players play optimally is denoted by s1(n, #H, F) when Max starts, and by s2(n, #H, F) when Mini starts. We study these values for several natural choices of F and H.</description>

      <title>Finding $d$-Cuts in Graphs of Bounded Diameter, Graphs of Bounded Radius and $H$-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $d$-Cut problem is to decide if a graph has an edge cut such that each vertex has at most $d$ neighbours at the opposite side of the cut. If $d=1$, we obtain the intensively studied Matching Cut problem. The $d$-Cut problem has been studied as well, but a systematic study for special graph classes was lacking. We initiate such a study and consider classes of bounded diameter, bounded radius and $H$-free graphs. We prove that for all $d\geq 2$, $d$-Cut is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of diameter $2$, $(P_3+P_4)$-free graphs and $P_5$-free graphs. These results extend known results for $d=1$. However, we also prove several NP-hardness results for $d$-Cut that contrast known polynomial-time results for $d=1$. Our results lead to full dichotomies for bounded diameter and bounded radius and to almost-complete dichotomies for $H$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Partitioning 2-edge-coloured bipartite graphs into monochromatic cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an $r$-edge-colouring of the edges of a graph $G$, we say that it can be partitioned into $p$ monochromatic cycles when there exists a set of $p$ vertex-disjoint monochromatic cycles covering all the vertices of $G$. In the literature of this problem, an edge and a single vertex both count as a cycle.
  We show that for every $2$-colouring of the edges of a complete balanced bipartite graph, $K_{n,n}$, it can be partitioned into at most 4 monochromatic cycles. This type of question was first studied in 1970 for complete graphs and in 1983, by Gy\'arf\'as and Lehel, for $K_{n,n}$. In 2014, Pokrovskiy showed for all $n$ that, given any $2$-colouring of its edges, $K_{n,n}$ can be partitioned into at most three monochromatic paths. It turns out that finding monochromatic cycles instead of paths is a natural question that has also been raised for other graphs. In 2015, Schaudt and Stein showed that 14 cycles are sufficient for sufficiently large $2$-edge-coloured $K_{n,n}$.</description>
