      <title>Metal Ions based Dynamic Nuclear Polarization: MI-DNP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last two decades magic angle spinning dynamic nuclear polarization (MAS DNP) has revolutionized NMR for materials characterization, tackling its main limitation of intrinsically low sensitivity. Progress in theoretical understanding, instrumentation, and sample formulation expanded the range of materials applications and research questions that can benefit from MAS DNP. Currently the most common approach for hyperpolarization under MAS consists in impregnating the sample of interest with a solution containing nitroxide radicals, which upon microwave irradiation serve as exogenous polarizing agents. On the other hand, in metal ion based (MI)-DNP, inorganic materials are doped with paramagnetic metal centres, which then can be used as endogenous polarizing agents. In this work we give an overview of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) concepts required to characterize the metal ions and discuss the expected changes in the NMR response due to the presence of paramagnetic species. We highlight which properties of the electron spins are beneficial for applications as polarizing agents in DNP and how to recognize them, both from the EPR and NMR data. A theoretical description of the main DNP mechanisms is given, employing a quantum mechanical formalism, and these concepts are used to explain the spin dynamics observed in the DNP experiment. In addition, we highlight the main differences between MI-DNP and the more common approaches in MAS DNP, which use organic radicals as exogenous polarizing source. Finally, we review some applications of metal ions as polarizing agents in general and then focus particularly on research questions in materials science that can benefit from MI-DNP.</description>

      <title>Decoherence and vibrational energy relaxation of the electronically excited PtPOP complex in solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the ultrafast vibrational relaxation following photoexcitation of molecules in a condensed phase is essential to predict the outcome and improve the efficiency of photoinduced molecular processes. Here, the vibrational decoherence and energy relaxation of a binuclear complex, [Pt$_2$(P$_2$O$_5$H$_2$)$_4$]$^{4-}$ (PtPOP), upon electronic excitation in liquid water and acetonitrile are investigated through direct adiabatic dynamics simulations. A quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) scheme is used where the excited state of the complex is modelled with orbital-optimized density functional calculations while solvent molecules are described using potential energy functions. The decoherence time of the Pt-Pt vibration dominating the photoinduced dynamics is found to be $\sim$1.6 ps in both solvents. This is in excellent agreement with experimental measurements in water, where intersystem crossing is slow ($&gt;10$ ps). Pathways for the flow of excess energy are identified by monitoring the power of the solvent on vibrational modes. The latter are obtained as generalized normal modes from the velocity covariances, and the power is computed using QM/MM embedding forces. Excess vibrational energy is found to be predominantly released through short-range repulsive and attractive interactions between the ligand atoms and surrounding solvent molecules, whereas solute-solvent interactions involving the Pt atoms are less important. Since photoexcitation deposits most of the excess energy into Pt-Pt vibrations, energy dissipation to the solvent is inefficient. This study reveals the mechanism behind the exceptionally long vibrational coherence of the photoexcited PtPOP complex in solution and underscores the importance of short-range interactions for accurate simulations of vibrational energy relaxation of solvated molecules.</description>

      <title>To Bin or not to Bin: Alternative Representations of Mass Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass spectrometry, especially so-called tandem mass spectrometry, is commonly used to assess the chemical diversity of samples. The resulting mass fragmentation spectra are representations of molecules of which the structure may have not been determined. This poses the challenge of experimentally determining or computationally predicting molecular structures from mass spectra. An alternative option is to predict molecular properties or molecular similarity directly from spectra. Various methodologies have been proposed to embed mass spectra for further use in machine learning tasks. However, these methodologies require preprocessing of the spectra, which often includes binning or sub-sampling peaks with the main reasoning of creating uniform vector sizes and removing noise. Here, we investigate two alternatives to the binning of mass spectra before down-stream machine learning tasks, namely, set-based and graph-based representations. Comparing the two proposed representations to train a set transformer and a graph neural network on a regression task, respectively, we show that they both perform substantially better than a multilayer perceptron trained on binned data.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium distribution function in ultra-fast processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple expression for the non-equilibrium distribution function in ultra-fast transient processes is proposed. Postulating its dependence on temporal derivatives of the equilibrium integrals of motion, non-equilibrium analogues of the thermodynamic relationships are derived and the conditions that maximize the non-equilibrium entropy are identified. A rigorous threshold between ``slow" and ``fast" processes is suggested, identifying the range of applicability of classical quasi-equilibrium description. The proposed theory is validated by deriving the known law of inertial heat conduction, which accounts for finite speed of thermal propagation. Finally, a new expression for the non-equilibrium work is derived, revealing two kinds of pressure that emerge in fast non-equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Simple H\"uckel Molecular Orbital Theory for M\"obius Carbon Nanobelts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently synthesized M\"obius carbon nanobelts (CNBs) have gained attention owing to their unique $\pi$-conjugation topology, which results in distinctive electronic properties with both fundamental and practical implications. Although M\"obius conjugation with phase inversion in atomic orbital (AO) basis is well-established for monocyclic systems, the extension of this understanding to double-stranded M\"obius CNBs remains uncertain. This study thoroughly examines the simple H\"uckel molecular orbital (SHMO) theory for describing the $\pi$ electronic structures of M\"obius CNBs. We demonstrate that the adjacency matrix for any M\"obius CNB can preserve its eigenvalues and eigenvectors (with possibly flipped directions) under different placements of the sign inversion, ensuring identical SHMO results regardless of AO phase inversion location. Representative examples of M\"obius CNBs, including the experimentally synthesized one, show that the H\"uckel molecular orbitals (MOs) strikingly resemble the DFT-computed $\pi$ MOs, which were obtained using a herein proposed technique based on the localization and re-delocalization of DFT canonical MOs. Interestingly, the lower-lying $\pi$ MOs exhibit an odd number of nodal planes and are doubly quasidegenerate as a consequence of the phase inversion in M\"obius macrocycles, contrasting with macrocyclic H\"uckel systems. Coulson bond orders derived from SHMO theory correlate well with DFT-calculated Wiberg bond indices for all C-C bonds in tested M\"obius CNBs. Additionally, a remarkable correlation is observed between HOMO-LUMO gaps obtained from the SHMO and GFN2-xTB calculations for a large number of topoisomers of M\"obius CNBs. Thus, the SHMO model not only captures the essence of $\pi$ electronic structure of M\"obius CNBs, but also provides reliable quantitative predictions comparable to DFT results.</description>

      <title>Periodic Boundary Conditions for Bosonic Path Integral Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for bosonic path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) that scales quadratically with the number of particles. Path integral methods are a powerful tool to simulate bosonic condensed phases, which exhibit fundamental physical phenomena such as Bose--Einstein condensation and superfluidity. Recently, we developed a quadratic scaling algorithm for bosonic PIMD, but employed an ad hoc treatment of PBC. Here we rigorously enforce PBC in bosonic PIMD. It requires summing over the spring energies of all periodic images in the partition function, and a naive implementation scales exponentially with the system size. We present an algorithm for bosonic PIMD simulations of periodic systems that scales only quadratically. We benchmark our implementation on the free Bose gas and a model system of cold atoms in optical lattices. We also study an approximate treatment of PBC based on the minimum-image convention, and derive a numerical criterion to determine when it is valid.</description>

      <title>NepoIP/MM: Towards Accurate Biomolecular Simulation with a Machine Learning/Molecular Mechanics Model Incorporating Polarization Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields offer the ability to simulate biomolecules with quantum mechanical accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs, attracting growing attention in biophysics. Meanwhile, leveraging the efficiency of molecular mechanics in modeling solvent molecules and long-range interactions, a hybrid machine learning/molecular mechanics (ML/MM) model offers a more realistic approach to describing complex biomolecular systems in solution. However, multiscale models with electrostatic embedding require accounting for the polarization of the ML region induced by the MM environment. To address this, we adapt the state-of-the-art NequIP architecture into a polarizable machine learning force field, NepoIP, enabling the modeling of polarization effects based on the external electrostatic potential. We found that the nanosecond MD simulations based on NepoIP/MM are stable for the periodic solvated dipeptide system and the converged sampling shows excellent agreement with the reference QM/MM level. Moreover, we show that a single NepoIP model can be transferable across different MM force fields, as well as extremely different MM environment of water and proteins, laying the foundation for developing a general machine learning biomolecular force field to be used in ML/MM with electrostatic embedding.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Scaling Bosonic Path Integral Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18025v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic exchange symmetry leads to fascinating quantum phenomena, from exciton condensation in quantum materials to the superfluidity of liquid Helium-4. Unfortunately, path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations of bosons are computationally prohibitive beyond $\mathord{\sim} 100$ particles, due to a cubic scaling with the system size. We present an algorithm that reduces the complexity from cubic to quadratic, allowing the first simulations of thousands of bosons using PIMD. Our method is orders of magnitude faster, with a speedup that scales linearly with the number of particles and the number of imaginary time slices (beads). Simulations that would have otherwise taken decades can now be done in days. In practice, the new algorithm eliminates most of the added computational cost of including bosonic exchange effects, making them almost as accessible as PIMD simulations of distinguishable particles.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Waves (PAW): extended resolution of unity method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) method is based on a linear transformation between the pseudo wavefunctions and the all electron wavefunctions. To obtain high accuracy with this method, it is important that the local part of the linear transform (inside each atomic sphere) be defined over a complete basis set (with deviations from completeness leading to corrections to the total energy not computed within current implementations of PAW). Here we show how to make this basis much closer to complete without significant additional computational work and without modifying the transformation in any significant way. This is done by extending the resolution of unity used for the transform to include more smooth wavefunctions (which have nothing to do with the atomic problem) and having them linearly transform via the identity.</description>

      <title>One-step Fabrication of Sharp Platinum/Iridium Tips via Amplitude-Modulated Alternating-Current Electropolishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The platinum/iridium (Pt/Ir) alloy tip for scanning probe microscopy (SPM) was fabricated by amplitude-modulated alternating-current (AC) electropolishing. The clean tips with a radius of curvature less than 100 nm were reproducibly obtained by applying the sinusoidal voltage in the frequency ($f_0$) of $900\ \mathrm{Hz} \leq f_0 \leq 1500\ \mathrm{Hz}$ with amplitude modulation by the sinusoidal wave in the modulation frequency ($f_s$) of $f_s=0.1f_0$ in $\mathrm{CaCl}_2$/$\mathrm{H_2O}$/acetone solution. The analyses by scanning electron microscopy with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (SEM-EDX) and atom probe tomography (APT) showed that a uniform Pt/Ir alloy was exposed on the tip surface as a clean surface without O or Cl contamination. The STM imaging using the fabricated tip showed that it is more suitable for investigating rough surfaces than conventional as-cut tips and applicable for atomic-resolution imaging. Furthermore, we applied the fabricated tip to qPlus AFM analysis in liquid and showed that it has atomic resolution in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Therefore, it is concluded that the amplitude-modulated AC etching method reproducibly provides sharp STM/AFM tips capable of both atomic resolution and large-area analyses without complex etching setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11439v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating novel molecules with higher properties than the training space, namely the out-of-distribution generation, is important for ${de~novo}$ drug design. However, it is not easy for distribution learning-based models, for example diffusion models, to solve this challenge as these methods are designed to fit the distribution of training data as close as possible. In this paper, we show that Bayesian flow network is capable of effortlessly generating high quality out-of-distribution samples that meet several scenarios. We introduce a semi-autoregressive training/sampling method that helps to enhance the model performance and surpass the state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Electronic States and Mechanical Behaviors of Phosphorus Carbide Nanotubes -- Structural and Quantum Phase Transitions in a Quasi-one-dimensional Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional (1D) materials can manifest exotic electronic properties in manners that are distinct from the bulk phase or other low-dimensional systems. Helical symmetries in such materials -- e.g., nanotubes with intrinsic or applied twist -- can simultaneously lead to strong electronic correlation and anomalous transport behavior. However, these materials remain underexplored, in part due to computational challenges. Using specialized symmetry-adapted first-principles calculations, we show that mono-layer $P_2C_3$ -- identified in a previous letter to possess ``double Kagome bands'' -- exhibits a number of striking properties when rolled up into phosphorous carbide nanotubes ($P_2C_3$NTs). Both armchair and zigzag $P_2C_3$NTs are stable at room temperature and display a degenerate combination of Dirac points and electronic flat bands at the Fermi level. Notably, these flat bands are highly resilient to elastic deformations. Large strains can transform the nanotube structure from honeycomb-kagome to ``brick-wall'', and trigger multiple quantum phase transitions. Edge states in $P_2C_3$NTs, spin-degeneracy lifting induced by vacancies and dopants, and strain-tunable magnetism are also discussed.</description>
