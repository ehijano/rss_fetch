      <title>The 2025 Evaluation of Experimental Thermonuclear Reaction Rates (ETR25)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work describes the formalism for estimating thermonuclear reaction rates for astrophysical applications, emphasizing modern statistical approaches such as Monte-Carlo sampling and Bayesian models. We discuss related topics including the calculation of resonance energies from nuclear Q values, indirect estimates of particle partial widths, and matching of reaction rates at elevated temperatures to statistical-model results. We have evaluated available experimental data on cross sections, resonance energies and strengths, partial widths, life-times, spin-parities, and spectroscopic factors. Based on these results, we have estimated numerical values of 78 experimental charged-particle thermonuclear reaction rates for target nuclei in the A = 2 to 40 mass region, for temperatures ranging from 1 MK to 10 GK. For each reaction, three rate values are provided: low, median, and high, corresponding to the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles, respectively, of the cumulative reaction rate probability density distribution. Additionally, we present the factor uncertainty of each rate at each temperature grid point. These results enable users to sample the reaction rate probability density in nucleosynthesis calculations, facilitating uncertainty estimates of nuclidic abundances. The rates presented here refer to their laboratory values. For use in stellar model simulations, these values need to be corrected for the effects of thermal excitations of the interacting nuclei. For each reaction, we include graphs that illustrate the fractional contributions to the overall reaction rate along with the associated uncertainty. These visuals are designed to assist both stellar modelers and nuclear experimentalists by identifying the primary sources of rate uncertainty at specific stellar temperatures. A graphical comparison with earlier Monte-Carlo rates is also provided.</description>

      <title>Baryon Transition Form Factors from Dynamical Coupled-Channel Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this talk, the electromagnetic transition form factors from the nucleon ground state to twelve $N^*$ and $\Delta$ states are exhibited and discussed. Those results are extracted through a comprehensive coupled-channel approach -- the Juelich-Bonn-Washington model, with the center-of-mass energy ranging from $1.13$ GeV to $1.8$ GeV, and the photon virtuality up to $8$ GeV$^2$. The extraction is based on $10^5$ electroproduction data points of $\pi N$, $\eta N$, and $K\Lambda$ channels, with additionally about $5\times 10^4$ data points in the hadronic sector as well as photoproductions as boundary conditions. The form factors are defined from the residues at the corresponding resonance poles in the multipole amplitudes. Uncertainties are also estimated by the exploration of the parameter space. The qualitative behavior of the transition form factors of $N(1440)$ and $\Delta(1232)$ here are in agreement with the previous studies, while for the other states, there has not been literature results that are also defined at the resonance poles.</description>

      <title>Contrasting impurity-induced magnetism and dynamics in 2H-MoTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of interstitial $^8$Li$^+$ implanted near the surface of 2H-MoTe$_2$ using $\beta$-detected NMR. We find that, unlike the muon, $^8$Li$^+$ does not show any signature of induced magnetism. This result is consistent with density functional theory, which identifies the Li stopping site at the 2a Wyckoff position in the van der Waals gap and confirms the absence of detectable Li-induced electronic spin polarization. Both the spin-lattice relaxation and the resonance lines show evidence of strong spin dynamics above $\sim 200$ K, reminiscent of local stochastic $^8$Li$^+$ motion within a cage. The resonance line shape consists of quadrupolar satellites on top of a broad central peak. To better understand the interaction of $^8$Li$^+$ with the host material, we employ a frequency-comb measurement, by simultaneously exciting four frequencies corresponding to the first-order quadrupolar satellite transitions, $\nu_0 \pm 3\nu_{\mathrm{comb}}$ and $\nu_0 \pm\nu_{\mathrm{comb}}$ around the Larmor frequency $\nu_0$ as a function of $\nu_{\mathrm{comb}}$. This offers an enhanced sensitivity to the quadrupolar split portion of the line. Using this method, we find a small decrease of the quadrupolar frequency with increasing temperature, showing the typical behavior associated with thermally excited phonons and the absence of any magnetic response which was observed with other defects in 2H-MoTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Regularization Prescription for the Mixing Between Nonlocal Gluon and Quark Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00639v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that in the study of mixing between nonlocal gluon and quark bilinear operators there exists an ambiguity when relating coordinate space and momentum space results, which can be conveniently resolved through Mellin moments matching in both spaces. In this work, we show that this ambiguity is due to the lack of a proper regularization prescription of the singularity that arises when the separation between the gluon/quark fields approaches zero. We then demonstrate that dimensional regularization resolves this issue and yields consistent results in both coordinate and momentum space. This prescription is also compatible with lattice extractions of parton distributions from nonlocal operators.</description>
