      <title>KEN: Knowledge Augmentation and Emotion Guidance Network for Multimodal Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the rampant spread of misinformation on social media has made accurate detection of multimodal fake news a critical research focus. However, previous research has not adequately understood the semantics of images, and models struggle to discern news authenticity with limited textual information. Meanwhile, treating all emotional types of news uniformly without tailored approaches further leads to performance degradation. Therefore, we propose a novel Knowledge Augmentation and Emotion Guidance Network (KEN). On the one hand, we effectively leverage LVLM's powerful semantic understanding and extensive world knowledge. For images, the generated captions provide a comprehensive understanding of image content and scenes, while for text, the retrieved evidence helps break the information silos caused by the closed and limited text and context. On the other hand, we consider inter-class differences between different emotional types of news through balanced learning, achieving fine-grained modeling of the relationship between emotional types and authenticity. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our KEN.</description>

      <title>ESG-Net: Event-Aware Semantic Guided Network for Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense audio-visual event localization (DAVE) aims to identify event categories and locate the temporal boundaries in untrimmed videos. Most studies only employ event-related semantic constraints on the final outputs, lacking cross-modal semantic bridging in intermediate layers. This causes modality semantic gap for further fusion, making it difficult to distinguish between event-related content and irrelevant background content. Moreover, they rarely consider the correlations between events, which limits the model to infer concurrent events among complex scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate multi-stage semantic guidance and multi-event relationship modeling, which respectively enable hierarchical semantic understanding of audio-visual events and adaptive extraction of event dependencies, thereby better focusing on event-related information. Specifically, our eventaware semantic guided network (ESG-Net) includes a early semantics interaction (ESI) module and a mixture of dependency experts (MoDE) module. ESI applys multi-stage semantic guidance to explicitly constrain the model in learning semantic information through multi-modal early fusion and several classification loss functions, ensuring hierarchical understanding of event-related content. MoDE promotes the extraction of multi-event dependencies through multiple serial mixture of experts with adaptive weight allocation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art methods, while greatly reducing parameters and computational load. Our code will be released on https://github.com/uchiha99999/ESG-Net.</description>

      <title>LayLens: Improving Deepfake Understanding through Simplified Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This demonstration paper presents $\mathbf{LayLens}$, a tool aimed to make deepfake understanding easier for users of all educational backgrounds. While prior works often rely on outputs containing technical jargon, LayLens bridges the gap between model reasoning and human understanding through a three-stage pipeline: (1) explainable deepfake detection using a state-of-the-art forgery localization model, (2) natural language simplification of technical explanations using a vision-language model, and (3) visual reconstruction of a plausible original image via guided image editing. The interface presents both technical and layperson-friendly explanations in addition to a side-by-side comparison of the uploaded and reconstructed images. A user study with 15 participants shows that simplified explanations significantly improve clarity and reduce cognitive load, with most users expressing increased confidence in identifying deepfakes. LayLens offers a step toward transparent, trustworthy, and user-centric deepfake forensics.</description>

      <title>DualDub: Video-to-Soundtrack Generation via Joint Speech and Background Audio Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent video-to-audio (V2A) models can generate realistic background audio from visual input, they largely overlook speech, an essential part of many video soundtracks. This paper proposes a new task, video-to-soundtrack (V2ST) generation, which aims to jointly produce synchronized background audio and speech within a unified framework. To tackle V2ST, we introduce DualDub, a unified framework built on a multimodal language model that integrates a multimodal encoder, a cross-modal aligner, and dual decoding heads for simultaneous background audio and speech generation. Specifically, our proposed cross-modal aligner employs causal and non-causal attention mechanisms to improve synchronization and acoustic harmony. Besides, to handle data scarcity, we design a curriculum learning strategy that progressively builds the multimodal capability. Finally, we introduce DualBench, the first benchmark for V2ST evaluation with a carefully curated test set and comprehensive metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that DualDub achieves state-of-the-art performance, generating high-quality and well-synchronized soundtracks with both speech and background audio.</description>

      <title>Infinite Video Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding. However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence, tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical, albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand, and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI, research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms. Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research directions towards achieving this transformative capability.</description>

      <title>Ambiguity-Aware and High-Order Relation Learning for Multi-Grained Image-Text Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image-text matching is crucial for bridging the semantic gap between computer vision and natural language processing. However, existing methods still face challenges in handling high-order associations and semantic ambiguities among similar instances. These ambiguities arise from subtle differences between soft positive samples (semantically similar but incorrectly labeled) and soft negative samples (locally matched but globally inconsistent), creating matching uncertainties. Furthermore, current methods fail to fully utilize the neighborhood relationships among semantically similar instances within training batches, limiting the model's ability to learn high-order shared knowledge. This paper proposes the Ambiguity-Aware and High-order Relation learning framework (AAHR) to address these issues. AAHR constructs a unified representation space through dynamic clustering prototype contrastive learning, effectively mitigating the soft positive sample problem. The framework introduces global and local feature extraction mechanisms and an adaptive aggregation network, significantly enhancing full-grained semantic understanding capabilities. Additionally, AAHR employs intra-modal and inter-modal correlation matrices to investigate neighborhood relationships among sample instances thoroughly. It incorporates GNN to enhance semantic interactions between instances. Furthermore, AAHR integrates momentum contrastive learning to expand the negative sample set. These combined strategies significantly improve the model's ability to discriminate between features. Experimental results demonstrate that AAHR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on Flickr30K, MSCOCO, and ECCV Caption datasets, considerably improving the accuracy and efficiency of image-text matching. The code and model checkpoints for this research are available at https://github.com/Image-Text-Matching/AAHR .</description>

      <title>Acoustic Wave Modeling Using 2D FDTD: Applications in Unreal Engine For Dynamic Sound Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate sound propagation simulation is essential for delivering immersive experiences in virtual applications, yet industry methods for acoustic modeling often do not account for the full breadth of acoustic wave phenomena. This paper proposes a novel two-dimensional (2D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework that simulates sound propagation as a wave-based model in Unreal Engine, with an emphasis on capturing lower frequency wave phenomena, embedding occlusion, diffraction, reflection and interference in generated impulse responses. The process begins by discretizing the scene geometry into a 2D grid via a top-down projection from which obstacle masks and boundary conditions are derived. A Python-based FDTD solver injects a sine sweep at a source position, and virtual quadraphonic microphone arrays record pressure field responses at pre-defined listener positions. De-convolution of the pressure responses yields multi-channel impulse responses that retain spatial directionality which are then integrated into Unreal Engine's audio pipeline for dynamic playback. Benchmark tests confirm agreement with analytical expectations, and the paper outlines hybrid extensions aimed at commercial viability.</description>

      <title>Balancing Semantic Relevance and Engagement in Related Video Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Related video recommendations commonly use collaborative filtering (CF) driven by co-engagement signals, often resulting in recommendations lacking semantic coherence and exhibiting strong popularity bias. This paper introduces a novel multi-objective retrieval framework, enhancing standard two-tower models to explicitly balance semantic relevance and user engagement. Our approach uniquely combines: (a) multi-task learning (MTL) to jointly optimize co-engagement and semantic relevance, explicitly prioritizing topical coherence; (b) fusion of multimodal content features (textual and visual embeddings) for richer semantic understanding; and (c) off-policy correction (OPC) via inverse propensity weighting to effectively mitigate popularity bias. Evaluation on industrial-scale data and a two-week live A/B test reveals our framework's efficacy. We observed significant improvements in semantic relevance (from 51% to 63% topic match rate), a reduction in popular item distribution (-13.8% popular video recommendations), and a +0.04% improvement in our topline user engagement metric. Our method successfully achieves better semantic coherence, balanced engagement, and practical scalability for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Text-to-Remote-Sensing-Image Retrieval beyond RGB Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieving relevant imagery from vast satellite archives is crucial for applications like disaster response and long-term climate monitoring. However, most text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to exploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the all-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the spectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we introduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual annotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from authoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific sources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining), a novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR images into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves a new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models. Additionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent difficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge from the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which integrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful trade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general semantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving location-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features. This work highlights that the integration of diverse sensor data and geographic context is essential for unlocking the full potential of remote sensing archives.</description>

      <title>RAPNet: A Receptive-Field Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network for Pansharpening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to generate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the effectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently constrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all spatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this issue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive convolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive Pansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive kernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of spatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the Pansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an attention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail enhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly available datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared to existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Evaluation of AI-Powered Non-Player Characters' Perceived Realism and Performance in Virtual Reality Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly enhanced the realism and interactivity of non-player characters (NPCs) in virtual reality (VR), creating more engaging and believable user experiences. This paper evaluates AI-driven NPCs within a VR interrogation simulator, focusing on their perceived realism, usability, and system performance. The simulator features two AI-powered NPCs, a suspect, and a partner, using GPT-4 Turbo to engage participants in a scenario to determine the suspect's guilt or innocence. A user study with 18 participants assessed the system using the System Usability Scale (SUS), Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ), and a Virtual Agent Believability Questionnaire, alongside latency measurements for speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo, and overall (cycle) latency. Results showed an average cycle latency of 7 seconds, influenced by the increasing conversational context. Believability scored 6.67 out of 10, with high ratings in behavior, social relationships, and intelligence but moderate scores in emotion and personality. The system achieved a SUS score of 79.44, indicating good usability. These findings demonstrate the potential of large language models to improve NPC realism and interaction in VR while highlighting challenges in reducing system latency and enhancing emotional depth. This research contributes to the development of more sophisticated AI-driven NPCs, revealing the need for performance optimization to achieve increasingly immersive virtual experiences.</description>

      <title>Chat with AI: The Surprising Turn of Real-time Video Communication from Human to AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI Video Chat emerges as a new paradigm for Real-time Communication (RTC), where one peer is not a human, but a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, as if chatting face-to-face with a real person. However, this poses significant challenges to latency, because the MLLM inference takes up most of the response time, leaving very little time for video streaming. Due to network uncertainty and instability, transmission latency becomes a critical bottleneck preventing AI from being like a real person. To address this, we propose Artic, an AI-oriented Real-time Communication framework, exploring the network requirement shift from "humans watching video" to "AI understanding video". To reduce bitrate dramatically while maintaining MLLM accuracy, we propose Context-Aware Video Streaming that recognizes the importance of each video region for chat and allocates bitrate almost exclusively to chat-important regions. To avoid packet retransmission, we propose Loss-Resilient Adaptive Frame Rate that leverages previous frames to substitute for lost/delayed frames while avoiding bitrate waste. To evaluate the impact of video streaming quality on MLLM accuracy, we build the first benchmark, named Degraded Video Understanding Benchmark (DeViBench). Finally, we discuss some open questions and ongoing solutions for AI Video Chat.</description>

      <title>MSVD-Indonesian: A Benchmark for Multimodal Video-Text Tasks in Indonesian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal learning on video and text has seen significant progress, particularly in tasks like text-to-video retrieval, video-to-text retrieval, and video captioning. However, most existing methods and datasets focus exclusively on English. Despite Indonesian being one of the most widely spoken languages, multimodal research in Indonesian remains under-explored, largely due to the lack of benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the first public Indonesian video-text dataset by translating the English captions in the MSVD dataset into Indonesian. Using this dataset, we evaluate neural network models which were developed for the English video-text dataset on three tasks, i.e., text-to-video retrieval, video-to-text retrieval, and video captioning. Most existing models rely on feature extractors pretrained on English vision-language datasets, raising concerns about their applicability to Indonesian, given the scarcity of large-scale pretraining resources in the language. We apply a cross-lingual transfer learning approach by leveraging English-pretrained extractors and fine-tuning models on our Indonesian dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across all tasks and metrics. We release our dataset publicly to support future research and hope it will inspire further progress in Indonesian multimodal learning.</description>

      <title>High-Quality Live Video Streaming via Transcoding Time Prediction and Preset Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video streaming often requires transcoding content into different resolutions and bitrates to match the recipient's internet speed and screen capabilities. Video encoders like x264 offer various presets, each with different tradeoffs between transcoding time and rate-distortion performance. Choosing the best preset for video transcoding is difficult, especially for live streaming, as trying all the presets and choosing the best one is not feasible. One solution is to predict each preset's transcoding time and select the preset that ensures the highest quality while adhering to live streaming time constraints. Prediction of video transcoding time is also critical in minimizing streaming delays, deploying resource management algorithms, and load balancing. We propose a learning-based framework for predicting the transcoding time of videos across various presets. Our predictor's features for video transcoding time prediction are derived directly from the ingested stream, primarily from the header or metadata. As a result, only minimal additional delay is incurred for feature extraction, rendering our approach ideal for live-streaming applications. We evaluated our learning-based transcoding time prediction using a dataset of videos. The results demonstrate that our framework can accurately predict the transcoding time for different presets, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of nearly 5.0%. Leveraging these predictions, we then select the most suitable transcoding preset for live video streaming. Utilizing our transcoding time prediction-based preset selection improved Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of up to 5 dB.</description>

      <title>AGAV-Rater: Adapting Large Multimodal Model for AI-Generated Audio-Visual Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many video-to-audio (VTA) methods have been proposed for dubbing silent AI-generated videos. An efficient quality assessment method for AI-generated audio-visual content (AGAV) is crucial for ensuring audio-visual quality. Existing audio-visual quality assessment methods struggle with unique distortions in AGAVs, such as unrealistic and inconsistent elements. To address this, we introduce AGAVQA-3k, the first large-scale AGAV quality assessment dataset, comprising $3,382$ AGAVs from $16$ VTA methods. AGAVQA-3k includes two subsets: AGAVQA-MOS, which provides multi-dimensional scores for audio quality, content consistency, and overall quality, and AGAVQA-Pair, designed for optimal AGAV pair selection. We further propose AGAV-Rater, a LMM-based model that can score AGAVs, as well as audio and music generated from text, across multiple dimensions, and selects the best AGAV generated by VTA methods to present to the user. AGAV-Rater achieves state-of-the-art performance on AGAVQA-3k, Text-to-Audio, and Text-to-Music datasets. Subjective tests also confirm that AGAV-Rater enhances VTA performance and user experience. The dataset and code is available at https://github.com/charlotte9524/AGAV-Rater.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Ego- and Exo-centric Dense Procedural Activity Captioning via Gaze Consensus Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even from an early age, humans naturally adapt between exocentric (Exo) and egocentric (Ego) perspectives to understand daily procedural activities. Inspired by this cognitive ability, we propose a novel Unsupervised Ego-Exo Dense Procedural Activity Captioning (UE$^{2}$DPAC) task, which aims to transfer knowledge from the labeled source view to predict the time segments and descriptions of action sequences for the target view without annotations. Despite previous works endeavoring to address the fully-supervised single-view or cross-view dense video captioning, they lapse in the proposed task due to the significant inter-view gap caused by temporal misalignment and irrelevant object interference. Hence, we propose a Gaze Consensus-guided Ego-Exo Adaptation Network (GCEAN) that injects the gaze information into the learned representations for the fine-grained Ego-Exo alignment. Specifically, we propose a Score-based Adversarial Learning Module (SALM) that incorporates a discriminative scoring network and compares the scores of distinct views to learn unified view-invariant representations from a global level. Then, the Gaze Consensus Construction Module (GCCM) utilizes the gaze to progressively calibrate the learned representations to highlight the regions of interest and extract the corresponding temporal contexts. Moreover, we adopt hierarchical gaze-guided consistency losses to construct gaze consensus for the explicit temporal and spatial adaptation between the source and target views. To support our research, we propose a new EgoMe-UE$^{2}$DPAC benchmark, and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms many related methods by a large margin.

      <title>Hear-Your-Click: Interactive Object-Specific Video-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation shows great potential in fields such as film production. Despite significant advances, current V2A methods relying on global video information struggle with complex scenes and generating audio tailored to specific objects. To address these limitations, we introduce Hear-Your-Click, an interactive V2A framework enabling users to generate sounds for specific objects by clicking on the frame. To achieve this, we propose Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV) with a Mask-guided Visual Encoder (MVE) to obtain object-level visual features aligned with audio. Furthermore, we tailor two data augmentation strategies, Random Video Stitching (RVS) and Mask-guided Loudness Modulation (MLM), to enhance the model's sensitivity to segmented objects. To measure audio-visual correspondence, we designed a new evaluation metric, the CAV score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework offers more precise control and improves generation performance across various metrics.

      <title>MEDTalk: Multimodal Controlled 3D Facial Animation with Dynamic Emotions by Disentangled Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation aims to generate synchronized lip movements and vivid facial expressions. However, most existing approaches focus on static and predefined emotion labels, limiting their diversity and naturalness. To address these challenges, we propose MEDTalk, a novel framework for fine-grained and dynamic emotional talking head generation. Our approach first disentangles content and emotion embedding spaces from motion sequences using a carefully designed cross-reconstruction process, enabling independent control over lip movements and facial expressions. Beyond conventional audio-driven lip synchronization, we integrate audio and speech text, predicting frame-wise intensity variations and dynamically adjusting static emotion features to generate realistic emotional expressions. Furthermore, to enhance control and personalization, we incorporate multimodal inputs-including text descriptions and reference expression images-to guide the generation of user-specified facial expressions. With MetaHuman as the priority, our generated results can be conveniently integrated into the industrial production pipeline.</description>
