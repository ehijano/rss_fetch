      <title>Analysis of Collaboration in CS Prizewinning with a Nobel-Turing Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the scientific community, prizes play a pivotal role in shaping research trajectories by conferring credibility and offering financial incentives to researchers. Yet, we know little about the relationship between academic collaborations and prizewinning. By analyzing over 100 scientific prizes and the collaboration behaviors of over 5,000 prizewinners in CS, we find that prizewinners collaborate earlier and more frequently with other prizewinners than researchers who have not yet received similar recognition. Moreover, CS researchers across age groups collaborate more with prizewinners after winning their first prize, and collaborating with prizewinners after their first win increases the likelihood of the collaborator winning an award. We find that recipients of general CS prizes collaborate more than recipients of more specialized prizes, who collaborate less frequently. With Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) and regression, we find an increase in prizewinning odds with strength of prizewinner collaboration. We examine the context of recent Nobel Prizes going to CS researchers by showing how an increasing share of Physics awards go to Physics-CS collaborations, and contrast Nobel-Turing winning author's trajectories. Our findings shed light on the relationship between prizewinning and collaboration.</description>

      <title>A Community-Aware Framework for Influence Maximization with Explicit Accounting for Inter-Community Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influence Maximization (IM) seeks to identify a small set of seed nodes in a social network to maximize expected information spread under a diffusion model. While community-based approaches improve scalability by exploiting modular structure, they typically assume independence between communities, overlooking inter-community influence$\unicode{x2014}$a limitation that reduces effectiveness in real-world networks. We introduce Community-IM++, a scalable framework that explicitly models cross-community diffusion through a principled heuristic based on community-based diffusion degree (CDD) and a progressive budgeting strategy. The algorithm partitions the network, computes CDD to prioritize bridging nodes, and allocates seeds adaptively across communities using lazy evaluation to minimize redundant computations. Experiments on large real-world social networks under different edge weight models show that Community-IM++ achieves near-greedy influence spread at up to 100 times lower runtime, while outperforming Community-IM and degree heuristics across budgets and structural conditions. These results demonstrate the practicality of Community-IM++ for large-scale applications such as viral marketing, misinformation control, and public health campaigns, where efficiency and cross-community reach are critical.</description>

      <title>A density-based framework for community detection in attributed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community structure in social and collaborative networks often emerges from a complex interplay between structural mechanisms, such as degree heterogeneity and leader-driven attraction, and homophily on node attributes. Existing community detection methods typically focus on these dimensions in isolation, limiting their ability to recover interpretable communities in presence of such mechanisms. In this paper, we propose AttDeCoDe, an attribute-driven extension of a density-based community detection framework, developed to analyse networks where node characteristics play a central role in group formation. Instead of defining density purely from network topology, AttDeCoDe estimates node-wise density in the attribute space, allowing communities to form around attribute-based community representatives while preserving structural connectivity constraints. This approach naturally captures homophily-driven aggregation while remaining sensitive to leader influence. We evaluate the proposed method through a simulation study based on a novel generative model that extends the degree-corrected stochastic block model by incorporating attribute-driven leader attraction, reflecting key features of collaborative research networks. We perform an empirical application to research collaboration data from the Horizon programmes, where organisations are characterised by project-level thematic descriptors. Both results show that AttDeCoDe offers a flexible and interpretable framework for community detection in attributed networks achieving competitive performance relative to topology-based and attribute-assisted benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Airline Alliances through Multi-Attribute Graph Partitioning to Maximize Competition and Market Penetration Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The air transportation market is highly competitive and dynamic. Airlines often form alliances to expand their network reach, improve operational efficiency, and enhance customer experience. However, the impact of these alliances on market competition and operational efficiency is not fully understood. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to analyze airline alliances using multi\mfabian{-}attribute graph partitioning. We develop metrics to quantify the competitiveness of flight segments and the market penetration capability of airlines based on their alliance memberships. We formulate a bi\mfabian{-}objective optimization problem to maximize both competition and market penetration simultaneously. We also propose algorithms to solve this optimization problem and demonstrate their effectiveness using real-world flight schedule data. Our results provide insights into the structure of airline alliances and their implications for market competition and operational efficiency.</description>

      <title>When Does the Silhouette Score Work? A Comprehensive Study in Network Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting the number of communities is a fundamental challenge in network clustering. The silhouette score offers an intuitive, model-free criterion that balances within-cluster cohesion and between-cluster separation. Albeit its widespread use in clustering analysis, its performance in network-based community detection remains insufficiently characterized. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of the silhouette score across unweighted, weighted, and fully connected networks, examining how network size, separation strength, and community size imbalance influence its performance. Simulation studies show that the silhouette score accurately identifies the true number of communities when clusters are well separated and balanced, but it tends to underestimate under strong imbalance or weak separation and to overestimate in sparse networks. Extending the evaluation to a real airline reachability network, we demonstrate that the silhouette-based clustering can recover geographically interpretable and market-oriented clusters. These findings provide empirical guidance for applying the silhouette score in network clustering and clarify the conditions under which its use is most reliable.</description>

      <title>Structured Production Systems: Viability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for analysing equilibrium in structured production systems incorporating a static social division of labour by distinguishing between consumption goods traded in competitive markets and intermediate goods exchanged through bilateral relationships. We develop the concept of viability -- the requirement that all producers earn positive incomes -- as a foundational equilibrium prerequisite.
  Our main theoretical contribution establishes that acyclic production systems -- those without circular conversion processes among goods -- are always viable, a condition that implies coherence. We characterise completely viable systems through input restrictions demonstrating that prohibiting consumption goods as inputs for other consumption goods is necessary for ensuring viable prices exist for all consumption good price vectors. The analysis reveals fundamental relationships between production system architectural design and economic sustainability.
  The introduced framework bridges Leontief-Sraffa production theory with modern network economics while capturing institutional realities of contemporary production systems. This also results in a contribution of the literature on the existence of a positive output price system and the Hawkins-Simon condition.</description>

      <title>Geometric characterisation of structural and regular equivalences in undirected (hyper)graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Similarity notions between vertices in a graph, such as structural and regular equivalence, are one of the main ingredients in clustering tools in complex network science. We generalise structural and regular equivalences for undirected hypergraphs and provide a characterisation of structural and regular equivalences of undirected graphs and hypergraphs through neighbourhood graphs and Ollivier-Ricci curvature. Our characterisation sheds new light on these similarity notions opening a new avenue for their exploration. These characterisations also enable the construction of a possibly wide family of regular partitions, thereby offering a new route to a task that has so far been computationally challenging.</description>

      <title>Stock Price Responses to Firm-Level News in Supply Chain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06255v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines how positive and negative news about firms are associated with stock prices and whether these associations extend to suppliers and clients linked via supply chain relationships, using large samples of publicly listed firms worldwide and in Japan. News sentiment is measured using FinBERT, a natural language processing model fine-tuned for financial text, and supply chain links are identified from financial statements for global firms and from large-scale firm-level surveys for Japanese firms. We find that stock prices exhibit systematic associations with positive and negative news even before public disclosure. These associations are also observed for suppliers and clients before and after disclosure. In general, post-disclosure associations are larger than pre-disclosure associations, with the difference concentrated around the time of public news disclosure relative to the pre-disclosure period. However, for Japanese firms, the post-disclosure associations for suppliers and clients are smaller than the pre-disclosure associations, in contrast to the pattern observed for firms outside Japan.</description>

      <title>Beyond Firms and Industries: Shock Propagation through Establishment- and Product-Level Supply Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05595v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates how the granularity of supply-chain data affects the propagation of economic shocks through production networks. Using newly constructed establishment-level supply chains with product-level information links for Japan, we simulate disruption dynamics under alternative definitions of network nodes and input classifications. We show that defining inputs at the product level generates substantially larger propagation effects than industry-based classifications, indicating that coarse industry measures overstate input substitutability and underestimate systemic vulnerability. While establishment-level networks generally amplify shock propagation relative to firm-level networks, this effect is quantitatively modest, reflecting opposing forces of increased network complexity and greater substitution possibilities. We further demonstrate that incorporating establishment-level geographic information is critical for assessing region-specific shocks, as firm-level networks tend to overstate the impact of shocks originating in major metropolitan areas. Overall, our results highlight the importance of granular information on products, establishments, and geography for accurately evaluating supply-chain resilience and systemic risk.</description>

      <title>HiGen: Hierarchical Graph Generative Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most real-world graphs exhibit a hierarchical structure, which is often overlooked by existing graph generation methods. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph generative network that captures the hierarchical nature of graphs and successively generates the graph sub-structures in a coarse-to-fine fashion. At each level of hierarchy, this model generates communities in parallel, followed by the prediction of cross-edges between communities using separate neural networks. This modular approach enables scalable graph generation for large and complex graphs. Moreover, we model the output distribution of edges in the hierarchical graph with a multinomial distribution and derive a recursive factorization for this distribution. This enables us to generate community graphs with integer-valued edge weights in an autoregressive manner. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed generative model, achieving state-ofthe-art performance in terms of graph quality across various benchmark datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Karami-m/HiGen_main.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing graphs and their connectivity using graphlets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphlets are subgraphs rooted at a fixed vertex. The number of occurrences of graphlets aligned to a particular vertex, called graphlet degree sequence (gds), gives a topological description of the surrounding of the analyzed vertex. Graphlet degree distribution (gdd) of a graph is a matrix containing graphlet degree sequence for all vertices in the given graph. A long standing open problem called reconstruction conjecture (RC) asks whether the structure of a graph is uniquely determined by the multiset of its vertex-deleted subgraphs. Graphlet degree distribution up to size (n - 1), (&lt;= n - 1)-gdd, gives more information to reconstruct the graph and we use it to reconstruct any graph having a unique almost-asymmetric vertex-deleted subgraph, where almost-asymmetric means that at most one automorphism orbit has size larger than one. Moreover, we prove that any graph containing a vertex-cut of size 1 or any graph of order n having a vertex with degree at most 2 or at least n-2 is reconstructible from its (&lt;= n - 1)-gdd, which expands results shown in the standard RC. We also discuss the relation between gdd and graph connectivity and the conditions on (&lt;= 3)-gdd, whose breaking means that no graph with such gdd exists.</description>

      <title>Towards Operational Validation of LLM-Agent Social Simulations: A Replicated Study of a Reddit-like Technology Forum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative social simulations that can capture culturally informed, norm-guided interaction on online social platforms. We build a technology community simulation modeled on Voat, a Reddit-like alt-right news aggregator and discussion platform active from 2014 to 2020. Using the YSocial framework, we seed the simulation with a fixed catalog of technology links sampled from Voat's shared URLs (covering 30+ domains) and calibrate parameters to Voat's v/technology using samples from the MADOC dataset. Agents use a base, uncensored model (Dolphin 3.0, based on Llama 3.1 8B) and concise personas (demographics, political leaning, interests, education, toxicity propensity) to generate posts, replies, and reactions under platform rules for link and text submissions, threaded replies and daily activity cycles. We run a 30-day simulation and evaluate operational validity by comparing distributions and structures with matched Voat data: activity patterns, interaction networks, toxicity, and topic coverage. Results indicate familiar online regularities: similar activity rhythms, heavy-tailed participation, sparse low-clustering interaction networks, core-periphery structure, topical alignment with Voat, and elevated toxicity. Limitations of the current study include the stateless agent design and evaluation based on a single 30-day run, which constrains external validity and variance estimates. The simulation generates realistic discussions, often featuring toxic language, primarily centered on technology topics such as Big Tech and AI. This approach offers a valuable method for examining toxicity dynamics and testing moderation strategies within a controlled environment.</description>
