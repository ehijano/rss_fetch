      <title>Unconventional tunnel magnetoresistance scaling with altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) typically increases with barrier thickness as electron transmission in the antiparallel configuration decays faster than that of the parallel configuration. In this work, we reveal an anomalous scaling effect in altermagnetic tunnel junctions (AMTJs), where the TMR decreases anomalously with an increasing barrier thickness. The anomalous scaling originates from the overlapping spin-split branches form a transmission path that cannot be suppressed in the antiparallel state. Such phenomena is explained by adouble-barrier model and is further demonstrated using ab initio quantum transport simulations in 2D V2Te2O/Cr2Se2O/V2Te2O-based AMTJ, where the TMR anomalously decreases from 220% to 40% as the layer number of Cr2Se2O increases from 1 to 5. Our work identifies a peculiar unexpected transport characteristic of AMTJ, providing a fundamental limit on AMTJ device design and illustrating the potential optimal design of AMTJ at the ultrascaled monolayer limit.</description>

      <title>Tunable photogating in a molecular aggregate coupled graphene phototransistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a graphene photodetector coupled to a layer of aggregated organic semiconductor. A graphene phototransistor is covered with a thin film of merocyanine molecules. The aggregation of the molecular layer can be controlled by the deposition parameters and post-deposition annealing to obtain films ranging from amorphous to a highly aggregated state. The molecular layer has a uniaxial structure with excitonic transitions whose transition dipole moments are well defined. The presence of the molecular layer results in an enormous increase in the response of the phototransistor. We further demonstrate that the signal-enhancement is due to p-photodoping of the graphene. The spectroscopic photoresponse suggests that the photodoping via monomers and molecular aggregates takes place differently. Our photodetector is a platform to study the influence of molecular aggregation and order on charge transport processes between aggregated organic semiconductors and two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Promoted current-induced spin polarization in inversion symmetry broken topological insulator thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate current-induced spin polarization in disordered topological insulator thin films with broken inversion symmetry under an applied in-plane electric field. Utilizing the Kubo formalism within the self-consistent Born approximation, and incorporating vertex corrections to account for multiple scattering events, we analyze how disorder, chemical potential, the electrostatic potential difference between the top and bottom surfaces, and momentum-dependent hybridization affect the spin susceptibility. Our results reveal that the spin susceptibility exhibits nonzero values within a finite range around a zero gap, and this range broadens as the chemical potential increases. A higher hybridization strength induces asymmetry in the spin response, and a stronger potential difference, breaking inversion symmetry, significantly enhances polarization, a trend attributable to band inversion that is further refined by vertex corrections. These findings provide a theoretical framework for tuning spin-charge conversion in topological thin films, with implications for spintronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Resonance-enhanced Floquet cavity electromagnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet engineering has been recently recognized as an important tool for manipulating the coherent magnon-photon interaction in cavity electromagnonics systems at microwave frequencies. In spite of the novel hybrid magnonic functionalities that have been demonstrated, the effect of the Floquet drive has been relatively weak due to the limited driving efficiency, limiting its broader application. This work shows that by utilizing LC resonances, the Floquet drive in our cavity electromagnonic device can be drastically enhanced, giving rise to drastically boosted interaction between hybrid modes with fundamentally different spectral characteristics compared with previous demonstrations. In addition, the Floquet drives can also be obtained from GHz signals on such a system, allowing the demonstration of more advanced signal operations. Our novel resonance-enhanced Floquet cavity electromagnonics points to a new direction to fully unleash the potential of Floquet hybrid magnonics.</description>

      <title>Multi-shot readout error benchmark of the nitrogen-vacancy center's electronic qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground-state electronic spin of a negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond can be used for room-temperature experiments showing coherent qubit functionality. At room temperature, photoluminescence-based qubit readout has a low single-shot fidelity; however, the populations of the qubit's two basis states can be inferred using multi-shot readout. In this work, we calculate the dependence of the error of a multi-shot inference method on various parameters of the readout process. This multi-shot readout error scales as $\Delta/\sqrt{N}$, with $N$ being the number of shots, suggesting to use the coefficient $\Delta$ as a simple multi-shot readout error benchmark. Our calculation takes into account background photons, photon loss, and initialization error. Our model enables the identification of the readout error budget, i.e., the role various imperfections play in setting the readout error. Our results enable experimentalists and engineers to focus their efforts on those hardware improvements that yield the highest performance gain for multi-shot readout.</description>

      <title>Near-Unity Charge Readout in a Nonlinear Resonator without Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a nonlinear resonator performing the readout of a charge-sensing quantum dot. We show that by driving the resonator in the nonlinear regime, we achieve a near-unity signal. This despite not satisfying the impedance matching requirements necessary for such large signals in the linear regime. Our experiments, supported by numerical calculations, demonstrate that the signal increase stems from the sensor dissipation shifting the onset of the nonlinear resonator response. By lifting the matching requirement, we increase the bandwidth limit of resonator readout-based charge detection by an order of magnitude, opening up the avenue to ultra-fast charge detectors.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian skin effects in two-dimensional electron systems at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liouvillian skin effects, manifested as the localization of Liouvillian eigenstates around the boundary, are distinctive features of non-Hermitian systems and are particularly notable for their impact on system dynamics. Despite their significance, Liouvillian skin effects have not been sufficiently explored in electron systems. In this work, we demonstrate that a two-dimensional electron system on a substrate exhibits $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Liouvillian skin effects due to the interplay among energy dissipations, spin-orbit coupling, and a transverse magnetic field. In addition, our analysis of the temperature dependence reveals that these Liouvillian skin effects become pronounced below the energy scale of band splitting induced by the spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic field. While our Liouvillian skin effect leads to charge accumulation under quench dynamics, its relaxation time is independent of the system size, in contrast to that of previously reported Liouvillian skin effects. This difference is attributed to the scale-free behavior of the localization length, which is analogous to non-Hermitian critical skin effects.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-Driven Giant Amplification of Ultrashort Spin Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in spintronics is to efficiently generate and manipulate spin current for information processing. Here we study ultrashort spin transport and associated terahertz (THz) emission in a hybrid structure comprising gold nanoparticles, a ferromagnet (FM) and a normal metal (NM) and show that plasmon excitation in the nanoparticles strongly enhances the electron-magnon scattering rate through heating effects, thereby amplifying the spin current generation at the FM$|$NM interface. This effect is even more pronounced when the FM is an insulator with a thickness much smaller than the nanoparticle size. In this case, the gold nanoparticle and NM substrate form a nanocavity with the FM as a dielectric layer, trapping plasmons inside the gap. The resulting spin current can be amplified by two orders of magnitude as compared to the case without plasmon excitations. Our findings provide a novel route to design efficient spintronic THz devices and further open the door to the interdisciplinary field of spintronics and nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Mattis ordering theorem of electronic energy levels in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lieb-Mattis theorem orders the lowest-energy states of total spin $s$ of a system of $P$ interacting fermions. We generalize these predictions to fermionic mixtures of $P$ particles with more than $N=2$ spinor components/species in the thermodynamic limit $P\to\infty$. The lowest-energy state inside each permutation symmetry sector $h$, arising in the $P$-fold tensor product decomposition, is well approximated by a U$(N)$ coherent (quasi-classical, variational) state, specially in the limit $P\to\infty$. In particular, the ground state of the system belongs the most symmetric (dominant Young tableau $h_0$) configuration. We exemplify our construction with the $N=3$ level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, with a previous motivation on pairing correlations and U$(N)$-invariant quantum Hall ferromagnets. In the limit $P\to\infty$, each lowest-energy state within each permutation symmetry sector $h$ undergoes a quantum phase transition for a critical value $\lambda_c(h)$ of the exchange coupling constant $\lambda$, depending on $h$. This generalizes standard quantum phase transitions and their phase diagrams corresponding to the ground state belonging to the most symmetric sector $h_0$.</description>

      <title>A high-resolution molecular spin-photon interface at telecommunications wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically addressable electronic spins in polyatomic molecules are a promising platform for quantum information science with the potential to enable scalable qubit design and integration through atomistic tunability and nanoscale localization. However, optical state- and site-selection are an open challenge. Here we introduce an organo-erbium spin qubit in which narrow (MHz-scale) optical and spin transitions couple to provide high-resolution access to spin degrees of freedom with telecommunications frequency light. This spin-photon interface enables demonstration of optical spin polarization and readout that distinguishes between spin states and magnetically inequivalent sites in a molecular crystal. Operation at frequencies compatible with mature photonic and microwave devices opens a path for engineering scalable, integrated molecular spin-optical quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Engineering Altermagnetism via Layer Shifts and Spin Order in Bilayer MnPS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how stacking configuration and magnetic ordering determine the magnetic phases of bilayer MnPS$_3$, using density-functional theory and spin-Laue symmetry analysis. While monolayer MnPS$_3$ is a collinear antiferromagnet with no spin splitting, our calculations show that the bilayer can host either Type II (AFM) or Type III (altermagnetic) phases depending sensitively on stacking and spin alignment. We focus on two representative stackings: AA, where the top layer sits directly above the bottom one, and AA$^\prime$, its inversion-symmetric counterpart obtained by reflecting one layer about the out-of-plane axis. For each geometry, we consider two collinear spin alignments, $\uparrow\downarrow/\uparrow\downarrow$ and $\uparrow\downarrow/\downarrow\uparrow$, and explore lateral displacements to sample the full stacking landscape. Our results show that magnetic order and interlayer symmetry breaking jointly enable momentum-dependent spin polarization without net magnetization. These findings highlight stacking and spin alignment as coupled symmetry control parameters for engineering altermagnetism in van der Waals magnets, paving the way toward tunable spintronic functionality.</description>

      <title>Advancing Excited-State Properties of 2D Materials Using a Dielectric-Dependent Hybrid Functional</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting accurate band gaps and optical properties of lower-dimensional materials, including two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials and their heterostructures, remains a challenge within density functional theory (DFT) due to their unique screening compared to their bulk counterparts. Additionally, accurate treatment of the dielectric response is crucial for developing and applying screened-exchange dielectric-dependent range-separated hybrid functionals (SE-DD-RSH) for vdW materials. In this work, we introduce a SE-DD-RSH functional to the 2D vdW materials like MoS2, WS2, hBN, black phosphorus (BP), and \b{eta}-InSe. By accounting for in-plane and out-of-plane dielectric responses, our method achieves accuracy comparable to advanced many-body techniques like G0 W0 and BSE@G0 W0 at a lower computational cost. We demonstrate improved band gap predictions and optical absorption spectra for both bulk and layered structures, including some heterostructures like MoS2/WS2 . This approach offers a practical and precise tool for exploring electronic and optical phenomena in 2D materials, paving the way for efficient computational studies of layered systems.</description>

      <title>Polariton cascade phonon laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon lasers, as their photon counterparts, rely on the physics of stimulated emission. Arguably, because light does not require a material substrate to propagate, while sound does, the impact of the two technologies has however been highly contrasting, with "sasers" (for sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) mostly remaining as an academic curiosity. This might be changing due to the possibility to use coherent sound generation for on-chip processing of information at ultra-high frequencies, and in the quantum realm, in integrated photonic and optomechanical devices. Inspired by the concept of unipolar lasers based on the quantum engineering of states in semiconductor heterostructures, we propose and implement a quantum cascade phonon laser (QCPL). A condensate of exciton-photon quasiparticles (polaritons) is optically induced in a microstructured semiconductor device to jump down a ladder of engineered levels. This down-cascade is accompanied by the efficient stimulated emission of phonons of $\sim 20$, $\sim 60$, and $\sim 100$~GHz, which are designed to strongly interact with the polaritons on the same chip. The proposed concept opens the path for the design of integrated high-frequency optomechanical devices, as for example for non-reciprocal photon transport and multi-wavelength Brillouin lasers.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Altered Superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Is it feasible to alter the ground state properties of a material by engineering its electromagnetic environment? Inspired by theoretical predictions, experimental realizations of such cavity-controlled properties without optical excitation are beginning to emerge. Here, we devised and implemented a novel platform to realize cavity-altered materials. Single crystals of hyperbolic van der Waals (vdW) compounds provide a resonant electromagnetic environment with enhanced density of photonic states and superior quality factor. We interfaced hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with the molecular superconductor $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br ($\kappa$-ET). The frequencies of infrared (IR) hyperbolic modes of hBN match the IR-active carbon-carbon stretching molecular resonance of ($\kappa$-ET) implicated in superconductivity. Nano-optical data supported by first-principles molecular Langevin dynamics simulations confirm resonant coupling between the hBN hyperbolic cavity modes and the carbon-carbon stretching mode in ($\kappa$-ET). Meissner effect measurements via magnetic force microscopy demonstrate a strong suppression of superfluid density near the hBN/($\kappa$-ET) interface. Non-resonant control heterostructures, including RuCl$_3$/($\kappa$-ET) and hBN/$\text{Bi}_2\text{Sr}_2\text{CaCu}_2\text{O}_{8+x}$, do not display the superfluid suppression. These observations suggest that hBN/($\kappa$-ET) realizes a cavity-altered superconducting ground state. This work highlights the potential of dark cavities devoid of external photons for engineering electronic ground-state properties of materials using IR-active phonons.</description>

      <title>Superinsulating behavior in granular Pb film on gated few-layer MoS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a super-insulating behavior, in a device having granular Pb film on back-gated few-layer $\mathrm{MoS_2}$, below an onset temperature same as the critical temperature $T_{\rm C}\approx7$ K of bulk Pb. Below $T_{\rm C}$, the current-voltage characteristics exhibit a threshold voltage marking a crossover between the low-bias insulating and the high-bias normal-resistance states, consistent with the known super-insulating state behavior. A temperature dependent critical magnetic field is also found above which the insulating behavior is suppressed. The threshold voltage is found to vary with the gate-voltage but the critical field remains unchanged. With reducing temperature, the sample conductance saturates to a finite value, which depends on magnetic field and gate-voltage. This saturation behavior is found to be inconsistent with the charge-BKT and the thermal activation models but it can be fitted well to a combination of thermal activation and quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Polarization Vortices in a Ferromagnetic Metal via Twistronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in moire engineering provide new pathways for manipulating lattice distortions and electronic properties in low-dimensional materials. Here, we demonstrate that twisted stacking can induce dipolar vortices in metallic SrRuO3 membranes, despite the presence of free charges that would normally screen depolarizing fields and dipole-dipole interactions. These polarization vortices are correlated with moire-periodic flexoelectricity induced by shear strain gradients, and exhibit a pronounced dependence on the twist angle. In addition, multiferroic behavior emerges below the ferromagnetic Curie temperature of the films, whereby polarization and ferromagnetism coexist and compete, showing opposite twist-angle dependencies of their respective magnitudes. Density functional theory calculations provide insights into the microscopic origin of these observations. Our findings extend the scope of polarization topology design beyond dielectric materials and into metals.</description>

      <title>A variational quantum eigensolver tailored to multi-band tight-binding simulations of electronic structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a cost-efficient measurement scheme of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) for atomistic simulations of electronic structures based on a tight-binding (TB) theory. Leveraging the lattice geometry of a material domain, the sparse TB Hamiltonian is constructed in a bottom-up manner and is represented as a linear combination of the standard-basis (SB) operators. The cost function is evaluated with an extended version of the Bell measurement circuit that can simultaneously measure multiple SB operators and therefore reduces the number of circuits required bythe evaluation process. The proposed VQE scheme is applied to find band-gap energies of metal-halide-perovskite supercells that have finite dimensions with closed boundaries and are described with a sp3 TB model. Experimental results confirm that the proposed scheme gives solutions that follow well the accurate ones, but, more importantly, has the computing efficiency that is obviously superior to the commutativity-based Pauli grouping methods. Extending the application scope of VQE to three-dimensional confined atomic structures, this work can serve as a practical guideline for handling TB simulations in the noise-intermediate-scale quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Emergent reactance induced by the deformation of a current-driven skyrmion lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between conduction electrons and spin textures gives rise to remarkable phenomena associated with the Berry phase. The Berry phase acquired by conduction electrons acts as an emergent electromagnetic field, facilitating phenomena analogous to classical electromagnetism, such as the Lorentz force and electromagnetic induction. Magnetic skyrmions, spin vortices with non-trivial topology, serve as a key platform for such studies. For example, non-trivial transport responses are recognized as being induced by the emergent Lorentz force and the emergent electromagnetic induction. Despite remarkable progress in skyrmion physics, emergent reactance, in which the phase of an applied AC current is modified by emergent electromagnetism, has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we report emergent reactance in the prototypical skyrmion-hosting material, MnSi. We observe longitudinal and Hall reactance signals as the skyrmion lattice undergoes creep motion, in which the skyrmions deform while moving. The Hall reactance is attributed to the emergent electric field associated with the inertial translational motion arising from the skyrmion effective mass. In contrast, the longitudinal reactance results from the emergent electric fields generated by the phason and spin-tilting modes excited by their deformation. Our findings shed light on the internal deformation degrees of freedom in skyrmions as a important factor for efficient generation of the emergent electric field.</description>

      <title>Nucleation and Antiphase Twin Control in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ via Step-Terminated Al$_2$O$_3$ Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The epitaxial synthesis of high-quality 2D layered materials is an essential driver of both fundamental physics studies and technological applications. Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a prototypical 2D layered topological insulator, is sensitive to defects imparted during the growth, either thermodynamically or due to the film-substrates interaction. In this study, we demonstrate that step-terminated Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates with a high miscut angle (3$^\circ$) can effectively suppress a particular hard-to-mitigate defect, the antiphase twin. Systematic investigations across a range of growth temperatures and substrate miscut angles confirm that atomic step edges act as preferential nucleation sites, stabilizing a single twin domain. First principles calculations suggest that there is a significant energy barrier for twin boundary formation at step edges, supporting the experimental observations. Detailed structural characterization indicates that this twin-selectivity is lost through the mechanism of the 2D layers overgrowing the step edges, leading to higher twin density as the thickness increases. These findings highlight the complex energy landscape unique to 2D materials that is driven by the interplay between substrate topology, nucleation dynamics, and defect formation, and overcoming and controlling these are critical to improve material quality for quantum and electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Tuning Thermal Conductivity and Electron-Phonon Interactions in Carbon and Boron Nitride Moir\'e Diamanes via Twist Angle Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the effect of interlayer twist angle on the in-plane lattice thermal conductivity and the band gap renormalization in diamane-like hydrogenated bilayer boron nitride (BN) and graphene Moir\'e lattices. Machine learning moment tensor potentials were used for calculating energies and forces of interatomic interactions. The methods based on the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) for phonons and the Green-Kubo (GK) formula were utilized to obtain LTC values. The 20-40\% difference in LTC values obtained with GK and BTE-based methods showed the importance of high-order anharmonic contributions to LTC in the BN-based lattice with $\theta=21.8^\circ$ and all considered graphene-based structures. Significant reduction (by 4.5 - 9 times) of the in-plane LTC with the increase in the twist angle was observed in the Moir\'e lattices. This LTC reduction is caused by the decrease of phonon lifetimes. The phonon lifetimes decrease due to the growth of structural disorder in the Moir\'e lattices with the twist angle increase. We also show that the growth of disorder with increasing twist angle affects the electron-phonon interactions. This leads to higher band gap renormalization (induced by classical nuclei motion) at higher twist angles. High band gap renormalization (even at T = 0 K) values obtained considering the quantum nuclear effects are caused by the high frequencies of lattice vibrations in the Moir\'e lattices. These high frequencies are caused by the presence of light hydrogen atoms on the surfaces of the structures. Understanding of the twist-angle-induced disorder effect on phonon properties, LTC and electron-phonon coupling in the Moir\'e lattices provides a fundamental basis for manipulating the thermal and electronic properties of these structures, making them promising for applications in thermoelectrics, microelectronics and optoelectronics.</description>

Abstract: Kondo physics and heavy-fermion behavior have been predicted and observed in moir\'e materials. The electric tunability of moir\'e materials allows an in-situ study of Kondo lattices' phase diagrams, which is not possible with their intermetallic counterparts. However, moir\'e platforms rely on twisting, which introduces twisting angle disorder and undesired buckling. Here we propose device layouts for one- and two-dimensional gate-defined superlattices in Bernal bilayer graphene where localized states couple to dispersive valley-helical modes. 16We show that, under electronic interactions, these superlattices are described by an electrically-tunable Kondo-Heisenberg model.</description>

Abstract: We investigate quantum phase transitions in a topological Josephson junction with an embedded ferromagnetic layer, revealing a rich landscape of critical phenomena. The low-energy excitations comprise Majorana fermions propagating along the junction, coupled to the magnons in the ferromagnet. Based on mean-field and renormalization group arguments, we predict Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions in this system, both in the case of a magnetic easy-plane and weak easy-axis anisotropy. In the latter case, this is based on an emergent effective easy-plane, spanned by the easy-axis and the component of the magnetization which couples to the Majoranas. We conclude by presenting a conjecture for the full phase diagram of the model. It covers BKT transitions as well as exotic multicritical and supersymmetric points known from related models of interacting real fermions and bosons.</description>

      <title>Tuning the lasing threshold of quantum well exciton-polaritons under a magnetic field in Faraday geometry: a theoretical study</title>

Abstract: Polariton lasing is a promising phenomenon with potential applications in next-generation lasers that operate without the need for population inversion. Applying a perpendicular magnetic field to a quantum well (QW) significantly alters the properties of exciton-polaritons. In this theoretical study, we investigate how the lasing threshold of QW exciton-polaritons depends on the magnetic field. By modifying the exciton's effective mass and Rabi splitting, the magnetic field induces notable changes in the relaxation kinetics, which directly affect the lasing threshold. For low-energy pumping, an increase in the magnetic field delays the lasing threshold, while for high-energy pumping, the threshold is reached at much lower pump intensities. Furthermore, increasing both the pump energy and the magnetic field enhances relaxation efficiency, leading to a substantially larger number of condensed polaritons. Our result gives insights into the modulation of exciton-polariton condensation through magnetic fields, with potential implications for the design of low-threshold polariton lasers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems have a longstanding reputation for establishing rich topological phenomena beyond their static counterpart. In this work, we propose and investigate a periodically driven extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with three sites per unit cell, obtained by replacing the Pauli matrices with their $3\times 3$ counterparts. The system is found to support a number of edge modes over a range of parameter windows, some of which have no static counterparts. Among these edge modes, of particular interest are those which are pinned at a specific quasienergy value. Such quasienergy-fixed edge modes arise due to the interplay between topology and chiral symmetry, which are typically not expected in a three-band static model due to the presence of a bulk band at the only chiral-symmetric energy value, i.e., zero. In our time-periodic setting, another chiral-symmetric quasienergy value exists at half the driving frequency, which is not occupied by a bulk band and could then host chiral-symmetry-protected edge modes ($\pi$ modes). Finally, we verify the robustness of all edge modes against spatial disorder and briefly discuss the prospect of realizing our system in experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the magnetization angle dependence $M(\alpha)$ for single crystals of MnTe altermagnetic candidate. In high magnetic fields, experimental $M(\alpha)$ curves mostly reflect standard antiferromagnetic spin-flop processes, which are allowed below the N\'eel vector reorientation field. In low magnetic fields and at low temperatures, spontaneous magnetization appears as a sharp $M(T)$ magnetization jump around 81~K. In this regime, $M(\alpha)$ dependence is quite unusual: the easy magnetization axis is $\pi/2$ rotated either by increasing the field above 1~kOe or the temperature above 81~K. The observed behavior cannot be expected for antiferromagnetics, e.g. it differs strongly from the well known weak ferromagnetism. Thus, it requires to take into account the formation of the altermagnetic ground state for MnTe altermagnetic candidate. Despite MnTe is expected to have g-wave order parameter, $M(\alpha)$ magnetization symmetry confirms the prevailing population of one from three easy axes, as it has been shown previously by temperature-dependent angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: The strict geometric rules that define aperiodic tilings lead to the unique spectral and transport properties of quasicrystals, but also limit our ability to design them. In this work, we explore the first continuously tunable family of two-dimensional aperiodic tilings in which the underlying real-space geometry becomes a control knob of the wave-function's quantum geometric tensor. The real-space geometry can be used to tune into topological phases occupying an expanded phase space compared to crystals, or into a disorder-driven topological Anderson insulator. The quantum metric can also be tuned continuously, opening new routes towards tunable single- and many-body physics in aperiodic solid-state and synthetic systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of dephased entangled states and varying measurement orientations on the reliability of cryptographic keys generated via the quantum protocol E91: A quantum simulation approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main requirements to achieve reliable quantum communications are on-demand sources of highly entangled photon pairs, and semiconductor quantum dots have emerged as prominent candidates to satisfy the necessary conditions of brightness and entanglement fidelity. However, in most cases the biexciton-exciton-vacuum cascade produces a pair of maximally polarization-entangled photons with a dephasing, due to a non-negligible exciton fine structure splitting in the emitting nanostructure. This work focuses on the performance of the E91 quantum key distribution protocol under the variation of two elements: first, the phase in the input state when the protocol is implemented using entangled photons generated via the radiative cascade, and second, the relative directions of the polarization analyzers. We use a quantum computational approach by means of the IBM's API Qiskit to simulate the optical implementation of the studied cryptographic protocol and thus to validate analytical expressions derived for the secret key rate and the Bell's parameter. Our results show that the performance of the quantum transmission is highly impacted by the product between the exciton lifetime and the quantum dot's fine structure splitting and that such an impact may be modulated through the orientation of the polarizers. Under some specific conditions, the studied E91 protocol is shown to turn into the BBM92 protocol, to which the results can be extended. These findings provide important insight for the scalable implementation of quantum key distribution protocols with realistic entanglement sources. Furthermore, this study constitutes an illustrative example of how quantum computation can be used as a tool for simulating physical processes whose experimental realization can be substituted by short algorithms run on quantum software.</description>

Abstract: The experimental realizations of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states have been achieved recently, and there is a growing number of experiments in moir\'e systems showing the inequality between the filling of the Chern band and the quantized Hall conductance: $\nu\neq\sigma_\mathrm{H}$. Among many possible explanations, a popular one is that the topological states have coexisting charge density wave (CDW) orders, and such states are referred to as Hall crystals. However, apart from the experimental uncertainties, the generic mechanism of Hall crystals, especially those with fractional $\sigma_\mathrm{H}$ is still elusive at the microscopic level. In this work, we numerically study a topological flat-band model and find that, the Chern band can be folded by the interaction-driven CDW, and a mini Chern band appears above the CDW gap. Through further analysis, we find the energy dispersion and the fluctuation of quantum geometry of the miniband could be flattened by competing interactions. When further doping this miniband, a series of (F)QAH states are found to coexist with the CDW order at (fractional)integer fillings of the miniband and the Hall conductivities of the FQAH crystals (FQAHCs)- determined by the fillings of the miniband - are different from the fillings of the original Chern band. We also study the thermodynamics of an FQAHC state and find the separation of energy scales and a compressible CDW phase at intermediate temperatures. Our work paves the way for the systematic understanding of (fractional) Hall crystals.</description>
