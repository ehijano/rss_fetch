      <title>Optimizing Sequence Alignment with Scored NFAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid increase in symbolic data has underscored the significance of pattern matching and regular expression processing. While nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) are commonly used for these tasks, they are limited to detecting matches without determining the optimal one. This research expands on the NAPOLY pattern-matching accelerator by introducing NAPOLY+, which adds registers to each processing element to store variables like scores, weights, or edge costs. This enhancement allows NAPOLY+ to identify the highest score corresponding to the best match in sequence alignment tasks through the new-added arithmetic unit in each processor element. The design was evaluated against the original NAPOLY, with results showing that NAPOLY+ offers superior functionality and improved performance in identifying the best match. The design was implemented and tested on zynq102 and zynq104 FPGA devices, with performance metrics compared across array sizes from 1K to 64K processing elements. The results showed that memory usage increased proportionally with array size with Fmax decreasing as the array size grew on both platforms. The reported findings focus specifically on the core array, excluding the impact of buffers and DRAMs.</description>

      <title>Improved Data Encoding for Emerging Computing Paradigms: From Stochastic to Hyperdimensional Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data encoding is a fundamental step in emerging computing paradigms, particularly in stochastic computing (SC) and hyperdimensional computing (HDC), where it plays a crucial role in determining the overall system performance and hardware cost efficiency. This study presents an advanced encoding strategy that leverages a hardware-friendly class of low-discrepancy (LD) sequences, specifically powers-of-2 bases of Van der Corput (VDC) sequences (VDC-2^n), as sources for random number generation. Our approach significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of SC and HDC systems by addressing challenges associated with randomness. By employing LD sequences, we improve correlation properties and reduce hardware complexity. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and energy savings for SC and HDC systems. Our solution provides a robust framework for integrating SC and HDC in resource-constrained environments, paving the way for efficient and scalable AI implementations.</description>

      <title>Transmissive Beyond Diagonal RIS-Mounted LEO Communication for NOMA IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology has emerged as a transformative solution for enhancing satellite networks in next-generation wireless communication. The integration of RIS in satellite networks addresses critical challenges such as limited spectrum resources and high path loss, making it an ideal candidate for next-generation Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This paper provides a new framework based on transmissive beyond diagonal RIS (T-BD-RIS) mounted low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The NOMA power allocation at LEO and phase shift design at T-BD-RIS are optimized to maximize the system's spectral efficiency. The optimization problem is formulated as non-convex, which is first transformed using successive convex approximation and then divided into two problems. A closed-form solution is obtained for LEO satellite transmit power using KKT conditions, and a semi-definite relaxation approach is adopted for the T-BD-RIS phase shift design. Numerical results are obtained based on Monte Carlo simulations, which demonstrate the advantages of T-BD-RIS in satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Anti-counterfeiting tags with camouflaged QR codes on nanocavities, using polymer-dispersed-liquid-crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfeiting poses an evergrowing challenge, driving the need for innovative and sophisticated anti-counterfeiting strategies and technologies. Many solutions focus on tags characterized by optical features that are partially or completely camouflaged to the human eye, thus discouraging scammers. In this paper, a QR code is laser printed on a thin plastic foil previously coated by a specific nanocavity consisting of a metal/insulator/metal/insulator (MIMI) multilayer. This metamaterial possesses unique features in terms of light transmission that are due to the specific design. A thin layer of polymer dispersed liquid crystals, fabricated incorporating specific nematic liquid crystals in a polymer matrix, is able to camouflage the QR code that becomes, then, readable only under specific thermal conditions. Three anti-counterfeiting tags were fabricated, each using a distinct LC with its own nematic-isotropic transition temperature. The peculiar combination of the unique optical properties of nematic liquid crystals and optical nanocavities results in the creation of a novel type of tags showing two different encoding levels. Stress tests including water immersion, bending test, and prolonged heating have been performed ensuring the long-term stability of the tags. The realized two security-level anti-counterfeiting tags are cost-effective, straightforward to manufacture and, thanks to their flexibility, can be easily integrated into packaging and products.</description>

      <title>A hybrid marketplace of ideas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of humans and artificial intelligence systems introduces new dynamics into the cultural and intellectual landscape. Complementing emerging cultural evolution concepts such as machine culture, AI agents represent a significant technosociological development, particularly within the anthropological study of Web3 as a community focused on decentralization through blockchain. Despite their growing presence, the cultural significance of AI agents remains largely unexplored in academic literature. We argue that, within the context of Web3, these agents challenge traditional notions of participation and influence in public discourse, creating a hybrid marketplace of ideas, a conceptual space where human and AI generated ideas coexist and compete for attention. We examine the current state of AI agents in idea generation, propagation, and engagement, positioning their role as cultural agents through the lens of memetics and encouraging further inquiry into their cultural and societal impact. Additionally, we address the implications of this paradigm for privacy, intellectual property, and governance, highlighting the societal and legal challenges of integrating AI agents into the hybrid marketplace of ideas.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent in materia through homodyne gradient extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.11233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning, a multi-layered neural network approach inspired by the brain, has revolutionized machine learning. One of its key enablers has been backpropagation, an algorithm that computes the gradient of a loss function with respect to the weights and biases in the neural network model, in combination with its use in gradient descent. However, the implementation of deep learning in digital computers is intrinsically energy hungry, with energy consumption becoming prohibitively high for many applications. This has stimulated the development of specialized hardware, ranging from neuromorphic CMOS integrated circuits and integrated photonic tensor cores to unconventional, material-based computing system. The learning process in these material systems, realized, e.g., by artificial evolution, equilibrium propagation or surrogate modelling, is a complicated and time-consuming process. Here, we demonstrate a simple yet efficient and accurate gradient extraction method, based on the principle of homodyne detection, for performing gradient descent on a loss function directly in a physical system without the need of an analytical description. By perturbing the parameters that need to be optimized using sinusoidal waveforms with distinct frequencies, we effectively obtain the gradient information in a highly robust and scalable manner. We illustrate the method in dopant network processing units, but argue that it is applicable in a wide range of physical systems. Homodyne gradient extraction can in principle be fully implemented in materia, facilitating the development of autonomously learning material systems.</description>

      <title>Gumbel-Softmax Discretization Constraint, Differentiable IDS Channel, and an IDS-Correcting Code for DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) error-correcting codes have garnered increased attention with recent advancements in DNA storage technology. However, a universal method for designing IDS-correcting codes across varying channel settings remains underexplored. We present an autoencoder-based method, THEA-code, aimed at efficiently generating IDS-correcting codes for complex IDS channels. In the work, a Gumbel-Softmax discretization constraint is proposed to discretize the features of the autoencoder, and a simulated differentiable IDS channel is developed as a differentiable alternative for IDS operations. These innovations facilitate the successful convergence of the autoencoder, resulting in channel-customized IDS-correcting codes with commendable performance across complex IDS channels.</description>
