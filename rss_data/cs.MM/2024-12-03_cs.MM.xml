      <title>A Survey of Recent Advances and Challenges in Deep Audio-Visual Correlation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-visual correlation learning aims to capture and understand natural phenomena between audio and visual data. The rapid growth of Deep Learning propelled the development of proposals that process audio-visual data and can be observed in the number of proposals in the past years. Thus encouraging the development of a comprehensive survey. Besides analyzing the models used in this context, we also discuss some tasks of definition and paradigm applied in AI multimedia. In addition, we investigate objective functions frequently used and discuss how audio-visual data is exploited in the optimization process, i.e., the different methodologies for representing knowledge in the audio-visual domain. In fact, we focus on how human-understandable mechanisms, i.e., structured knowledge that reflects comprehensible knowledge, can guide the learning process. Most importantly, we provide a summarization of the recent progress of Audio-Visual Correlation Learning (AVCL) and discuss the future research directions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Local-Global Context Learning for Neural Video Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In neural video codecs, current state-of-the-art methods typically adopt multi-scale motion compensation to handle diverse motions. These methods estimate and compress either optical flow or deformable offsets to reduce inter-frame redundancy. However, flow-based methods often suffer from inaccurate motion estimation in complicated scenes. Deformable convolution-based methods are more robust but have a higher bit cost for motion coding. In this paper, we propose a hybrid context generation module, which combines the advantages of the above methods in an optimal way and achieves accurate compensation at a low bit cost. Specifically, considering the characteristics of features at different scales, we adopt flow-guided deformable compensation at largest-scale to produce accurate alignment in detailed regions. For smaller-scale features, we perform flow-based warping to save the bit cost for motion coding. Furthermore, we design a local-global context enhancement module to fully explore the local-global information of previous reconstructed signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Hybrid Local-Global Context learning (HLGC) method can significantly enhance the state-of-the-art methods on standard test datasets.</description>

      <title>OmniFlow: Any-to-Any Generation with Multi-Modal Rectified Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce OmniFlow, a novel generative model designed for any-to-any generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-audio, and audio-to-image synthesis. OmniFlow advances the rectified flow (RF) framework used in text-to-image models to handle the joint distribution of multiple modalities. It outperforms previous any-to-any models on a wide range of tasks, such as text-to-image and text-to-audio synthesis. Our work offers three key contributions: First, we extend RF to a multi-modal setting and introduce a novel guidance mechanism, enabling users to flexibly control the alignment between different modalities in the generated outputs. Second, we propose a novel architecture that extends the text-to-image MMDiT architecture of Stable Diffusion 3 and enables audio and text generation. The extended modules can be efficiently pretrained individually and merged with the vanilla text-to-image MMDiT for fine-tuning. Lastly, we conduct a comprehensive study on the design choices of rectified flow transformers for large-scale audio and text generation, providing valuable insights into optimizing performance across diverse modalities. The Code will be available at https://github.com/jacklishufan/OmniFlows.</description>

      <title>FLOAT: Generative Motion Latent Flow Matching for Audio-driven Talking Portrait</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. We shift the generative modeling from the pixel-based latent space to a learned motion latent space, enabling efficient design of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with a simple yet effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Neuron Abandoning Attention Flow: Visual Explanation of Dynamics inside CNN Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a Neuron Abandoning Attention Flow (NAFlow) method to address the open problem of visually explaining the attention evolution dynamics inside CNNs when making their classification decisions. A novel cascading neuron abandoning back-propagation algorithm is designed to trace neurons in all layers of a CNN that involve in making its prediction to address the problem of significant interference from abandoned neurons. Firstly, a Neuron Abandoning Back-Propagation (NA-BP) module is proposed to generate Back-Propagated Feature Maps (BPFM) by using the inverse function of the intermediate layers of CNN models, on which the neurons not used for decision-making are abandoned. Meanwhile, the cascading NA-BP modules calculate the tensors of importance coefficients which are linearly combined with the tensors of BPFMs to form the NAFlow. Secondly, to be able to visualize attention flow for similarity metric-based CNN models, a new channel contribution weights module is proposed to calculate the importance coefficients via Jacobian Matrix. The effectiveness of the proposed NAFlow is validated on nine widely-used CNN models for various tasks of general image classification, contrastive learning classification, few-shot image classification, and image retrieval.</description>

      <title>Long Video Diffusion Generation with Segmented Cross-Attention and Content-Rich Video Data Curation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Presto, a novel video diffusion model designed to generate 15-second videos with long-range coherence and rich content. Extending video generation methods to maintain scenario diversity over long durations presents significant challenges. To address this, we propose a Segmented Cross-Attention (SCA) strategy, which splits hidden states into segments along the temporal dimension, allowing each segment to cross-attend to a corresponding sub-caption. SCA requires no additional parameters, enabling seamless incorporation into current DiT-based architectures. To facilitate high-quality long video generation, we build the LongTake-HD dataset, consisting of 261k content-rich videos with scenario coherence, annotated with an overall video caption and five progressive sub-captions. Experiments show that our Presto achieves 78.5% on the VBench Semantic Score and 100% on the Dynamic Degree, outperforming existing state-of-the-art video generation methods. This demonstrates that our proposed Presto significantly enhances content richness, maintains long-range coherence, and captures intricate textual details. More details are displayed on our project page: https://presto-video.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Divide-and-Conquer: Confluent Triple-Flow Network for RGB-T Salient Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RGB-Thermal Salient Object Detection aims to pinpoint prominent objects within aligned pairs of visible and thermal infrared images. Traditional encoder-decoder architectures, while designed for cross-modality feature interactions, may not have adequately considered the robustness against noise originating from defective modalities. Inspired by hierarchical human visual systems, we propose the ConTriNet, a robust Confluent Triple-Flow Network employing a Divide-and-Conquer strategy. Specifically, ConTriNet comprises three flows: two modality-specific flows explore cues from RGB and Thermal modalities, and a third modality-complementary flow integrates cues from both modalities. ConTriNet presents several notable advantages. It incorporates a Modality-induced Feature Modulator in the modality-shared union encoder to minimize inter-modality discrepancies and mitigate the impact of defective samples. Additionally, a foundational Residual Atrous Spatial Pyramid Module in the separated flows enlarges the receptive field, allowing for the capture of multi-scale contextual information. Furthermore, a Modality-aware Dynamic Aggregation Module in the modality-complementary flow dynamically aggregates saliency-related cues from both modality-specific flows. Leveraging the proposed parallel triple-flow framework, we further refine saliency maps derived from different flows through a flow-cooperative fusion strategy, yielding a high-quality, full-resolution saliency map for the final prediction. To evaluate the robustness and stability of our approach, we collect a comprehensive RGB-T SOD benchmark, VT-IMAG, covering various real-world challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and our VT-IMAG dataset demonstrate that ConTriNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in both common and challenging scenarios.</description>

      <title>X-Prompt: Towards Universal In-Context Image Generation in Auto-Regressive Vision Language Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context generation is a key component of large language models' (LLMs) open-task generalization capability. By leveraging a few examples as context, LLMs can perform both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Recent advancements in auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) built upon LLMs have showcased impressive performance in text-to-image generation. However, the potential of in-context learning for general image generation tasks remains largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce X-Prompt, a purely auto-regressive large-vision language model designed to deliver competitive performance across a wide range of both seen and unseen image generation tasks, all within a unified in-context learning framework. X-Prompt incorporates a specialized design that efficiently compresses valuable features from in-context examples, supporting longer in-context token sequences and improving its ability to generalize to unseen tasks. A unified training task for both text and image prediction enables X-Prompt to handle general image generation with enhanced task awareness from in-context examples. Extensive experiments validate the model's performance across diverse seen image generation tasks and its capacity to generalize to previously unseen tasks.</description>

      <title>Separate Anything You Describe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language-queried audio source separation (LASS) is a new paradigm for computational auditory scene analysis (CASA). LASS aims to separate a target sound from an audio mixture given a natural language query, which provides a natural and scalable interface for digital audio applications. Recent works on LASS, despite attaining promising separation performance on specific sources (e.g., musical instruments, limited classes of audio events), are unable to separate audio concepts in the open domain. In this work, we introduce AudioSep, a foundation model for open-domain audio source separation with natural language queries. We train AudioSep on large-scale multimodal datasets and extensively evaluate its capabilities on numerous tasks including audio event separation, musical instrument separation, and speech enhancement. AudioSep demonstrates strong separation performance and impressive zero-shot generalization ability using audio captions or text labels as queries, substantially outperforming previous audio-queried and language-queried sound separation models. For reproducibility of this work, we will release the source code, evaluation benchmark and pre-trained model at: https://github.com/Audio-AGI/AudioSep.</description>

      <title>SongBsAb: A Dual Prevention Approach against Singing Voice Conversion based Illegal Song Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singing voice conversion (SVC) automates song covers by converting a source singing voice from a source singer into a new singing voice with the same lyrics and melody as the source, but sounds like being covered by the target singer of some given target singing voices. However, it raises serious concerns about copyright and civil right infringements. We propose SongBsAb, the first proactive approach to tackle SVC-based illegal song covers. SongBsAb adds perturbations to singing voices before releasing them, so that when they are used, the process of SVC will be interfered, leading to unexpected singing voices. Perturbations are carefully crafted to (1) provide a dual prevention, i.e., preventing the singing voice from being used as the source and target singing voice in SVC, by proposing a gender-transformation loss and a high/low hierarchy multi-target loss, respectively; and (2) be harmless, i.e., no side-effect on the enjoyment of protected songs, by refining a psychoacoustic model-based loss with the backing track as an additional masker, a unique accompanying element for singing voices compared to ordinary speech voices. We also adopt a frame-level interaction reduction-based loss and encoder ensemble to enhance the transferability of SongBsAb to unknown SVC models. We demonstrate the prevention effectiveness, harmlessness, and robustness of SongBsAb on five diverse and promising SVC models, using both English and Chinese datasets, and both objective and human study-based subjective metrics. Our work fosters an emerging research direction for mitigating illegal automated song covers.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Movie Genres through Cross-Attention Fusion of Bi-Modal Synergy of Poster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Movie posters are not just decorative; they are meticulously designed to capture the essence of a movie, such as its genre, storyline, and tone/vibe. For decades, movie posters have graced cinema walls, billboards, and now our digital screens as a form of digital posters. Movie genre classification plays a pivotal role in film marketing, audience engagement, and recommendation systems. Previous explorations into movie genre classification have been mostly examined in plot summaries, subtitles, trailers and movie scenes. Movie posters provide a pre-release tantalizing glimpse into a film's key aspects, which can ignite public interest. In this paper, we presented the framework that exploits movie posters from a visual and textual perspective to address the multilabel movie genre classification problem. Firstly, we extracted text from movie posters using an OCR and retrieved the relevant embedding. Next, we introduce a cross-attention-based fusion module to allocate attention weights to visual and textual embedding. In validating our framework, we utilized 13882 posters sourced from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). The outcomes of the experiments indicate that our model exhibited promising performance and outperformed even some prominent contemporary architectures.</description>
