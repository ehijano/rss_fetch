      <title>A control variate method for threshold crossing probabilities of plastic deformation driven by transient coloured noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid method combining partial differential equation (PDE) and Monte Carlo (MC) techniques to obtain efficient estimates of statistics for plastic deformation related to kinematic hardening models driven by transient coloured noise. Our approach employs a control variate strategy inspired by [CPAM, 75 (3), 455-492, 2022] and relies on a class of PDEs with non-standard boundary conditions, which we derive here. The solutions of those PDEs represent the statistics of models driven by transient white noise and are significantly easier to solve than the coloured noise version. We apply our method to threshold-crossing probabilities, which are used as failure criteria known as ultimate and serviceability limit states under non-stationary excitation. Our contribution provides solid grounds for such calculations and is significantly more computationally efficient in terms of variance reduction compared to standard MC simulations.</description>

      <title>Yang-Lee Zeros of 2D Nearest-Neighbor Antiferromagnetic Ising Models: A Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Yang-Lee zeros in the thermodynamic limit of the 2D nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic Ising model on square and triangular lattices. We employ the Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion (NLCE) equipped with Exact Enumeration (EE) of the partition function to estimate the Laplacian of the free energy, which is proportional to the zeros density. Using a modified NLCE, where the expansion can be carried directly on the Yang-Lee zeros of the involved clusters, we estimate the density of Yang-Lee zeros in the thermodynamic limit. NLCE gives significantly more zeros than EE in the complex field plane providing more insights on how the root curves look in the thermodynamic limit. For the square lattice at $T \ll T_c$, the results suggest that two vertical lines at $\pm h_c(T)$ in the complex field plane (i.e two concentric circles in the complex fugacity plane) are the thermodynamic root curves. A similar picture is expected for the triangular lattice for phase transitions at large values of magnetic field while further study is needed for phase transitions at smaller values of magnetic field. The convergence of the NLCE and (EE) calculations of the partition function to the thermodynamic limit is studied in both lattices and the temperature-field phase diagram is obtained from Yang-Lee zeros using both methods. This NLCE-based approach will facilitate the study of different types of phase transitions using Yang-Lee zeros in future research.</description>

      <title>Universal Exotic Dynamics in Critical Mesoscopic Systems: Simulating the Square Root of Avogadro's Number of Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly demonstrate the universality of critical dynamics through unprecedented large-scale GPU-based simulations of two out-of-equilibrium processes, comparing the behavior of spin-$1/2$ Ising and spin-$1$ Blume-Capel models on a square lattice. In the first protocol, a completely disordered system is instantaneously brought into contact with a thermal bath at the critical temperature, allowing it to evolve until the coherence length exceeds $10^{3}$ lattice spacings. Finite-size effects are negligible due to the mesoscopic scale of the lattice sizes studied, with linear dimensions up to $L=2^{22}$ and $2^{19}$ for the Ising and Blume-Capel models, respectively. Our numerical data, and the subsequent analysis, demonstrate a strong dynamic universality between the two models and provide the most precise estimate to date of the dynamic critical exponent for this universality class, $z = 2.1676(1)$. In the second protocol, we corroborate the role of the universal ratio of dynamic and static length scales in achieving an exponential acceleration in the approach to equilibrium just \emph{above} the critical temperature, through a time-dependent variation of the thermal bath temperature. The results presented in this work leverage our CUDA-based numerical code, breaking the world record for the simulation speed of the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Resetting Dyson Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new stochastic process of $N$ interacting particles on the line that evolve via Dyson Brownian motion (DBM) with Dyson's index $\beta &gt; 0$ and undergo simultaneous resetting to their initial positions at a constant rate $r$. We call this process the resetting Dyson Brownian motion (RDBM) -- in short the $\beta$-RDBM. For $\beta = 1,2,4$, the positions of the particles in the RDBM can be interpreted as the eigenvalues of a random matrix ensemble where the entries of an $N x N$ Gaussian matrix evolve as simultaneously resetting Brownian motions (with rate $r$) in the presence or absence of a harmonic trap. For $r=0$ and in the presence of a harmonic trap, this system reaches an equilibrium Gibbs-Boltzmann state of the so called Dyson log-gas. However, the stochastic resetting drives the system at long time to a nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS). We compute exactly the joint distribution of the positions of the particles in this NESS for all $\beta&gt;0$ and calculate several observables for large $N$: the average density profile of the gas, the extreme value statistics, the spacing between two consecutive particles and the full counting statistics. We show that a nonzero resetting rate $r&gt;0$ drastically changes the nature of the fluctuations in the stationary state: while the log-gas is rather rigid, the $\beta$-RDBM in its NESS becomes fluffy, i.e., the fluctuations of different observables are of the same order as their mean. In the absence of a harmonic trap, our results for the $\beta = 2$-RDBM can be related to nonintersecting Brownian motions in the presence of resetting. Our model demonstrates interesting effects arising from the interplay between the eigenvalue repulsion and the all-to-all attraction (generated by stochastic resetting) in an interacting particle system. Numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with our analytical results.</description>

      <title>From anomalous diffusion in polygons to a transport locking relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study particle transport in a class of open channels of finite length, made of identical cells of connected open polygonal billiards with parallel boundaries. In these systems the Mean Square Displacement (MSD) grows in time faster than linearly. We show that irrespective of the geometry of these channels, the distribution of the first return times decays algebraically with two different exponents, separated by a crossover region that is determined by the MSD. We find that the distribution of first return times satisfies a simple scaling form. In turn, the transmission coefficient, defined as the fraction of trajectories that starting at the cell at the origin escape the channel through the other boundary, decays algebraically with the size of the system, and, as a signature of non-recurrent transport, sometimes slower. From these two processes we derive a locking relation among the scaling exponents for the asymptotic behavior of the MSD, the times of first return to the origin and the way transmission decays with the system size, showing that these three processes are interdependent. The locking relation holds for diffusive processes, as well as for fractional Brownian motion with arbitrary Hurst exponent. We argue that the locking relation may be valid for many other transport processes, Markovian or not, with finite MSD.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds on the Universal Lindblad Equation in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors due to several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation keep small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of the accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Tunable Anomalous Diffusion in Subrecoil-Laser-Cooled Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of atomic motion through laser cooling has revolutionized quantum technologies, enabling applications ranging from quantum computing to precision metrology. However, the spatial spreading of subrecoil-laser-cooled atoms -- crucial for understanding cooling mechanisms and atomic confinement -- remains largely unexplored. Here, we analyze anomalous diffusion in subrecoil-laser-cooled atoms, where a velocity-dependent fluorescence rate $R(v) \propto |v|^{\alpha}$ governs transport properties. By tuning $\alpha$, we uncover transitions between normal, subdiffusive, and superdiffusive regimes. Notably, at $\alpha = 3/2$, diffusion is minimized, leading to optimal atomic confinement. These findings advance the understanding of anomalous transport in laser-cooled systems and offer new avenues for precise control of atomic motion.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Tilted Thermodynamic Maps (expTM): Predicting Phase Transitions Across Temperature, Pressure, and Chemical Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting and characterizing phase transitions is crucial for understanding generic physical phenomena such as crystallization, protein folding and others. However, directly observing phase transitions is not always easy, and often one has limited observations far from the phase boundary and measured under some specific thermodynamic conditions. In this study, we propose a statistical physics and Generative AI driven framework that can take such limited information to generate samples of different phases under arbitrary thermodynamic conditions, which we name Exponentially Tilted Thermodynamic Maps (expTM). The central idea is to map collected data into a tractable simple prior expressed as an exponentially tilted Gaussian. We demonstrate how the variance and mean of the prior can be correlated with pairs of thermodynamic control variables, including temperature, pressure, and chemical potential. This gives us the ability to generate thermodynamically correct samples under any values of the control variables. To demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach, we use expTM to sample the lattice gas models with the Grand Canonical ensemble, capturing phase transitions under varying chemical potentials and temperatures. We further demonstrate how expTM can model the isothermal-isobaric ensemble, with which we predict different phases of CO2 under varying pressure conditions. Both examples are trained on very limited data far from the phase boundary. These results establish expTM as a robust tool for understanding phase transitions across diverse thermodynamic conditions requiring only a small number of observations.</description>

      <title>Controlled Diagonal Catalyst Improves the Efficiency of Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. It searches for the ground state of the Ising model, which corresponds to the optimal solution of a given combinatorial optimization problem. The guiding principle of quantum annealing is the adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics, which guarantees that a system remains in the ground state of its Hamiltonian if the time evolution is sufficiently slow. According to the adiabatic theorem, the runtime required for quantum annealing to satisfy the adiabaticity scales is inverse to the square of the minimum energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state during time evolution. As a result, finding the ground state becomes significantly more difficult when the energy gap is small, creating a major bottleneck in quantum annealing. Expanding the energy gap is one strategy to improve the performance of quantum annealing; however, its implementation in actual hardware remains challenging. This study proposes a method for efficiently solving instances with small energy gaps by introducing additional local terms to the Hamiltonian and exploiting the diabatic transition remaining in the small energy gap. The proposed method achieves an approximate square speed up in time-to-solution compared to the conventional quantum annealing. In addition, we investigate the transferability of the parameters obtained with the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Fractional Brownian motion with mean-density interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion is a Gaussian stochastic process with long-range correlations in time; it has been shown to be a useful model of anomalous diffusion. Here, we investigate the effects of mutual interactions in an ensemble of particles undergoing fractional Brownian motion. Specifically, we introduce a mean-density interaction in which each particle in the ensemble is coupled to the gradient of the total, time-integrated density produced by the entire ensemble. We report the results of extensive computer simulations for the mean-square displacements and the probability densities of particles undergoing one-dimensional fractional Brownian motion with such a mean-density interaction. We find two qualitatively different regimes, depending on the anomalous diffusion exponent $\alpha$ characterizing the fractional Gaussian noise. The motion is governed by the interactions for $\alpha &lt; 4/3$ whereas it is dominated by the fractional Gaussian noise for $\alpha &gt; 4/3$. We develop a scaling theory explaining our findings. We also discuss generalizations to higher space dimensions and nonlinear interactions as well as applications to the growth of strongly stochastic axons (e.g., serotonergic fibers) in vertebrate brains.</description>

      <title>Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion in an annealed heterogeneous environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion is a ubiquitous phenomenon observed in various biological and soft matter systems. This anomalous dynamics is typically attributed to heterogeneous environments inducing spatiotemporal variations in the diffusivity of tracer particles. While previous studies have predominantly focused on systems exhibiting either spatial or temporal heterogeneity, this work bridges the gap by introducing a model based on an annealed extreme landscape to simultaneously account for both types of heterogeneities. Through a combination of computational analyses and analytical derivations, we investigate how the interplay of spatial and temporal heterogeneities in the energy landscape gives rise to Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the presence of temporal environmental fluctuations, the heterogeneous diffusion inevitably converges to classical Brownian motion via a homogenization process. We derive an analytical expression for the homogenization time as a function of key parameters governing the system's spatiotemporal heterogeneities. Additionally, we quantify particle-to-particle diffusion heterogeneity and examine the ergodic properties of this model, providing deeper insights into the dynamics of complex, heterogeneous systems.</description>

      <title>Particle Pairing Caused Subdiffusion of Heavy Particles in the Imbalanced Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imbalanced Hubbard model features a transition between dynamic regimes depending on the mass ratio and coupling strength between two different particle species. A slowdown of the lighter particle transport can be attributed to an emergent effective disorder induced by the heavy particles for high mass ratio and strong coupling. This subdiffusive regime has been interpreted as a Griffiths phase, linking the effect to the coexistence of metallic and insulating regions. Here, we investigate the dynamics of the heavy particles, which also reveals subdiffusive behavior, yet cannot be explained within the Griffiths picture. We demonstrate that heavy particles predominantly form small clusters, mainly pairs, during the dynamical process, which reduces their propagation speed and transiently shifts the time-dependent diffusion constant into the subdiffusive regime at late times. The necessary attraction between particles driving this process can be understood within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We introduce a classical one-dimensional random walk model that can quantitatively reproduce the subdiffusion dynamics in the strong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of Shape Symmetry Breaking in Surfactant Mediated Crystal Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamical model of crystal growth, in which it is possible to reliably achieve asymmetric products, beginning from symmetric initial conditions and growing within an isotropic environment. The asymmetric growth is the result of a positive feedback mechanism that amplifies the effect of thermal fluctuations in the coverage of surfactants on the growing crystalline facets. Within our simple model, we are able to understand the kinetic and thermodynamic factors involved in both the onset of symmetry breaking and the persistence of anisotropic growth. We demonstrate that the mechanism is general by studying models with increasing complexity. We argue that this mechanism of symmetry breaking underpins observations of colloidal, seed-mediated syntheses of single crystalline metal nanorods capped with strongly interacting surfactants. The parameters within our model are related to experimental observables such as the concentration, hydrophobicity, and binding strength of the surfactants, which suggests a potential route to optimize the yield of asymmetric products in colloidal nanoparticle syntheses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript we introduce a novel Decision Flow (DF) framework for sampling from a target distribution while incorporating additional guidance from a prior sampler. DF can be viewed as an AI driven algorithmic reincarnation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach in Stochastic Optimal Control. It extends the continuous space, continuous time path Integral Diffusion sampling technique to discrete time and space, while also generalizing the Generative Flow Network framework. In its most basic form, an explicit, Neural Network (NN) free formulation, DF leverages the linear solvability of the the underlying MDP to adjust the transition probabilities of the prior sampler. The resulting Markov Process is expressed as a convolution of the reverse time Green's function of the prior sampling with the target distribution. We illustrate the DF framework through an example of sampling from the Ising model, discuss potential NN based extensions, and outline how DF can enhance guided sampling across various applications.</description>

      <title>Spin squeezing in an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin squeezed states provide a seminal example of how the structure of quantum mechanical correlations can be controlled to produce metrologically useful entanglement. Such squeezed states have been demonstrated in a wide variety of artificial quantum systems ranging from atoms in optical cavities to trapped ion crystals. By contrast, despite their numerous advantages as practical sensors, spin ensembles in solid-state materials have yet to be controlled with sufficient precision to generate targeted entanglement such as spin squeezing. In this work, we present the first experimental demonstration of spin squeezing in a solid-state spin system. Our experiments are performed on a strongly-interacting ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond at room temperature, and squeezing (-0.5 $\pm$ 0.1 dB) is generated by the native magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between NVs. In order to generate and detect squeezing in a solid-state spin system, we overcome a number of key challenges of broad experimental and theoretical interest. First, we develop a novel approach, using interaction-enabled noise spectroscopy, to characterize the quantum projection noise in our system without directly resolving the spin probability distribution. Second, noting that the random positioning of spin defects severely limits the generation of spin squeezing, we implement a pair of strategies aimed at isolating the dynamics of a relatively ordered sub-ensemble of NV centers. Our results open the door to entanglement-enhanced metrology using macroscopic ensembles of optically active spins in solids.</description>

      <title>Superconducting nonlinear Hall effect induced by geometric phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear Hall effect in superconductors without magnetic fields induced by a quantum geometric phase (i.e., the Aharonov-Bohm phase) carried by single or pair particles. We find that the second-order nonlinear Hall conductivity diverges in the dc limit in a robust way against dissipation when the system is superconducting, suggesting that the supercurrent flows perpendicular to the direction of the applied electric field. This superconducting nonlinear Hall effect (SNHE) is demonstrated for the Haldane model with attractive interaction and its variant with pair hoppings. In the Ginzburg-Landau theory, the SNHE can be understood as those arising from a higher-order Lifshitz invariant, that is, a symmetry invariant constructed from order parameters that contains an odd number of spatial derivatives. We perform real-time simulations including the effect of collective modes for the models driven by a multi-cycle pulse, and show that the SNHE leads to large rectification of the Hall current under light driving.</description>

      <title>Dynamics in the presence of local symmetry-breaking impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous symmetries lead to universal slow relaxation of correlation functions in quantum many-body systems. In this work, we study how local symmetry-breaking impurities affect the dynamics of these correlation functions using Brownian quantum circuits, which we expect to apply to generic non-integrable systems with the same symmetries. While explicitly breaking the symmetry is generally expected to lead to eventual restoration of full ergodicity, we find that approximately conserved quantities that survive under such circumstances can still induce slow relaxation. This can be understood using a super-Hamiltonian formulation, where low-lying excitations determine the late-time dynamics and exact ground states correspond to conserved quantities. We show that in one dimension, symmetry-breaking impurities modify diffusive and subdiffusive behaviors associated with U$(1)$ and dipole conservation at late-times, e.g., by increasing power-law decay exponents of the decay of autocorrelation functions. This stems from the fact that for these symmetries, impurities are relevant in the renormalization group sense, e.g., bulk impurities effectively disconnect the system, completely modifying both temporal and spatial correlations. On the other hand, for an impurity that disrupts strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the super-Hamiltonian only acquires an exponentially small gap, leading to prethermal plateaus in autocorrelation functions which extend for times that scale exponentially with the distance to the impurity. Overall, our approach systematically characterizes how symmetry breaking impurities affect relaxation dynamics in symmetric systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce parallel-sequential (PS) circuits, a family of quantum circuit layouts that interpolate between brickwall and sequential circuits, which introduces control parameters governing the ratio of over the amount of entanglement and the maximum correlation distance they can express. We provide numerical evidence that PS circuits can efficiently prepare many-body ground states in one dimension. On noisy devices, characterized through both idling errors and two-qubit gate errors, we show that in a wide parameter regime, PS circuits outperform brickwall, sequential, and log-depth circuits from [Malz, Styliaris, Wei, Cirac, PRL 132, 040404 (2024)]. Additionally, we demonstrate that properly chosen noisy random PS circuits suppress error proliferation and, when employed as a variational ansatz, exhibit superior trainability.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium field theory with a temperature gradient: Thermal current in a nanowire</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A perturbative framework is developed within the standard non-equilibrium field theory techniques to incorporate a temperature gradient across a thermoelectric device. The framework uses a temperature-dependent pseudo-Hamiltonian generated from the exact density matrix in the presence of non-uniform temperatures. We develop a perturbation theory for small temperature gradients in long wires and obtain the non-linear thermal conductance as a function of temperature difference. The framework should be adaptable to more general cases of temperature inhomogeneities in either fermionic or bosonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nanowire with its two ends fixed at two different temperatures by external baths is the simplest example of a fermionic system with a temperature inhomogeneity, and could be an easy platform to study thermodynamic and transport properties of a boundary-driven open quantum system. Starting with a temperature-dependent pseudo free energy derived from an exact reduced density matrix and assuming a small temperature gradient $\gamma$ across the wire, we show within perturbation theory that electron dispersion relation and therefore the Fermi distribution becomes $\gamma$ and space coordinates dependent, leading to non-linear effects of the temperature inhomogeneity. In particular, we show that in the non-linear response regime, the Widemann-Franz Law for the ratio of thermal and electrical conductivities is generalized, and that the thermopower increases with increasing temperature gradient $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Elasticity of a Freely Jointed Chain with Quenched Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple theoretical model, the Freely Jointed Chain with quenched hinges (qFJC), which captures the quenched disorder in the local bending stiffness of the polymer. In this article, we analyze the tensile elasticity of the qFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. For finite-size systems, we obtain a recurrence relation of the exact free energy, which allows us to calculate the exact force-extension relation numerically for an arbitrary size of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, when $L({\rm contour \;length})\gg L_p({\rm persistence \;length})$, we obtain a framework to deal with quenched disorder in the polymer configuration. This allows us to obtain the response function for the discrete and continuous qFJC in the thermodynamic limit. It turns out that the extension of the continuous qFJC can be cast in a simple form. Furthermore, we have applied our analysis to rod-coil multiblock copolymers.</description>

      <title>Separation of variables for higher rank integrable models: review of recent progress</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Separation of variables (SoV) is a powerful method expected to be applicable for a wide range of quantum integrable systems, from models in condensed matter physics to gauge and string theories. Yet its full implementation for many higher rank examples, such as SU(N) spin chains with N&gt;2, has remained elusive for a long time. In this pedagogical review we discuss the major progress achieved recently in understanding SoV for models of this type. In particular, for rational SU(N) spin chains we describe different constructions of the SoV basis, novel compact forms for spin chain eigenstates, the functional SoV approach, and explicit computation of the SoV measure. We also discuss key first applications of these results, namely the new compact determinant representations for many observables such as scalar products and correlators.</description>

Abstract: Finding good quantum codes for a particular hardware application and determining their error thresholds is central to quantum error correction. The threshold defines the noise level where a quantum code switches between a coding and a no-coding \emph{phase}. Provided sufficiently frequent error correction, the quantum capacity theorem guarantees the existence of an optimal code that provides a maximum communication rate. By viewing a system experiencing repeated error correction as a novel form of matter, this optimal code, in analogy to Jaynes's maximum entropy principle of quantum statistical mechanics, \emph{defines a phase}. We explore coding phases from this perspective using the Open Random Unitary Model (ORUM), which is a quantum circuit with depolarizing and dephasing channels. Using numerical optimization, we find this model hosts three phases: a maximally mixed phase, a ``$Z_2$ code'' that breaks its U(1) gauge symmetry down to $Z_2$, and a no-coding phase with first-order transitions between them and a novel \emph{zero capacity multi-critical point} where all three phases meet. For the $Z_2$ code, we provide two practical error correction procedures that fall short of the optimal codes and qualitatively alter the phase diagram, splitting the multi-critical point into two second-order coding no-coding phase transitions. Carrying out our approach on current noisy devices could provide a systematic way to construct quantum codes for robust computation and communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1906.00340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum groups and quantum algebras have received considerable attention in the last decades because they are very useful as mathematical tools of research. Existing proposals for quantum groups have always suggested the idea of deforming a classical object. Motivated by the possibility of anyons in three dimensions ($d=3$), with important consequences to a wide range of fields of physics, in the present work we investigate how the magnetization and other thermodynamic quantities, associated to the Landau diamagnetism problem, depend on the deforming parameter of two models with intermediate statistics: (i) $q$-fermions and (ii) $F$-anyons, and make {\it comparisons between both cases}. In particular, we extend the results from the literature for $q$-fermions by considering {\it second order terms} in the expansion of the grand partition function. Also, we find that for $F$-anyons statistics the magnetization shows a stronger response with respect to magnetic fields compared to magnetization for $q$-fermions statistics. This theoretical outcome may be experimentally verified for instance in superconductors, that are perfect diamagnetic materials with strong magnetic susceptibility, by adjusting impurities or pressure. The latter can be associated to the deforming parameter $q$.</description>

We use this quantity to formulate an exact upper bound ${\cal O}(L^{-5/2})$ on the gap of the Fredkin and Motzkin spin chains. Our results establish that transport in kinetically constrained dynamical systems with Fredkin or Motzkin constraints is subdiffusive, with dynamical exponent $z \geq 5/2$.</description>

Abstract: We experimentally investigate the statistical properties of the quantum analog of entanglement between two electric circuits equivalent to two Brownian particles connected by an elastic force and maintained at different temperatures through separate heat reservoirs. Uncertainty relations between coordinates and coarse-grained velocity can produce a phenomenon similar to quantum entanglement, where temperature plays the role of Planck's constant. The theoretical analysis matches the experimental results, confirming that the interconnected particles exhibit Brownian quantum-inspired classical correlation entanglement. This effect arises from a coarse grained description of Brownian motion and vanishes at a finer resolution. {The coarsening scales range is measured too.</description>

Abstract: Fisher Information (FI) is a quantity ubiquitously measured in such varied areas like metrology, machine learning, and biological complexity. Mathematically, it represents a lower bound in the variance of unknown parameters that are related to the distributions one has access, and a metric for probability manifolds. A stochastic analogous of the Fisher Information, dubbed stochastic Fisher Information was recently introduced in the literature by some of us. By exploring the probability distributions of the Stochastic Fisher Information (SFI), we uncover two fluctuation relations with an inherent geometric nature, as the SFI acts as a single nonequilibrium trajectory metric. The geometric nature of these relations is expressed through a stochastic length in entropy space derived from the system entropy associated with a nonequilibrium trajectory. We also explore the possibility of trajectory-dependent uncertainty relations linked to the SFI with time as a parameter. Finally, we test our geometric fluctuation relations using two nonequilibrium models.</description>

Abstract: We study S=1/2 quantum spin chains with shift-invariant and inversion-symmetric next-nearest-neighbor interaction, also known as zigzag spin chains. We completely classify the integrability and non-integrability of the above class of spin systems. We prove that in this class there are only two integrable models, a classical model and a model solvable by the Bethe ansatz, and all the remaining systems are non-integrable. Our classification theorem confirms that within this class of spin chains, there is no missing integrable model. This theorem also implies the absence of intermediate models with a finite number of local conserved quantities.</description>

Abstract: Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the dynamical properties of the Baxter-Wu (BW) model under linear quenches. For the linear cooling process, the scaling behavior of the excess defect density in the critical region aligns well with the predictions of the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism. However, the scaling behavior of the excess defect density after exiting the impulse regime does not follow from a simple interplay between the KZ mechanism and the coarsening dynamics; the system undergoes a decay close to a power-law form with an exponent that is significantly different from the coarsening exponent observed in instantaneous quenching. For the linear heating process, we show that, if the system starts from its ground state, the relevant exponents describing the KZ mechanism are identical to those in the cooling scenario. We find that the system does not directly enter the adiabatic regime after leaving the impulse regime but instead passes through a crossover regime with an exponential decay of the excess defect density. If the initial state is ordered but not the ground state of the system, the defect density exhibits a good scaling behavior, but the relevant exponents do not conform to the predictions of the KZ mechanism.</description>

Abstract: Although classical thermal machines power industries and modern living, quantum thermal engines have yet to prove their utility. Here, we demonstrate a useful quantum absorption refrigerator formed from superconducting circuits. We use it to cool a transmon qubit to a temperature lower than that achievable with any one available bath, thereby resetting the qubit to an initial state suitable for quantum computing. The process is driven by a thermal gradient and is autonomous, requiring no external feedback. The refrigerator exploits an engineered three-body interaction between the target qubit and two auxiliary qudits. Each auxiliary qudit is coupled to a physical heat bath, realized with a microwave waveguide populated with synthesized quasithermal radiation. If the target qubit is initially fully excited, its effective temperature reaches a steady-state level of approximately 22~mK, lower than what can be achieved by existing state-of-the-art reset protocols. Our results demonstrate that superconducting circuits with propagating thermal fields can be used to experimentally explore quantum thermodynamics and apply it to quantum information-processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Pseudoentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum entanglement plays a central role in explaining the emergence of thermal equilibrium in isolated many-body systems. However, entanglement is notoriously hard to measure. Recent works have introduced a notion of pseudoentanglement describing ensembles of many-body states that, while only weakly entangled, cannot be efficiently distinguished from states with much higher entanglement, such as random states in the Hilbert space. This prompts the question: how much entanglement is truly necessary to achieve thermal equilibrium in quantum systems? In this work we address this question by introducing random circuit models of quantum dynamics that, at late times, equilibrate to pseudoentangled ensembles -- a phenomenon we name ensemble pseudothermalization. These models replicate all the efficiently observable predictions of thermal equilibrium, while generating only a small (and tunable) amount of entanglement. We examine (i) how a pseudoentangled ensemble on a small subsystem spreads to the whole system as a function of time, and (ii) how a pseudoentangled ensemble can be generated from an initial product state. We map the above problems onto a family of classical Markov chains on subsets of the computational basis. The mixing times of such Markov chains are related to the time scales at which the states produced from the dynamics become indistinguishable from Haar-random states at the level of each statistical moment, or number of copies. Based on a combination of rigorous bounds and conjectures supported by numerics, we argue that each Markov chain's relaxation time and mixing time have different asymptotic behavior in the limit of large system size. This is a necessary condition for a cutoff phenomenon: an abrupt dynamical transition to equilibrium. We thus conjecture that our random circuits give rise to asymptotically sharp distinguishability transitions.</description>

      <title>Simple crowd dynamics to generate complex temporal contact networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirical contact networks or interaction networks demonstrate peculiar characteristics stemming from the fundamental social, psychological, physical mechanisms governing human interactions. Although these mechanisms are complex, we test whether we are able to reproduce some dynamical properties of these empirical networks from relatively simple models. In this study, we perform simulations for a range of 2D models of particle dynamics, namely the Random Walk, Active Brownian Particles, and Vicsek models, to generate artificial contact networks. We investigate temporal properties of these contact networks: the distributions of contact durations, inter-contact durations and number of contact per pair of particle. We demonstrate that the distribution of inter-contact durations can be recovered by the dynamics of these simple crowd particle models, and show that it is simply related to the well-know first-return process, which explains the -3/2 exponent that is found in both the numerical models and empirical contact networks.</description>

      <title>Vector Resonant Relaxation and Statistical Closure Theory. I. Direct Interaction Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stars orbiting a supermassive black hole in the center of galaxies undergo very efficient diffusion in their orbital orientations: this is "Vector Resonant Relaxation". Such a dynamics is intrinsically non-linear, stochastic, and correlated, hence bearing deep similarities with turbulence in fluid mechanics or plasma physics. In that context, we show how generic methods stemming from statistical closure theory, namely the celebrated "Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism", can be used to characterize the correlations describing the redistribution of orbital orientations. In particular, limiting ourselves to the leading order truncation in this closure scheme, the so-called "Direct Interaction Approximation", and placing ourselves in the limit of an isotropic distribution of orientations, we explicitly compare the associated prediction for the two-point correlation function with measures from numerical simulations. We discuss the successes and limitations of this approach and present possible future venues.</description>

      <title>A symmetry-based approach to species-rich ecological communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disordered systems theory provides powerful tools to analyze the generic behaviors of highdimensional systems, such as species-rich ecological communities or neural networks. By assuming randomness in their interactions, universality ensures that many microscopic details are irrelevant to system-wide dynamics; but the choice of a random ensemble still limits the generality of results. We show here, in the context of ecological dynamics, that these analytical tools do not require a specific choice of ensemble, and that solutions can be found based only on a fundamental rotational symmetry in the interactions, encoding the idea that traits can be recombined into new species without altering global features. Dynamical outcomes then depend on the spectrum of the interaction matrix as a free parameter, allowing us to bridge between results found in different models of interactions, and extend beyond them to previously unidentified behaviors. The distinctive feature of ecological models is the possibility of species extinctions, which leads to an increased universality of dynamics as the fraction of extinct species increases. We expect that these findings can inform new developments in theoretical ecology as well as for other families of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10300v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>
