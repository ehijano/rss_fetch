      <title>ESND: An Embedding-based Framework for Signed Network Dismantling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network dismantling aims to maximize the disintegration of a network by removing a specific set of nodes or edges and is applied to various tasks in diverse domains, such as cracking down on crime organizations, delaying the propagation of rumors, and blocking the transmission of viruses. Most of the current network dismantling methods are tailored for unsigned networks, which only consider the connection between nodes without evaluating the nature of the relationships, such as friendship/hostility, enhancing/repressing, and trust/distrust. We here propose an embedding-based algorithm, namely ESND, to solve the signed network dismantling problem. The algorithm generally iterates the following four steps, i.e., giant component detection, network embedding, node clustering, and removal node selection. To illustrate the efficacy and stability of ESND, we conduct extensive experiments on six signed network datasets as well as null models, and compare the performance of our method with baselines. Experimental results consistently show that the proposed ESND is superior to the baselines and displays stable performance with the change in the network structure. Additionally, we examine the impact of sign proportions on network robustness via ESND, observing that networks with a high ratio of negative edges are generally easier to dismantle than networks with high positive edges.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Fluctuation Relations in UNO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems are generalisations of the second law that describe the relations between work, temperature, and free energy in thermodynamic processes and are used extensively in studies of irreversibility and entropy. Many experiments have verified these relations for different physical systems in the setting of thermodynamics. In this study, we observe the same behavior away from physical thermodynamics, namely for the card game UNO, by performing numerical simulations of the game. As the analog of work, we choose the number of steps one player needs to effect a transition in her deck; the other players and the remaining cards play the role of a finite, non-Markovian bath. We also compare our observation with is expected for a Markovian random walk.</description>

      <title>Limiting behaviour of Branching Processes and Online Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The literature considers multi-type Markov branching processes (BPs), where the offspring distribution depends only on the living (current) population. We analyse the total-current population-dependent BPs where the offspring distribution can also depend on the total (dead and living) population. Such a generalization is inspired by the need to accurately model content propagation over online social networks (OSNs). The key question investigated is the time-asymptotic proportion of the populations, which translates to the proportional visibility of the posts on the OSN. We provide the answer using a stochastic approximation (SA) technique, which has not been used in the existing BP literature. The analysis is derived using a non-trivial autonomous measurable ODE. Interestingly, we prove the possibility of a new limiting behaviour for the stochastic trajectory, named as hovering around. Such a result is not just new to the theory of BPs but also to the SA based literature.
  Later, we explore three new variants of BPs: (i) any living individual of a population can attack and acquire the living individuals of the other population, in addition to producing its offspring; (ii) the individuals can die due to abnormal circumstances, and not just at the completion of their lifetimes; (iii) the expected number of offspring decreases as the total-population increases, leading to the saturation of the total-population.
  Such variants aid in analysing unexplored aspects of content propagation over OSNs: (i) competition in advertisement posts for similar products; (ii) controlling fake-post propagation, while not affecting the sharing of real-post; (iii) impact of re-forwarding the posts. We also designed and analysed a participation (mean-field) game where the OSN lures the users with a reward-based scheme to provide their opinion about the actuality of the post (fake or real).</description>

      <title>Empirical Networks are Sparse: Enhancing Multi-Edge Models with Zero-Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world networks are sparse. As we show in this article, even when a large number of interactions is observed most node pairs remain disconnected. We demonstrate that classical multi-edge network models, such as the $G(N,p)$, configuration models, and stochastic block models, fail to accurately capture this phenomenon. To mitigate this issue, zero-inflation must be integrated into these traditional models. Through zero-inflation, we incorporate a mechanism that accounts for the excess number of zeroes (disconnected pairs) observed in empirical data. By performing an analysis on all the datasets from the Sociopatterns repository, we illustrate how zero-inflated models more accurately reflect the sparsity and heavy-tailed edge count distributions observed in empirical data. Our findings underscore that failing to account for these ubiquitous properties in real-world networks inadvertently leads to biased models which do not accurately represent complex systems and their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Capital Inequality Induced Business Cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter we present a stochastic dynamic model which can explain economic cycles. We show that the macroscopic description yields a complex dynamical landscape consisting of multiple stable fixed points, each corresponding to a split of the population into a large low and a small high income group. The stochastic fluctuations induce switching between the resulting metastable states, and excitation oscillations just below a deterministic bifurcation. The shocks are caused by the decisions of a few agents who have a disproportionate influence over the macroscopic state of the economy due to the unequal distribution of wealth among the population. The fluctuations have a long-term effect on the growth of economic output and lead to business cycle oscillations exhibiting coherence resonance, where the correlation time is controlled by the population size which is inversely proportional to the noise intensity.</description>

      <title>A simple model of global cascades on random hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a comprehensive framework that situates information cascades within the domain of higher-order interactions, utilizing a double-threshold hypergraph model. We propose that individuals (nodes) gain awareness of information through each communication channel (hyperedge) once the number of information adopters surpasses a threshold $\phi_m$. However, actual adoption of the information only occurs when the cumulative influence across all communication channels exceeds a second threshold, $\phi_k$. We analytically derive the cascade condition for both the case of a single seed node using percolation methods and the case of any seed size employing mean-field approximation. Our findings underscore that when considering the fractional seed size, $r_0 \in (0,1]$, the connectivity pattern of the random hypergraph, characterized by the hyperdegree, $k$, and cardinality, $m$, distributions, exerts an asymmetric impact on the global cascade boundary. This asymmetry manifests in the observed differences in the boundaries of the global cascade within the $(\phi_m, \langle m \rangle)$ and $(\phi_k, \langle k \rangle)$ planes. However, as $r_0 \to 0$, this asymmetric effect gradually diminishes. Overall, by elucidating the mechanisms driving information cascades within a broader context of higher-order interactions, our research contributes to theoretical advancements in complex systems theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of matrix coupled Kuramoto oscillators on modular networks: excitable behavior and global decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization is observed in many natural systems, with examples ranging from neuronal activation to walking pedestrians. The models proposed by Winfree and Kuramoto stand as the classic frameworks for investigating these phenomena. The Kuramoto model, in particular, has been extended in different ways since its original formulation to account for more general scenarios. One such extension replaces the coupling parameter with a coupling matrix, describing a form of generalized frustration with broken rotational symmetry. A key feature of this model is the existence of {\it phase tuned states}, characterized by having the phase of the order parameter pointing in the direction of the dominant eigenvector of the coupling matrix. Here we investigate the matrix coupled Kuramoto model on networks with two modules, such that one module is in the phase tuned state and the other in a state where the order parameter rotates. We identified different regimes in which one or the other module dominates the dynamics. We found, in particular, that the phase tuned module can create a bottleneck for the oscillation of the rotating module, leading to a behavior similar to the charge and fire regimes of excitable systems. We also found an extended region in the parameter space where motion is globally disordered, even though one of the modules presented high levels of synchronization when uncoupled.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Evolutionary Pressure and Diminishing Returns Might Explain the Fermi Paradox: On What Super-AIs Are Like</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With an evolutionary approach, the basis of morality can be explained as adaptations to problems of cooperation. With 'evolution' taken in a broad sense, evolving AIs that satisfy the conditions for evolution to apply will be subject to the same cooperative evolutionary pressure as biological entities. Here the adaptiveness of increased cooperation as material safety and wealth increase is discussed -- for humans, for other societies, and for AIs. Diminishing beneficial returns from increased access to material resources also suggests the possibility that, on the whole, there will be no incentive to for instance colonize entire galaxies, thus providing a possible explanation of the Fermi paradox, wondering where everybody is. It is further argued that old societies could engender, give way to, super-AIs, since it is likely that super-AIs are feasible, and fitter. Closing is an aside on effective ways for morals and goals to affect life and society, emphasizing environments, cultures, and laws, and exemplified by how to eat.
  Appended are an algorithm for colonizing for example a galaxy quickly, models of the evolution of cooperation and fairness under diminishing returns, and software for simulating signaling development. It is also noted that there can be no exponential colonization or reproduction, for mathematical reasons, as each entity takes up a certain amount of space.</description>

      <title>Revisiting institutional punishment in the $N$-person prisoner's dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conflict between individual and collective interests makes fostering cooperation in human societies a challenging task, requiring drastic measures such as the establishment of sanctioning institutions. These institutions are costly because they have to be maintained regardless of the presence or absence of offenders. Here, we propose realistic improvements to the standard $N$-person prisoner's dilemma formulation with institutional punishment by eliminating overpunishment, requiring a minimum number of contributors to establish the sanctioning institution, and sharing the cost among them once this minimum number is reached. In addition, we focus on large groups or communities for which sanctioning institutions are ubiquitous. Using the replicator equation framework for an infinite population, we find that by sufficiently fining players who fail to contribute either to the public good or to the sanctioning institution, a population of contributors immune to invasion by these free riders can be established, provided that the contributors are sufficiently numerous. In a finite population, we use finite-size scaling to show that, for some parameter settings, demographic noise helps to fixate the strategy that contributes to the public good but not to the sanctioning institution even for infinitely large populations when, somewhat counterintuitively, its proportion in the initial population vanishes with a small power of the population size.</description>
