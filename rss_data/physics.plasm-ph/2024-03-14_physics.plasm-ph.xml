      <title>An asymptotic Grad-Shafranov equation for quasisymmetric stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A first-order model is derived for quasisymmetric stellarators where the vacuum field due to coils is dominant, but plasma-current-induced terms are not negligible and can contribute to magnetic differential equations, with $\beta$ of the order of the ratio of induced to vacuum fields. Under these assumptions, it is proven that the aspect ratio must be large and a simple expression can be obtained for the lowest-order vacuum field. The first-order correction, which involves both vacuum and current-driven fields, is governed by a Grad-Shafranov equation and the requirement that flux surfaces exist. These two equations are not always consistent, and so this model is generally overconstrained, but special solutions exist that satisfy both equations simultaneously. One family of such solutions are the first-order near-axis solutions. Thus, the first-order near-axis model is a subset of the model presented here. Several other solutions outside the scope of the near-axis model are also found. A case study comparing one such solution to a VMEC-generated solution shows good agreement.</description>

      <title>Effects of wave damping and finite perpendicular scale on three-dimensional Alfv\'en wave parametric decay in low-beta plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shear Alfven wave parametric decay instability (PDI) provides a potential path toward significant wave dissipation and plasma heating. However, fundamental questions regarding how PDI is excited in a realistic three-dimensional (3D) open system and how critically the finite perpendicular wave scale -- as found in both the laboratory and space plasmas -- affects the excitation remain poorly understood. Here, we present the first 3D, open-boundary, hybrid kinetic-fluid simulations of kinetic Alfven wave PDI in low-beta plasmas. Key findings are that the PDI excitation is strongly limited by the wave damping present, including electron-ion collisional damping (represented by a constant resistivity) and geometrical attenuation associated with the finite-scale Alfven wave, and ion Landau damping of the child acoustic wave. The perpendicular wave scale alone, however, plays no discernible role, with different wave scales exhibiting similar instability growth. These findings are corroborated by theoretical analysis and estimates. The new understanding of 3D kinetic Alfven wave PDI physics is essential for laboratory study of the basic plasma process and may also help evaluate the relevance/role of PDI in low-beta space plasmas.</description>

      <title>Ab initio Density Response and Local Field Factor of Warm Dense Hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present quasi-exact ab initio path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results for the partial static density responses and local field factors of hydrogen in the warm dense matter regime, from solid density conditions to the strongly compressed case. The full dynamic treatment of electrons and protons on the same footing allows us to rigorously quantify both electronic and ionic exchange--correlation effects in the system, and to compare with earlier incomplete models such as the archetypal uniform electron gas [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 235001 (2020)] or electrons in a fixed ion snapshot potential [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 066402 (2022)] that do not take into account the interplay between the two constituents. The full electronic density response is highly sensitive to electronic localization around the ions, and our results constitute unambiguous predictions for upcoming X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) experiments with hydrogen jets and fusion plasmas. All PIMC results are made freely available and can directly be used for a gamut of applications, including inertial confinement fusion calculations and the modelling of dense astrophysical objects. Moreover, they constitute invaluable benchmark data for approximate but computationally less demanding approaches such as density functional theory or PIMC within the fixed-node approximation.</description>

      <title>Turbulence from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a first-principles approach to turbulence by employing the electrodynamics of continuous media at the viscous limit to recover the Navier-Stokes equations. We treat oscillators with two orthogonal angular momenta as a spin network with properties applicable to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem. The microscopic viscous limit has an irreducible representation that includes $O(3)$ expansion terms for a radiation-dominated fluid with a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, equivalent to an oriented toroidal de Sitter space. The turbulence solution in $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$ lies on 6-choose-3 de Sitter intersections of three orthogonal $n$-tori.</description>

      <title>Parallel Diffusion Coefficient of Energetic Charged Particles in the Inner Heliosphere from the Turbulent Magnetic Fields Measured by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion coefficients of energetic charged particles in turbulent magnetic fields are a fundamental aspect of diffusive transport theory but remain incompletely understood. In this work, we use quasi-linear theory to evaluate the spatial variation of the parallel diffusion coefficient $\kappa_\parallel$ from the measured magnetic turbulence power spectra in the inner heliosphere. We consider the magnetic field and plasma velocity measurements from Parker Solar Probe made during Orbits 5-13. The parallel diffusion coefficient is calculated as a function of radial distance from 0.062 to 0.8 AU, and the particle energy from 100 keV to 1GeV. We find that $\kappa_\parallel$ increases exponentially with both heliocentric distance and energy of particles. The fluctuations in $\kappa_\parallel$ are related to the episodes of large-scale magnetic structures in the solar wind. By fitting the results, we also provide an empirical formula of $\kappa_{\parallel}=(5.16\pm1.22) \times 10^{18} \: r^{1.17\pm0.08} \: E^{0.71\pm 0.02} \; (cm^2/s)$ in the inner heliosphere which can be used as a reference in studying the transport and acceleration of solar energetic particles as well as the modulation of cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Plasma sheath studies using a physical treatment of electron emission from a dielectric wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a plasma sheath forms next to a dielectric wall, material properties determine electron absorption and reflection from the surface, impacting the sheath formation and structure. The low energy regime of this interaction is often not considered rigorously in emissive sheath simulations, but may be modeled from quantum mechanical first principles, and has important applications to plasma thrusters and fusion devices. In this work, low energy electron reflection from the wall is implemented as a boundary condition in a continuum kinetic framework and the sheath is simulated for dielectric material parameters in high and low emission cases. The results presented here demonstrate that the material parameters can have significant effect on the resulting sheath profile and particle distribution functions. Surfaces with high reflection rates see the formation of a space-charge limited sheath.</description>

      <title>An Analytic Model For Magnetically-Dominated Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent numerical cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamic-thermochemical-star formation simulations have resolved the formation of quasar accretion disks with Eddington or super-Eddington accretion rates onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) down to a few hundred gravitational radii. These 'flux-frozen' and hyper-magnetized disks appear to be qualitatively distinct from classical $\alpha$ disks and magnetically-arrested disks: the midplane pressure is dominated by toroidal magnetic fields with plasma $\beta \ll 1$ powered by advection of magnetic flux from the interstellar medium (ISM), and they are super-sonically and trans-Alfvenically turbulent with cooling times short compared to dynamical times yet remain gravitationally stable owing to magnetic support. In this paper, we present a simple analytic similarity model for such disks. For reasonable assumptions, the model is entirely specified by the boundary conditions (inflow rate at the BH radius of influence [BHROI]). We show that the scalings from this model are robust to various detailed assumptions, agree remarkably well with the simulations (given their simplicity), and demonstrate the self-consistency and gravitational stability of such disks even in the outer accretion disk (approaching the BHROI) at hyper-Eddington accretion rates.</description>
