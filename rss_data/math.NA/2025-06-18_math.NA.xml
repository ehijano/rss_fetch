      <title>Surface Minkowski tensors to characterize shapes on curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce surface Minkowski tensors to characterize rotational symmetries of shapes embedded in curved surfaces. The definition is based on a modified vector transport of the shapes boundary co-normal into a reference point which accounts for the angular defect that a classical parallel transport would introduce. This modified transport can be easily implemented for general surfaces and differently defined embedded shapes, and the associated irreducible surface Minkowski tensors give rise to the classification of shapes by their normalized eigenvalues, which are introduced as shape measures following the flat-space analog. We analyze different approximations of the embedded shapes, their influence on the surface Minkowski tensors, and the stability to perturbations of the shape and the surface. The work concludes with a series of numerical experiments showing the applicability of the approach on various surfaces and shape representations and an application in biology in which the characterization of cells in a curved monolayer of cells is considered.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Neural Network -- Polynomial Series Scheme for Learning Invariant Manifolds of Discrete Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid machine learning scheme to learn -- in physics-informed and numerical analysis-informed fashion -- invariant manifolds (IM) of discrete maps for constructing reduced-order models (ROMs) for dynamical systems. The proposed scheme combines polynomial series with shallow neural networks, exploiting the complementary strengths of both approaches. Polynomials enable an efficient and accurate modeling of ROMs with guaranteed local exponential convergence rate around the fixed point, where, under certain assumptions, the IM is demonstrated to be analytic. Neural networks provide approximations to more complex structures beyond the reach of the polynomials' convergence. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed scheme using three benchmark examples, examining convergence behavior, numerical approximation accuracy, and computational training cost. Additionally, we compare the IM approximations obtained solely with neural networks and with polynomial expansions. We demonstrate that the proposed hybrid scheme outperforms both pure polynomial approximations (power series, Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials) and standalone shallow neural network approximations in terms of numerical approximation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of effective diffusivities in homogenization of nondivergence-form equations with large drift by a Lagrangian method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study numerical methods for the homogenization of linear second-order elliptic equations in nondivergence-form with periodic diffusion coefficients and large drift terms. Upon noting that the effective diffusion matrix can be characterized through the long-time variance of an associated diffusion process, we construct a Lagrangian numerical scheme based on a direct simulation of the underlying stochastic differential equation and utilizing the framework of modified equations, thereby avoiding the need to solve the Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equation. Through modified equation analysis, we derive higher-order weak convergence rates for our method. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method. The results show that the method efficiently computes effective diffusivities, even in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Unified numerical analysis for thermoelastic diffusion and thermo-poroelasticity of thin plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a coupled hyperbolic-parabolic system modeling thermoelastic diffusion (resp. thermo-poroelasticity) in plates, consisting of a fourth-order hyperbolic partial differential equation for plate deflection and two second-order parabolic partial differential equations for the first moments of temperature and chemical potential (resp. pore pressure). The unique solvability of the system is established via Galerkin approach, and the additional regularity of the solution is obtained under appropriately strengthened data. For numerical approximation, we employ the Newmark method for time discretization of the hyperbolic term and a continuous interior penalty scheme for the spatial discretization of displacement. For the parabolic equations that represent the first moments of temperature and chemical potential (resp. pore pressure), we use the Crank--Nicolson method for time discretization and conforming finite elements for spatial discretization. The convergence of the fully discrete scheme with quasi-optimal rates in space and time is established. The numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the 2D Kirchhoff--Love plate model in capturing thermoelastic diffusion and thermo-poroelastic behavior in specific materials. We illustrate that as plate thickness decreases, the two-dimensional simulations closely approximate the results of three-dimensional problem. Finally, the numerical experiments also validate the theoretical rates of convergence.</description>

      <title>Using BDF schemes in the temporal integration of POD-ROM methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the numerical approximation of a semilinear reaction-diffusion model problem (PDEs) by means of reduced order methods (ROMs) based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). We focus on the time integration of the fully discrete reduced order model. Most of the analysis in the literature has been carried out for the implicit Euler method as time integrator. We integrate in time the reduced order model with the BDF-q time stepping ($1\le q\le 5$) and prove optimal rate of convergence of order $q$ in time. Our set of snapshots is obtained from finite element approximations to the original model problem computed at different times. These finite element approximations can be obtained with any time integrator. The POD method is based on first order difference quotients of the snapshots. The reason for doing this is twofold. On the one hand, the use of difference quotients allow us to provide pointwise-in-time error bounds. On the other, the use of difference quotients is essential to get the expected rate $q$ in time since we apply that the BDF-q time stepping, $1\le q\le 5$, can be written as a linear combination of first order difference quotients.</description>

      <title>Convergence of generalized cross-validation with applications to ill-posed integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we rigorously establish the consistency of generalized cross-validation as a parameter-choice rule for solving inverse problems. We prove that the index chosen by leave-one-out GCV achieves a non-asymptotic, order-optimal error bound with high probability for polynomially ill-posed compact operators. Hereby it is remarkable that the unknown true solution need not satisfy a self-similarity condition, which is generally needed for other heuristic parameter choice rules. We quantify the rate and demonstrate convergence numerically on integral equation test cases, including image deblurring and CT reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Posterior contraction rates of computational methods for Bayesian data assimilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze posterior consistency of a Bayesian data assimilation problem under discretization. We prove convergence rates for the discrete posterior to ground truth solution under both conforming discretization and finite element discretization (usually non-conforming). The analysis is based on the coupling of asymptotics between the number of samples and the dimension of discrete spaces. In the finite element discretization, tailor-made discrete priors, instead of the discretization of continuous priors, are used to generate an optimal convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gearhart-Koshy acceleration is a Krylov subspace method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kaczmarz method is a row-action method for solving consistent non-square linear systems, and Gearhart-Koshy acceleration is a line-search that minimizes the Euclidean norm of the error along a ray in the direction of a Kaczmarz step. Recently one of the authors generalized this procedure to a search for the point with minimal Euclidean error norm within a sequence of nested affine subspaces.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that this generalization can be interpreted as a Krylov subspace method for a square linear system, which is equivalent with the original system to be solved. In exact arithmetic the method cannot break down prematurely, and it makes progress in every step. We also present a mathematically equivalent reformulation of the algorithm in terms of the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure, and we illustrate the convergence behavior of the new method with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Model Order Reduction of Stiff Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) represent a significant advancement at the intersection of machine learning and dynamical systems, offering a continuous-time analog to discrete neural networks. Despite their promise, deploying neural ODEs in practical applications often encounters the challenge of stiffness, a condition where rapid variations in some components of the solution demand prohibitively small time steps for explicit solvers. This work addresses the stiffness issue when employing neural ODEs for model order reduction by introducing a suitable reparametrization in time. The considered map is data-driven and it is induced by the adaptive time-stepping of an implicit solver on a reference solution. We show the map produces a nonstiff system that can be cheaply solved with an explicit time integration scheme. The original, stiff, time dynamic is recovered by means of a map learnt by a neural network that connects the state space to the time reparametrization. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating improvements in efficiency for the neural ODE inference while maintaining robustness and accuracy. The neural network model also showcases good generalization properties for times beyond the training data.</description>

      <title>Extending Mercer's expansion to indefinite and asymmetric kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mercer's expansion and Mercer's theorem are cornerstone results in kernel theory. While the classical Mercer's theorem only considers continuous symmetric positive definite kernels, analogous expansions are effective in practice for indefinite and asymmetric kernels. In this paper we extend Mercer's expansion to continuous kernels, providing a rigorous theoretical underpinning for indefinite and asymmetric kernels. We begin by demonstrating that Mercer's expansion may not be pointwise convergent for continuous indefinite kernels, before proving that the expansion of continuous kernels with bounded variation uniformly in each variable separably converges pointwise almost everywhere, almost uniformly, and unconditionally almost everywhere. We also describe an algorithm for computing Mercer's expansion for general kernels and give new decay bounds on its terms.</description>

      <title>A Meshfree Method for Eigenvalues of Differential Operators on Surfaces, Including Steklov Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and study techniques for investigating the spectra of linear differential operators on surfaces and flat domains using symmetric meshfree methods: meshfree methods that arise from finding norm-minimizing Hermite-Birkhoff interpolants in a Hilbert space. Meshfree methods are desirable for surface problems due to the increased difficulties associated with mesh creation and refinement on curved surfaces. While meshfree methods have been used for solving a wide range of partial differential equations (PDEs) in recent years, the spectra of operators discretized using radial basis functions (RBFs) often suffer from the presence of non-physical eigenvalues (spurious modes). This makes many RBF methods unhelpful for eigenvalue problems. We provide rigorously justified processes for finding eigenvalues based on results concerning the norm of the solution in its native space; specifically, only PDEs with solutions in the native space produce numerical solutions with bounded norms as the fill distance approaches zero. For certain problems, we prove that eigenvalue and eigenfunction estimates converge at a high-order rate. The technique we present is general enough to work for a wide variety of problems, including Steklov problems, where the eigenvalue parameter is in the boundary condition. Numerical experiments for a mix of standard and Steklov eigenproblems on surfaces with and without boundary, as well as flat domains, are presented, including a Steklov-Helmholtz problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of computing the stationary distribution of nearly completely decomposable Markov processes, a well-established area in the classical theory of Markov processes with broad applications in the design, modeling, analysis and optimization of computer systems and applications. We devise a general mathematical framework of numerical solution methods that exploits forms of mixed-precision computation to significantly reduce computation times and that exploits forms of iterative approximate computing approaches to mitigate the impact of inaccurate computations, further reduce computation times, and ensure convergence. Then we derive a mathematical analysis that establishes theoretical properties of our general algorithmic framework including results on approximation errors, convergence behaviors, and other algorithmic characteristics. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our general algorithmic framework provides significant improvements in computation times over the most-efficient existing numerical methods.</description>

      <title>An Operator-Splitting Scheme for Viscosity Solutions of Constrained Second-Order PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel operator-splitting finite element scheme for approximating viscosity solutions of constrained second-order partial differential equations (PDEs). The method is designed for solutions with low regularity in \( C(\overline{\Omega}_T) \cap H^1(\Omega_T) \). By decoupling the PDE evolution from constraint enforcement, the scheme combines a stabilized finite element method with a semi-implicit time-stepping strategy. We prove that the scheme satisfies a discrete comparison principle by showing the discrete operator yields an M-matrix, which guarantees monotonicity and \(L^\infty\)-stability. These properties, along with consistency, ensure convergence to the unique viscosity solution via the Barles-Souganidis framework. For regular solutions, we establish an optimal-order error estimate of \( O(\Delta t + h^2) \). Numerical experiments validate the theory.</description>

      <title>Block Alpha-Circulant Preconditioners for All-at-Once Diffusion-Based Covariance Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Covariance matrices are central to data assimilation and inverse methods derived from statistical estimation theory. Previous work has considered the application of an all-at-once diffusion-based representation of a covariance matrix operator in order to exploit inherent parallellism in the underlying problem. In this paper, we provide practical methods to apply block $\alpha$-circulant preconditioners to the all-at-once system for the case where the main diffusion operation matrix cannot be readily diagonalized using a discrete Fourier transform. Our new framework applies the block $\alpha$-circulant preconditioner approximately by solving an inner block diagonal problem via a choice of inner iterative approaches. Our first method applies Chebyshev semi-iteration to a symmetric positive definite matrix, shifted by a complex scaling of the identity. We extend theoretical results for Chebyshev semi-iteration in the symmetric positive definite setting, to obtain computable bounds on the asymptotic convergence factor for each of the complex sub-problems. The second approach transforms the complex sub-problem into a (generalized) saddle point system with real coefficients. Numerical experiments reveal that in the case of unlimited computational resources, both methods can match the iteration counts of the `best-case' block $\alpha$-circulant preconditioner. We also provide a practical adaptation to the nested Chebyshev approach, which improves performance in the case of a limited computational budget. Using an appropriate choice of $\alpha$ our new approaches are robust and efficient in terms of outer iterations and matrix--vector products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for fast integral operations by uncovering hidden geometries in the row and column structures of the underlying operators. This is accomplished through an iterative procedure that constructs adaptive hierarchical partition trees, revealing latent multiscale organization and exposing local low-rank structures within the data. Guided by this geometry, we employ two complementary techniques: (1) the \emph{butterfly algorithm}, which exploits the learned hierarchical low-rank structure; and (2) \emph{adaptive best tilings} in both space and frequency using all levels of the generalized Haar--Walsh wavelet packet tree. These techniques enable efficient matrix factorization and multiplication. Unlike classical approaches that rely on prior knowledge of the underlying geometry, our method is fully data-driven and applicable to matrices arising from irregular or unknown distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on matrices associated with acoustic heterogeneous potential operators and families of orthogonal polynomials. The resulting compressed representations reduce storage complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$, enabling fast computation and scalable implementation.</description>

      <title>On a Continuum Model for Random Genetic Drift: A Dynamical Boundary Condition Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new continuum model for a random genetic drift problem by employing a dynamical boundary condition approach. The new model, which can be viewed as a regularized Kimura equation, admits a continuous solution. The existence and uniqueness of the strong solution of the regularized system are shown. We present some numerical results for the regularized model, which indicate that the model can capture the main features of random genetic drift, such as gene fixation and conservation of the first moment.</description>

      <title>Perturbation analysis of a class of composite optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the perturbation analysis of a class of composite optimization problems, which is a very convenient and unified framework for developing both theoretical and algorithmic issues of constrained optimization problems. The underlying theme of this paper is very important in both theoretical and computational study of optimization problems. Under some mild assumptions on the objective function, we provide a definition of a strong second order sufficient condition (SSOSC) for the composite optimization problem and also prove that the following conditions are equivalent to each other: the SSOSC and the nondegeneracy condition, the nonsingularity of Clarke's generalized Jacobian of the nonsmooth system at a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point, and the strong regularity of the KKT point. These results provide an important way to characterize the stability of the KKT point.
  As for the convex composite optimization problem, which is a special case of the general problem, we establish the equivalence between the primal/dual second order sufficient condition and the dual/primal strict Robinson constraint qualification, the equivalence between the primal/dual SSOSC and the dual/primal nondegeneracy condition. Moreover, we prove that the dual nondegeneracy condition and the nonsingularity of Clarke's generalized Jacobian of the subproblem corresponding to the augmented Lagrangian method are also equivalent to each other. These theoretical results lay solid foundation for designing an efficient algorithm.</description>

      <title>On Efficient Solutions of General Structured Markov Processes in Quantum Computational Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study from a theoretical viewpoint the fundamental problem of efficiently computing the stationary distribution of general classes of structured Markov processes. In strong contrast with previous work, we consider this fundamental problem within the context of quantum computational environments from a mathematical perspective and devise the first quantum algorithms for computing the stationary distribution of general structured Markov processes. We derive a mathematical analysis of the computational properties of our quantum algorithms together with related theoretical results, establishing that our quantum algorithms provide the potential for significant computational improvements over that of the best-known and most-efficient classical algorithms in various settings of both theoretical and practical importance. Although motivated by general structured Markov processes, our quantum algorithms can be exploited to address a much larger class of numerical computation problems, as well as to potentially play the role of a subroutine as part of solving larger computational problems involving the stationary distribution on a quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Analysis and Faster Algorithms for Iteratively Solving Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite being a key bottleneck in many machine learning tasks, the cost of solving large linear systems has proven challenging to quantify due to problem-dependent quantities such as condition numbers. To tackle this, we consider a fine-grained notion of complexity for solving linear systems, which is motivated by applications where the data exhibits low-dimensional structure, including spiked covariance models and kernel machines, and when the linear system is explicitly regularized, such as ridge regression. Concretely, let $\kappa_\ell$ be the ratio between the $\ell$th largest and the smallest singular value of $n\times n$ matrix $A$. We give a stochastic algorithm based on the Sketch-and-Project paradigm, that solves the linear system $Ax = b$, that is, finds $\bar{x}$ such that $\|A\bar{x} - b\| \le \epsilon \|b\|$, in time $\bar O(\kappa_\ell\cdot n^2\log 1/\epsilon)$, for any $\ell = O(n^{0.729})$. This is a direct improvement over preconditioned conjugate gradient, and it provides a stronger separation between stochastic linear solvers and algorithms accessing $A$ only through matrix-vector products. Our main technical contribution is the new analysis of the first and second moments of the random projection matrix that arises in Sketch-and-Project.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis for different finite element types in strain-gradient elasticity simulations performed on Firedrake and FEniCS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The layer-upon-layer approach in additive manufacturing, open or closed cells in polymeric or metallic foams involve an intrinsic microstructure tailored to the underlying applications. Homogenization of such architectured materials creates metamaterials modeled by higher-gradient models, specifically when the microstructure's characteristic length is comparable to the length scale of the structure. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of various finite elements methods for solving problems in strain-gradient elasticity. We employ open-source packages from Firedrake and FEniCS. Different finite element formulations are tested: we implement Lagrange, Argyris, Hermite elements, a Hu--Washizu type (mixed) formulation, as well as isogeometric analysis with Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). For the numerical study, we investigate one- and two-dimensional problems discussed in the literature of strain-gradient modeling. All developed codes are open-access to encourage research in Finite Element Method (FEM) based computation of generalized continua.</description>

      <title>Sparse Pseudospectral Shattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of nonnormal matrices can be unstable under perturbations of their entries. This renders an obstacle to the analysis of numerical algorithms for non-Hermitian eigenvalue problems. A recent technique to handle this issue is pseudospectral shattering [BGVKS23], showing that adding a random perturbation to any matrix has a regularizing effect on the stability of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Prior work has analyzed the regularizing effect of dense Gaussian perturbations, where independent noise is added to every entry of a given matrix [BVKS20, BGVKS23, BKMS21, JSS21].
  We show that the same effect can be achieved by adding a sparse random perturbation. In particular, we show that given any $n\times n$ matrix $M$ of polynomially bounded norm: (a) perturbing $O(n\log^2(n))$ random entries of $M$ by adding i.i.d. complex Gaussians yields $\log\kappa_V(A)=O(\text{poly}\log(n))$ and $\log (1/\eta(A))=O(\text{poly}\log(n))$ with high probability; (b) perturbing $O(n^{1+\alpha})$ random entries of $M$ for any constant $\alpha&gt;0$ yields $\log\kappa_V(A)=O_\alpha(\log(n))$ and $\log(1/\eta(A))=O_\alpha(\log(n))$ with high probability. Here, $\kappa_V(A)$ denotes the condition number of the eigenvectors of the perturbed matrix $A$ and $\eta(A)$ denotes its minimum eigenvalue gap.
  A key mechanism of the proof is to reduce the study of $\kappa_V(A)$ to control of the pseudospectral area and minimum eigenvalue gap of $A$, which are further reduced to estimates on the least two singular values of shifts of $A$. We obtain the required least singular value estimates via a streamlining of an argument of Tao and Vu [TV07] specialized to the case of sparse complex Gaussian perturbations.</description>

      <title>Regional climate risk assessment from climate models using probabilistic machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate, actionable climate information at km scales is crucial for robust natural hazard risk assessment and infrastructure planning. Simulating climate at these resolutions remains intractable, forcing reliance on downscaling: either physics-based or statistical methods that transform climate simulations from coarse to impact-relevant resolutions. One major challenge for downscaling is to comprehensively capture the interdependency among climate processes of interest, a prerequisite for representing climate hazards. However, current approaches either lack the desired scalability or are bespoke to specific types of hazards. We introduce GenFocal, a computationally efficient, general-purpose, end-to-end generative framework that gives rise to full probabilistic characterizations of complex climate processes interacting at fine spatiotemporal scales. GenFocal more accurately assesses extreme risk in the current climate than leading approaches, including one used in the US 5th National Climate Assessment. It produces plausible tracks of tropical cyclones, providing accurate statistics of their genesis and evolution, even when they are absent from the corresponding climate simulations. GenFocal also shows compelling results that are consistent with the literature on projecting climate impact on decadal timescales. GenFocal revolutionizes how climate simulations can be efficiently augmented with observations and harnessed to enable future climate impact assessments at the spatiotemporal scales relevant to local and regional communities. We believe this work establishes genAI as an effective paradigm for modeling complex, high-dimensional multivariate statistical correlations that have deterred precise quantification of climate risks associated with hazards such as wildfires, extreme heat, tropical cyclones, and flooding; thereby enabling the evaluation of adaptation strategies.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on multirate time-domain simulations of power system models. It proposes a matrix pencil-based approach to evaluate the spurious numerical deformation introduced into power system dynamics by a given multirate integration scheme. Moreover, it considers the problem of multirate partitioning and discusses a strategy for allocating state and algebraic variables to fast and slow subsystems based on modal participation factors (PFs). The suitability and features of the proposed approach are illustrated through numerical simulations that assess the accuracy effects of interfacing, as well as of various prediction and solution methods.</description>

      <title>Dual guidance: ROM-informed field reconstruction with generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a dual-guided framework for reconstructing unsteady incompressible flow fields using sparse observations. The approach combines optimized sensor placement with a physics-informed guided generative model. Sensor locations are selected using mutual information theory applied to a reduced-order model of the flow, enabling efficient identification of high-information observation points with minimal computational cost. These sensors, once selected, provide targeted observations that guide a denoising diffusion probabilistic model conditioned by physical constraints. Extensive experiments on 2D laminar cylinder wake flows demonstrate that under sparse sensing conditions, the structured sensor layouts fail to capture key flow dynamics, yielding high reconstruction errors. In contrast, our optimized sensor placement strategy achieves accurate reconstructions with L2 errors as low as 0.05, even with a limited number of sensors, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach in data-limited regimes. When the number of sensors is higher than a threshold, however, both methods perform comparably. Our dual-guided approach bridges reduced order model-based sensor position optimization with modern generative modeling, providing accurate, physics-consistent reconstruction from sparse data for scientific machine-learning problems.</description>
