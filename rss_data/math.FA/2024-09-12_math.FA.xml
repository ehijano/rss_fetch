      <title>Hereditarily frequently hypercyclic operators and disjoint frequent hypercyclicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the notion of hereditary frequent hypercyclicity, which is a reinforcement of the well known concept of frequent hypercyclicity. This notion is useful for the study of the dynamical properties of direct sums of operators; in particular, a basic observation is that the direct sum of a hereditarily frequently hypercyclic operator with any frequently hypercyclic operator is frequently hypercyclic. Among other results, we show that operators satisfying the Frequent Hypercyclicity Criterion are hereditarily frequently hypercyclic, as well as a large class of operators whose unimodular eigenvectors are spanning with respect to the Lebesgue measure. On the other hand, we exhibit two frequently hypercyclic weighted shifts $B_w,B_{w'}$ on $c_0(\mathbb{Z}_+)$ whose direct sum $B_w\oplus B_{w'}$ is not $\mathcal{U}$-frequently hypercyclic (so that neither of them is hereditarily frequently hypercyclic), and we construct a $C$-type operator on $\ell_p(\mathbb{Z}_+)$, $1\le p&lt;\infty$ which is frequently hypercyclic but not hereditarily frequently hypercyclic. We also solve several problems concerning disjoint frequent hypercyclicity: we show that for every $N\in\mathbb{N}$, any disjoint frequently hypercyclic $N$-tuple of operators $(T_1,\dots ,T_N)$ can be extended to a disjoint frequently hypercyclic $(N+1)$-tuple $(T_1,\dots ,T_N, T_{N+1})$ as soon as the underlying space supports a hereditarily frequently hypercyclic operator; we construct a disjoint frequently hypercyclic pair which is not densely disjoint hypercyclic; and we show that the pair $(D,\tau_a)$ is disjoint frequently hypercyclic, where $D$ is the derivation operator acting on the space of entire functions and $\tau_a$ is the operator of translation by $a\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\{ 0\}$. Part of our results are in fact obtained in the general setting of Furstenberg families.</description>

      <title>On unitary equivalence and reducing subspaces of analytic Toeplitz operator on vector-valued Hardy space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we proved that $T_{z^n}$ acting on the $\mathbb{C}^m$-valued Hardy space $H_{\mathbb{C}^m}^2(\mathbb{D})$, is unitarily equivalent to $\bigoplus_1^{mn}T_z$, where $T_z$ is acting on the scalar-valued Hardy space $H_{\mathbb{C}}^2(\mathbb{D})$. And using the matrix manipulations combined with operator theory methods, we completely describe the reducing subspaces of $T_{z^n}$ on $H_{\mathbb{C}^m}^2(\mathbb{D})$.</description>

      <title>The $H^\infty$-functional calculus for bisectorial Clifford operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to introduce the H-infinity functional calculus for unbounded bisectorial operators in a Clifford module over the algebra R_n. While recent studies have focused on bounded operators or unbounded paravector operators, we now investigate unbounded fully Clifford operators and define polynomially growing functions of them. We first generate the omega-functional calculus for functions that exhibit an appropriate decay at zero and at infinity. We then extend to functions with a finite value at zero and at infinity. Finally, using a subsequent regularization procedure, we can define the H-infinity functional calculus for the class of regularizable functions, which in particular include functions with polynomial growth at infinity and, if T is injective, also functions with polynomial growth at zero.</description>

      <title>A Dyadic Approach to Weak Characterizations of Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak-type quasi-norms are defined using the mean oscillation or the mean of a function on dyadic cubes, providing discrete analogues and variants of the corresponding quasi-norms on the upper half-space previously considered in the literature. Comparing the resulting function spaces to known function spaces such as $\dot{W}^{1,p}(\rn)$, $\JNp$, $\Lp$ and weak-$\Lp$ gives new embeddings and characterizations of these spaces. Examples are provided to prove the sharpness of the results.</description>

      <title>Preservers of Operator Commutativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{M}$ and $\mathfrak{J}$ be JBW$^*$-algebras admitting no central summands of type $I_1$ and $I_2,$ and let $\Phi: \mathfrak{M} \rightarrow \mathfrak{J}$ be a linear bijection preserving operator commutativity in both directions, that is, $$[x,\mathfrak{M},y] = 0 \Leftrightarrow [\Phi(x),\mathfrak{J},\Phi(y)] = 0,$$ for all $x,y\in \mathfrak{M}$, where the associator of three elements $a,b,c$ in $\mathfrak{M}$ is defined by $[a,b,c]:=(a\circ b)\circ c - (c\circ b)\circ a$. We prove that under these conditions there exist a unique invertible central element $z_0$ in $\mathfrak{J}$, a unique Jordan isomorphism $J: \mathfrak{M} \rightarrow \mathfrak{J}$, and a unique linear mapping $\beta$ from $\mathfrak{M}$ to the centre of $\mathfrak{J}$ satisfying $$ \Phi(x) = z_0 \circ J(x) + \beta(x), $$ for all $x\in \mathfrak{M}.$ Furthermore, if $\Phi$ is a symmetric mapping (i.e., $\Phi (x^*) = \Phi (x)^*$ for all $x\in \mathfrak{M}$), the element $z_0$ is self-adjoint, $J$ is a Jordan $^*$-isomorphism, and $\beta$ is a symmetric mapping too.
  In case that $\mathfrak{J}$ is a JBW$^*$-algebra admitting no central summands of type $I_1$, we also address the problem of describing the form of all symmetric bilinear mappings $B : \mathfrak{J}\times \mathfrak{J}\to \mathfrak{J}$ whose trace is associating (i.e., $[B(a,a),b,a] = 0,$ for all $a, b \in \mathfrak{J})$ providing a complete solution to it. We also determine the form of all associating linear maps on $\mathfrak{J}$.</description>

      <title>Homogenisation for Maxwell and Friends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine the understanding of continuous dependence on coefficients of solution operators under the nonlocal $H$-topology viz Schur topology in the setting of evolutionary equations in the sense of Picard. We show that certain components of the solution operators converge strongly. The weak convergence behaviour known from homogenisation problems for ordinary differential equations is recovered on the other solution operator components. The results are underpinned by a rich class of examples that, in turn, are also treated numerically, suggesting a certain sharpness of the theoretical findings. Analytic treatment of an example that proves this sharpness is provided too. Even though all the considered examples contain local coefficients, the main theorems and structural insights are of operator-theoretic nature and, thus, also applicable to nonlocal coefficients. The main advantage of the problem class considered is that they contain mixtures of type, potentially highly oscillating between different types of PDEs; a prototype can be found in Maxwell's equations highly oscillating between the classical equations and corresponding eddy current approximations.</description>

      <title>Embedding C*-algebras into the Calkin algebra of $\ell^{p}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p\in(1,\infty)$. We show that there is an isomorphism from any separable unital subalgebra of $B(\ell^{2})/K(\ell^{2})$ onto a subalgebra of $B(\ell^{p})/K(\ell^{p})$ that preserves the Fredholm index. As a consequence, every separable $C^{*}$-algebra is isomorphic to a subalgebra of $B(\ell^{p})/K(\ell^{p})$. Another consequence is the existence of operators on $\ell^{p}$ that behave like the essentially normal operators with arbitrary Fredholm indices in the Brown-Douglas-Fillmore theory.</description>

      <title>Hoeffding decomposition of black-box models with dependent inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Performing an additive decomposition of arbitrary functions of random elements is paramount for global sensitivity analysis and, therefore, the interpretation of black-box models. The well-known seminal work of Hoeffding characterized the summands in such a decomposition in the particular case of mutually independent inputs. Going beyond the framework of independent inputs has been an ongoing challenge in the literature.  Existing solutions have so far required constraining assumptions or suffer from a lack of interpretability.  In this paper, we generalize Hoeffding's decomposition for dependent inputs under very mild conditions. For that purpose, we propose a novel framework to handle dependencies based on probability theory, functional analysis, and combinatorics. It allows for characterizing two reasonable assumptions on the dependence structure of the inputs: non-perfect functional dependence and non-degenerate stochastic dependence. We then show that any square-integrable, real-valued function of random elements respecting these two assumptions can be uniquely additively decomposed and offer a characterization of the summands using oblique projections. We then introduce and discuss the theoretical properties and practical benefits of the sensitivity indices that ensue from this decomposition. Finally, the decomposition is analytically illustrated on bivariate functions of Bernoulli inputs.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Grand Wiener Amalgam Spaces and the boundedness of Hardy-Littlewood maximal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [17], we defined and investigated the grand Wiener amalgam space $W(L^{p),\theta_1}(\Omega), L^{q),\theta_2}(\Omega))$ by using the classical grand Lebesgue spaces, where $1&lt;p,q&lt;\infty, \theta_1&gt;0, \theta_2&gt;0$ and the measure of $\Omega$ is finite. In the present paper we generalize this space and define the generalized grand Wiener amalgam space $W(L_{a}^{p)}(\mathbb R^{n}), L_{b}^{q)}(\mathbb R^{n})),$ where $L_{a}^{p)}(\mathbb R^{n})$ and $L_{b}^{q)}(\mathbb R^{n}),$ are the generalized grand Lebesgue spaces. Later we investigate some basic properties. Next we study embeddings for these spaces and we discuss boundedness and unboundedness of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator between some generalized grand Wiener amalgam spaces.</description>

      <title>Manifolds of absolutely continuous functions with values in an infinite-dimensional manifold and regularity properties of half-Lie groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $p\in [1,\infty]$, we define a smooth manifold structure on the set of absolutely continuous functions $\gamma\colon [a,b]\to N$ with $L^p$-derivatives for each smooth manifold $N$ modeled on a sequentially complete locally convex topological vector space which admits a local addition. Smoothness of natural mappings between spaces of absolutely continuous functions is discussed. For $1\leq p &lt;\infty$ and $r\in \mathbb{N}$ we show that the right half-Lie groups $\text{Diff}_K^r(\mathbb{R})$ and $\text{Diff}^r(M)$ are $L^p$-semiregular. Here $K$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $M$ is a compact smooth manifold. For the preceding examples, the evolution map $\text{Evol}$ is continuous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider integrals in the sense of Choquet with respect to the $\delta$-dimensional Hausdorff content for continuously differentiable functions defined on open, connected sets in the Euclidean $n$-space, $n\geq 2$, $0&lt;\delta\le n$. In particular, for these functions we prove Sobolev inequalities in the limiting case $p=\delta /n$ and in the case $p&gt;\delta$, here $p$ is the integrability exponent of the absolute value of the gradient of any given function. The results complement previously known Poincar\'e-Sobolev and Morrey inequalities.</description>

Abstract: We study boundedness, optimality and attainability of Trudinger-Moser type maximization problems in the radial and the subcritical homogeneous Sobolev spaces $\dot{W}^{1,p}_{0, \text{rad}}(B_R^N)\,(p&lt;N)$. Our results give a revision of an error in \cite[Theorem C]{HL}. Also, our inequality converges to the original Trudinger-Moser inequality as $p \nearrow N$ including optimal exponent and concentration limit. Finally, we consider an application of our inequality to elliptic problems with exponential nonlinearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say that an inclusion of an algebra $A$ into a $C^*$-algebra $B$ has the ideal separation property if closed ideals in $B$ can be recovered by their intersection with $A$. Such inclusions have attractive properties from the point of view of harmonic analysis and noncommutative geometry. We establish several permanence properties of locally compact groups for which $L^1(G) \subseteq C^*_{\mathrm{red}}(G)$ has the ideal separation property.</description>
