      <title>Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection in Long-Term Investments with Unknown Distribution: Online Estimation, Risk Aversion under Ambiguity, and Universality of Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard approach for constructing a Mean-Variance portfolio involves estimating parameters for the model using collected samples. However, since the distribution of future data may not resemble that of the training set, the out-of-sample performance of the estimated portfolio is worse than one derived with true parameters, which has prompted several innovations for better estimation. Instead of treating the data without a timing aspect as in the common training-backtest approach, this paper adopts a perspective where data gradually and continuously reveal over time. The original model is recast into an online learning framework, which is free from any statistical assumptions, to propose a dynamic strategy of sequential portfolios such that its empirical utility, Sharpe ratio, and growth rate asymptotically achieve those of the true portfolio, derived with perfect knowledge of the future data.
  When the distribution of future data has a normal shape, the growth rate of wealth is shown to increase by lifting the portfolio along the efficient frontier through the calibration of risk aversion. Since risk aversion cannot be appropriately predetermined, another proposed algorithm updating this coefficient over time forms a dynamic strategy approaching the optimal empirical Sharpe ratio or growth rate associated with the true coefficient. The performance of these proposed strategies is universally guaranteed under specific stochastic markets. Furthermore, in stationary and ergodic markets, the so-called Bayesian strategy utilizing true conditional distributions, based on observed past market information during investment, almost surely does not perform better than the proposed strategies in terms of empirical utility, Sharpe ratio, or growth rate, which, in contrast, do not rely on conditional distributions.</description>

      <title>Pricing VIX options under the Heston-Hawkes stochastic volatility model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a semi-analytical pricing formula for European VIX call options under the Heston-Hawkes stochastic volatility model introduced in arXiv:2210.15343. This arbitrage-free model incorporates the volatility clustering feature by adding an independent compound Hawkes process to the Heston volatility. Using the Markov property of the exponential Hawkes an explicit expression of $\text{VIX}^2$ is derived as a linear combination of the variance and the Hawkes intensity. We apply qualitative ODE theory to study the existence of some generalized Riccati ODEs. Thereafter, we compute the joint characteristic function of the variance and the Hawkes intensity exploiting the exponential affine structure of the model. Finally, the pricing formula is obtained by applying standard Fourier techniques.</description>

      <title>Robust Lambda-quantiles and extreme probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the robust models for $\Lambda$-quantiles with partial information regarding the loss distribution, where $\Lambda$-quantiles extend the classical quantiles by replacing the fixed probability level with a probability/loss function $\Lambda$. We find that, under some assumptions, the robust $\Lambda$-quantiles equal the $\Lambda$-quantiles of the extreme probabilities. This finding allows us to obtain the robust $\Lambda$-quantiles by applying the results of robust quantiles in the literature. Our results are applied to uncertainty sets characterized by three different constraints respectively: moment constraints, probability distance constraints via Wasserstein metric, and marginal constraints in risk aggregation. We obtain some explicit expressions for robust $\Lambda$-quantiles by deriving the extreme probabilities for each uncertainty set. Those results are applied to optimal portfolio selection under model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Robust convex risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the general properties of robust convex risk measures as worst-case values under uncertainty on random variables. We establish general concrete results regarding convex conjugates and sub-differentials. We refine some results for closed forms of worstcase law invariant convex risk measures under two concrete cases of uncertainty sets for random variables: based on the first two moments and Wasserstein balls.</description>

      <title>Strong existence and uniqueness of a calibrated local stochastic volatility model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation, whose volatility coefficient depends on the conditional distribution of the second component with respect to the first component. We prove the strong existence and uniqueness of the solution, establishing the well-posedness of a two-factor local stochastic volatility (LSV) model calibrated to the market prices of European call options. In the spirit of [Jourdain and Zhou, 2020, Existence of a calibrated regime switching local volatility model.], we assume that the factor driving the volatility of the log-price takes finitely many values. Additionally, the propagation of chaos of the particle system is established, giving theoretical justification for the algorithm [Julien Guyon and Henry-Labord\`ere, 2012, Being particular about calibration.].</description>

      <title>Detecting asset price bubbles using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we employ deep learning techniques to detect financial asset bubbles by using observed call option prices. The proposed algorithm is widely applicable and model-independent. We test the accuracy of our methodology in numerical experiments within a wide range of models and apply it to market data of tech stocks in order to assess if asset price bubbles are present. Under a given condition on the pricing of call options under asset price bubbles, we are able to provide a theoretical foundation of our approach for positive and continuous stochastic asset price processes. When such a condition is not satisfied, we focus on local volatility models. To this purpose, we give a new necessary and sufficient condition for a process with time-dependent local volatility function to be a strict local martingale.</description>

      <title>Utility maximization in constrained and unbounded financial markets: Applications to indifference valuation, regime switching, consumption and Epstein-Zin recursive utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.00199v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This memoir presents a systematic study of utility maximization problems for an investor in constrained and unbounded financial markets. Building upon the foundational work of Hu et al. (2005) [Ann. Appl. Probab., 15, 1691--1712] in a bounded framework, we extend our analysis to more challenging unbounded cases. Our methodology combines quadratic backward stochastic differential equations with unbounded solutions and convex duality methods. Central to our approach is the verification of the finite entropy condition, which plays a pivotal role in solving the underlying utility maximization problems and establishing the martingale property and convex duality representation of the value processes. Through four distinct applications, we first study utility indifference valuation of financial derivatives with unbounded payoffs, uncovering novel asymptotic behavior as the risk aversion parameter approaches zero or infinity. Furthermore, we study the regime switching market model with unbounded random endowments and consumption-investment problems with unbounded random endowments, both constrained to portfolios chosen from a convex and closed set. Finally, we investigate investment-consumption problems involving an investor with Epstein-Zin recursive utility in an unbounded financial market.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of kernel learning FBSDE filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel learning forward backward SDE filter is an iterative and adaptive meshfree approach to solve the nonlinear filtering problem. It builds from forward backward SDE for Fokker-Planker equation, which defines evolving density for the state variable, and employs KDE to approximate density. This algorithm has shown more superior performance than mainstream particle filter method, in both convergence speed and efficiency of solving high dimension problems.
  However, this method has only been shown to converge empirically. In this paper, we present a rigorous analysis to demonstrate its local and global convergence, and provide theoretical support for its empirical results.</description>
