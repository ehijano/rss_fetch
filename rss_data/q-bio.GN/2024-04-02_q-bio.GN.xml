      <title>Guide to k-mer approaches for genomics across the tree of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wide array of currently available genomes display a wonderful diversity in size, composition and structure with many more to come thanks to several global biodiversity genomics initiatives starting in recent years. However, sequencing of genomes, even with all the recent advances, can still be challenging for both technical (e.g. small physical size, contaminated samples, or access to appropriate sequencing platforms) and biological reasons (e.g. germline restricted DNA, variable ploidy levels, sex chromosomes, or very large genomes). In recent years, k-mer-based techniques have become popular to overcome some of these challenges. They are based on the simple process of dividing the analysed sequences (e.g. raw reads or genomes) into a set of sub-sequences of length k, called k-mers. Despite this apparent simplicity, k-mer-based analysis allows for a rapid and intuitive assessment of complex sequencing datasets. Here, we provide the first comprehensive review to the theoretical properties and practical applications of k-mers in biodiversity genomics, serving as a reference manual for this powerful approach.</description>

      <title>The Rashomon Importance Distribution: Getting RID of Unstable, Single Model-based Variable Importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13775v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying variable importance is essential for answering high-stakes questions in fields like genetics, public policy, and medicine. Current methods generally calculate variable importance for a given model trained on a given dataset. However, for a given dataset, there may be many models that explain the target outcome equally well; without accounting for all possible explanations, different researchers may arrive at many conflicting yet equally valid conclusions given the same data. Additionally, even when accounting for all possible explanations for a given dataset, these insights may not generalize because not all good explanations are stable across reasonable data perturbations. We propose a new variable importance framework that quantifies the importance of a variable across the set of all good models and is stable across the data distribution. Our framework is extremely flexible and can be integrated with most existing model classes and global variable importance metrics. We demonstrate through experiments that our framework recovers variable importance rankings for complex simulation setups where other methods fail. Further, we show that our framework accurately estimates the true importance of a variable for the underlying data distribution. We provide theoretical guarantees on the consistency and finite sample error rates for our estimator. Finally, we demonstrate its utility with a real-world case study exploring which genes are important for predicting HIV load in persons with HIV, highlighting an important gene that has not previously been studied in connection with HIV.
