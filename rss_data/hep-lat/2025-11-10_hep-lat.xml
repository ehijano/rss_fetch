      <title>Unbiased Krylov subspace method for the extraction of ground state from lattice correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-state energy and matrix element are reconstructed from correlators in lattice QCD by diagonalizing transfer matrix $\hat{T}$ within the Krylov subspace spanned by $\hat{T}^n|\chi\rangle$, where $|\chi\rangle$ is a state generated by an interpolating field on the lattice. In numerical applications, this strategy is spoiled by statistical noise. To circumvent the problem, we introduce a low-rank approximation based on a singular-value decomposition of a matrix made of the correlators. The associated bias is eliminated by an extrapolation to the limit of vanishing variance of energy eigenvalue. The strategy is tested using a set of mock data as well as real data of $K$ and $D_s$ meson correlators.</description>

      <title>QCD in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study QCD on AdS space with scalars or fermions in the fundamental representation, extending earlier results on pure Yang-Mills theory. In the latter, the Dirichlet boundary condition is conjectured to disappear via merger and annihilation, as signaled by the lightest scalar singlet operator approaching marginality as the coupling increases. With matter, there are two candidate operators for this mechanism. We compute their one-loop anomalous dimensions via broken conformal Ward identities and Witten diagrams. In the confining phase, with Dirichlet (Neumann) boundary condition, their anomalous dimensions are negative (positive), consistent with the disappearance (persistence) of the associated boundary CFT in the flat-space limit. In the conformal window, one of these operators becomes the displacement operator of the IR CFT, as signaled by the vanishing of its one-loop anomalous dimension in the perturbative Banks-Zaks regime. Possible scenarios for the lower edge of the conformal window are discussed. Finally, we consider general boundary conditions on fermions and discuss their relation to chiral symmetry breaking in flat space.</description>

      <title>Three-loop QCD Mass Relation between the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ and Symmetric-momentum Subtraction Scheme Away from the Chiral Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The perturbative result for the quark-mass conversion factor between the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ and regularization-independent symmetric-momentum subtraction scheme (RI/SMOM) away from the chiral limit, i.e. at non-zero quark masses (RI/mSMOM), is derived up to three loops in QCD, extending the existing result by two additional orders. We further explore an illuminating possibility that in Dimensional Regularization, the original RI/(m)SMOM renormalization conditions may be interpreted merely in a weaker sense, namely as equations holding just in the 4-dimensional limit rather than exactly in $d$ dimensions: they result in different, albeit simpler, renormalization constants but still the same finite conversion factor. This novel observation has the added benefit of reducing computational effort, particularly at high orders. Our high-order results for the conversion factor exhibit rich behaviors, and in particular a window is observed in the subtraction scale and mass where it receives less perturbative corrections than the RI/SMOM counterpart up to three loops; this finding may help to further improve the accuracy of $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ quark-mass determinations with Lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Continuous matrix product operators for quantum fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce an ansatz for continuous matrix product operators for quantum field theory. We show that (i) they admit a closed-form expression in terms of finite number of matrix-valued functions without reference to any lattice parameter; (ii) they are obtained as a suitable continuum limit of matrix product operators; (iii) they preserve the entanglement area law directly in the continuum, and in particular they map continuous matrix product states (cMPS) to another cMPS. As an application, we use this ansatz to construct several families of continuous matrix product unitaries beyond quantum cellular automata.</description>
