      <title>Interpolation characterization of higher Thom polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thom polynomials provide universal formulas for the fundamental class of singularity loci in terms of characteristic classes. Ohmoto extended this notion to SSM-Thom polynomials, which refine this description by capturing the richer Segre-Schwartz-MacPherson (SSM) class of singularity loci. While previous methods for computing SSM-Thom polynomials relied on intricate geometric arguments, we introduce a more efficient approach that depends solely on the symmetries of singularities. Our method is inspired by connections to Geometric Representation Theory, particularly the interpolation properties of Maulik-Okounkov stable envelopes. By formulating SSM analogs of these axioms within a degree-bounded framework, we obtain new computational tools for SSM-Thom polynomials. We also present explicit examples of SSM-Thom polynomials, and illustrate their applications in enumerative geometry and singularity theory.</description>

      <title>On filtered algebraic $K$-theory of stacks I: characteristic zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact Lie group $G$ acting on a space $X$, the classical Atiyah-Segal completion theorem identifies topological $K$-theory of the homotopy quotient $X/G$ with an explicit completion of $G$-equivariant topological $K$-theory of $X$. We prove an analog of this result for algebraic $K$-theory over a field of characteristic 0. In our setting $G$ is a reductive group that acts on a derived algebraic space $X$ with the assumption that all stabilizer groups are nice (in the sense of Alper). Our main result identifies the value $R^{\mathrm{dAff}}K([X/G])$ of right Kan extension of the $K$-theory functor from schemes to stacks with the completion of $K$-theory of the category $\mathrm{Perf}([X/G])$ at the augmentation ideal of $K_0(\mathrm{Rep}(G))$. The main novelty of our results is that $X$ is allowed to be singular or even derived. This generality is achieved by employing and improving analogous versions of completion theorem for negative cyclic homology (after Ben-Zvi--Nadler and Chen) and for homotopy $K$-theory (after van den Bergh--Tabuada). We also show that in the singular setting the completion theorem does not necessarily hold without the nice stabilizer assumption. We view our results as a part of the general paradigm of extending the motivic filtration on algebraic $K$-theory of schemes to algebraic $K$-theory of stacks.</description>

      <title>On characteristic cycles of irregular holonomic D-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the recent progress in the irregular Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for holonomic D-modules, we show that the characteristic cycles of some standard irregular holonomic D-modules can be expressed as in the classical theorem of Ginsburg. For this purpose, we first prove a formula for the enhanced solution complexes of holonomic D-modules having a quasi-normal form, via which, to our surprise, their solution complexes can be calculated more easily by topological methods. In the formulation and the proof of our main theorems, not necessarily homogeneous Lagrangian cycles that we call irregular characteristic cycles will play a crucial role.</description>

      <title>The Iskovskih Theorem for regular surfaces over imperfect fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Iskovskih's theorem about surfaces without irregularity and bigenus from the smooth case to regular surfaces over arbitrary fields, with special focus on the case of imperfect fields. This includes surfaces that are geometrically non-normal or geometrically non-reduced. Here the usual approach of Galois descent breaks down, and one relies entirely on the scheme theory over the ground field. Moreover, the degrees of closed points can be larger than expected, and certain curves might have purely inseparable constant field extension. To deal with the latter we establish a general theory for inseparable pencils, which is of independent interest. A crucial case not present in the classical proof for Iskovskih's theorem leads to non-normal quartic surfaces that are singular along a twisted cubic, or more exotic space curves of degree three.</description>

      <title>The Bass--Quillen conjecture for torsors over valuation rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a valuation ring $V$, a smooth $V$-algebra $A$, and a reductive $V$-group scheme $G$ satisfying a certain natural isotropicity condition, we prove that every Nisnevich $G$-torsor on $\mathbb{A}^N_A$ descends to a $G$-torsor on $A$. As a corollary, we generalize Raghunathan's theorem on torsors over affine spaces to a relative setting. We also extend several affine representability results of Asok, Hoyois, and Wendt from equi-characteristics to mixed characteristics. Our proof relies on previous work on the purity of reductive torsors over smooth relative curves and the Grothendieck--Serre conjecture for constant reductive group schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is based on a talk given by the first author at the G\"okova Geometry \&amp; Topology conference in May 2024. The subject is an interplay between the ideas of tropical geometry and two-by-two matrices with an intention to explore new types of geometries. More concretely, the article gives a preliminary account for a non-abelian version of phase tropicalization for subvarieties of $PSL_2.$</description>

      <title>Liftability and vanishing theorems for Fano threefolds in positive characteristic I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our series of papers, we prove that smooth Fano threefolds in positive characteristic lift to the ring of Witt vectors. Moreover, we show that they satisfy Akizuki-Nakano vanishing, $E_1$-degeneration of the Hodge to de Rham spectral sequence, and torsion-freeness of Crystalline cohomologies. In this paper, we establish these results for the case when $|-K_X|$ is very ample and the Picard group is generated by $\omega_X$.</description>

      <title>Tight approximation for rationally simply connected varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that holomorphic maps from an open subset of a complex smooth projective curve to a complex smooth projective rationally simply connected variety can be approximated by algebraic maps for the compact-open topology. This theorem can be applied in particular when the target is a smooth hypersurface of degree d in P^n with n greater than or equal to d^2-1. We deduce it from a more general result: the tight approximation property holds for rationally simply connected varieties over function fields of complex curves.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial proofs of the type A quiver component formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The K-theoretic quiver component formula expresses the K-polynomial of a type A quiver locus as an alternating sum of products of double Grothendieck polynomials. This formula was conjectured by A. Buch and R. Rim\'anyi and later proved by R. Kinser, A. Knutson, and the second author. We provide a new proof of this formula which replaces Gr\"obner degenerations by combinatorics. Along the way, we obtain a new proof of A. Buch and R. Rim\'anyi's cohomological quiver component formula. Again, our proof replaces geometric techniques by combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle and topological Riemann-Roch theorem for circle fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the group $\mathcal G$ which is the semidirect product of the group of analytic functions with values in ${\mathbb C}^*$ on the circle and the group of analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle that preserve the orientation. Then we construct the central extensions of the group $\mathcal G$ by the group ${\mathbb C}^*$. The first central extension, so-called the determinant central extension, is constructed by means of determinants of linear operators acting in infinite-dimensional locally convex topological $\mathbb C$-vector spaces. Other central extensions are constructed by $\cup$-products of group $1$-cocycles with the application to them the map related with algebraic $K$-theory. We prove in the second cohomology group, i.e. modulo of a group $2$-coboundary, the equality of the $12$th power of the $2$-cocycle constructed by the first central extension and the product of integer powers of the $2$-cocycles constructed above by means of $\cup$-products (in multiplicative notation). As an application of this result we obtain the new topological Riemann-Roch theorem for a complex line bundle $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, where $\pi :M \to B$ is a fibration in oriented circles. More precisely, we prove that in the group $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ the element $12 \, [ {\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is equal to the element $6 \, \pi_* ( c_1(L) \cup c_1(L))$, where $[{\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is the class of the determinant gerbe on $B$ constructed by $L$ and the determinant central extension.</description>

      <title>A Simple Description of the Hyperk\"{a}hler Structure of the Cotangent Bundle of Projective Space via Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization identifies the cotangent bundle of projective space with the (non-Hermitian) rank-$1$ projections of a Hilbert space. We use this identification to study the natural geometric structures of these cotangent bundles and those of Grassmanians. In particular, we show that the quantization map is an isometric and complex embedding $T^*\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})\backslash\{0\}.$ Here, the metric on the domain is the hyperk\"{a}hler metric and the metric on the codomain is the one whose K\"{a}hler potential is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. The K\"{a}hler potential pulled back to $T^*\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}$ equals the trace-class norm. Using this, we give a complete, simple and explicit description of the hyperk\"{a}hler structure. Our constructions are functorial, coordinate-free and reduction-free.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}_{n,d} := \mathbb{R}[x_1$,$\ldots$, $x_n]_d$ be the set of all the homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$, and let $\mathcal{H}_{n,d}^s := \mathcal{H}_{n,d}^{\mathfrak{S}_n}$ be the subset of all the symmetric polynomials. For a semialgebraic subset of $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and a vector subspace $\mathcal{H} \subset \mathcal{H}_{n,d}$, we define a PSD cone $\mathcal{P}(A$, $\mathcal{H})$ by $\mathcal{P}(A$, $\mathcal{H}) := \big\{f \in \mathcal{H}$ $\big|$ $f(a) \geq 0$ ($\forall a \in A$)$\big\}$. In this article, we study a family of extremal symmetric polynomials of $\mathcal{P}_{3,6} := \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathcal{H}_{3,6})$ and that of $\mathcal{P}_{4,4} := \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^4$, $\mathcal{H}_{4,4})$. We also determine all the extremal polynomials of $\mathcal{P}_{3,5}^{s+} := \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}_+^3$, $\mathcal{H}_{3,5}^s)$ where $\mathbb{R}_+ := \big\{ x \in \mathbb{R}$, $x \geq 0 \big\}$. Some of them provide extremal polynomials of $\mathcal{P}_{3,10}$.</description>

      <title>New building blocks for $\mathbb{F}_1$-geometry: bands and band schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and study a generalization of commutative rings called bands, along with the corresponding geometric theory of band schemes. Bands generalize both hyperrings, in the sense of Krasner, and partial fields in the sense of Semple and Whittle. They from a ring-like counterpart to the field-like category of idylls introduced by the first and third author.
  The first part of the paper is dedicated to establishing fundamental properties of bands analogous to basic facts in commutative algebra. In particular, we introduce various kinds of ideals in a band and explore their properties, and we study localization, quotients, limits, and colimits.
  The second part of the paper studies band schemes. After giving the definition, we present some examples of band schemes, along with basic properties of band schemes and morphisms thereof, and we describe functors into some other scheme theories.
  In the third part, we discuss some ``visualizations'' of band schemes, which are different topological spaces that one can functorially associate to a band scheme $X$.</description>

      <title>Moduli of Cubic fourfolds and reducible OADP surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the intersection of the Hassett divisor $\mathcal C_8$, parametrizing smooth cubic fourfolds $X$ containing a plane $P$ with other divisors $\mathcal C_i$. Notably we study the irreducible components of the intersections with $\mathcal{C}_{12}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{20}$. These two divisors generically parametrize respectively cubics containing a smooth cubic scroll, and a smooth Veronese surface. First, we find all the irreducible components of the two intersections, and describe the geometry of the generic elements in terms of the intersection of $P$ with the other surface. Then we consider the problem of rationality of cubics in these components, either by finding rational sections of the quadric fibration induced by projection off $P$, or by finding examples of reducible one-apparent-double-point surfaces inside $X$. Finally, via some Macaulay computations, we give explicit equations for cubics in each component.</description>

Abstract: Given $n$ regular functions $f_1, \ldots, f_n$ on an $n$-dimensional variety $X$, and a subset $Z$ of $X$, we consider deformations of the set of zeroes of the $f_i$ of the form $f_1 - t^{r_1}g_1 = \cdots = f_n - t^{r_n}g_n = 0$ where the $g_i$ are generic, and study the number $N_Z$ of points which "move to" generic points of $Z$ as $t$ moves to $0$. We compute $N_Z$ in the case that each $r_i/r_{i+1} \gg 1$. This associates to every subvariety of $X$ an asymmetric variant of the dynamic intersection number defined by Lazarsfeld [Compos. Math. 43, 1981] a la Severi [Ann. Mat. Pura Appl. 26 (4), 1947]. We explicitly describe the "distinguished components" of this "ordered intersection" (i.e. all $Z$ such that $N_Z &gt; 0$), and give an explicit formula for $N_Z$ in terms of sums of products of various "degrees" of $Z$ (the "global" factors) and lengths of certain ideals in the local ring of $Z$ (the "local" factors). We also consider certain scenarios in which $N_Z$ can be computed in terms of associated Newton diagrams, and describe how these point towards inductive solutions to the "affine Bezout problem" of counting isolated solutions of systems of polynomials. To illustrate our methods we compute the number of common tangent lines to $4$ general spheres in the affine $3$-space (which is known to be 12 due to Macdonald, Pach, and Theobald [Discrete Comput. Geom. 26 (1), 2001]) via certain ordered intersection multiplicities on the corresponding Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Calabi-Yau Crystals in BPS States Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02792v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the counting problem of BPS D-branes wrapping holomorphic cycles of a general toric Calabi-Yau manifold. We evaluate the Jeffrey-Kirwan residues for the flavoured Witten index for the supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanics on the worldvolume of the D-branes, and find that BPS degeneracies are described by a statistical mechanical model of crystal melting. For Calabi-Yau threefolds, we reproduce the crystal melting models long known in the literature. For Calabi-Yau fourfolds, however, we find that the crystal does not contain the full information for the BPS degeneracy and we need to explicitly evaluate non-trivial weights assigned to the crystal configurations. Our discussions treat Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds on equal footing, and include discussions on elliptic and rational generalizations of the BPS states counting, connections to the mathematical definition of generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants, examples of wall crossings, and of trialities in quiver gauge theories.</description>

      <title>A Deligne conjecture for prestacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an analog of the Deligne conjecture for prestacks. We show that given a prestack $\mathbb A$, its Gerstenhaber--Schack complex $\mathbf{C}_{\mathsf{GS}}(\mathbb A)$ is naturally an $E_2$-algebra. This structure generalises both the known $\mathsf{L}_\infty$-algebra structure on $\mathbf{C}_{\mathsf{GS}}(\mathbb A)$, as well as the Gerstenhaber algebra structure on its cohomology $\mathbf{H}_{\mathsf{GS}}(\mathbb A)$. The main ingredient is the proof of a conjecture of Hawkins \cite{hawkins}, stating that the dg operad $\mathsf{Quilt}$ has vanishing homology in positive degrees. As a corollary, $\mathsf{Quilt}$ is quasi-isomorphic to the operad $\mathsf{Brace}$ encoding brace algebras. In addition, we improve the $L_\infty$-structure on $\mathsf{Quilt}$ by showing that it originates from a $\mathsf{PreLie}_\infty$-structure lifting the $\mathsf{PreLie}$-structure on $\mathsf{Brace}$ in homology.</description>

      <title>Is there a group structure on the Galois cohomology of a reductive group over a global field?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let K be a global field, that is, a number field or a global function field. It is known that the answer to the question in the title over K is "Yes" when K has no real embeddings. We show that otherwise the answer is "No". Namely, we show that when K is a number field admitting a real embedding, it is impossible to define a group structure on the first Galois cohomology sets H^1(K,G) for all reductive K-groups G in a functorial way.</description>

Abstract: We construct new examples of constant scalar curvature K\"{a}hler metrics on suitable resolutions of certain constant scalar curvature K\"{a}hler orbifolds with type I singularities, in the sense of Apostolov--Rollin, along a suborbifold of complex codimension greater than 2.</description>

      <title>Curvature, macroscopic dimensions, and symmetric products of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the curvature and symplectic asphericity properties of symmetric products of surfaces. We show that these spaces can be used to answer nuanced questions arising in the study of closed Riemannian manifolds with positive scalar curvature. For example, we prove that symmetric products of surfaces sharply distinguish between two distinct notions of macroscopic dimension introduced by Gromov and the second-named author. As a natural generalization of this circle of ideas, we address the Gromov--Lawson and Gromov conjectures in the Kaehler projective setting and draw new connections between the theories of the minimal model, positivity in algebraic geometry, and macroscopic dimensions.</description>
