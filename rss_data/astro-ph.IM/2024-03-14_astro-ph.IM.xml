      <title>Venus as an Anchor Point for Planetary Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major focus of the planetary science and astrobiology community is the understanding of planetary habitability, including the myriad factors that control the evolution and sustainability of temperate surface environments such as that of Earth. The few substantial terrestrial planetary atmospheres within the Solar System serve as a critical resource in studying these habitability factors, from which models can be constructed for application to extrasolar planets. The recent Astronomy and Astrophysics and Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Surveys both emphasise the need for an improved understanding of planetary habitability as an essential goal within the context of astrobiology. The divergence in climate evolution of Venus and Earth provides a major, accessible basis for understanding how the habitability of large rocky worlds evolves with time and what conditions limit the boundaries of habitability. Here, we argue that Venus can be considered an "anchor point" for understanding planetary habitability within the context of terrestrial planet evolution. We discuss the major factors that have influenced the respective evolutionary pathways of Venus and Earth, how these factors might be weighted in their overall influence, and the measurements that will shed further light on their impacts of these worlds' histories. We further discuss the importance of Venus with respect to both of the recent decadal surveys, and how these community consensus reports can help shape the exploration of Venus in the coming decades.</description>

      <title>JAXbind: Bind any function to JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JAX is widely used in machine learning and scientific computing, the latter of which often relies on existing high-performance code that we would ideally like to incorporate into JAX. Reimplementing the existing code in JAX is often impractical and the existing interface in JAX for binding custom code requires deep knowledge of JAX and its C++ backend. The goal of JAXbind is to drastically reduce the effort required to bind custom functions implemented in other programming languages to JAX. Specifically, JAXbind provides an easy-to-use Python interface for defining custom so-called JAX primitives that support arbitrary JAX transformations.</description>

      <title>PAPERCLIP: Associating Astronomical Observations and Natural Language with Multi-Modal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PAPERCLIP (Proposal Abstracts Provide an Effective Representation for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), a method which associates astronomical observations imaged by telescopes with natural language using a neural network model. The model is fine-tuned from a pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model using successful observing proposal abstracts and corresponding downstream observations, with the abstracts optionally summarized via guided generation using large language models (LLMs). Using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as an example, we show that the fine-tuned model embodies a meaningful joint representation between observations and natural language through tests targeting image retrieval (i.e., finding the most relevant observations using natural language queries) and description retrieval (i.e., querying for astrophysical object classes and use cases most relevant to a given observation). Our study demonstrates the potential for using generalist foundation models rather than task-specific models for interacting with astronomical data by leveraging text as an interface.</description>

      <title>Digitization of Astronomical Photographic Plate of China and Astrometric Measurement of Single-exposure Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the mid-19th century to the end of the 20th century, photographic plates served as the primary detectors for astronomical observations. Astronomical photographic observations in China began in 1901, and over a century, a total of approximately 30,000 astronomical photographic plates have been captured. These historical plates play an irreplaceable role in conducting long-term, time-domain astronomical research. To preserve and explore these valuable original astronomical observational data, Shanghai Astronomical Observatory has organized the transportation of plates taken at night from various stations across the country to the Sheshan Plate Archive for centralized preservation. For the first time, plate information statistics was performed. On this basis, the plates were cleaned and digitally scanned, and finally digitized images were acquired for 29,314 plates. In this study, using Gaia DR2 as the reference star catalog, astrometric processing has been carried out successfully on 15,696 single-exposure plates, including object extraction, stellar identification, and plate model computation. As a result, for long focal length telescopes, such as the 40cm double-tube refractor telescope and the 1.56m reflector telescope at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and the 1m reflector telescope at the Yunnan Astronomical Observatory, the astrometric accuracy obtained for their plates is approximately 0.1" to 0.3". The distribution of astrometric accuracy for medium and short focal length telescopes ranges from 0.3" to 1.0". The relevant data of this batch of plates, including digitized images and stellar catalog of the plates are archived and released by the National Astronomical Data Center. Users can access and download plate data based on keywords such as station, telescope, observation year, and observed celestial coordinates.</description>

      <title>HST astrometry of the closest Brown Dwarfs -- II. Improved parameters and constraints on a third body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Located at less than 2pc away, Luhman16AB (WISE.J104915.57-531906.1) is the closest pair of brown dwarfs and third closest `stellar' system to Earth. An exoplanet candidate in the Luhman16 binary system was reported in 2017 based on a weak astrometric signature in the analysis of 12 HST epochs. An additional epoch collected in 2018 and re-analysis of the data with more advanced methods further increased the significance level of the candidate, consistent with a Neptune-mass exoplanet orbiting one of the Luhman16 brown dwarf components. We report the joint analysis of these previous data together with two new astrometric HST epochs we obtained to confirm or disprove this astrometric signature. Our new analysis rules out presence of a planet orbiting one component of the Luhman16AB system for masses M &gt; 1.5 M_Nep (Neptune masses) and periods between 400 and 5000 days. However, the presence of third bodies with masses M &lt; 3 M_Nep and periods between 2 and 400 days (~1.1yrs) can not be excluded. Our measurements make significant improvements to the characterization of this sub-stellar binary, including its mass-ratio 0.8305+/-0.0006, individual component masses 35.4+/-0.2 M_Jup and 29.4+/-0.2 M_Jup (Jupiter masses), and parallax distance 1.9960pc +/- 50AU. Comparison of the masses and luminosities of Luhman16AB to several evolutionary models shows persistent discrepancies in the ages of the two components, but strengthens the case that this system is a member of the 510+/-95 Myr Oceanus Moving Group.</description>

      <title>Moving Towards Automated Interstellar Boundary Explorer Data Selection with LOTUS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) satellite collects data on energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) that provide insight into the heliosphere, the region surrounding our solar system and separating it from interstellar space. IBEX collects information on these particles and on extraneous ``background'' particles. While IBEX records how and when the different particles are observed, it does not distinguish between heliospheric ENA particles and incidental background particles. To address this issue, all IBEX data has historically been manually labeled as ``good'' ENA data, or ``bad'' background data. This manual culling process is incredibly time-intensive and contingent on subjective, manually-induced decision thresholds. In this paper, we develop a three-stage automated culling process, called LOTUS, that uses random forests to expedite and standardize the labelling process. In Stage 1, LOTUS uses random forests to obtain probabilities of observing true ENA particles on a per-observation basis. In Stage 2, LOTUS aggregates these probabilities to obtain predictions within small windows of time. In Stage 3, LOTUS refines these predictions. We compare the labels generated by LOTUS to those manually generated by the subject matter expert. We use various metrics to demonstrate that LOTUS is a useful automated process for supplementing and standardizing the manual culling process.</description>

      <title>CorrSim: A Multiwavelength Timing Observation Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.10337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the rapid variability of many astronomical objects is key to understanding the underlying processes at play. However, a combination of limited telescope availability, viewing constraints, and the unpredictable nature of many sources mean that obtaining data well-suited to this task can be tricky, especially when it comes to simultaneous multiwavelength observations. Researchers can often find themselves tuning observational parameters in real-time, or may realise later that their observation did not achieve their goals. Here, we present CorrSim, a program to aid planning of multiwavelength coordinated observations. CorrSim takes a model of a system (i.e. Power Spectra, Coherence, and Lags), and returns a simulated multiwavelength observation, including effects of noise, telescope parameters, and finite sampling. The goals of this are: (i) To simulate a potential observation (to inform decisions about its feasibility); (ii) To investigate how different Fourier models affect a system's variability (e.g. how altering the frequency-dependent lags between bands can affect data products like cross-correlation functions); and (iii) To simulate existing data and investigate its trustworthiness. We outline the methodology behind CorrSim, show how a variety of parameters (e.g. noise sources, observation length, and telescope choice) can affect data, and present examples of the software in action.</description>

      <title>SAGUARO: Time-domain Infrastructure for the Fourth Gravitational-wave Observing Run and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present upgraded infrastructure for Searches after Gravitational Waves Using ARizona Observatories (SAGUARO) during LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA's fourth gravitational-wave (GW) observing run (O4). These upgrades implement many of the lessons we learned after a comprehensive analysis of potential electromagnetic counterparts to the GWs discovered during the previous observing run. We have developed a new web-based target and observation manager (TOM) that allows us to coordinate sky surveys, vet potential counterparts, and trigger follow-up observations from one centralized portal. The TOM includes software that aggregates all publicly available information on the light curves and possible host galaxies of targets, allowing us to rule out potential contaminants like active galactic nuclei, variable stars, solar-system objects, and preexisting supernovae, as well as to assess the viability of any plausible counterparts. We have also upgraded our image-subtraction pipeline by assembling deeper reference images and training a new neural network-based real-bogus classifier. These infrastructure upgrades will aid coordination by enabling the prompt reporting of observations, discoveries, and analysis to the GW follow-up community, and put SAGUARO in an advantageous position to discover kilonovae in the remainder of O4 and beyond. Many elements of our open-source software stack have broad utility beyond multimessenger astronomy, and will be particularly relevant in the "big data" era of transient discoveries by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Differentiable and accelerated wavelet transforms on the sphere and ball</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Directional wavelet dictionaries are hierarchical representations which efficiently capture and segment information across scale, location and orientation. Such representations demonstrate a particular affinity to physical signals, which often exhibit highly anisotropic, localised multiscale structure. Many physically important signals are observed over spherical domains, such as the celestial sky in cosmology. Leveraging recent advances in computational harmonic analysis, we design new highly distributable and automatically differentiable directional wavelet transforms on the $2$-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ and $3$-dimensional ball $\mathbb{B}^3 = \mathbb{R}^+ \times \mathbb{S}^2$ (the space formed by augmenting the sphere with the radial half-line). We observe up to a $300$-fold and $21800$-fold acceleration for signals on the sphere and ball, respectively, compared to existing software, whilst maintaining 64-bit machine precision. Not only do these algorithms dramatically accelerate existing spherical wavelet transforms, the gradient information afforded by automatic differentiation unlocks many data-driven analysis techniques previously not possible for these spaces. We publicly release both S2WAV and S2BALL, open-sourced JAX libraries for our transforms that are automatically differentiable and readily deployable both on and over clusters of hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs &amp; TPUs).</description>

Abstract: Networks of ground stations designed to transmit and receive at optical wavelengths through the atmosphere offer an opportunity to provide on-demand, high-bandwidth, secure communications with spacecraft in Earth orbit and beyond. This work describes the operation and activities of current Free Space Optical Communication (FSOC) ground stations in Germany and Australasia. In Germany, FSOC facilities are located at the Oberpfaffenhofen campus of the Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Aerospace Center, DLR), the Laser-Bodenstation in Trauen (Responsive Space Cluster Competence Center, DLR), and the Research Center Space of the University of the Bundeswehr Munich in Neubiberg. The DLR also operates a ground station in Almeria, Spain as part of the European Optical Nucleus Network. The Australasian Optical Ground Station Network (AOGSN) is a proposed network of 0.5 -- 0.7m class optical telescopes located across Australia and New Zealand. The development and progress for each node of the AOGSN is reported, along with optimisation of future site locations based on cloud cover analysis.</description>

      <title>Fast emulation of anisotropies induced in the cosmic microwave background by cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are linear topological defects that may have been produced during symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the very early Universe. In an expanding Universe the existence of causally separate regions prevents such symmetries from being broken uniformly, with a network of cosmic string inevitably forming as a result. To faithfully generate observables of such processes requires computationally expensive numerical simulations, which prohibits many types of analyses. We propose a technique to instead rapidly emulate observables, thus circumventing simulation. Emulation is a form of generative modelling, often built upon a machine learning backbone. End-to-end emulation often fails due to high dimensionality and insufficient training data. Consequently, it is common to instead emulate a latent representation from which observables may readily be synthesised. Wavelet phase harmonics are an excellent latent representations for cosmological fields, both as a summary statistic and for emulation, since they do not require training and are highly sensitive to non-Gaussian information. Leveraging wavelet phase harmonics as a latent representation, we develop techniques to emulate string induced CMB anisotropies over a 7.2 degree field of view, with sub-arcminute resolution, in under a minute on a single GPU. Beyond generating high fidelity emulations, we provide a technique to ensure these observables are distributed correctly, providing a more representative ensemble of samples. The statistics of our emulations are commensurate with those calculated on comprehensive Nambu-Goto simulations. Our findings indicate these fast emulation approaches may be suitable for wide use in, e.g., simulation based inference pipelines. We make our code available to the community so that researchers may rapidly emulate cosmic string induced CMB anisotropies for their own analysis.</description>

      <title>LimberJack.jl: auto-differentiable methods for angular power spectra analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08306v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present LimberJack.jl, a fully auto-differentiable code for cosmological analyses of 2 point auto- and cross-correlation measurements from galaxy clustering, CMB lensing and weak lensing data written in Julia. Using Julia's auto-differentiation ecosystem, LimberJack.jl can obtain gradients for its outputs up to an order of magnitude faster than traditional finite difference methods. This makes LimberJack.jl greatly synergistic with gradient-based sampling methods, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, capable of efficiently exploring parameter spaces with hundreds of dimensions. We first prove LimberJack.jl's reliability by reanalysing the DES Y1 3$\times$2-point data. We then showcase its capabilities by using a O(100) parameters Gaussian Process to reconstruct the cosmic growth from a combination of DES Y1 galaxy clustering and weak lensing data, eBOSS QSO's, CMB lensing and redshift-space distortions. Our Gaussian process reconstruction of the growth factor is statistically consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM Planck 2018 prediction at all redshifts. Moreover, we show that the addition of RSD data is extremely beneficial to this type of analysis, reducing the uncertainty in the reconstructed growth factor by $20\%$ on average across redshift. LimberJack.jl is a fully open-source project available on Julia's general repository of packages and GitHub.</description>

      <title>Efficient parameter inference for gravitational wave signals in the presence of transient noises using temporal and time-spectral fusion normalizing flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Glitches represent a category of non-Gaussian and transient noise that frequently intersects with gravitational wave (GW) signals, exerting a notable impact on the processing of GW data. The inference of GW parameters, crucial for GW astronomy research, is particularly susceptible to such interference. In this study, we pioneer the utilization of temporal and time-spectral fusion normalizing flow for likelihood-free inference of GW parameters, seamlessly integrating the high temporal resolution of the time domain with the frequency separation characteristics of both time and frequency domains. Remarkably, our findings indicate that the accuracy of this inference method is comparable to traditional non-glitch sampling techniques. Furthermore, our approach exhibits greater efficiency, boasting processing times on the order of milliseconds. In conclusion, the application of normalizing flow emerges as pivotal in handling GW signals affected by transient noises, offering a promising avenue for enhancing the field of GW astronomy research.</description>

Abstract: We have performed a comprehensive study of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) combining the photometric data obtained by the two \textit{HST} Treasury programs that targeted this region. To consistently analyze the rich dataset obtained in a wide variety of filters, we adopted a Bayesian approach to fit the Spectral Energy Distribution of the sources, deriving mass, age, extinction, distance, and accretion for each source in the region. The three dimensional study of mass distribution for bona-fide cluster members shows that mass segregation in the ONC extends to sub-solar masses, while the age distribution strongly supports the idea that star formation in the ONC is best described by a major episode of star formation that happened $\sim 1$ Myr ago. For masses $\gtrsim 0.1$ \Msun, our derived empirical initial mass function (IMF) is in good agreement with a Chabrier system IMF. Both the accretion luminosity (\Lacc) and mass accretion rates (\dMacc) are best described by broken power-law relations. This suggests that for the majority of young circumstellar disks in this cluster the excess emission may be dominated by X-ray-driven photoevaporation by the central star rather than external photoevaporation. If this is the case, the slopes of the power-law relations may be largely determined by the initial conditions set at the onset of the star formation process, which may be quite similar between regions that eventually form clusters of different sizes.</description>
