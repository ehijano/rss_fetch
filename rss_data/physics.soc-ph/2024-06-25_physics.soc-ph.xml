      <title>The hidden architecture of connections: How do multidimensional identities shape our social networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our multidimensional identities determine how we interact with each other, shaping social networks through group-based connection preferences. While interactions along single dimensions have been extensively studied, the dynamics driving multidimensional connection preferences remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a network model of multidimensional social interactions to tackle two crucial questions: What is the structure of our latent connection preferences, and how do we integrate information from our multidimensional identities to connect with others? To answer these questions, we systematically model different latent preference structures and preference aggregation mechanisms. Then, we compare them using Bayesian model selection by fitting empirical data from high school friendship networks. We find that a simple latent preference model consistently outperforms more complex alternatives. The calibrated model provides robust measures of latent connection preferences in real-world networks, bringing insights into how one- and multidimensional groups interact. Finally, we develop natural operationalizations of dimension salience, revealing which aspects of identity are most relevant for individuals when forming connections.</description>

      <title>Echo chamber effects in signed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Echo chamber effects in social networks are generally attributed to the prevalence of interactions among like-minded peers. However, recent evidence has emphasized the role of hostile interactions between opposite-minded groups. Here, we model information propagation between such groups by generalizing popular contagion models to signed networks. We show that echo chambers spontaneously emerge in balanced networks, and in antibalanced ones for specific parameters. The robustness of our results is confirmed through simulations on various network topologies, including a real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>A Weighted-Median Model of Opinion Dynamics on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social interactions influence people's opinions. In some situations, these interactions result in a consensus opinion; in others, they result in opinion fragmentation and the formation of different opinion groups in the form of "echo chambers". Consider a social network of individuals, who hold continuous-valued scalar opinions and change their opinions when they interact with each other. In such an opinion model, it is common for an opinion-update rule to depend on the mean opinion of interacting individuals. However, we consider an alternative update rule - which may be more realistic in some situations - that instead depends on a weighted median opinion of interacting individuals. Through numerical simulations of our opinion model, we investigate how the limit opinion distribution depends on network structure. For configuration-model networks, we also derive a mean-field approximation for the asymptotic dynamics of the opinion distribution when there are infinitely many individuals in a network.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal statistical features of velocity responses to traffic congestions in a local motorway network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The causal connection between congestions and velocity changes at different locations induces various statistical features, which we identify and measure in detail. We carry out an empirical analysis of large-scale traffic data on a local motorway network around the Breitscheid intersection in the North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. We put forward a response function which measures the velocity change at a certain location versus time conditioned on a congestion at another location. We use a novel definition of the corresponding congestion indicator to ensure causality. We find that the response of velocities to the congestion exhibits phase changes in time. A negative response at smaller time lags transforms into positive one at larger time lags, implying a certain traffic mechanism. The response decays as a power law with the distance. We also identify a scaling property leading to a collapse of the response functions on one curve.</description>

      <title>Connectivity and Community Structure of Online and Register-based Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominance of online social media data as a source of population-scale social network studies has recently been challenged by networks constructed from government-curated register data. In this paper, we investigate how the two compare, focusing on aggregations of the Dutch online social network (OSN) Hyves and a register-based social network (RSN) of the Netherlands. First and foremost, we find that the connectivity of the two population-scale networks is strikingly similar, especially between closeby municipalities, with more long-distance ties captured by the OSN. This result holds when correcting for population density and geographical distance, notwithstanding that these two patterns appear to be the main drivers of connectivity. Second, we show that the community structure of neither network follows strict administrative geographical delineations (e.g., provinces). Instead, communities appear to either center around large metropolitan areas or, outside of the country's most urbanized area, are comprised of large blocks of interdependent municipalities. Interestingly, beyond population and distance-related patterns, communities also highlight the persistence of deeply rooted historical and sociocultural communities based on religion. The results of this study suggest that both online social networks and register-based social networks are valuable resources for insights into the social network structure of an entire population.</description>

      <title>Testing network clustering algorithms with Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of online social networks has led to the development of an abundant literature on the study of online social groups and their relationship to individuals' personalities as revealed by their textual productions. Social structures are inferred from a wide range of social interactions. Those interactions form complex -- sometimes multi-layered -- networks, on which community detection algorithms are applied to extract higher order structures. The choice of the community detection algorithm is however hardily questioned in relation with the cultural production of the individual they classify. In this work, we assume the entangled nature of social networks and their cultural production to propose a definition of cultural based online social groups as sets of individuals whose online production can be categorized as social group-related. We take advantage of this apparently self-referential description of online social groups with a hybrid methodology that combines a community detection algorithm and a natural language processing classification algorithm. A key result of this analysis is the possibility to score community detection algorithms using their agreement with the natural language processing classification. A second result is that we can assign the opinion of a random user at &gt;85% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Ranking nodes in bipartite systems with a non-linear iterative map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method based on a non-linear iterative map to evaluate node relevance in bipartite networks. By tuning a single parameter gamma, the method captures different concepts of node importance, including established measures like degree centrality, eigenvector centrality and the fitness-complexity ranking used in economics. The algorithm's flexibility allows for efficient ranking optimization tailored to specific tasks. As an illustrative example, we apply this method to ecological mutualistic networks, where ranking quality can be assessed by the extinction area - the rate at which the system collapses when species are removed in a certain order. The map with the optimal gamma value, which is dataset-specific, surpasses existing ranking methods on this task. Additionally, our method excels in evaluating nestedness, another crucial structural property of ecological systems, requiring specific node rankings. The final part of the paper explores the theoretical aspects of the map, revealing a phase transition at a critical $\gamma$ value dependent on the data structure that can be characterized analytically for random networks. Near the critical point, the map exhibits unique features and a distinctive triangular packing pattern of the adjacency matrix.</description>

      <title>Math behind everyday life: on emergence of "black days" and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our daily lives, we encounter numerous independent events, each occurring with varying probabilities over time. This letter delves into the scientific background behind the inhomogeneous distribution of these events over time, often resulting in what we refer to as "black days", where multiple events seem to converge at once. In the first part of the work we performed an analysis involving $D$ independent periodic and random sequences of events. Employing the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) technique, we observed a clustering of sequences of events on a 2D manifold ${\cal M}$ at some large $D_{cr}$, which we interpret as the manifestation of "black days" and which occurs in a narrow interval around $D_{cr}$. We found that increasing the number of sequences within rather wide interval below $D_{cr}$ leads to a plateau in the clustering on ${\cal M}$. In the second part of the work we examined in detail clustering patterns of independently distributed $N$ points within the corners of a $D$-dimensional cube when $1\ll N&lt;D$. Our findings revealed that a transition to a single-component cluster occurs at a critical dimensionality, $D_{cr}$, via a nearly third-order phase transition. Finally, we have addressed the question "How the infinite-dimensional space could look like?" Considering the eigenvalue problem for the hyperspherical Laplacian $\nabla^2_D$ in the limit $D\to\infty$, we conjectured about the topology of a target space representing the hyperspherical layer.</description>

      <title>Rate of epidemic spreading on complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial phase of an epidemic is often characterised by an exponential increase in the number of infected individuals. In a well-mixed population, this exponential increase is controlled by the basic reproduction number R0 and the distribution of times between consecutive infection along an infection chain. However, real populations are characterised by a complex network of interactions, and are thus far from being well mixed. Here, we derive an expression for the rate of exponential spread of an epidemic on a complex network. We find that this rate is affected by the degree distribution, the network assortativity, and the level of clustering. Our result holds for a broad range of networks, apart from networks with very broad degree distribution, where no clear exponential regime is present. The theory presented in this paper bridges the gap between classic epidemiology and the theory of complex network, with broad implications for model inference and policy making.</description>

      <title>Optimal Verification of Rumors in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the diffusion of a true and a false message when agents are biased and able to verify messages. As a recipient of a rumor who verifies it becomes informed of the truth, a higher rumor prevalence can increase the prevalence of the truth. We uncover conditions such that this happens and discuss policy implications. Specifically, a planner aiming to maximize the prevalence of the truth should allow rumors to circulate if: verification overcomes ignorance of messages, transmission of information is relatively low, and the planner's budget to induce verification is neither too low nor too high.</description>

      <title>Breaking Consensus in Kinetic Opinion Formation Models on Graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose and investigate a strategy to prevent consensus in kinetic models for opinion formation. We consider a large interacting agent system, and assume that agent interactions are driven by compromise as well as self-thinking dynamics and also modulated by an underlying static social network. This network structure is included using so-called graphons, which modulate the interaction frequency in the corresponding kinetic formulation. We then derive the corresponding limiting Fokker Planck equation, and analyze its large time behavior. This microscopic setting serves as a starting point for the proposed control strategy, which steers agents away from mean opinion and is characterised by a suitable penalization depending on the properties of the graphon. We show that this minimalist approach is very effective by analyzing the quasi-stationary solutions mean-field model in a plurality of graphon structures. Several numerical experiments are also provided to show the effectiveness of the approach in preventing the formation of consensus steering the system towards a declustered state.</description>
