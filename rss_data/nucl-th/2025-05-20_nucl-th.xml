      <title>Probing Nuclear Geometry through Multi-Particle Azimuthal Correlations and Rapidity-Even Dipolar Flow in ${}^{16}$O+${}^{16}$O Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study symmetric and asymmetric cumulants as well as rapidity-even dipolar flow in ${}^{16}$O+${}^{16}$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$~GeV to explore $\alpha$-clustering phenomena in light nuclei within the viscous relativistic hydrodynamics framework. Signatures of $\alpha$-clustering manifest in the anisotropic flow coefficients and their correlations -- particularly in observables involving elliptic-triangular flow correlations. We show that final-state symmetric and asymmetric cumulants -- especially $\mathrm{NSC}(2,3)$ and $\mathrm{NAC}_{2,1}(2,3)$ -- are sensitive to the initial nuclear geometry. Additionally, we observe a significant difference in rapidity-even dipolar flow, $v_1^{\text{even}}$, between $\alpha$-clustered and Woods--Saxon configurations in high-multiplicity events. These findings underscore the pivotal role of nuclear structure in heavy-ion collision dynamics and provide observables for distinguishing nuclear geometries, particularly in ultra-central collisions.</description>

      <title>On the symmetry energy expansion and the peak value of the bulk viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetry energy expansion is a useful way to parameterize the properties of dense matter near nuclear saturation density, and much work has been done to connect physical quantities like the neutron star radius and the core-crust transition density to the symmetry energy parameters. In this work, I connect the weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity in neutron-proton-electron ($npe$) matter to the symmetry parameters by calculating the susceptibilities of dense matter in terms of the symmetry energy. I use this result to calculate the resonant-peak value of the bulk viscosity as a function of density, finding that it strongly depends on $L$, as does the minimum bulk-viscous dissipation timescale. Also resulting from this calculation is a formula for finding the conformal points of the zero-temperature equation of state. Finally, I determine for which values of the symmetry parameters the maximum r-mode stable rotation frequency of an $npe$-matter neutron star is smaller than the Kepler frequency, in the high-temperature conditions where bulk viscosity is the dominant dissipation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Approach to nuclear cross sections via classical Skyrmion scattering: A proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analogy with heavy ion collisions, which can be modelled by a classical hydrodynamics, it is proposed that the differential cross section for collisions of smaller nuclei can be calculated from the classical, numerical scattering data for Skyrmions. It is also suggested that the numerical data for the outgoing particles should be classified into bins, as is done in nuclear physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Three-nucleon contact forces in the Jacobi partial-wave basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the three-nucleon contact potentials in the Jacobi partial-wave basis. The potentials are built in the separable form as the products of the antisymmetrized three-nucleon states in which the nucleons are arbitrarily close to each other. We compile the three-nucleon contact potentials up to $\mathcal{O}(Q^2)$. These contact potentials are by construction independent operators under exchanges of any nucleon pairs.</description>

      <title>Study of the hottest droplet of fluid through correlations and fluctuations of collective variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we focus on the fluctuations and correlations of the collective observables such as the mean transverse momentum per particle ($[p_T]$) and harmonic flow coefficients ($v_n$) of particles produced in the ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC. Specifically, we show that the fluctuations of harmonic flow can be probed by the factorization-breaking coefficients between flow vectors in different $p_T$-bins. Experimental difficulty can be reduced by taking one of the flow vectors momentum averaged. Fluctuations cause a decorrelation between the flow vectors, which can be attributed to equal contributions from the flow magnitude and flow angle decorrelation. We study fluctuations of mean transverse momentum per particle ($[p_T]$) in ultra-central collisions and show that our model can explain the steep fall of its variance observed by the ATLAS collaboration. We also present robust predictions for the skewness and kurtosis, and highlight the role of impact parameter fluctuations in ultracentral collisions. We study the Pearson correlation coefficients between $[p_T]$ and $v_n^2$, which can map the initial state correlations between the shape and size of the fireball. We show that higher order normalized and symmetric cumulants between these observables can be constructed, which put useful additional constraints on the initial state properties. Furthermore, we study the momentum dependent Pearson correlation between $[p_T]$ and the transverse momentum dependent flow. It shows sensitivity to the Gaussian width of the nucleon at the initial state. Finally, we show that such correlations and fluctuations of collective observables can be used to study nuclear deformation and put robust constraints on their deformation parameters through high energy nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Correlation between U/Th and Pb/Os abundance ratios and its application in nuclear cosmochronology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abundance ratios of radioactive elements U/Th and stable elements Pb/Os from the $r$-process are found to have a strong correlation. This correlation is quite robust with respect to astrophysical conditions. The U/Th-Pb/Os correlation is then applied to provide customized initial abundance ratios U/Th from the observed abundance ratios Pb/Os for six $r$-process enhanced metal-poor stars respectively. Ages of these six metal-poor stars are predicted by the U/Th chronometer, which are approximately between $11$ and $15$ Gyr. Their ages are compatible with the cosmic age of 13.8 billion years predicted from the cosmic microwave background radiation.</description>

      <title>Nucleon-nucleon correlation functions from different interactions in comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlation functions as they can be observed in heavy-ion collisions using the femtoscopy technique are a powerful tool to study the interaction among different baryons or mesons. Specifically, the multi-nucleon correlation functions have been under intense experimental and theoretical investigation in the recent years. Due to the interest of using this observable as an input in the construction of potentials between hadrons we revisit the nucleon-nucleon correlation function and calculate it using different nuclear interactions at high precision. Since the nucleon-nucleon potential is determined to reproduce the two-nucleon scattering data, we would like to critically evaluate the amount of this information captured by the correlation function. We study the dependence of the correlations on the nuclear force giving detailed insights into the calculations, in particular the convergence behavior in the partial waves. The coupling between the different partial-wave channels is taken into account and the relevance of this effect is quantified. To make contact with precedent studies the results based on the Argonne V18 interaction are presented. Then we consider also the Norfolk NV2-IIa and NV2-IIb chiral EFT interactions. The analysis of the differences between the correlations of the various interactions shows that for momenta between 0 and 500 MeV there are variations of up to 5.9 % for the $nn$ system, of up to 1.8 % for the $np$ system, and of 1.4 % for the $pp$ system.</description>

      <title>On Robust $\beta$-Spectra Shape Parameter Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental extraction of $\beta$-shape functions, C(W), is challenging. Comparing different experimental $\beta$-shapes to each other and to those predicted by theory in a consistent manner is difficult. This difficulty is compounded when different parameterizations of the $\beta$-shape function are used. Usually some form of a power polynomial of the total electron energy is chosen for this parametrization. This choice results in extracted coefficients that are highly correlated, with their physical meaning and numerical value dependent on the order of polynomial chosen. This is true for both theoretical and experimental coefficients, and leads to challenges when comparing coefficients from polynomials of different orders. Accurately representing the highly correlated uncertainties is difficult and subtle. These issues impact the underlying physical interpretation of shape function parameters. We suggest an alternative approach based on orthogonal polynomials. Orthogonal polynomials offer more stable coefficient extraction which is less dependent on the order of the polynomial, allow for easier comparison between theory and experimental coefficients from polynomials of different orders, and offer some observations on simple physical meaning and on the statistical limits of the extracted coefficients.</description>

      <title>Unbound neutron $\nu0d_{3/2}$ strength in $^{17}$C and the N=16 shell gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant continuum strength has been observed to be populated in $^{17}$C produced in the d($^{16}$C,p) reaction at a beam energy of 17.2~MeV/nucleon. The strength appears at greater than $\sim$2~MeV above the single-neutron decay threshold and has been identified as arising from transfer into the neutron $0d_{3/2}$ orbital. Guided by shell model predictions the greater majority of the strength is associated with a 3/2$^+$ state at an excitation energy of 4.40$_{-0.14}^{+0.33}$ MeV and a much weaker 3/2$^+$ level at 5.60$_{-0.45}^{+1.35}$ MeV. The corresponding total widths were determined to be 3.45$_{-0.78}^{+1.82}$ and 1.6$_{-1.4}^{+4.6}$ MeV, respectively. From the backward angle proton differential cross sections and the branching ratios for neutron decay to the $^{16}$C(2$_{1}^{+}$) level, the corresponding spectroscopic factors to the ground state were deduced to be 0.47$\pm{10}$ and $&lt;$0.09. Shell-model calculations employing the phenomenological SFO-tls interaction as well as Gamow Shell-Model calculations including continuum effects are in reasonable agreement with experiment, although the predicted strength lies at somewhat lower energy. The size of the N=16 shell gap ($\varepsilon_{ \nu0d_{3/2}}-\varepsilon _{\nu 1s_{1/2}}$) was estimated to be 5.08$_{-0.33}^{+0.43}$~MeV - some 1.3~MeV larger than found in the SFO-tls shell model calculation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the spectroscopic features of double-strangeness tetraquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the $T_{cc}$ double-charm tetaquark by the LHCb collaboration, the field of the theoretical research on heavy quarks has advanced rapidly, with increasing interest in exploring the light quark sector. In this study, the quark model is employed to systematically analyze the double-strange tetraquark system. Both the meson-meson configuration and diquark-antidiquark configuration are considered. The interactions between hadron pairs under various quantum numbers, as well as the possibilities of bound states and resonances, are evaluated. The results indicate the presence of two bound states, $ \bar{K}^{\ast }\bar{K}$ and $\bar{K}^{\ast }\bar{K}^{\ast}$, with quantum number $I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})$ in single-channel estimations. Additionally, by considering the channel coupling between the two configurations, a bound state with quantum numbers $I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})$ and a mass of approximately $1310$ MeV is obtained. Moreover, through the application of Resonance Ground Method, a resonance state is identified in the $I(J^{P})=0(1^{+})$ $\ssqq$ system, with an estimated mass of around 1783 MeV and a decay width of approximately 17 MeV.</description>

      <title>Basis light-front quantization approach to deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the deuteron's wave functions as eigenstates of the light-front quantum chromodynamics (QCD) Hamiltonian using a fully relativistic and nonperturbative approach based on light-front quantization, without an explicit confining potential. These eigenstates include six-quark and six-quark--one-gluon components. The deuteron wave function consists of both a singlet-singlet color state and additional hidden color states arising from non-trivial color rearrangements. Our results reveal that while the singlet-singlet state is present, the hidden color states collectively dominate, contributing a larger probability to the deuteron wave function. This highlights the significant role of hidden color components in the QCD description of nuclear structure. Using these wave functions, we investigate the deuteron's electromagnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Emulators for scarce and noisy data: application to auxiliary field diffusion Monte Carlo for the deuteron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The validation, verification, and uncertainty quantification of computationally expensive theoretical models of quantum many-body systems require the construction of fast and accurate emulators. In this work, we develop emulators for auxiliary field diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC), a powerful many-body method for nuclear systems. We introduce a reduced-basis method (RBM) emulator for AFDMC and study it in the simple case of the deuteron. Furthermore, we compare our RBM emulator with the recently proposed parametric matrix model (PMM) that combines elements of RBMs with machine learning. We contrast these two approaches with a traditional Gaussian Process emulator. All three emulators constructed here are based on a very limited set of 5 training points, as expected for realistic AFDMC calculations, but validated against $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ exact solutions. We find that the PMM, with emulator errors of only $\approx 0.1 \%$ and speed-up factors of $\approx 10^7$, outperforms our implementation of the other two emulators when applied to AFDMC.</description>

      <title>General features of the stellar matter equation of state from microscopic theory, new maximum-mass constraints, and causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The profile of a neutron star probes a very large range of densities, from the density of iron up to several times the density of saturated nuclear matter, and thus no theory of hadrons can be considered reliable if extended to those regions. We emphasize the importance of taking contemporary ab initio theories of nuclear and neutron matter as the baseline for any extension method, which will unavoidably involve some degree of phenomenology. We discuss how microscopic theory, on the one end, with causality and maximum-mass constraints, on the other, set strong boundaries to the high-density equation of state. We present our latest neutron star predictions where we combine polytropic extensions and parametrizations guided by speed of sound considerations. The predictions we show include our baseline neutron star cooling curves.</description>

      <title>A "breathing'' octupole $^{208}$Pb nucleus: resolving the elliptical-to-triangular azimuthal anisotropy puzzle in ultracentral relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic heavy ion collisions provide a unique opportunity to probe the nuclear structure by taking an instantaneous snapshot of the colliding nuclei and converting it into momentum anisotropies of final emitted hadrons. A long-standing puzzle of too large a ratio of the elliptical-to-triangular ($v_{2}$-to-$v_{3}$) anisotropies in ultracentral $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider(LHC) cannot be solved simply by hydrodynamic simulations with initial conditions containing the spherical or certain deformed shape of $^{208}$Pb. In this Letter, using the iEBE-VISHNU relativistic viscous hydrodynamic hybrid model simulations with the Trento initial condition, we show that a dynamic octupole deformation--a shape-breathing of $^{208}$Pb --could potentially solve the $v_{2}$-to-$v_{3}$ puzzle and simultaneously describe the $v_3\{4\}$ data measured in experiment. Our results highlight the unique capability of capturing transient collective properties of nuclei on yoctosecond ($10^{-24}$~s) timescales, unfeasible with low-energy nuclear reactions.</description>

      <title>Gluonic contributions to the pion parton distribution functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of a dynamical gluon in the pion within the Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) framework and compare it with the solution of the Minkowski space Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), focusing on contributions beyond the valence sector. We develop a framework to compute the quark-antiquark-gluon component of the pion, starting from its valence light-front wave function. Additionally, the quark and gluon parton distribution functions (PDFs) are derived by considering this higher Fock component in the pion state. The proposed operator, which acts on the valence state to produce the quark-antiquark-gluon component of the pion, is tested against results from BLFQ for its contribution to the quark and gluon PDFs, as well as with results from the BSE. In the BLFQ framework, we identify the effect of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking on the pion structure through the enhancement of the spin-flip matrix element. This enhancement is captured in the $|q\bar{q}g\rangle$ component of the light-front wave function and the associated gluon PDF. We explicitly demonstrate an enhancement of the low-$x$ contribution in the quark PDF, which is associated with the large spin-flip matrix element, which also drives the $\pi-\rho$ mass splitting. The proposed framework also enables an exploration of the effect of the dressed gluon mass for a given valence state at the pion scale. We show that when the gluon mass vanishes, departing from the constituent gluon picture, it has a significant impact on the gluon PDF.</description>

      <title>Explaining Snowball-in-hell Phenomena in Heavy-ion Collisions Using a Novel Thermodynamic Variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03935v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A loosely bound hadronic molecule produced by a relativistic heavy-ion collision has been described as a ``snowball in hell'' since it emerges from a hadron resonance gas whose temperature is orders of magnitude larger than the binding energy of the molecule. This remarkable phenomenon can be explained in terms of a novel thermodynamic variable called the ``contact'' that is conjugate to the binding momentum of the molecule. The production rate of the molecule can be expressed in terms of the contact density at the kinetic freezeout of the hadron resonance gas. It approaches a nonzero limit as the binding energy goes to 0.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Function of a Deuteron-like Dibaryon System from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a lattice QCD calculation of the parton distribution function (PDF) of a deuteron-like dibaryon system using large-momentum effective theory. The calculation is done on three Wilson Clover ensembles with a fixed lattice spacing a=0.105 fm and two pion masses. The lattice matrix elements are computed at proton momenta up to 2.46 GeV with the signal of high momentum modes being improved by applying the momentum smearing technique. The state-of-the-art renormalization, matching and extrapolation are then applied to obtain the final result of the light-cone PDF. A comparison between the result of the dibaryon system and the sum of the proton and neutron PDFs is also given.</description>

      <title>Far-from-equilibrium attractors with Full Relativistic Boltzmann approach in 3+1 D: moments of distribution function and anisotropic flows $v_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the Full Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach for a conformal system in 3+1D to study the universal behaviour in moments of the distribution function and anisotropic flows. We investigate different transverse system sizes $R$ and interaction strength $\eta/s$ and identify universality classes based upon the interplay between $R$ and the mean free path; we show that each of this classes can be identified by a particular value of the opacity $\hat \gamma$, which has been previously introduced in literature. Our results highlight that, at early times, the inverse Reynolds number and momentum moments of the distribution function display universal behaviour, converging to a 1D attractor driven by longitudinal expansion. This indicates that systems of different sizes and interaction strengths tend to approach equilibrium in a similar manner. We provide a detailed analysis of how the onset of transverse flow affects these moments at later times. Moreover, we investigate the system size and $\eta/s$ dependence for the harmonic flows $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ and their response functions, along with the impact of the $\eta/s$ and the system transverse size on the dissipation of initial azimuthal correlations in momentum space. Finally, we introduce the normalised elliptic flow $v_2/v_{2,eq}$, showing the emergence of attractor behaviour in the regime of large opacity. These results offer new insights into how different systems evolve towards equilibrium and the role that system size and interaction play in this process.</description>

      <title>A harmonic oscillator in nonadditive statistics and a novel transverse momentum spectrum in high-energy collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is widely observed that particles produced in high-energy collisions follow a power-law distribution. One such power-law distribution used extensively in the phenomenological studies owes its origin to nonadditive statistics proposed by C. Tsallis. In this article, we derive a novel nonadditive generalization of the conventional Bose-Einstein distribution using a single-mode harmonic oscillator. The approach taken in this paper eliminates the need of a regularization procedure proposed in previous works. We observe that the spectra of the bosonic particles like the pions and kaons produced in high-energy collisions are well-described by the nonadditive bosonic distribution derived in this paper.</description>

      <title>Covariant analysis of electromagnetic current on the light cone: exposition with scalar Yukawa theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of the Lorentz covariance of the charge form factor for a strongly coupled scalar theory in (3+1)-dimensions. Our results are based on the first non-perturbative solution of the scalar Yukawa theory with a Fock sector expansion including up to thee-particles (one mock nucleon plus two mock pions or two mock nucleons plus one mock anti-nucleon). The light-front Hamiltonian is constructed and renormalized using a Fock sector dependent scheme. The derived eigenvalue equation is then solved non-perturbatively to obtain the wave functions, which are then used to compute the current matrix element.
  We perform a covariant analysis of the current matrix element taking into account possible violation of the Poincar\'e symmetry due to the Fock sector truncation. The physical form factor depends on two boost invariants $\zeta, \Delta^2_\perp$, instead of the single Lorentz invariant $Q^2$. Instead of adopting the conventional Drell-Yan frame $\zeta = 0$, we evaluate the form factor in general frames, and use the frame dependence to quantitatively gauge the loss of the Lorentz covariance. Our numerical result shows that as more Fock sectors are included, the frame dependence reduces dramatically. In particular, the anti-nucleon degree of freedom plays an important role in the reduction of the frame dependence, even though it only takes a small portion within the state vector. We also find that there is no zero-mode contribution to the current for the scalar Yukawa theory.</description>

      <title>In-medium bottomonium properties from lattice NRQCD calculations with extended meson operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the temperature dependence of bottomonium correlators in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with the aim to constrain in-medium properties of bottomonia at high temperature. The lattice calculations are performed using HISQ action with physical strange quark mass and light quark masses twenty times smaller than the strange quark mass at two lattice spacings $a=0.0493$ fm and $0.0602$ fm, and temporal extents $N_{\tau}=16-30$, corresponding to the temperatures $T=133-250$ MeV. We use a tadpole-improved NRQCD action including spin-dependent $v^6$ corrections for the heavy quarks and extended meson operators in order to be sensitive to in-medium properties of the bottomonium states of interest. We find that within estimated errors the bottomonium masses do not change compared to their vacuum values for all temperatures under our consideration; however, we find different nonzero widths for the various bottomonium states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the rotational Brownian motion of heavy quark in QCD medium and provide analytical results for polarization of open heavy-flavor hadrons. We calculate expressions for vector and tensor polarization, corresponding to baryon spin polarization and vector meson spin alignment, respectively. We compare our results with recent experimental data from ALICE collaboration for $D^{*+}$ meson and provide predictions for spin polarization of open charm baryons. We propose that the transverse momentum dependence of heavy quark polarization may serve as a distinctive signature of the intense initial magnetic field generated in off-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>CoMBolt-ITA, a Collective Model via relativistic Boltzmann equation in Isotropization Time Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new (2+1)-model is developed to investigate the collective behavior of the quark-gluon plasma produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. This framework couples pre-equilibrium dynamics with hydrodynamic evolution by solving the Boltzmann equation within the isotropization time approximation. A numerical scheme based on the method of characteristics enables the evolution to begin from a specified initial Boltzmann distribution. In this work, the spatial structure of the initial distribution is modeled using the TrENTo framework. Our results show that a medium initialized at $\tau_0 $ in the order of 1\,[fm/$c$] with a small shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ($\eta/s = 0.008$) evolves consistently with hydrodynamic simulations, such as those performed using the VISH2+1 code, while discrepancies arise for a medium with $\eta/s = 0.8$. Furthermore, when initialized with a highly anisotropic momentum distribution in the longitudinal direction at early times, the system exhibits spatially non-uniform thermalization in the transverse plane, leading to the emergence of a nontrivial hypersurface that marks the onset of hydrodynamic applicability.</description>
