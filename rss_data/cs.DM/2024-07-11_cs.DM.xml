      <title>Towards Complete Causal Explanation with Expert Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of restricting Markov equivalence classes of maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) containing certain edge marks, which we refer to as expert knowledge. MAGs forming a Markov equivalence class can be uniquely represented by an essential ancestral graph. We seek to learn the restriction of the essential ancestral graph containing the proposed expert knowledge. Our contributions are several-fold. First, we prove certain properties for the entire Markov equivalence class including a conjecture from Ali et al. (2009). Second, we present three sound graphical orientation rules, two of which generalize previously known rules, for adding expert knowledge to an essential graph. We also show that some orientation rules of Zhang (2008) are not needed for restricting the Markov equivalence class with expert knowledge. We provide an algorithm for including this expert knowledge and show that our algorithm is complete in certain settings i.e., in these settings, the output of our algorithm is a restricted essential ancestral graph. We conjecture this algorithm is complete generally. Outside of our specified settings, we provide an algorithm for checking whether a graph is a restricted essential graph and discuss its runtime. This work can be seen as a generalization of Meek (1995).</description>

      <title>Further Results and Questions on $S$-Packing Coloring of Subcubic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For non-decreasing sequence of integers $S=(a_1,a_2, \dots, a_k)$, an $S$-packing coloring of $G$ is a partition of $V(G)$ into $k$ subsets $V_1,V_2,\dots,V_k$ such that the distance between any two distinct vertices $x,y \in V_i$ is at least $a_{i}+1$, $1\leq i\leq k$. We consider the $S$-packing coloring problem on subclasses of subcubic graphs: For $0\le i\le 3$, a subcubic graph $G$ is said to be $i$-saturated if every vertex of degree 3 is adjacent to at most $i$ vertices of degree 3. Furthermore, a vertex of degree 3 in a subcubic graph is called heavy if all its three neighbors are of degree 3, and $G$ is said to be $(3,i)$-saturated if every heavy vertex is adjacent to at most $i$ heavy vertices. We prove that every 1-saturated subcubic graph is $(1,1,3,3)$-packing colorable and $(1,2,2,2,2)$-packing colorable. We also prove that every $(3,0)$-saturated subcubic graph is $(1,2,2,2,2,2)$-packing colorable.</description>

      <title>Graph Reconstruction with Connectivity Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a problem of reconstruction of connected graphs where the input gives all subsets of size k that induce a connected subgraph. Originally introduced by Bastide et al. (WG 2023) for triples ($k=3$), this problem received comprehensive attention in their work, alongside a study by Qi, who provided a complete characterization of graphs uniquely reconstructible via their connected triples, i.e. no other graphs share the same set of connected triples. Our contribution consists in output-polynomial time algorithms that enumerate every triangle-free graph (resp. every graph with bounded maximum degree) that is consistent with a specified set of connected $k$-sets. Notably, we prove that triangle-free graphs are uniquely reconstructible, while graphs with bounded maximum degree that are consistent with the same $k$-sets share a substantial common structure, differing only locally. We suspect that the problem is NP-hard in general and provide a NP-hardness proof for a variant where the connectivity is specified for only some $k$-sets (with $k$ at least 4).</description>

      <title>APTAS for bin packing with general cost structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the following generalization of the bin packing problem. We are given a set of items each of which is associated with a rational size in the interval [0,1], and a monotone non-decreasing non-negative cost function f defined over the cardinalities of the subsets of items. A feasible solution is a partition of the set of items into bins subject to the constraint that the total size of items in every bin is at most 1. Unlike bin packing, the goal function is to minimize the total cost of the bins where the cost of a bin is the value of f applied on the cardinality of the subset of items packed into the bin. We present an APTAS for this strongly NP-hard problem. We also provide a complete complexity classification of the problem with respect to the choice of f.</description>

      <title>Directed Transit Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transit functions were introduced as models of betweenness on undirected structures. Here we introduce directed transit function as the directed analogue on directed structures such as posets and directed graphs. We first show that betweenness in posets can be expressed by means of a simple set of first order axioms. Similar characterizations can be obtained for graphs with natural partial orders, in particular, forests, trees, and mangroves. Relaxing the acyclicity conditions leads to a generalization of the well-known geometric transit function to the directed structures. Moreover, we discuss some properties of the directed analogues of prominent transit functions, including the all-paths, induced paths, and shortest paths (or interval) transit functions. Finally we point out some open questions and directions for future work.</description>

      <title>Cliques in High-Dimensional Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent trend in the context of graph theory is to bring theoretical analyses closer to empirical observations, by focusing the studies on random graph models that are used to represent practical instances. There, it was observed that geometric inhomogeneous random graphs (GIRGs) yield good representations of complex real-world networks, by expressing edge probabilities as a function that depends on (heterogeneous) vertex weights and distances in some underlying geometric space that the vertices are distributed in. While most of the parameters of the model are understood well, it was unclear how the dimensionality of the ground space affects the structure of the graphs.
  In this paper, we complement existing research into the dimension of geometric random graph models and the ongoing study of determining the dimensionality of real-world networks, by studying how the structure of GIRGs changes as the number of dimensions increases. We prove that, in the limit, GIRGs approach non-geometric inhomogeneous random graphs and present insights on how quickly the decay of the geometry impacts important graph structures. In particular, we study the expected number of cliques of a given size as well as the clique number and characterize phase transitions at which their behavior changes fundamentally. Finally, our insights help in better understanding previous results about the impact of the dimensionality on geometric random graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This investigation is firstly focused into showing that two metric parameters represent the same object in graph theory. That is, we prove that the multiset resolving sets and the ID-colorings of graphs are the same thing. We also consider some computational and combinatorial problems of the multiset dimension, or equivalently, the ID-number of graphs. We prove that the decision problem concerning finding the multiset dimension of graphs is NP-complete. We consider the multiset dimension of king grids and prove that it is bounded above by 4. We also give a characterization of the strong product graphs with one factor being a complete graph, and whose multiset dimension is not infinite.</description>

      <title>The convex dimension of hypergraphs and the hypersimplicial Van Kampen-Flores Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.01189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convex dimension of a $k$-uniform hypergraph is the smallest dimension $d$ for which there is an injective mapping of its vertices into $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that the set of $k$-barycenters of all hyperedges is in convex position. We completely determine the convex dimension of complete $k$-uniform hypergraphs, which settles an open question by Halman, Onn and Rothblum, who solved the problem for complete graphs. We also provide lower and upper bounds for the extremal problem of estimating the maximal number of hyperedges of $k$-uniform hypergraphs on $n$ vertices with convex dimension $d$. To prove these results, we restate them in terms of affine projections that preserve the vertices of the hypersimplex. More generally, we provide a full characterization of the projections that preserve its $i$-dimensional skeleton. In particular, we obtain a hypersimplicial generalization of the linear van Kampen-Flores theorem: for each $n$, $k$ and $i$ we determine onto which dimensions can the $(n,k)$-hypersimplex be linearly projected while preserving its $i$-skeleton. Our results have direct interpretations in terms of $k$-sets and $(i,j)$-partitions, and are closely related to the problem of finding large convexly independent subsets in Minkowski sums of $k$ point sets.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for the zeros of the chromatic polynomial via Whitney's Broken Circuit Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any graph $G$ of maximum degree at most $\Delta$, the zeros of its chromatic polynomial $\chi_G(x)$ (in $\mathbb{C}$) lie inside the disc of radius $5.94 \Delta$ centered at $0$. This improves on the previously best known bound of approximately $6.91\Delta$.
  We also obtain improved bounds for graphs of high girth. We prove that for every $g$ there is a constant $K_g$ such that for any graph $G$ of maximum degree at most $\Delta$ and girth at least $g$, the zeros of its chromatic polynomial $\chi_G(x)$ lie inside the disc of radius $K_g \Delta$ centered at $0$, where $K_g$ is the solution to a certain optimization problem. In particular, $K_g &lt; 5$ when $g \geq 5$ and $K_g &lt; 4$ when $g \geq 25$ and $K_g$ tends to approximately $3.86$ as $g \to \infty$.
  Key to the proof is a classical theorem of Whitney which allows us to relate the chromatic polynomial of a graph $G$ to the generating function of so-called broken-circuit-free forests in $G$. We also establish a zero-free disc for the generating function of all forests in $G$ (aka the partition function of the arboreal gas) which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Boundary rigidity of finite CAT(0) cube complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we prove that finite CAT(0) cube complexes can be reconstructed from their boundary distances (computed in their 1-skeleta). This result was conjectured by Haslegrave, Scott, Tamitegama, and Tan (2023). The reconstruction of a finite cell complex from the boundary distances is the discrete version of the boundary rigidity problem, which is a classical problem from Riemannian geometry. In the proofs, we use the bijection between CAT(0) cube complexes and median graphs and the corner peelings of median graphs.</description>

      <title>A logarithmic approximation of linearly-ordered colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A linearly ordered (LO) $k$-colouring of a hypergraph assigns to each vertex a colour from the set $\{0,1,\ldots,k-1\}$ in such a way that each hyperedge has a unique maximum element. Barto, Batistelli, and Berg conjectured that it is NP-hard to find an LO $k$-colouring of an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph for any constant $k\geq 2$ [STACS'21] but even the case $k=3$ is still open. Nakajima and \v{Z}ivn\'{y} gave polynomial-time algorithms for finding, given an LO 2-colourable 3-uniform hypergraph, an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt{n})$ colours [ICALP'22] and an LO colouring with $O^*(\sqrt[3]{n})$ colours [ACM ToCT'23]. Very recently, Louis, Newman, and Ray gave an SDP-based algorithm with $O^*(\sqrt[5]{n})$ colours. We present two simple polynomial-time algorithms that find an LO colouring with $O(\log_2(n))$ colours, which is an exponential improvement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the connection between mixing properties for bipartite graphs and materialization of the mutual information in one-shot settings. We show that mixing properties of a graph imply impossibility to extract the mutual information shared by the ends of an edge randomly sampled in the graph. We apply these impossibility results to some questions motivated by information-theoretic cryptography. In particular, we show that communication complexity of a secret key agreement in one-shot setting is inherently uneven: for some inputs, almost all communication complexity inevitably falls on only one party.</description>
