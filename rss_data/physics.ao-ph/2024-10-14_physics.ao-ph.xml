      <title>A Visual-Analytical Approach for Automatic Detection of Cyclonic Events in Satellite Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the location and intensity of tropical cyclones holds crucial significance for predicting catastrophic weather events. In this study, we approach this task as a detection and regression challenge, specifically over the North Indian Ocean (NIO) region where best tracks location and wind speed information serve as the labels. The current process for cyclone detection and intensity estimation involves physics-based simulation studies which are time-consuming, only using image features will automate the process for significantly faster and more accurate predictions. While conventional methods typically necessitate substantial prior knowledge for training, we are exploring alternative approaches to enhance efficiency. This research aims to focus specifically on cyclone detection, intensity estimation and related aspects using only image input and data-driven approaches and will lead to faster inference time and automate the process as opposed to current NWP models being utilized at SAC. In context to algorithm development, a novel two stage detection and intensity estimation module is proposed. In the first level detection we try to localize the cyclone over an entire image as captured by INSAT3D over the NIO (North Indian Ocean). For the intensity estimation task, we propose a CNN-LSTM network, which works on the cyclone centered images, utilizing a ResNet-18 backbone, by which we are able to capture both temporal and spatial characteristics.</description>

      <title>Many wrong models approach to localize an odor source in turbulence with static sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of locating an odor source in turbulent flows is central to key applications such as environmental monitoring and disaster response. We address this challenge by designing an algorithm based on Bayesian inference, which uses odor measurements from an ensemble of static sensors to estimate the source position through a stochastic model of the environment. The problem is hard because of the multi-scale and out-of-equilibrium properties of turbulent transport, which lacks accurate analytical and phenomenological modeling, thus preventing a guaranteed convergence for Bayesian approaches. To overcome the risk of relying on a single unavoidably wrong model approximation, we propose a method to rank "many wrong models" and to blend their predictions. We evaluate our weighted Bayesian update algorithm by its ability to estimate the source location with predefined accuracy and/or within a specified time frame, and compare it to standard Monte Carlo sampling methods. To demonstrate the robustness and potential applications of both approaches under realistic environmental conditions, we use high-quality direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations to mimic the transport of odors in the atmospheric boundary layer. Despite minimal prior information about the source and environmental conditions, our proposed approach consistently proves to be more accurate, reliable, and robust than Monte Carlo methods, thus showing promise as a new tool for addressing the odor source localization problem in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>RAIN: Reinforcement Algorithms for Improving Numerical Weather and Climate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with idealised climate models to address key parameterisation challenges in climate science. Current climate models rely on complex mathematical parameterisations to represent sub-grid scale processes, which can introduce substantial uncertainties. RL offers capabilities to enhance these parameterisation schemes, including direct interaction, handling sparse or delayed feedback, continuous online learning, and long-term optimisation. We evaluate the performance of eight RL algorithms on two idealised environments: one for temperature bias correction, another for radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) imitating real-world computational constraints. Results show different RL approaches excel in different climate scenarios with exploration algorithms performing better in bias correction, while exploitation algorithms proving more effective for RCE. These findings support the potential of RL-based parameterisation schemes to be integrated into global climate models, improving accuracy and efficiency in capturing complex climate dynamics. Overall, this work represents an important first step towards leveraging RL to enhance climate model accuracy, critical for improving climate understanding and predictions.

      <title>Cool Pavements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cool pavements designate alternative pavements designed to reduce their contribution to urban heating. Urban heating generally refers to the sensible heat exchanged with the atmosphere by urban materials but can also include the radiative load they impose on pedestrians. In either case, pavement surface temperature is a very important parameter, which cool pavements seek to decrease compared with standard pavement designs. The energy balance of a pavement surface or very thin pavement slab helps identify the outbound flows which cool pavements attempt to promote and fundamental physical principles which govern them. On this basis, cool pavements can be classified as reflective pavements, green and evaporative pavements, high inertia or phase changing pavements as well as conductive or heatharvesting pavements. This chapter presents the urban heat island and the urban heating phenomena and provides an overview of cool pavement technologies, detailing areas which require further scientific investigation.</description>
