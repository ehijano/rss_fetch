      <title>Zero Trust Architecture: A Systematic Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of digital ecosystems and evolving cybersecurity threats have highlighted the limitations of traditional perimeter-based security models, leading to the growing adoption of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA). ZTA operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify", enforcing continuous authentication, conditional access, dynamic trust evaluation, and the principle of least privilege to enhance security across diverse domains. This study applies the PRISMA framework to analyze 10 years of research (2016-2025) on ZTA, presenting a systematic literature review (SLR) that synthesizes its applications, enabling technologies, and associated challenges. It provides a detailed taxonomy that organizes ZTA's application domains, together with the emerging technologies that facilitate its implementation, and critically examines the barriers to ZTA adoption. Additionally, the study traces the historical evolution of ZTA alongside notable events and publications trends while highlighting some potential factors for the surge over the past few years. This comprehensive analysis serves as a practical guide for researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage ZTA for stronger, more adaptive security frameworks in a rapidly shifting threat landscape.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Resiliency of Sketch-based Security via LSB Sharing-based Dynamic Late Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the exponentially growing Internet traffic, sketch data structure with a probabilistic algorithm has been expected to be an alternative solution for non-compromised (non-selective) security monitoring. While facilitating counting within a confined memory space, the sketch's memory efficiency and accuracy were further pushed to their limit through finer-grained and dynamic control of constrained memory space to adapt to the data stream's inherent skewness (i.e., Zipf distribution), namely small counters with extensions. In this paper, we unveil a vulnerable factor of the small counter design by introducing a new sketch-oriented attack, which threatens a stream of state-of-the-art sketches and their security applications. With the root cause analyses, we propose Siamese Counter with enhanced adversarial resiliency and verified feasibility with extensive experimental and theoretical analyses. Under a sketch pollution attack, Siamese Counter delivers 47% accurate results than a state-of-the-art scheme, and demonstrates up to 82% more accurate estimation under normal measurement scenarios.</description>

      <title>Trust Under Siege: Label Spoofing Attacks against Machine Learning for Android Malware Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) malware detectors rely heavily on crowd-sourced AntiVirus (AV) labels, with platforms like VirusTotal serving as a trusted source of malware annotations. But what if attackers could manipulate these labels to classify benign software as malicious? We introduce label spoofing attacks, a new threat that contaminates crowd-sourced datasets by embedding minimal and undetectable malicious patterns into benign samples. These patterns coerce AV engines into misclassifying legitimate files as harmful, enabling poisoning attacks against ML-based malware classifiers trained on those data. We demonstrate this scenario by developing AndroVenom, a methodology for polluting realistic data sources, causing consequent poisoning attacks against ML malware detectors. Experiments show that not only state-of-the-art feature extractors are unable to filter such injection, but also various ML models experience Denial of Service already with 1% poisoned samples. Additionally, attackers can flip decisions of specific unaltered benign samples by modifying only 0.015% of the training data, threatening their reputation and market share and being unable to be stopped by anomaly detectors on training data. We conclude our manuscript by raising the alarm on the trustworthiness of the training process based on AV annotations, requiring further investigation on how to produce proper labels for ML malware detectors.</description>

      <title>Local Pan-Privacy for Federated Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pan-privacy was proposed by Dwork et al. as an approach to designing a private analytics system that retains its privacy properties in the face of intrusions that expose the system's internal state. Motivated by federated telemetry applications, we study local pan-privacy, where privacy should be retained under repeated unannounced intrusions on the local state. We consider the problem of monitoring the count of an event in a federated system, where event occurrences on a local device should be hidden even from an intruder on that device. We show that under reasonable constraints, the goal of providing information-theoretic differential privacy under intrusion is incompatible with collecting telemetry information. We then show that this problem can be solved in a scalable way using standard cryptographic primitives.</description>

      <title>PREAMBLE: Private and Efficient Aggregation of Block Sparse Vectors and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of secure aggregation of high-dimensional vectors in a two-server system such as Prio. These systems are typically used to aggregate vectors such as gradients in private federated learning, where the aggregate itself is protected via noise addition to ensure differential privacy. Existing approaches require communication scaling with the dimensionality, and thus limit the dimensionality of vectors one can efficiently process in this setup.
  We propose PREAMBLE: Private Efficient Aggregation Mechanism for BLock-sparse Euclidean Vectors. PREAMBLE is a novel extension of distributed point functions that enables communication- and computation-efficient aggregation of block-sparse vectors, which are sparse vectors where the non-zero entries occur in a small number of clusters of consecutive coordinates. We then show that PREAMBLE can be combined with random sampling and privacy amplification by sampling results, to allow asymptotically optimal privacy-utility trade-offs for vector aggregation, at a fraction of the communication cost. When coupled with recent advances in numerical privacy accounting, our approach incurs a negligible overhead in noise variance, compared to the Gaussian mechanism used with Prio.</description>

      <title>Implementation of classical client universal blind quantum computation with 8-state RSP in current architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future of quantum computing architecture is most likely the one in which a large number of clients are either fully classical or have a very limited quantum capability while a very small number of servers having the capability to perform quantum computations and most quantum computational tasks are delegated to these quantum servers. In this architecture, it becomes very crucial that a classical/semi-classical client is able to keep the delegated data/ computation secure against eavesdroppers as well as the server itself, known as the blindness feature. In 2009, A. Broadbent et. al proposed a universal blind quantum computation (UBQC) protocol based on measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) that enables a semi-classical client to delegate universal quantum computation to a quantum server, interactively and fetch the results while the computation itself remains blind to the server. In this work, we propose an implementation (with examples) of UBQC in the current quantum computing architecture, a fully classical client, a quantum server (IBM Quantum) and the computation does not proceed interactively (projective measurement basis is not decided by previous measurement outcome). We combined UBQC with the 8-state remote state preparation (RSP) protocol, to blindly prepare the initial cluster state, which is an initial resource state in UBQC protocol, to allow a completely classical client to perform delegated blind quantum computation. Such an implementation has already been shown to be secure in a game-based security setting, which is the weakest security model.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Evaluating Emerging Cyberattack Capabilities of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As frontier models become more capable, the community has attempted to evaluate their ability to enable cyberattacks. Performing a comprehensive evaluation and prioritizing defenses are crucial tasks in preparing for AGI safely. However, current cyber evaluation efforts are ad-hoc, with no systematic reasoning about the various phases of attacks, and do not provide a steer on how to use targeted defenses. In this work, we propose a novel approach to AI cyber capability evaluation that (1) examines the end-to-end attack chain, (2) helps to identify gaps in the evaluation of AI threats, and (3) helps defenders prioritize targeted mitigations and conduct AI-enabled adversary emulation to support red teaming. To achieve these goals, we propose adapting existing cyberattack chain frameworks to AI systems. We analyze over 12,000 instances of real-world attempts to use AI in cyberattacks catalogued by Google's Threat Intelligence Group. Using this analysis, we curate a representative collection of seven cyberattack chain archetypes and conduct a bottleneck analysis to identify areas of potential AI-driven cost disruption. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 50 new challenges spanning different phases of cyberattacks. Based on this, we devise targeted cybersecurity model evaluations, report on the potential for AI to amplify offensive cyber capabilities across specific attack phases, and conclude with recommendations on prioritizing defenses. In all, we consider this to be the most comprehensive AI cyber risk evaluation framework published so far.</description>

      <title>Practical Implications of Implementing Local Differential Privacy for Smart grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent smart grid advancements enable near-realtime reporting of electricity consumption, raising concerns about consumer privacy. Differential privacy (DP) has emerged as a viable privacy solution, where a calculated amount of noise is added to the data by a trusted third party, or individual users perturb their information locally, and only send the randomized data to an aggregator for analysis safeguarding users and aggregators privacy. However, the practical implementation of a Local DP-based (LDP) privacy model for smart grids has its own challenges. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of implementing an LDP-based model for smart grids. We compare existing LDP mechanisms in smart grids for privacy preservation of numerical data and discuss different methods for selecting privacy parameters in the existing literature, their limitations and the non-existence of an optimal method for selecting the privacy parameters. We also discuss the challenges of translating theoretical models of LDP into a practical setting for smart grids for different utility functions, the impact of the size of data set on privacy and accuracy, and vulnerability of LDP-based smart grids to manipulation attacks. Finally, we discuss future directions in research for better practical applications in LDP based models for smart grids.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Training-Inference Trigger Intensity in Backdoor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks typically place a specific trigger on certain training data, such that the model makes prediction errors on inputs with that trigger during inference. Despite the core role of the trigger, existing studies have commonly believed a perfect match between training-inference triggers is optimal. In this paper, for the first time, we systematically explore the training-inference trigger relation, particularly focusing on their mismatch, based on a Training-Inference Trigger Intensity Manipulation (TITIM) workflow. TITIM specifically investigates the training-inference trigger intensity, such as the size or the opacity of a trigger, and reveals new insights into trigger generalization and overfitting.
  These new insights challenge the above common belief by demonstrating that the training-inference trigger mismatch can facilitate attacks in two practical scenarios, posing more significant security threats than previously thought. First, when the inference trigger is fixed, using training triggers with mixed intensities leads to stronger attacks than using any single intensity. For example, on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, mixing training triggers with 1.0 and 0.1 opacities improves the worst-case attack success rate (ASR) (over different testing opacities) of the best single-opacity attack from 10.61\% to 92.77\%. Second, intentionally using certain mismatched training-inference triggers can improve the attack stealthiness, i.e., better bypassing defenses. For example, compared to the training/inference intensity of 1.0/1.0, using 1.0/0.7 decreases the area under the curve (AUC) of the Scale-Up defense from 0.96 to 0.62, while maintaining a high attack ASR (99.65\% vs. 91.62\%). The above new insights are validated to be generalizable across different backdoor attacks, models, datasets, tasks, and (digital/physical) domains.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Systems Execute Arbitrary Malicious Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems coordinate LLM-based agents to perform tasks on users' behalf. In real-world applications, multi-agent systems will inevitably interact with untrusted inputs, such as malicious Web content, files, email attachments, etc.
  Using several recently proposed multi-agent frameworks as concrete examples, we demonstrate that adversarial content can hijack control and communication within the system to invoke unsafe agents and functionalities. This results in a complete security breach, up to execution of arbitrary malicious code on the user's device and/or exfiltration of sensitive data from the user's containerized environment. We show that control-flow hijacking attacks succeed even if the individual agents are not susceptible to direct or indirect prompt injection, and even if they refuse to perform harmful actions.</description>

      <title>TFHE-Coder: Evaluating LLM-agentic Fully Homomorphic Encryption Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the torus (TFHE) enables computation on encrypted data without decryption, making it a cornerstone of secure and confidential computing. Despite its potential in privacy preserving machine learning, secure multi party computation, private blockchain transactions, and secure medical diagnostics, its adoption remains limited due to cryptographic complexity and usability challenges. While various TFHE libraries and compilers exist, practical code generation remains a hurdle. We propose a compiler integrated framework to evaluate LLM inference and agentic optimization for TFHE code generation, focusing on logic gates and ReLU activation. Our methodology assesses error rates, compilability, and structural similarity across open and closedsource LLMs. Results highlight significant limitations in off-the-shelf models, while agentic optimizations such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and few-shot prompting reduce errors and enhance code fidelity. This work establishes the first benchmark for TFHE code generation, demonstrating how LLMs, when augmented with domain-specific feedback, can bridge the expertise gap in FHE code generation.</description>

      <title>Research on Large Language Model Cross-Cloud Privacy Protection and Collaborative Training based on Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fast development of large language models (LLMs) and popularization of cloud computing have led to increasing concerns on privacy safeguarding and data security of cross-cloud model deployment and training as the key challenges. We present a new framework for addressing these issues along with enabling privacy preserving collaboration on training between distributed clouds based on federated learning. Our mechanism encompasses cutting-edge cryptographic primitives, dynamic model aggregation techniques, and cross-cloud data harmonization solutions to enhance security, efficiency, and scalability to the traditional federated learning paradigm. Furthermore, we proposed a hybrid aggregation scheme to mitigate the threat of Data Leakage and to optimize the aggregation of model updates, thus achieving substantial enhancement on the model effectiveness and stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the training efficiency, privacy protection, and model accuracy of the proposed model compare favorably to those of the traditional federated learning method.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Side-Channel Analysis of PRESENT Lightweight Cipher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Side-channel vulnerabilities pose an increasing threat to cryptographically protected devices. Consequently, it is crucial to observe information leakages through physical parameters such as power consumption and electromagnetic (EM) radiation to reduce susceptibility during interactions with cryptographic functions. EM side-channel attacks are becoming more prevalent. PRESENT is a promising lightweight cryptographic algorithm expected to be incorporated into Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in the future. This research investigates the EM side-channel robustness of PRESENT using a correlation attack model. This work extends our previous Correlation EM Analysis (CEMA) of PRESENT with improved results. The attack targets the Substitution box (S-box) and can retrieve 8 bytes of the 10-byte encryption key with a minimum of 256 EM waveforms. This paper presents the process of EM attack modelling, encompassing both simple and correlation attacks, followed by a critical analysis.</description>

      <title>Defense Against Model Stealing Based on Account-Aware Distribution Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malicious users attempt to replicate commercial models functionally at low cost by training a clone model with query responses. It is challenging to timely prevent such model-stealing attacks to achieve strong protection and maintain utility. In this paper, we propose a novel non-parametric detector called Account-aware Distribution Discrepancy (ADD) to recognize queries from malicious users by leveraging account-wise local dependency. We formulate each class as a Multivariate Normal distribution (MVN) in the feature space and measure the malicious score as the sum of weighted class-wise distribution discrepancy. The ADD detector is combined with random-based prediction poisoning to yield a plug-and-play defense module named D-ADD for image classification models. Results of extensive experimental studies show that D-ADD achieves strong defense against different types of attacks with little interference in serving benign users for both soft and hard-label settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Payment channel networks (PCNs) are a promising solution to address blockchain scalability and throughput challenges, However, the security of PCNs and their vulnerability to attacks are not sufficiently studied. In this paper, we introduce SCOOP, a framework that includes two novel congestion attacks on PCNs. These attacks consider the minimum transferable amount along a path (path capacity) and the number of channels involved (path length), formulated as linear optimization problems. The first attack allocates the attacker's budget to achieve a specific congestion threshold, while the second maximizes congestion under budget constraints. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed attack formulations in comparison to other attack strategies. Specifically, the results indicate that the first attack provides around a 40\% improvement in congestion performance, while the second attack offers approximately a 50\% improvement in comparison to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, in terms of payment to congestion efficiency, the first attack is about 60\% more efficient, and the second attack is around 90\% more efficient in comparison to state-of-the-art</description>

      <title>Enabling High-Frequency Trading with Near-Instant, Trustless Cross-Chain Transactions via Pre-Signing Adaptor Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic swaps have been widely considered to be an ideal solution for cross-chain cryptocurrency transactions due to their trustless and decentralized nature. However, their adoption in practice has been strictly limited compared to centralized exchange order books because of long transaction times (anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes) prohibiting market makers from accurately pricing atomic swap spreads. For the decentralized finance ecosystem to expand and benefit all users, this would require accommodating market makers and high-frequency traders to reduce spreads and dramatically boost liquidity. This white paper will introduce a protocol for atomic swaps that eliminates the need for an intermediary currency or centralized trusted third party, reducing transaction times between Bitcoin and Ethereum swaps to approximately 15 seconds for a market maker, and could be reduced further with future Layer 2 solutions.</description>

      <title>Safeguarding LLM Embeddings in End-Cloud Collaboration via Entropy-Driven Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies improve on-device language model (LM) inference through end-cloud collaboration, where the end device retrieves useful information from cloud databases to enhance local processing, known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Typically, to retrieve information from the cloud while safeguarding privacy, the end device transforms original data into embeddings with a local embedding model. However, the recently emerging Embedding Inversion Attacks (EIAs) can still recover the original data from text embeddings (e.g., training a recovery model to map embeddings back to original texts), posing a significant threat to user privacy. To address this risk, we propose EntroGuard, an entropy-driven perturbation-based embedding privacy protection method, which can protect the privacy of text embeddings while maintaining retrieval accuracy during the end-cloud collaboration. Specifically, to defeat various EIAs, we perturb the embeddings to increase the entropy of the recovered text in the common structure of recovery models, thus steering the embeddings toward meaningless texts rather than original sensitive texts during the recovery process. To maintain retrieval performance in the cloud, we constrain the perturbations within a bound, applying the strategy of reducing them where redundant and increasing them where sparse. Moreover, EntroGuard can be directly integrated into end devices without requiring any modifications to the embedding model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EntroGuard can reduce the risk of privacy leakage by up to 8 times at most with negligible loss of retrieval performance compared to existing privacy-preserving methods.</description>

      <title>MirrorGuard: Adaptive Defense Against Jailbreaks via Entropy-Guided Mirror Crafting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is crucial for ensuring their safe deployment. Existing defense strategies generally rely on predefined static criteria to differentiate between harmful and benign prompts. However, such rigid rules are incapable of accommodating the inherent complexity and dynamic nature of real jailbreak attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of ``mirror'' to enable dynamic and adaptive defense. A mirror refers to a dynamically generated prompt that mirrors the syntactic structure of the input while ensuring semantic safety. The personalized discrepancies between the input prompts and their corresponding mirrors serve as the guiding principles for defense. A new defense paradigm, MirrorGuard, is further proposed to detect and calibrate risky inputs based on such mirrors. An entropy-based detection metric, Relative Input Uncertainty (RIU), is integrated into MirrorGuard to quantify the discrepancies between input prompts and mirrors. MirrorGuard is evaluated on several popular datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art defense performance while maintaining general effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis and Industry Deployment of Post-Quantum Cryptography Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum computing advances, modern cryptographic standards face an existential threat, necessitating a transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has selected CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium as standardized PQC algorithms for secure key exchange and digital signatures, respectively. This study conducts a comprehensive performance analysis of these algorithms by benchmarking execution times across cryptographic operations such as key generation, encapsulation, decapsulation, signing, and verification. Additionally, the impact of AVX2 optimizations is evaluated to assess hardware acceleration benefits. Our findings demonstrate that Kyber and Dilithium achieve efficient execution times, outperforming classical cryptographic schemes such as RSA and ECDSA at equivalent security levels. Beyond technical performance, the real-world deployment of PQC introduces challenges in telecommunications networks, where large-scale infrastructure upgrades, interoperability with legacy systems, and regulatory constraints must be addressed. This paper examines the feasibility of PQC adoption in telecom environments, highlighting key transition challenges, security risks, and implementation strategies. Through industry case studies, we illustrate how telecom operators are integrating PQC into 5G authentication, subscriber identity protection, and secure communications. Our analysis provides insights into the computational trade-offs, deployment considerations, and standardization efforts shaping the future of quantum-safe cryptographic infrastructure.</description>

      <title>FedSDP: Explainable Differential Privacy in Federated Learning via Shapley Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables participants to store data locally while collaborating in training, yet it remains vulnerable to privacy attacks, such as data reconstruction. Existing differential privacy (DP) technologies inject noise dynamically into the training process to mitigate the impact of excessive noise. However, this dynamic scheduling is often grounded in factors indirectly related to privacy, making it difficult to clearly explain the intricate relationship between dynamic noise adjustments and privacy requirements. To address this issue, we propose FedSDP, a novel and explainable DP-based privacy protection mechanism that guides noise injection based on privacy contribution. Specifically, FedSDP leverages Shapley values to assess the contribution of private attributes to local model training and dynamically adjusts the amount of noise injected accordingly. By providing theoretical insights into the injection of varying scales of noise into local training, FedSDP enhances interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedSDP can achieve a superior balance between privacy preservation and model performance, surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study empirically analyzes the transaction activity of Bitcoin addresses linked to Russian intelligence services, which have liquidated over 7 Bitcoin (BTC), i.e., equivalent to approximately US$300,000 based on the exchange rate at the time. Our investigation begins with an observed anomaly in transaction outputs featuring the Bitcoin Script operation code, tied to input addresses identified by cyber threat intelligence sources and court documents as belonging to Russian intelligence agencies. We explore how an unauthorized entity appears to have gained control of the associated private keys, with messages embedded in the outputs confirming the seizure. Tracing the funds' origins, we connect them to cryptocurrency mixers and establish a link to the Russian ransomware group Conti, implicating intelligence service involvement. This analysis represents one of the first empirical studies of large-scale Bitcoin misuse by nation-state cyber actors.</description>

      <title>VeriLeaky: Navigating IP Protection vs Utility in Fine-Tuning for LLM-Driven Verilog Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for coding, yet fine-tuning (FT) with curated data is essential for niche languages like Verilog. Using proprietary intellectual property (IP) for FT presents a serious risk, as FT data can be leaked through LLM inference. This leads to a critical dilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering competitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT utility while ensuring IP protection?
  For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma. Using LLaMA 3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder) supplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple tape-outs. To rigorously assess IP leakage, we quantify structural similarity (AST/Dolos) and functional equivalence (Synopsys Formality) between generated codes and our in-house IP. We show that our IP can indeed be leaked, confirming the threat. As defense, we evaluate logic locking of Verilog codes (ASSURE). This offers some level of protection, yet reduces the IP's utility for FT and degrades the LLM's performance. Our study shows the need for novel strategies that are both effective and minimally disruptive to FT, an essential effort for enabling design houses to fully utilize their proprietary IP toward LLM-driven Verilog coding.</description>

      <title>ProDiF: Protecting Domain-Invariant Features to Secure Pre-Trained Models Against Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained models are valuable intellectual property, capturing both domain-specific and domain-invariant features within their weight spaces. However, model extraction attacks threaten these assets by enabling unauthorized source-domain inference and facilitating cross-domain transfer via the exploitation of domain-invariant features. In this work, we introduce **ProDiF**, a novel framework that leverages targeted weight space manipulation to secure pre-trained models against extraction attacks. **ProDiF** quantifies the transferability of filters and perturbs the weights of critical filters in unsecured memory, while preserving actual critical weights in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for authorized users. A bi-level optimization further ensures resilience against adaptive fine-tuning attacks. Experimental results show that **ProDiF** reduces source-domain accuracy to near-random levels and decreases cross-domain transferability by 74.65\%, providing robust protection for pre-trained models. This work offers comprehensive protection for pre-trained DNN models and highlights the potential of weight space manipulation as a novel approach to model security.</description>

      <title>Securing Virtual Reality Experiences: Unveiling and Tackling Cybersickness Attacks with Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synergy between virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning (DL)-based cybersickness detection models, has ushered in unprecedented advancements in immersive experiences by automatically detecting cybersickness severity and adaptively various mitigation techniques, offering a smooth and comfortable VR experience. While this DL-enabled cybersickness detection method provides promising solutions for enhancing user experiences, it also introduces new risks since these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks; a small perturbation of the input data that is visually undetectable to human observers can fool the cybersickness detection model and trigger unexpected mitigation, thus disrupting user immersive experiences (UIX) and even posing safety risks. In this paper, we present a new type of VR attack, i.e., a cybersickness attack, which successfully stops the triggering of cybersickness mitigation by fooling DL-based cybersickness detection models and dramatically hinders the UIX. Next, we propose a novel explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-guided cybersickness attack detection framework to detect such attacks in VR to ensure UIX and a comfortable VR experience. We evaluate the proposed attack and the detection framework using two state-of-the-art open-source VR cybersickness datasets: Simulation 2021 and Gameplay dataset. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we implement the attack and the XAI-based detection using a testbed with a custom-built VR roller coaster simulation with an HTC Vive Pro Eye headset and perform a user study. Our study shows that such an attack can dramatically hinder the UIX. However, our proposed XAI-guided cybersickness attack detection can successfully detect cybersickness attacks and trigger the proper mitigation, effectively reducing VR cybersickness.</description>

      <title>Making Every Step Effective: Jailbreaking Large Vision-Language Models Through Hierarchical KV Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of large vision-language models (LVLMs), adversarial jailbreak attacks serve as a red-teaming approach to identify safety vulnerabilities of these models and their associated defense mechanisms. However, we identify a critical limitation: not every adversarial optimization step leads to a positive outcome, and indiscriminately accepting optimization results at each step may reduce the overall attack success rate. To address this challenge, we introduce HKVE (Hierarchical Key-Value Equalization), an innovative jailbreaking framework that selectively accepts gradient optimization results based on the distribution of attention scores across different layers, ensuring that every optimization step positively contributes to the attack. Extensive experiments demonstrate HKVE's significant effectiveness, achieving attack success rates of 75.08% on MiniGPT4, 85.84% on LLaVA and 81.00% on Qwen-VL, substantially outperforming existing methods by margins of 20.43\%, 21.01\% and 26.43\% respectively. Furthermore, making every step effective not only leads to an increase in attack success rate but also allows for a reduction in the number of iterations, thereby lowering computational costs. Warning: This paper contains potentially harmful example data.</description>

      <title>TetrisLock: Quantum Circuit Split Compilation with Interlocking Patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum computing, quantum circuits are fundamental representations of quantum algorithms, which are compiled into executable functions for quantum solutions. Quantum compilers transform algorithmic quantum circuits into one compatible with target quantum computers, bridging quantum software and hardware. However, untrusted quantum compilers pose significant risks. They can lead to the theft of quantum circuit designs and compromise sensitive intellectual property (IP). In this paper, we propose TetrisLock, a split compilation method for quantum circuit obfuscation that uses an interlocking splitting pattern to effectively protect IP with minimal resource overhead. Our approach divides the quantum circuit into two interdependent segments, ensuring that reconstructing the original circuit functionality is possible only by combining both segments and eliminating redundancies. This method makes reverse engineering by an untrusted compiler unrealizable, as the original circuit is never fully shared with any single entity. Also, our approach eliminates the need for a trusted compiler to process the inserted random circuit, thereby relaxing the security requirements. Additionally, it defends against colluding attackers with mismatched numbers of qubits, while maintaining low overhead by preserving the original depth of the quantum circuit. We demonstrate our method by using established RevLib benchmarks, showing that it achieves a minimal impact on functional accuracy (less than 1%) while significantly reducing the likelihood of IP inference.</description>

      <title>SEAL: Semantic Aware Image Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models have rapidly evolved to generate realistic outputs. However, their synthetic outputs increasingly challenge the clear distinction between natural and AI-generated content, necessitating robust watermarking techniques. Watermarks are typically expected to preserve the integrity of the target image, withstand removal attempts, and prevent unauthorized replication onto unrelated images. To address this need, recent methods embed persistent watermarks into images produced by diffusion models using the initial noise. Yet, to do so, they either distort the distribution of generated images or rely on searching through a long dictionary of used keys for detection.
  In this paper, we propose a novel watermarking method that embeds semantic information about the generated image directly into the watermark, enabling a distortion-free watermark that can be verified without requiring a database of key patterns. Instead, the key pattern can be inferred from the semantic embedding of the image using locality-sensitive hashing. Furthermore, conditioning the watermark detection on the original image content improves robustness against forgery attacks. To demonstrate that, we consider two largely overlooked attack strategies: (i) an attacker extracting the initial noise and generating a novel image with the same pattern; (ii) an attacker inserting an unrelated (potentially harmful) object into a watermarked image, possibly while preserving the watermark. We empirically validate our method's increased robustness to these attacks. Taken together, our results suggest that content-aware watermarks can mitigate risks arising from image-generative models.</description>

      <title>Closing the Chain: How to reduce your risk of being SolarWinds, Log4j, or XZ Utils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software supply chain frameworks, such as the US NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF), detail what tasks software development organizations should adopt to reduce security risk. However, to further reduce the risk of similar attacks occurring, framework adopters (i.e., software organizations) would benefit from knowing what tasks mitigate attack techniques the attackers are currently using to help organizations prioritize and to indicate current framework task gaps that leave organizations vulnerable to attacks. The goal of this study is to aid software supply chain framework adopters in reducing the risk of attacks by systematically mapping the attack techniques used in the SolarWinds, Log4j, and XZ Utils attacks to mitigating framework tasks. We qualitatively analyzed 106 Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports of the 3 attacks to gather the attack techniques. We then systematically constructed a mapping between attack techniques and the 73 tasks enumerated in 10 software supply chain frameworks. Afterward, we established and ranked priority tasks that mitigate attack techniques. The three mitigation tasks with the highest scores are role-based access control, system monitoring, and boundary protection. Additionally, three mitigation tasks were missing from all ten frameworks, including sustainable open-source software and environmental scanning tools. Thus, software products would still be vulnerable to software supply chain attacks even if organizations adopted all recommended tasks.</description>

      <title>A Bubble-Cluster Federated Learning Framework for Privacy-Preserving Demand Forecasting on Heterogeneous Retail Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables retailers to share model parameters for demand forecasting while maintaining privacy. However, heterogeneous data across diverse regions, driven by factors such as varying consumer behavior, poses challenges to the effectiveness of federated learning. To tackle this challenge, we propose Bubble-Cluster Federated Learning (BFL), a novel clustering-based federated learning framework tailored for sales prediction. By leveraging differential privacy and feature importance distribution, BFL groups retailers into distinct "bubbles", each forming its own federated learning (FL) system to effectively isolate data heterogeneity. Within each bubble, Transformer models are designed to predict local sales for each client. Our experiments demonstrate that BFL significantly surpasses FedAvg and outperforms local learning in demand forecasting performance across all participating clients. Compared to local learning, BFL can achieve a 5.4\% improvement in R\textsuperscript{2}, a 69\% reduction in RMSE, and a 45\% decrease in MAE. Our study highlights BFL's adaptability in enabling effective federated learning through dynamic adjustments to noise levels and the range of clients participating in each bubble. This approach strategically groups participants into distinct "bubbles" while proactively identifying and filtering out risky clients that could compromise the FL system. The findings demonstrate BFL's ability to enhance collaborative learning in regression tasks on heterogeneous data, achieving a balance between forecasting accuracy and privacy preservation in retail applications. Additionally, BFL's capability to detect and neutralize poisoned data from clients enhances the system's robustness and reliability, ensuring more secure and effective federated learning.</description>

      <title>Empirical Privacy Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the notion of empirical privacy variance and study it in the context of differentially private fine-tuning of language models. Specifically, we show that models calibrated to the same $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantee using DP-SGD with different hyperparameter configurations can exhibit significant variations in empirical privacy, which we quantify through the lens of memorization. We investigate the generality of this phenomenon across multiple dimensions and discuss why it is surprising and relevant. Through regression analysis, we examine how individual and composite hyperparameters influence empirical privacy. The results reveal a no-free-lunch trade-off: existing practices of hyperparameter tuning in DP-SGD, which focus on optimizing utility under a fixed privacy budget, often come at the expense of empirical privacy. To address this, we propose refined heuristics for hyperparameter selection that explicitly account for empirical privacy, showing that they are both precise and practically useful. Finally, we take preliminary steps to understand empirical privacy variance. We propose two hypotheses, identify limitations in existing techniques like privacy auditing, and outline open questions for future research.</description>

      <title>SCReedSolo: A Secure and Robust LSB Image Steganography Framework with Randomized Symmetric Encryption and Reed-Solomon Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image steganography is an information-hiding technique that involves the surreptitious concealment of covert informational content within digital images. In this paper, we introduce ${\rm SCR{\small EED}S{\small OLO}}$, a novel framework for concealing arbitrary binary data within images. Our approach synergistically leverages Random Shuffling, Fernet Symmetric Encryption, and Reed-Solomon Error Correction Codes to encode the secret payload, which is then discretely embedded into the carrier image using LSB (Least Significant Bit) Steganography. The combination of these methods addresses the vulnerability vectors of both security and resilience against bit-level corruption in the resultant stego-images. We show that our framework achieves a data payload of 3 bits per pixel for an RGB image, and mathematically assess the probability of successful transmission for the amalgamated $n$ message bits and $k$ error correction bits. Additionally, we find that ${\rm SCR{\small EED}S{\small OLO}}$ yields good results upon being evaluated with multiple performance metrics, successfully eludes detection by various passive steganalysis tools, and is immune to simple active steganalysis attacks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Starscream-11813/SCReedSolo-Steganography.</description>

      <title>BLIA: Detect model memorization in binary classification model through passive Label Inference attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model memorization has implications for both the generalization capacity of machine learning models and the privacy of their training data. This paper investigates label memorization in binary classification models through two novel passive label inference attacks (BLIA). These attacks operate passively, relying solely on the outputs of pre-trained models, such as confidence scores and log-loss values, without interacting with or modifying the training process. By intentionally flipping 50% of the labels in controlled subsets, termed "canaries," we evaluate the extent of label memorization under two conditions: models trained without label differential privacy (Label-DP) and those trained with randomized response-based Label-DP. Despite the application of varying degrees of Label-DP, the proposed attacks consistently achieve success rates exceeding 50%, surpassing the baseline of random guessing and conclusively demonstrating that models memorize training labels, even when these labels are deliberately uncorrelated with the features.</description>

      <title>Zero-Knowledge Proof-Based Consensus for Blockchain-Secured Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple participants to collaboratively train machine learning models while ensuring their data remains private and secure. Blockchain technology further enhances FL by providing stronger security, a transparent audit trail, and protection against data tampering and model manipulation. Most blockchain-secured FL systems rely on conventional consensus mechanisms: Proof-of-Work (PoW) is computationally expensive, while Proof-of-Stake (PoS) improves energy efficiency but risks centralization as it inherently favors participants with larger stakes. Recently, learning-based consensus has emerged as an alternative by replacing cryptographic tasks with model training to save energy. However, this approach introduces potential privacy vulnerabilities, as the training process may inadvertently expose sensitive information through gradient sharing and model updates. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Zero-Knowledge Proof of Training (ZKPoT) consensus mechanism. This method leverages the zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge proof (zk-SNARK) protocol to validate participants' contributions based on their model performance, effectively eliminating the inefficiencies of traditional consensus methods and mitigating the privacy risks posed by learning-based consensus. We analyze our system's security, demonstrating its capacity to prevent the disclosure of sensitive information about local models or training data to untrusted parties during the entire FL process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system is robust against privacy and Byzantine attacks while maintaining accuracy and utility without trade-offs, scalable across various blockchain settings, and efficient in both computation and communication.</description>

      <title>Report of the Medical Image De-Identification (MIDI) Task Group -- Best Practices and Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report addresses the technical aspects of de-identification of medical images of human subjects and biospecimens, such that re-identification risk of ethical, moral, and legal concern is sufficiently reduced to allow unrestricted public sharing for any purpose, regardless of the jurisdiction of the source and distribution sites. All medical images, regardless of the mode of acquisition, are considered, though the primary emphasis is on those with accompanying data elements, especially those encoded in formats in which the data elements are embedded, particularly Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM). These images include image-like objects such as Segmentations, Parametric Maps, and Radiotherapy (RT) Dose objects. The scope also includes related non-image objects, such as RT Structure Sets, Plans and Dose Volume Histograms, Structured Reports, and Presentation States. Only de-identification of publicly released data is considered, and alternative approaches to privacy preservation, such as federated learning for artificial intelligence (AI) model development, are out of scope, as are issues of privacy leakage from AI model sharing. Only technical issues of public sharing are addressed.</description>

      <title>A Model Stealing Attack Against Multi-Exit Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared to traditional neural networks with a single output channel, a multi-exit network has multiple exits that allow for early outputs from the model's intermediate layers, thus significantly improving computational efficiency while maintaining similar main task accuracy. Existing model stealing attacks can only steal the model's utility while failing to capture its output strategy, i.e., a set of thresholds used to determine from which exit to output. This leads to a significant decrease in computational efficiency for the extracted model, thereby losing the advantage of multi-exit networks. In this paper, we propose the first model stealing attack against multi-exit networks to extract both the model utility and the output strategy. We employ Kernel Density Estimation to analyze the target model's output strategy and use performance loss and strategy loss to guide the training of the extracted model. Furthermore, we design a novel output strategy search algorithm to maximize the consistency between the victim model and the extracted model's output behaviors. In experiments across multiple multi-exit networks and benchmark datasets, our method always achieves accuracy and efficiency closest to the victim models.</description>

      <title>JailGuard: A Universal Detection Framework for LLM Prompt-based Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10766v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The systems and software powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Modal LLMs (MLLMs) have played a critical role in numerous scenarios. However, current LLM systems are vulnerable to prompt-based attacks, with jailbreaking attacks enabling the LLM system to generate harmful content, while hijacking attacks manipulate the LLM system to perform attacker-desired tasks, underscoring the necessity for detection tools. Unfortunately, existing detecting approaches are usually tailored to specific attacks, resulting in poor generalization in detecting various attacks across different modalities. To address it, we propose JailGuard, a universal detection framework deployed on top of LLM systems for prompt-based attacks across text and image modalities. JailGuard operates on the principle that attacks are inherently less robust than benign ones. Specifically, JailGuard mutates untrusted inputs to generate variants and leverages the discrepancy of the variants' responses on the target model to distinguish attack samples from benign samples. We implement 18 mutators for text and image inputs and design a mutator combination policy to further improve detection generalization. The evaluation on the dataset containing 15 known attack types suggests that JailGuard achieves the best detection accuracy of 86.14%/82.90% on text and image inputs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 11.81%-25.73% and 12.20%-21.40%.</description>

      <title>Systematic Categorization, Construction and Evaluation of New Attacks against Multi-modal Mobile GUI Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into mobile GUI agents has significantly enhanced user efficiency and experience. However, this advancement also introduces potential security vulnerabilities that have yet to be thoroughly explored. In this paper, we present a systematic security investigation of multi-modal mobile GUI agents, addressing this critical gap in the existing literature. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we propose a novel threat modeling methodology, leading to the discovery and feasibility analysis of 34 previously unreported attacks, and (2) we design an attack framework to systematically construct and evaluate these threats. Through a combination of real-world case studies and extensive dataset-driven experiments, we validate the severity and practicality of those attacks, highlighting the pressing need for robust security measures in mobile GUI systems.</description>

      <title>MARTSIA: Safeguarding Data Confidentiality in Blockchain-Driven Process Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchain technology streamlines multi-party collaborations in decentralized settings, especially when trust is limited or difficult to establish. While public blockchains enhance transparency and reliability by replicating data across all network nodes, they also conflict with confidentiality. Here, we introduce Multi-Authority Approach to Transaction Systems for Interoperating Applications (MARTSIA) to address this challenge. MARTSIA provides fine-grained read-access control at the message-part level by combining user-defined policies with certifier-declared attributes. The approach guarantees that even though data is replicated across the network to maintain consistency, fault tolerance, and availability, its confidentiality is securely preserved through encryption. To this end, MARTSIA integrates blockchain technologies, Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption, and distributed hash-table file storages. This architecture effectively balances the transparency inherent in public blockchains with the privacy required for sensitive applications. We present the tool and its applicability in a business scenario.</description>

      <title>An FPGA-Based Open-Source Hardware-Software Framework for Side-Channel Security Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attacks based on side-channel analysis (SCA) pose a severe security threat to modern computing platforms, further exacerbated on IoT devices by their pervasiveness and handling of private and critical data. Designing SCA-resistant computing platforms requires a significant additional effort in the early stages of the IoT devices' life cycle, which is severely constrained by strict time-to-market deadlines and tight budgets. This manuscript introduces a hardware-software framework meant for SCA research on FPGA targets. It delivers an IoT-class system-on-chip (SoC) that includes a RISC-V CPU, provides observability and controllability through an ad-hoc debug infrastructure to facilitate SCA attacks and evaluate the platform's security, and streamlines the deployment of SCA countermeasures through dedicated hardware and software features such as a DFS actuator and FreeRTOS support. The open-source release of the framework includes the SoC, the scripts to configure the computing platform, compile a target application, and assess the SCA security, as well as a suite of state-of-the-art attacks and countermeasures. The goal is to foster its adoption and novel developments in the field, empowering designers and researchers to focus on studying SCA countermeasures and Attacks while relying on a sound and stable hardware-software platform as the foundation for their research.</description>

      <title>From ML to LLM: Evaluating the Robustness of Phishing Webpage Detection Models against Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phishing attacks attempt to deceive users into stealing sensitive information, posing a significant cybersecurity threat. Advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have led to the development of numerous phishing webpage detection solutions, but these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Evaluating their robustness against adversarial phishing webpages is essential. Existing tools contain datasets of pre-designed phishing webpages for a limited number of brands, and lack diversity in phishing features.
  To address these challenges, we develop PhishOracle, a tool that generates adversarial phishing webpages by embedding diverse phishing features into legitimate webpages. We evaluate the robustness of three existing task-specific models -- Stack model, VisualPhishNet, and Phishpedia -- against PhishOracle-generated adversarial phishing webpages and observe a significant drop in their detection rates. In contrast, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based phishing detector demonstrates stronger robustness against these adversarial attacks but still is prone to evasion. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of phishing detection models to adversarial attacks, emphasizing the need for more robust detection approaches. Furthermore, we conduct a user study to evaluate whether PhishOracle-generated adversarial phishing webpages can deceive users. The results show that many of these phishing webpages evade not only existing detection models but also users. We also develop the PhishOracle web app, allowing users to input a legitimate URL, select relevant phishing features and generate a corresponding phishing webpage. All resources will be made publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>h4rm3l: A language for Composable Jailbreak Attack Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their demonstrated valuable capabilities, state-of-the-art (SOTA) widely deployed large language models (LLMs) still have the potential to cause harm to society due to the ineffectiveness of their safety filters, which can be bypassed by prompt transformations called jailbreak attacks. Current approaches to LLM safety assessment, which employ datasets of templated prompts and benchmarking pipelines, fail to cover sufficiently large and diverse sets of jailbreak attacks, leading to the widespread deployment of unsafe LLMs. Recent research showed that novel jailbreak attacks could be derived by composition; however, a formal composable representation for jailbreak attacks, which, among other benefits, could enable the exploration of a large compositional space of jailbreak attacks through program synthesis methods, has not been previously proposed. We introduce h4rm3l, a novel approach that addresses this gap with a human-readable domain-specific language (DSL). Our framework comprises: (1) The h4rm3l DSL, which formally expresses jailbreak attacks as compositions of parameterized string transformation primitives. (2) A synthesizer with bandit algorithms that efficiently generates jailbreak attacks optimized for a target black box LLM. (3) The h4rm3l red-teaming software toolkit that employs the previous two components and an automated harmful LLM behavior classifier that is strongly aligned with human judgment. We demonstrate h4rm3l's efficacy by synthesizing a dataset of 2656 successful novel jailbreak attacks targeting 6 SOTA open-source and proprietary LLMs, and by benchmarking those models against a subset of these synthesized attacks. Our results show that h4rm3l's synthesized attacks are diverse and more successful than existing jailbreak attacks in literature, with success rates exceeding 90% on SOTA LLMs.</description>

Abstract: At present, in lattice-based linearly homomorphic signature schemes, especially under the standard model, there are very few schemes with tight security. This paper constructs the first lattice-based linearly homomorphic signature scheme that achieves tight security against existential unforgeability under chosen-message attacks (EUF-CMA) in the standard model. Furthermore, among existing schemes, the scheme proposed in this paper also offers certain advantages in terms of public key size, signature length, and computational cost.</description>

Abstract: The transaction pool plays a critical role in processing and disseminating transactions in cryptocurrency networks. However, increasing transaction loads strain the resources of full node deployments. We present Neonpool, an innovative transaction pool optimization using bloom filter variants, which reduces the memory footprint of the transaction pool to a fraction. Implemented in C++ and benchmarked using a unique Bitcoin and Ethereum dataset, our solution verifies and forwards transactions with over 99.99\% accuracy and does not necessitate a hard fork. Neonpool is ideally suited for lightweight cryptocurrency clients and for resource-constrained devices such as browsers, systems-on-a-chip, mobile or IoT devices.</description>

      <title>Privacy Bills of Materials: A Transparent Privacy Information Inventory for Collaborative Privacy Notice Generation in Mobile App Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Privacy regulations mandate that developers must provide authentic and comprehensive privacy notices, e.g., privacy policies or labels, to inform users of their apps' privacy practices. However, due to a lack of knowledge of privacy requirements, developers often struggle to create accurate privacy notices, especially for sophisticated mobile apps with complex features and in crowded development teams. To address these challenges, we introduce Privacy Bills of Materials (PriBOM), a systematic software engineering approach that leverages different development team roles to better capture and coordinate mobile app privacy information. PriBOM facilitates transparency-centric privacy documentation and specific privacy notice creation, enabling traceability and trackability of privacy practices. We present a pre-fill of PriBOM based on static analysis and privacy notice analysis techniques. We demonstrate the perceived usefulness of PriBOM through a human evaluation with 150 diverse participants. Our findings suggest that PriBOM could serve as a significant solution for providing privacy support in DevOps for mobile apps.</description>

      <title>Poisoned Source Code Detection in Code Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning models have gained popularity for conducting various tasks involving source code. However, their black-box nature raises concerns about potential risks. One such risk is a poisoning attack, where an attacker intentionally contaminates the training set with malicious samples to mislead the model's predictions in specific scenarios. To protect source code models from poisoning attacks, we introduce CodeGarrison (CG), a hybrid deep-learning model that relies on code embeddings to identify poisoned code samples. We evaluated CG against the state-of-the-art technique ONION for detecting poisoned samples generated by DAMP, MHM, ALERT, as well as a novel poisoning technique named CodeFooler. Results showed that CG significantly outperformed ONION with an accuracy of 93.5%. We also tested CG's robustness against unknown attacks, achieving an average accuracy of 85.6% in identifying poisoned samples across the four attacks mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Order Fairness Evaluation of DAG-based ledgers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Order fairness in distributed ledgers refers to properties that relate the order in which transactions are sent or received to the order in which they are eventually finalized, i.e., totally ordered. The study of such properties is relatively new and has been especially stimulated by the rise of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attacks in blockchain environments. Indeed, in many classical blockchain protocols, leaders are responsible for selecting the transactions to be included in blocks, which creates a clear vulnerability and opportunity for transaction order manipulation.
  Unlike blockchains, DAG-based ledgers allow participants in the network to independently propose blocks, which are then arranged as vertices of a directed acyclic graph. Interestingly, leaders in DAG-based ledgers are elected only after the fact, once transactions are already part of the graph, to determine their total order. In other words, transactions are not chosen by single leaders; instead, they are collectively validated by the nodes, and leaders are only elected to establish an ordering. This approach intuitively reduces the risk of transaction manipulation and enhances fairness.
  In this paper, we aim to quantify the capability of DAG-based ledgers to achieve order fairness. To this end, we define new variants of order fairness adapted to DAG-based ledgers and evaluate the impact of an adversary capable of compromising a limited number of nodes (below the one-third threshold) to reorder transactions. We analyze how often our order fairness properties are violated under different network conditions and parameterizations of the DAG algorithm, depending on the adversary's power.
  Our study shows that DAG-based ledgers are still vulnerable to reordering attacks, as an adversary can coordinate a minority of Byzantine nodes to manipulate the DAG's structure.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: Detecting Black-box Adversarial Attacks in the Making through Query Update Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks remain a significant threat that can jeopardize the integrity of Machine Learning (ML) models. In particular, query-based black-box attacks can generate malicious noise without having access to the victim model's architecture, making them practical in real-world contexts. The community has proposed several defenses against adversarial attacks, only to be broken by more advanced and adaptive attack strategies. In this paper, we propose a framework that detects if an adversarial noise instance is being generated. Unlike existing stateful defenses that detect adversarial noise generation by monitoring the input space, our approach learns adversarial patterns in the input update similarity space. In fact, we propose to observe a new metric called Delta Similarity (DS), which we show it captures more efficiently the adversarial behavior. We evaluate our approach against 8 state-of-the-art attacks, including adaptive attacks, where the adversary is aware of the defense and tries to evade detection. We find that our approach is significantly more robust than existing defenses both in terms of specificity and sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Secure On-Device Video OOD Detection Without Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability of machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. While deploying personalized OOD detection directly on edge devices is desirable, it remains challenging due to large model sizes and the computational infeasibility of on-device training. Federated learning partially addresses this but still requires gradient computation and backpropagation, exceeding the capabilities of many edge devices. To overcome these challenges, we propose SecDOOD, a secure cloud-device collaboration framework for efficient on-device OOD detection without requiring device-side backpropagation. SecDOOD utilizes cloud resources for model training while ensuring user data privacy by retaining sensitive information on-device. Central to SecDOOD is a HyperNetwork-based personalized parameter generation module, which adapts cloud-trained models to device-specific distributions by dynamically generating local weight adjustments, effectively combining central and local information without local fine-tuning. Additionally, our dynamic feature sampling and encryption strategy selectively encrypts only the most informative feature channels, largely reducing encryption overhead without compromising detection performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and OOD scenarios demonstrate that SecDOOD achieves performance comparable to fully fine-tuned models, enabling secure, efficient, and personalized OOD detection on resource-limited edge devices. To enhance accessibility and reproducibility, our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Dystopians/SecDOOD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of cloud computing and data-driven applications has amplified privacy concerns, driven by the increasing demand to process sensitive data securely. Homomorphic encryption (HE) has become a vital solution for addressing these concerns by enabling computations on encrypted data without revealing its contents. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of two leading HE libraries, SEAL and OpenFHE, examining their performance, usability, and support for prominent HE schemes such as BGV and CKKS. Our analysis highlights computational efficiency, memory usage, and scalability across Linux and Windows platforms, emphasizing their applicability in real-world scenarios. Results reveal that Linux outperforms Windows in computation efficiency, with OpenFHE emerging as the optimal choice across diverse cryptographic settings. This paper provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners to advance privacy-preserving applications using FHE.</description>

      <title>Permute-and-Flip: An optimally stable and watermarkable decoder for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05864v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new decoding method called Permute-and-Flip (PF) decoder. It enjoys stability properties similar to the standard sampling decoder, but is provably up to 2x better in its quality-stability tradeoff than sampling and never worse than any other decoder. We also design a cryptographic watermarking scheme analogous to Aaronson (2023)'s Gumbel watermark, but naturally tailored for PF decoder. The watermarking scheme does not change the distribution to sample, while allowing arbitrarily low false positive rate and high recall whenever the generated text has high entropy. Our experiments show that the PF decoder (and its watermarked counterpart) significantly outperform(s) naive sampling (and its Gumbel watermarked counterpart) in terms of perplexity, while retaining the same stability (and detectability), hence making it a promising new approach for LLM decoding.

      <title>TuBA: Cross-Lingual Transferability of Backdoor Attacks in LLMs with Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The implications of backdoor attacks on English-centric large language models (LLMs) have been widely examined - such attacks can be achieved by embedding malicious behaviors during training and activated under specific conditions that trigger malicious outputs. Despite the increasing support for multilingual capabilities in open-source and proprietary LLMs, the impact of backdoor attacks on these systems remains largely under-explored. Our research focuses on cross-lingual backdoor attacks against multilingual LLMs, particularly investigating how poisoning the instruction-tuning data for one or two languages can affect the outputs for languages whose instruction-tuning data were not poisoned. Despite its simplicity, our empirical analysis reveals that our method exhibits remarkable efficacy in models like mT5 and GPT-4o, with high attack success rates, surpassing 90% in more than 7 out of 12 languages across various scenarios. Our findings also indicate that more powerful models show increased susceptibility to transferable cross-lingual backdoor attacks, which also applies to LLMs predominantly pre-trained on English data, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Gemma. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate 1) High Transferability: the backdoor mechanism operates successfully in cross-lingual response scenarios across 26 languages, achieving an average attack success rate of 99%, and 2) Robustness: the proposed attack remains effective even after defenses are applied. These findings expose critical security vulnerabilities in multilingual LLMs and highlight the urgent need for more robust, targeted defense strategies to address the unique challenges posed by cross-lingual backdoor transfer.</description>

      <title>Unclonable Functional Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a functional encryption (FE) scheme, a user that holds a ciphertext and a function key can learn the result of applying the function to the plaintext message. Security requires that the user does not learn anything beyond the function evaluation. We extend this notion to the quantum setting by providing definitions and a construction for a quantum functional encryption (QFE) scheme which allows for the evaluation of polynomialy-sized circuits on arbitrary quantum messages. Our construction is built upon quantum garbled circuits [BY22]. We also investigate the relationship of QFE to the seemingly unrelated notion of unclonable encryption (UE) and find that any QFE scheme universally achieves the property of unclonable functional encryption (UFE). In particular we assume the existence of an unclonable encryption scheme with quantum decryption keys which was recently constructed by [AKY24]. Our UFE guarantees that two parties cannot simultaneously recover the correct function outputs using two independently sampled function secret keys. As an application we give the first construction for public-key UE with variable decryption keys. Lastly, we establish a connection between quantum indistinguishability obfuscation (qiO) and quantum functional encryption (QFE); Showing that any multi-input indistinguishability-secure quantum functional encryption scheme unconditionally implies the existence of qiO.</description>

      <title>Robust Watermarking Using Generative Priors Against Image Editing: From Benchmarking to Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current image watermarking methods are vulnerable to advanced image editing techniques enabled by large-scale text-to-image models. These models can distort embedded watermarks during editing, posing significant challenges to copyright protection. In this work, we introduce W-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of watermarking methods against a wide range of image editing techniques, including image regeneration, global editing, local editing, and image-to-video generation. Through extensive evaluations of eleven representative watermarking methods against prevalent editing techniques, we demonstrate that most methods fail to detect watermarks after such edits. To address this limitation, we propose VINE, a watermarking method that significantly enhances robustness against various image editing techniques while maintaining high image quality. Our approach involves two key innovations: (1) we analyze the frequency characteristics of image editing and identify that blurring distortions exhibit similar frequency properties, which allows us to use them as surrogate attacks during training to bolster watermark robustness; (2) we leverage a large-scale pretrained diffusion model SDXL-Turbo, adapting it for the watermarking task to achieve more imperceptible and robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that our method achieves outstanding watermarking performance under various image editing techniques, outperforming existing methods in both image quality and robustness.

      <description>arXiv:2410.19371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides robust privacy guarantees for statistical inference, but this can lead to unreliable results and biases in downstream applications. While several noise-aware approaches have been proposed which integrate DP perturbation into the inference, they are limited to specific types of simple probabilistic models. In this work, we propose a novel method for noise-aware approximate Bayesian inference based on stochastic gradient variational inference which can also be applied to high-dimensional and non-conjugate models. We also propose a more accurate evaluation method for noise-aware posteriors. Empirically, our inference method has similar performance to existing methods in the domain where they are applicable. Outside this domain, we obtain accurate coverages on high-dimensional Bayesian linear regression and well-calibrated predictive probabilities on Bayesian logistic regression with the UCI Adult dataset.</description>

      <title>GuardSplat: Efficient and Robust Watermarking for 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19895v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently created impressive 3D assets for various applications. However, considering security, capacity, invisibility, and training efficiency, the copyright of 3DGS assets is not well protected as existing watermarking methods are unsuited for its rendering pipeline. In this paper, we propose GuardSplat, an innovative and efficient framework for watermarking 3DGS assets. Specifically, 1) We propose a CLIP-guided pipeline for optimizing the message decoder with minimal costs. The key objective is to achieve high-accuracy extraction by leveraging CLIP's aligning capability and rich representations, demonstrating exceptional capacity and efficiency. 2) We tailor a Spherical-Harmonic-aware (SH-aware) Message Embedding module for 3DGS, seamlessly embedding messages into the SH features of each 3D Gaussian while preserving the original 3D structure. This enables watermarking 3DGS assets with minimal fidelity trade-offs and prevents malicious users from removing the watermarks from the model files, meeting the demands for invisibility and security. 3) We present an Anti-distortion Message Extraction module to improve robustness against various distortions. Experiments demonstrate that GuardSplat outperforms state-of-the-art and achieves fast optimization speed.

      <title>Proactive Adversarial Defense: Harnessing Prompt Tuning in Vision-Language Models to Detect Unseen Backdoored Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat by embedding hidden triggers into inputs, causing models to misclassify them into target labels. While extensive research has focused on mitigating these attacks in object recognition models through weight fine-tuning, much less attention has been given to detecting backdoored samples directly. Given the vast datasets used in training, manual inspection for backdoor triggers is impractical, and even state-of-the-art defense mechanisms fail to fully neutralize their impact. To address this gap, we introduce a groundbreaking method to detect unseen backdoored images during both training and inference. Leveraging the transformative success of prompt tuning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), our approach trains learnable text prompts to differentiate clean images from those with hidden backdoor triggers. Experiments demonstrate the exceptional efficacy of this method, achieving an impressive average accuracy of 86% across two renowned datasets for detecting unseen backdoor triggers, establishing a new standard in backdoor defense.</description>

      <title>Mark Your LLM: Detecting the Misuse of Open-Source Large Language Models via Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As open-source large language models (LLMs) like Llama3 become more capable, it is crucial to develop watermarking techniques to detect their potential misuse. Existing watermarking methods either add watermarks during LLM inference, which is unsuitable for open-source LLMs, or primarily target classification LLMs rather than recent generative LLMs. Adapting these watermarks to open-source LLMs for misuse detection remains an open challenge. This work defines two misuse scenarios for open-source LLMs: intellectual property (IP) violation and LLM Usage Violation. Then, we explore the application of inference-time watermark distillation and backdoor watermarking in these contexts. We propose comprehensive evaluation methods to assess the impact of various real-world further fine-tuning scenarios on watermarks and the effect of these watermarks on LLM performance. Our experiments reveal that backdoor watermarking could effectively detect IP Violation, while inference-time watermark distillation is applicable in both scenarios but less robust to further fine-tuning and has a more significant impact on LLM performance compared to backdoor watermarking. Exploring more advanced watermarking methods for open-source LLMs to detect their misuse should be an important future direction.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Backdoor Attacks on Time Series Classification in the Frequency Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is a cornerstone of modern web applications, powering tasks such as financial data analysis, network traffic monitoring, and user behavior analysis. In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have greatly enhanced the performance of TSC models in these critical domains. However, DNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers can covertly implant triggers into models to induce malicious outcomes. Existing backdoor attacks targeting DNN-based TSC models remain elementary. In particular, early methods borrow trigger designs from computer vision, which are ineffective for time series data. More recent approaches utilize generative models for trigger generation, but at the cost of significant computational complexity. In this work, we analyze the limitations of existing attacks and introduce an enhanced method, FreqBack. Drawing inspiration from the fact that DNN models inherently capture frequency domain features in time series data, we identify that improper perturbations in the frequency domain are the root cause of ineffective attacks. To address this, we propose to generate triggers both effectively and efficiently, guided by frequency analysis. FreqBack exhibits substantial performance across five models and eight datasets, achieving an impressive attack success rate of over 90%, while maintaining less than a 3% drop in model accuracy on clean data.</description>

      <title>Siege: Autonomous Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Large Language Models with Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Siege, a multi-turn adversarial framework that models the gradual erosion of Large Language Model (LLM) safety through a tree search perspective. Unlike single-turn jailbreaks that rely on one meticulously engineered prompt, Siege expands the conversation at each turn in a breadth-first fashion, branching out multiple adversarial prompts that exploit partial compliance from previous responses. By tracking these incremental policy leaks and re-injecting them into subsequent queries, Siege reveals how minor concessions can accumulate into fully disallowed outputs. Evaluations on the JailbreakBench dataset show that Siege achieves a 100% success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo and 97% on GPT-4 in a single multi-turn run, using fewer queries than baselines such as Crescendo or GOAT. This tree search methodology offers an in-depth view of how model safeguards degrade over successive dialogue turns, underscoring the urgency of robust multi-turn testing procedures for language models.</description>
