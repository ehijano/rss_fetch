      <title>From Failure Modes to Reliability Awareness in Generative and Agentic AI System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter bridges technical analysis and organizational preparedness by tracing the path from layered failure modes to reliability awareness in generative and agentic AI systems. We first introduce an 11-layer failure stack, a structured framework for identifying vulnerabilities ranging from hardware and power foundations to adaptive learning and agentic reasoning. Building on this, the chapter demonstrates how failures rarely occur in isolation but propagate across layers, creating cascading effects with systemic consequences. To complement this diagnostic lens, we develop the concept of awareness mapping: a maturity-oriented framework that quantifies how well individuals and organizations recognize reliability risks across the AI stack. Awareness is treated not only as a diagnostic score but also as a strategic input for AI governance, guiding improvement and resilience planning. By linking layered failures to awareness levels and further integrating this into Dependability-Centred Asset Management (DCAM), the chapter positions awareness mapping as both a measurement tool and a roadmap for trustworthy and sustainable AI deployment across mission-critical domains.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Function Encoder-Based Differentiable Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05757v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a differentiable framework for zero-shot adaptive control over parametric families of nonlinear dynamical systems. Our approach integrates a function encoder-based neural ODE (FE-NODE) for modeling system dynamics with a differentiable predictive control (DPC) for offline self-supervised learning of explicit control policies. The FE-NODE captures nonlinear behaviors in state transitions and enables zero-shot adaptation to new systems without retraining, while the DPC efficiently learns control policies across system parameterizations, thus eliminating costly online optimization common in classical model predictive control. We demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and online adaptability of the proposed method across a range of nonlinear systems with varying parametric scenarios, highlighting its potential as a general-purpose tool for fast zero-shot adaptive control.</description>

      <title>Log-linear Backstepping control on $SE_2(3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the rigid-body systems which evolve on nonlinear Lie groups where Euclidean control designs lose geometric meaning. In this paper, we introduce a log-linear backstepping control law on SE2(3) that preserves full rotational-translational coupling. Leveraging a class of mixed-invariant system, which is a group-affine dynamic model, we derive exact logarithmic error dynamics that are linear in the Lie algebra. The closed-form expressions for the left- and right-Jacobian inverses of SE2(3) are expressed in the paper, which provides us the exact error dynamics without local approximations. A log-linear backstepping control design ensures exponential stability for our error dynamics; since our error dynamics is a block-triangular structure, this allows us to use Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) formulation or $H_\infty$ gain performance design. This work establishes the exact backstepping framework for a class of mixed-invariant system, providing a geometrically consistent foundation for future Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and spacecraft control design.</description>

      <title>Autonomous and Distributed Synchronization and Restoration of an Islanded Network of Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition towards clean energy and the introduction of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) are leading to the formation of Microgrids (MGs) and Network of MGs (NMGs). MGs and NMGs can operate autonomously in islanded mode, which requires Grid-Forming (GFM) IBRs that can perform black start, synchronization, restoration and regulation. However, such IBRs face synchronization instability issues, which might be worsened by inadequate secondary level frequency and voltage regulation. Accordingly, we propose an autonomous and distributed synchronization and restoration scheme using Distributed-Averaging Proportional-Integral (DAPI) control. To validate the proposed method, we model and simulate a high-fidelity islanded and modified IEEE 123 bus system, modeled as an NMG consisting of 7 MGs. The simulation results demonstrate an effective autonomous soft-start, synchronization, connection and regulation procedure using DAPI control and distributed breaker operation logic.</description>

      <title>Policy Gradient-Based EMT-in-the-Loop Learning to Mitigate Sub-Synchronous Control Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the development of learning-based tunable control gains using EMT-in-the-loop simulation framework (e.g., PSCAD interfaced with Python-based learning modules) to address critical sub-synchronous oscillations. Since sub-synchronous control interactions (SSCI) arise from the mis-tuning of control gains under specific grid configurations, effective mitigation strategies require adaptive re-tuning of these gains. Such adaptiveness can be achieved by employing a closed-loop, learning-based framework that considers the grid conditions responsible for such sub-synchronous oscillations. This paper addresses this need by adopting methodologies inspired by Markov decision process (MDP) based reinforcement learning (RL), with a particular emphasis on simpler deep policy gradient methods with additional SSCI-specific signal processing modules such as down-sampling, bandpass filtering, and oscillation energy dependent reward computations. Our experimentation in a real-world event setting demonstrates that the deep policy gradient based trained policy can adaptively compute gain settings in response to varying grid conditions and optimally suppress control interaction-induced oscillations.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Multi-Stage Strategy for a Fixed-Wing Aircraft to Evade a Missile Detected at a Short Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Missiles pose a major threat to aircraft in modern air combat. Advances in technology make them increasingly difficult to detect until they are close to the target and highly resistant to jamming. The evasion maneuver is the last line of defense for an aircraft. However, conventional rule-based evasion strategies are limited by computational demands and aerodynamic constraints, and existing learning-based approaches remain unconvincing for manned aircraft against modern missiles. To enhance aircraft survivability, this study investigates missile evasion inspired by the pursuit-evasion game between a gazelle and a cheetah and proposes a multi-stage reinforcement learning-based evasion strategy. The strategy learns a large azimuth policy to turn to evade, a small azimuth policy to keep moving away, and a short distance policy to perform agile aggressive maneuvers to avoid. One of the three policies is activated at each stage based on distance and azimuth. To evaluate performance, a high-fidelity simulation environment modeling an F-16 aircraft and missile under various conditions is used to compare the proposed approach with baseline strategies. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance, enabling the F-16 aircraft to successfully avoid missiles with a probability of 80.89 percent for velocities ranging from 800 m/s to 1400 m/s, maximum overloads from 40 g to 50 g, detection distances from 5000 m to 15000 m, and random azimuths. When the missile is detected beyond 8000 m, the success ratio increases to 85.06 percent.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Control of Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a general framework for multi-agent control synthesis, which applies to a wide range of problems with convergence guarantees, regardless of the complexity of the underlying graph topology and the explicit time dependence of the objective function. The proposed framework systematically addresses a particularly challenging problem in multi-agent systems, i.e., decentralization of entangled dynamics among different agents, and it naturally supports multi-objective robotics and real-time implementations. To demonstrate its generality and effectiveness, the framework is implemented across three experiments, namely time-varying leader-follower formation control, decentralized coverage control for time-varying density functions without any approximations, which is a long-standing open problem, and safe formation navigation in dense environments.</description>

      <title>Parameter Recovery from Tangential Interpolations for Systems with an LFT Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how to recover parameters of a linear time invariant system from values and derivatives of its transfer function matrix, along several particular directions at a prescribed set of points in the complex plane, in which system matrices depend on these parameters through a linear fractional transformation. A necessary and sufficient condition is derived for a unique determination of these system parameters, which is expressed by a vector inequality. Under some particular situations, this condition reduces to a full column rank requirement on a constant matrix. Moreover, a method is given to recover system parameters from these values and derivatives, which is expressed by a vector linear equation with some rank constraints, for which various methods exist for finding its solutions. Robustness of the suggested recovery method is also clarified. A numerical example is given to illustrate characteristics of the suggested method, as well as effectiveness of derivative information introduction in parameter recovery, in which natural frequency and damping ratio are to be recovered for a transfer function.</description>

      <title>Probe-and-Release Coordination of Platoons at Highway Bottlenecks with Unknown Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers coordination of platoons of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at mixed-autonomy bottlenecks in the face of three practically important factors, viz. time-varying traffic demand, random CAV platoon sizes, and capacity breakdowns. Platoon coordination is essential to smoothen the interaction between CAV platoons and non-CAV traffic. Based on a fluid queuing model, we develop a "probe-and-release" algorithm that simultaneously estimates environmental parameters and coordinates CAV platoons for traffic stabilization. We show that this algorithm ensures bounded estimation errors and bounded traffic queues. The proof builds on a Lyapunov function that jointly penalizes estimation errors and traffic queues and a drift argument for an embedded Markov process. We validate the proposed algorithm in a standard micro-simulation environment and compare against a representative deep reinforcement learning method in terms of control performance and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Koopman Operator for Stability Analysis: Theory with a Linear--Radial Product Reproducing Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman operator, as a fully linear representation of nonlinear dynamical systems, if well-defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), can be efficiently learned from data. For stability analysis and control-related problems, it is desired that the defining RKHS of the Koopman operator should account for both the stability of an equilibrium point (as a local property) and the regularity of the dynamics on the state space (as a global property). To this end, we show that by using the product kernel formed by the linear kernel and a Wendland radial kernel, the resulting RKHS is invariant under the action of Koopman operator (under certain smoothness conditions). Furthermore, when the equilibrium is asymptotically stable, the spectrum of Koopman operator is provably confined inside the unit circle, and escapes therefrom upon bifurcation. Thus, the learned Koopman operator with provable probabilistic error bound provides a stability certificate. In addition to numerical verification, we further discuss how such a fundamental spectrum--stability relation would be useful for Koopman-based control.</description>

      <title>Model-free Adaptive Output Feedback Vibration Suppression in a Cantilever Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a model-free adaptive control approach to suppress vibrations in a cantilevered beam excited by an unknown disturbance. The cantilevered beam under harmonic excitation is modeled using a lumped parameter approach. Based on retrospective cost optimization, a sampled-data adaptive controller is developed to suppress vibrations caused by external disturbances. Both displacement and acceleration measurements are considered for feedback. Since acceleration measurements are more sensitive to spillover, which excites higher frequency modes, a filter is developed to extract key displacement information from the acceleration data and enhance suppression performance. The vibration suppression performance is compared using both displacement and acceleration measurements.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Criterion Approach to Smart EV Charging with CO2 Emissions and Cost Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel three-step framework for smart electric vehicle (EV) charging that jointly minimizes charging costs and CO2 emissions. Drawing inspiration from the classical Unit Commitment Problem (UCP), we first design a linear model to determine the optimal power generation mix over a 24-hour horizon, using real-world data from Vietnam, a country with a highly carbon intensive energy system. This allows us to estimate time-varying CO2 emissions and translate them into an emission cost signal. We then incorporate this environmental cost into a smart charging optimization model, formulated as a linear program (LP). Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed strategy significantly outperforms a baseline First-In-First-Served (FIFS) approach, achieving notable reductions in both CO2 emissions and charging costs also compared to another optimization approach. The results demonstrate the potential of this multiobjective optimization framework to support more sustainable and cost-efficient EV charging strategies.</description>

      <title>A Passive Software-Defined Radio-based mmWave Sensing System for Blind Integrated Communication and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is considered as a key component of future 6G technologies, especially in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. Recently, the performances of ISAC were experimentally evaluated and demonstrated in various scenarios by developing ISAC systems. These systems generally consist of coherent transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) modules. However, actively transmitting radio waves for experiments is not easy due to regulatory restrictions of radio. Meanwhile, the Tx/Rx should be synchronized and Rx need the information of Tx. In this paper, a fully passive mmWave sensing system is developed with software-defined radio for blind ISAC. It only consists of a passive Rx module which does not depend on the Tx. Since the proposed system is not synchronized with Tx and has no knowledge of the transmitted signals, a differential structure with two oppositely-oriented receivers is introduced to realize the sensing function. This structure can mitigate the influences of unknown source signals and other distortions. With the proposed sensing system, the ambient mmWave communication signals are leveraged for sensing without interrupting the existing systems. It can be deployed for field applications such as signal detection and dynamic human activity recognition since it does not emit signals. The efficacy of the developed system is first verified with a metallic plate with known motion pattern. The measured Doppler spectrogram shows good agreement with the simulation results, demonstrating the correctness of the sensing results. Further, the system is evaluated in complex scenarios, including handwaving, single- and multi-person motion detection. The sensing results successfully reflect the corresponding motions, demonstrating that the proposed sensing system can be utilized for blind ISAC in various applications.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Robust Bayesian Persuasion with Conformal Prediction Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Bayesian persuasion assumes that senders fully understand how receivers form beliefs and make decisions--an assumption that rarely holds when receivers possess private information or exhibit non-Bayesian behavior. In this paper, we develop a learning-based framework that integrates neural networks with conformal prediction to achieve robust persuasion under uncertainty about receiver belief formation. The proposed neural architecture learns end-to-end mappings from receiver observations and sender signals to action predictions, eliminating the need to identify belief mechanisms explicitly. Conformal prediction constructs finite-sample valid prediction sets with provable marginal coverage, enabling principled, distribution-free robust optimization. We establish exact coverage guarantees for the data-generating policy and derive bounds on coverage degradation under policy shifts. Furthermore, we provide neural network approximation and estimation error bounds, with sample complexity $O(d \log(|\mathcal{U}||\mathcal{Y}||\mathcal{S}|)/\varepsilon^2)$, where $d$ denotes the effective network dimension, and finite-sample lower bounds on the sender's expected utility. Numerical experiments on smart-grid energy management illustrate the framework's robustness.</description>

      <title>Coherency Analysis in Nonlinear Heterogeneous Power Networks: A Blended Dynamics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power system coherency refers to the phenomenon that machines in a power network exhibit similar frequency responses after disturbances, and is foundational for model reduction and control design. Despite abundant empirical observations, the understanding of coherence in complex power networks remains incomplete where the dynamics could be highly heterogeneous, nonlinear, and increasingly affected by persistent disturbances such as renewable energy fluctuations. To bridge this gap, this paper extends the blended dynamics approach, originally rooted in consensus analysis of multi-agent systems, to develop a novel coherency analysis in power networks. We show that the frequency responses of coherent machines coupled by nonlinear power flow can be approximately represented by the blended dynamics, which is a weighted average of nonlinear heterogeneous nodal dynamics, even under time-varying disturbances. Specifically, by developing novel bounds on the difference between the trajectories of nodal dynamics and the blended dynamics, we identify two key factors -- either high network connectivity or small time-variation rate of disturbances -- that contribute to coherence. They enable the nodal frequencies to rapidly approach the blended-dynamics trajectory from arbitrary initial state. Furthermore, they ensure the frequencies closely follow this trajectory in the long term, even when the system does not settle to an equilibrium. These insights contribute to the understanding of power system coherency and are further supported by simulation results.</description>

      <title>Partial-Power Flow Controller, Voltage Regulator, and Energy Router for Hybrid AC-DC Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The share of electronically converted power from renewable sources, loads, and storage is continuously growing in the low- and medium-voltage grids. These sources and loads typically rectify the grid AC to DC, e.g., for a DC link, so that a DC grid could eliminate hardware and losses of these conversion stages. However, extended DC grids lack the stabilizing nature of AC impedances so that the voltage is more fragile and power flows may need active control, particularly if redundancy as known from AC, such as rings and meshing, is desired. Furthermore, a DC infrastructure will not replace but will need to interface with the existing AC grid. This paper presents a partial-power energy router architecture that can interface multiple AC and DC lines to enable precise control of voltages and both active as well as reactive power flows. The proposed system uses modular low-voltage high-current series modules supplied through dual active bridges. These modules only need to process a small share of the voltage to control large power flows. The topology reduces component size, cost, energy losses, and reliability more than three times compared to conventional technology. The optional integration of battery energy storage can furthermore eliminate the need for the sum of the power flows of all inputs to be zero at all times. Through dynamic voltage injection relative to the line voltage, the modules effectively balance feeder currents, regulate reactive power, and improve the power factor in AC grids. Real-time hardware-in-the-loop and prototype measurements validate the proposed energy router's performance under diverse operating conditions. Experimental results confirm the series module's functionality in both AC and DC grids as an effective solution for controlling extended grids, including power sharing, voltage, and power quality.</description>

      <title>Optical Network Digital Twin -- Commercialization Barriers, Value Proposition, Early Use Cases, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of AI, machine-to-machine communications are rapidly increasing, reshaping the requirements for optical networks. Recent advances in Gaussian noise modeling for digital coherent transmission have raised expectations for digital-twin-based operation. However, unlike digital twins in wireless communication, which are already well established, significant barriers remain for commercialization in optical networks. This paper discusses the evolving requirements of optical networks in the AI era and proposes an Optical Network Digital Twin architecture that enables flexible end-to-end light path operation beyond conventional management. The value propositions of the proposed architecture, its evolutionary steps toward commercialization, and key research challenges for practical deployment are presented.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Electric Vehicle Charging Pricing for Load Balancing in Power Distribution Networks based on Collaborative DDPG Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from the Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs) to the Electric Vehicles (EVs) is globally recommended to combat the unfavourable environmental conditions caused by reliance on fossil fuels. However, it has been established that the charging of EVs can destabilize the grid when they penetrate the market in large numbers, especially in grids that were not initially built to handle the load from the charging of EVs. In this work, we present a dynamic EV charging pricing strategy that fulfills the following three objectives: distribution network-level load peak-shaving, valley-filling, and load balancing across distribution networks. Based on historical environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, EV charging prices and distribution of vehicles in different areas in different times of the day, we first forecast the distribution network load demand, and then use deep reinforcement learning approach to set the optimal dynamic EV charging price. While most research seeks to achieve load peak-shaving and valley-filling to stabilize the grid, our work goes further into exploring the load-balancing between the distribution networks in the close vicinity to each other. We compare the performance of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms for this purpose. The best algorithm is used for dymamic EV pricing. Simulation results show an improved utilization of the grid at the distribution network level, leading to the optimal usage of the grid on a larger scale.</description>

      <title>Sensor Importance towards Observability Degree via Shapley Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensor selection is an often under-appreciated aspect of state estimator or Kalman filter design. The basic minimum requirement for the choice of a sensor set while designing Kalman filters is that all states are observable. In addition, the sensors should be chosen with a view towards estimating the states with a desired accuracy. Often observability is treated as true/false check during filter design. Beyond observability -- the observability degree -- which measures \emph{how observable} the states are, has been used as the metric of choice to for sensor selection or placement applications. The higher the degree of observability, the better the possibility of designing Kalman filters that achieve the desired state estimation accuracy and consistency requirements. When a wide variety of sensors are available, sometimes with cost and physical constraints involved, sensor selection plays a crucial role in filter design. In such situations it is important to know the expected contribution of each sensor towards observability degree. Shapley values, developed in cooperative game theory for fair allocation of the payout of a multi-player game to individual players, are widely used in machine learning to assess feature importance. This paper shows that Shapley values can indeed be leveraged to quantify the expected marginal contribution of each sensor in any given sensor set towards the observability degree. This quantification of the fair contribution of each sensor towards the observability degree can be leveraged by filter designers for sensor selection, placement and filter (state estimator) design.</description>

      <title>Optimal Rank-1 Directional State Transition Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optimal rank-1 approximation of state transition tensors was developed as an efficient alternative to state transition tensors for nonlinear uncertainty quantification. While previous directional state transition tensors used the dominant right singular subspace of the state transition matrix to construct a reduced-dimension representation of the state transition tensors, optimal directional state transition tensors are constructed to maximize the information retained in a rank-1 approximation of the state transition tensors in the Frobenius-norm sense. The optimal rank-1 directional state transition tensor is found by solving a tensor z-eigenpair problem of the "square" of the state transition tensor. This construct leads to increased approximation accuracy of the state transition tensors and improved Gaussian moment propagation for nonlinear flight scenarios like aerocapture.</description>

      <title>Verification of low-frequency signal injection method for earth-fault detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unearthed neutral is commonly used in networks which require continuous power supply. This is common in MV circuits of industrial and power plants. Unearthed networks can remain in operation during an earth-fault, but fast determination of the faulty line is key for prevention of further fault escalation. Signal injection is one of the fault location methods often used in LV unearthed networks. The possibility of applying this method in MV networks depends on how to inject the signal into unearthed phases. In such networks, it is possible to use a group of three inductive voltage transformers (IVTs) for signal injection. After the simulations have shown promising results of signal injection and earth-fault detection in MV network, an experimental test was performed. This paper describes the experimental setup and shows the measurement results of signal injection method at MV level supported by EMT simulations.</description>

      <title>Investigation of lightning effects on solar power plants connected to transmission networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of solar power plants into transmission grids has raised concerns about their vulnerability to disturbances, particularly lightning strokes. Solar energy, while offering significant environmental and economic benefits, faces challenges when connected to transmission lines that are prone to lightning discharges. This paper investigates the impact of lightning events on solar power plants, focusing on overvoltage effects. Lightning stroke simulations were conducted at various distances from the solar power plant along the transmission line, considering scenarios with and without surge arrester. Key lightning parameters such as peak current, front time, and tail time were varied to simulate different lightning strokes. The study also includes a Fourier transform analysis of the resulting overvoltages with and without a surge arrester, along with the Hilbert marginal spectrum of these overvoltages. The results provide insights into the effectiveness of surge arresters in mitigating lightning overvoltages and highlight the importance of proper protective measures for enhancing the reliability and safety of solar power plants connected to transmission networks.</description>

      <title>Input-Output Data-Driven Stabilization of Continuous-Time Linear MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of data-driven stabilization of continuous-time multi-input multi-output (MIMO) linear time-invariant systems using the input-output data collected from an experiment. Building on recent results for data-driven output-feedback control based on non-minimal realizations, we propose an approach that can be applied to a broad class of continuous-time MIMO systems without requiring a uniform observability index. The key idea is to show that Kreisselmeier's adaptive filter can be interpreted as an observer of a stabilizable non-minimal realization of the plant. Then, by postprocessing the input-output data with such a filter, we derive a linear matrix inequality that yields the feedback gain of a dynamic output-feedback stabilizer.</description>

      <title>Voltage-Regulated Sparse Optimization for Proactive Diagnosis of Voltage Collapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to proactively diagnose and manage the voltage collapse risks, i.e., the risk of bus voltages violating the safe operational bounds, which can be caused by extreme events and contingencies. We jointly answer two resilience-related research questions: (Q1) Survivability: Upon having an extreme event/contingency, will the system remain feasible with voltage staying within a (preferred) safe range? (Q2) Dominant Vulnerability: If voltage collapses, what are the dominant sources of system vulnerabilities responsible for the failure? This highlights some key locations worth paying attention to in the planning or decision-making process. To address these questions, we propose a voltage-regulated sparse optimization that finds a minimal set of bus locations along with quantified compensations (corrective actions) that can simultaneously enforce AC network balance and voltage bounds. Results on transmission systems of varying sizes (30-bus to 2383-bus) demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigates voltage collapses by compensating at only a few strategically identified nodes, while scaling efficiently to large systems, taking on average less than 4 min for 2000+ bus cases. This work can further serve as a backbone for more comprehensive and actionable decision-making, such as reactive power planning to fix voltage issues.</description>

      <title>Dissipativity-Based Synthesis of Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for AC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based framework for co-designing distributed controllers and communication topologies in AC microgrids (MGs). Unlike existing methods that treat control synthesis and topology design separately, we propose a unified approach that simultaneously optimizes both aspects to achieve voltage and frequency regulation and proportional power sharing among distributed generators (DGs). We formulate the closed-loop AC MG as a networked system where DGs, distribution lines, and loads are interconnected subsystems characterized by their dissipative properties. Each DG employs a hierarchical architecture combining local controllers for voltage regulation and distributed controllers for droop-free power sharing through normalized power consensus. By leveraging dissipativity theory, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for subsystem passivity and cast the co-design problem as a convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization, enabling efficient computation and guaranteed stability. Our framework systematically synthesizes sparse communication topologies while handling the coupled dq-frame dynamics and dual power flow objectives inherent to AC MGs. Simulation results on a representative AC MG demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving accurate voltage regulation, frequency synchronization, and proportional power sharing.</description>

      <title>On the Potential of Digital Twins for Distribution System State Estimation with Randomly Missing Data in Heterogeneous Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional statistical optimization-based state estimation (DSSE) algorithms rely on detailed grid parameters and mathematical assumptions of all possible uncertainties. Furthermore, random data missing due to communication failures, congestion, and cyberattacks, makes these methods easily infeasible. Inspired by recent advances in digital twins (DTs), this paper proposes an interactive attention-based DSSE model for robust grid monitoring by integrating three core components: physical entities, virtual modeling, and data fusion. To enable robustness against various data missing in heterogeneous measurements, we first propose physics-informed data augmentation and transfer. Moreover, a state-of-the-art attention-based spatiotemporal feature learning is proposed, followed by a novel cross-interaction feature fusion for robust voltage estimation. A case study in a real-world unbalanced 84-bus distribution system with raw data validates the accuracy and robustness of the proposed DT model in estimating voltage states, with random locational, arbitrary ratios (up to 40% of total measurements) of data missing.</description>

      <title>GNN-Enabled Robust Hybrid Beamforming with Score-Based CSI Generation and Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate Channel State Information (CSI) is critical for Hybrid Beamforming (HBF) tasks. However, obtaining high-resolution CSI remains challenging in practical wireless communication systems. To address this issue, we propose to utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and score-based generative models to enable robust HBF under imperfect CSI conditions. Firstly, we develop the Hybrid Message Graph Attention Network (HMGAT) which updates both node and edge features through node-level and edge-level message passing. Secondly, we design a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based Noise Conditional Score Network (NCSN) to learn the distribution of high-resolution CSI, facilitating CSI generation and data augmentation to further improve HMGAT's performance. Finally, we present a Denoising Score Network (DSN) framework and its instantiation, termed DeBERT, which can denoise imperfect CSI under arbitrary channel error levels, thereby facilitating robust HBF. Experiments on DeepMIMO urban datasets demonstrate the proposed models' superior generalization, scalability, and robustness across various HBF tasks with perfect and imperfect CSI.</description>

      <title>F2GAN: A Feature-Feedback Generative Framework for Reliable AI-Based Fault Diagnosis in Inverter-Dominated Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the reliability of AI based fault diagnosis in inverter dominated microgrids requires diverse and statistically balanced datasets. However, the scarcity and imbalance of high fidelity fault data, especially for rare inverter malfunctions and extreme external line faults, limit dependable model training and validation. This paper introduces a unified framework that models a detailed inverter dominated microgrid and systematically generates multiple internal and external fault scenarios to mitigate data scarcity and class imbalance. An enhanced generative model called F2GAN (Feature Feedback GAN) is developed to synthesize high dimensional tabular fault data with improved realism and statistical alignment. Unlike conventional GANs, F2GAN integrates multi level feedback based on mean variance, correlation, and feature matching losses, enabling the generator to refine output distributions toward real fault feature spaces. The generated datasets are evaluated through quantitative and qualitative analyses. Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) experiments demonstrate strong generalization of machine learning classifiers trained exclusively on F2GAN samples. The framework is validated on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) fault diagnosis platform integrated with a real time simulator and graphical interface, achieving 100 % diagnostic accuracy under real-time testing. Results confirm that F2GAN effectively bridges the gap between simulated and real world microgrid fault datasets</description>

      <title>Pareto-Improvement-Driven Opinion Dynamics Explaining the Emergence of Pluralistic Ignorance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opinion dynamics has recently been modeled from a game-theoretic perspective, where opinion updates are captured by individuals' cost functions representing their motivations. Conventional formulations aggregate multiple motivations into a single objective, implicitly assuming that these motivations are interchangeable. This paper challenges that assumption and proposes an opinion dynamics model grounded in a multi-objective game framework. In the proposed model, each individual experiences two distinct costs: social pressure from disagreement with others and cognitive dissonance from deviation from the perceived truth. Opinion updates are modeled as Pareto improvements between these two costs. This fwork provides a parsimonious explanation for the emergence of pluralistic ignorance, where individuals may agree on something untrue even though they all know the underlying truth. We analytically characterize the model, derive conditions for the emrameergence and prevalence of the truth, and propose an initial-seeding strategy that ensures consensus on truth. Numerical simulations are conducted on how network density and clustering affect the expression of truth. Both theoretical and numerical results lead to clear and non-trivial sociological insights. For example, no network structure guarantees truthful consensus if no one initially express the truth; moderately sparse but well-mixed networks best mitigate pluralistic ignorance.</description>

      <title>The Wisdom of the Crowd: High-Fidelity Classification of Cyber-Attacks and Faults in Power Systems Using Ensemble and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a high-fidelity evaluation framework for machine learning (ML)-based classification of cyber-attacks and physical faults using electromagnetic transient simulations with digital substation emulation at 4.8 kHz. Twelve ML models, including ensemble algorithms and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), were trained on labeled time-domain measurements and evaluated in a real-time streaming environment designed for sub-cycle responsiveness. The architecture incorporates a cycle-length smoothing filter and confidence threshold to stabilize decisions. Results show that while several models achieved near-perfect offline accuracies (up to 99.9%), only the MLP sustained robust coverage (98-99%) under streaming, whereas ensembles preserved perfect anomaly precision but abstained frequently (10-49% coverage). These findings demonstrate that offline accuracy alone is an unreliable indicator of field readiness and underscore the need for realistic testing and inference pipelines to ensure dependable classification in inverter-based resources (IBR)-rich networks.</description>

      <title>Learning stabilising policies for constrained nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a two-layered control scheme for constrained nonlinear systems represented by a class of recurrent neural networks and affected by additive disturbances. In particular, a base controller ensures global or regional closed-loop l_p-stability of the error in tracking a desired equilibrium and the satisfaction of input and output constraints within a robustly positive invariant set. An additional control contribution, derived by combining the internal model control principle with a stable operator, is introduced to improve system performance. This operator, implemented as a stable neural network, can be trained via unconstrained optimisation on a chosen performance metric, without compromising closed-loop equilibrium tracking or constraint satisfaction, even if the optimisation is stopped prematurely. In addition, we characterise the class of closed-loop stable behaviours that can be achieved with the proposed architecture. Simulation results on a pH-neutralisation benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Correct-by-Design Control Synthesis of Stochastic Multi-agent Systems: a Robust Tensor-based Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06873v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete-time stochastic systems with continuous spaces are hard to verify and control, even with MDP abstractions due to the curse of dimensionality. We propose an abstraction-based framework with robust dynamic programming mappings that deliver control strategies with provable lower bounds on temporal-logic satisfaction, quantified via approximate stochastic simulation relations. Exploiting decoupled dynamics, we reveal a Canonical Polyadic Decomposition tensor structure in value functions that makes dynamic programming scalable. The proposed method provides correct-by-design probabilistic guarantees for temporal logic specifications. We validate our results on continuous-state linear stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Traffic Congestion in North Campus, Delhi University Using Continuous Time Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project investigates traffic congestion within North Campus, Delhi University (DU), using continuous time simulations implemented in UXSim to model vehicle movement and interaction. The study focuses on several key intersections, identifies recurring congestion points, and evaluates the effectiveness of conventional traffic management measures. Implementing signal timing optimization and modest intersection reconfiguration resulted in measurable improvements in simulated traffic flow. The results provide practical insights for local traffic management and illustrate the value of continuous time simulation methods for informing short-term interventions and longer-term planning.</description>

      <title>On the Redundant Distributed Observability of Mixed Traffic Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of distributed state estimation of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) by connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is investigated in mixed traffic transportation systems. Toward this, a distributed observable state-space model is derived, which paves the way for estimation and observability analysis of HDVs in mixed traffic scenarios. In this direction, first, we obtain the condition on the network topology to satisfy the distributed observability, i.e., the condition such that each HDV state is observable to every CAV via information-exchange over the network. It is shown that strong connectivity of the network, along with the proper design of the observer gain, is sufficient for this. A distributed observer is then designed by locally sharing estimates/observations of each CAV with its neighborhood. Second, in case there exist faulty sensors or unreliable observation data, we derive the condition for redundant distributed observability as a $q$-node/link-connected network design. This redundancy is achieved by extra information-sharing over the network and implies that a certain number of faulty sensors and unreliable links can be isolated/removed without losing the observability. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Capacity Estimation of Lithium-ion Batteries Using Invariance Property in Open Circuit Voltage Relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are ubiquitous in electric vehicles (EVs) as efficient energy storage devices. The reliable operation of Li-ion batteries depends critically on the accurate estimation of battery capacity. However, conventional estimation methods require extensive training datasets from costly battery tests for modeling, and a full cycle of charge and discharge is often needed to estimate the capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel capacity estimation method that leverages only one cycle of the open-circuit voltage (OCV) test in modeling and allows for estimating the capacity from partial charge or discharge data. Moreover, by applying it with OCV identification algorithms, we can estimate the capacity from dynamic discharge data without requiring dedicated data collection tests. We observed an invariance property in the OCV versus state of charge relationship across aging cycles. Leveraging this invariance, the proposed method estimates the capacity by solving an OCV alignment problem using only the OCV and the discharge capacity data from the battery. Simulation results demonstrate the method's efficacy, achieving a mean absolute relative error of 0.85\% in capacity estimation across 12 samples from 344 aging cycles.</description>

      <title>Koopman-Based Dynamic Environment Prediction for Safe UAV Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Koopman-based model predictive control (MPC) framework for safe UAV navigation in dynamic environments using real-time LiDAR data. By leveraging the Koopman operator to linearly approximate the dynamics of surrounding objets, we enable efficient and accurate prediction of the position of moving obstacles. Embedding this into an MPC formulation ensures robust, collision-free trajectory planning suitable for real-time execution. The method is validated through simulation and ROS2-Gazebo implementation, demonstrating reliable performance under sensor noise, actuation delays, and environmental uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Beyond Phasors: Solving Non-Sinusoidal Electrical Circuits using Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical phasor analysis is fundamentally limited to sinusoidal single-frequency conditions, which poses challenges when working in the presence of harmonics. Furthermore, the conventional solution, which consists of decomposing signals using Fourier series and applying superposition, is a fragmented process that does not provide a unified solution in the frequency domain. This paper overcomes this limitation by introducing a complete and direct approach for multi-harmonic AC circuits using Geometric Algebra (GA). In this way, all non-sinusoidal voltage and current waveforms are represented as simple vectors in a $2N$-dimensional Euclidean space. The relationship between these vectors is characterized by a single and unified geometric transformation termed the \textit{rotoflex}. This operator elevates the concept of impedance from a set of complex numbers per frequency to a single multivector that holistically captures the circuit response, while unifying the magnitude scale (flextance) and phase rotation (rotance) across all harmonics. Thus, this work establishes GA as a structurally unified and efficient alternative to phasor analysis, providing a more rigorous foundation for electrical circuit analysis. The methodology is validated through case studies that demonstrate perfect numerical consistency with traditional methods and superior performance.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Co-Simulation for DC Microgrid Energy Management with Communication Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) in modern power systems has intensified the need for resilient and efficient microgrid solutions. DC microgrids have gained prominence due to their reduced conversion losses, simplified interfacing with DC-based RESs, and improved reliability. To manage the inherent variability of RESs and ensure stable operation, energy management systems (EMS) have become essential. While various EMS algorithms have been proposed and validated using real-time simulation platforms, most assume ideal communication conditions or rely on simplified network models, overlooking the impact of realistic communication delays on EMS performance. This paper presents a novel real-time cyber-physical system (CPS) testbed for evaluating EMS performance in DC microgrids under realistic communication delays. The proposed testbed integrates a DC microgrid modeled in OPAL-RT with an EMS controller implemented on a Raspberry Pi (RPi). The communication network is emulated using EXataCPS, enabling the exchange of actual power system traffic and the replication of realistic latency conditions. This comprehensive setup captures the interplay between power system dynamics, EMS control, and communication network behavior.</description>

      <title>Structural sign herdability of linear time-invariant systems:theory and design for arbitrary network structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to investigate graph-theoretic conditions for structural herdability of an LTI system. In particular, we are interested in the structural sign (SS) herdability of a system wherein the underlying digraph representing it is signed. Structural herdability finds applications in various domains like power networks, biological networks, opinion dynamics, multi-robot shepherding, etc. We begin the analysis by introducing a layered graph representation Gs of the signed digraph G; such a representation allows us to capture the signed distances between the nodes with ease. We construct a subgraph of G_s that characterizes paths of identical signs between layers and uniform path lengths, referred to as a layer-wise unisigned graph LUG(G_s). A special subgraph of an LUG(G_s), denoted as an LUG^H(G_s), is key to achieving SS herdability. This is because we prove that an LTI system is SS herdable if and only if there exists an LUG^H(G_s) which covers all the nodes of the given digraph. To the best of our knowledge, such a graphical test is one of the first methods which allows us to check SS herdability for arbitrary digraph topologies. Interestingly, the analysis also reveals that a system can be SS herdable even in the presence of (signed and layer) dilation in the associated digraph (note that such a behaviour has been shown to be impossible in directed trees). Additionally, we also extend these results to digraphs with multiple leader and driver nodes. In order to illustrate all the results, we present numerous examples throughout the paper.</description>

      <title>Characterisation and Quantification of Data Centre Flexibility for Power System Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of data centres poses an evolving challenge for power systems with high variable renewable energy. Traditionally operated as passive electrical loads, data centres, have the potential to become active participants that provide flexibility to the grid. However, quantifying and utilising this flexibility have not yet been fully explored. This paper presents an integrated, whole facility optimisation model to investigate the least cost operating schedule of data centres and characterise the aggregate flexibility available from data centres to the power system. The model accounts for IT workload shifting, UPS energy storage, and cooling system. Motivated by the need to alleviate the increasing strain on power systems while leveraging their untapped flexibility potential, this study makes two primary contributions: (i) an operational optimisation model that integrates IT scheduling, UPS operation, and cooling dynamics to establish a cost optimal baseline operation, and (ii) a duration-aware flexibility assessment that, for any given start time and power deviation, computes the maximum feasible duration from this baseline while respecting all operational, thermal, and recovery constraints. This method characterises the aggregate flexibility envelope. Results reveal a clear temporal structure and a notable asymmetry in flexibility provision: upward flexibility (electricity load reduction) is driven by deferring IT workload, which allows for a secondary reduction in cooling power. Downward flexibility (electricity load increase) relies on increasing power consumption of the cooling system, supported by the TES buffer, and charging the UPS. This framework translates abstract flexibility potential into quantified flexibility magnitude and duration that system operators could investigate for use in services such as reserve, frequency response, and price responsive demand.</description>

      <title>Beyond Gaussian Assumptions: A General Fractional HJB Control Framework for L\'evy-Driven Heavy-Tailed Channels in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging 6G wireless systems suffer severe performance degradation in challenging environments like high-speed trains traversing dense urban corridors and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) links over mountainous terrain. These scenarios exhibit non-Gaussian, non-stationary channels with heavy-tailed fading and abrupt signal fluctuations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel wireless channel model based on symmetric $\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes, thereby enabling continuous-time state-space characterization of both long-term and short-term fading. Building on this model, a generalized optimal control framework is developed via a fractional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation that incorporates the Riesz fractional operator to capture non-local spatial effects and memory-dependent dynamics. The existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions to the fractional HJB equation are rigorously established, thus ensuring the theoretical validity of the proposed control formulation. Numerical simulations conducted in a multi-cell, multi-user downlink setting demonstrate the effectiveness of the fractional HJB-based strategy in optimizing transmission power under heavy-tailed co-channel and multi-user interference.</description>

      <title>Fair and Efficient allocation of Mobility-on-Demand resources through a Karma Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobility-on-demand systems like ride-hailing have transformed urban transportation, but they have also exacerbated socio-economic inequalities in access to these services, also due to surge pricing strategies. Although several fairness-aware frameworks have been proposed in smart mobility, they often overlook the temporal and situational variability of user urgency that shapes real-world transportation demands. This paper introduces a non-monetary, Karma-based mechanism that models endogenous urgency, allowing user time-sensitivity to evolve in response to system conditions as well as external factors. We develop a theoretical framework maintaining the efficiency and fairness guarantees of classical Karma economies, while accommodating this realistic user behavior modeling. Applied to a simulated mobility-on-demand scenario we show that our framework is able to achieve high levels of system efficiency, guaranteeing at the same time equitable resource allocation for the users.</description>

      <title>Beyond Prime Farmland: Solar Siting Tradeoffs for Cost-Effective Decarbonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The feasibility and cost-effectiveness of continued growth in solar photovoltaics are closely tied to siting decisions. But trade-offs between costs and technical potential between land categories, especially brownfields and rooftop sites, have not been quantified, despite increasing resistance to and policy interest in reducing use of greenfield sites (e.g., prime agricultural lands). We examine the effect of siting decisions across land types for utility-scale and rooftop PV on the feasibility and cost of meeting solar deployment targets across the Eastern U.S. We build a database of solar PV supply curves by land type for each county in the Eastern Interconnect (EI) region (~2,400 counties). Our supply curves quantify technical potential versus levelized cost across greenfield, brownfield, and rooftop land types. With these supply curves and a 2035 solar deployment target (435 GW) aligned with a decarbonized power system, we quantify cost and capacity trade-offs using scenarios that prioritize solar PV deployment on different land types. We find greenfield, particularly prime agriculture, sites offer the lowest levelized costs for meeting capacity targets, of 39 to 57 $/MWh. Contaminated lands, often prioritized in policy to reduce land use conflict, have limited technical potential and impose a cost premium of 14-33% relative to greenfield sites. Rooftop PV provides enough technical potential for meeting capacity targets but comes at consistently higher costs, with minimum LCOEs of roughly 70 $/MWh or well above the highest-cost greenfield sites. Our results detail heterogeneous siting trade-offs across the Eastern United States, enabling targeted policy design to meet deployment targets while balancing costs and land use conflicts.</description>

      <title>Robust Linear Design for Flight Control Systems with Operational Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic approach for designing robust linear proportional-integral (PI) servo-controllers that effectively manage control input and output constraints in flight control systems. The control design leverages the Nagumo Theorem and the Comparison Lemma to prove constraint satisfaction, while employing min-norm optimal controllers in a manner akin to Control Barrier Functions. This results in a continuous piecewise-linear state feedback policy that maintains the analyzability of the closed-loop system through the principles of linear systems theory. Additionally, we derive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) robustness margins, demonstrating that our approach enables robust tracking of external commands even in the presence of operational constraints. Moreover, the proposed control design offers a systematic approach for anti-windup protection. Through flight control trade studies, we illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework to real-world safety-critical aircraft control scenarios. Notably, MIMO margin analysis with active constraints reveals that our method preserves gain and phase margins comparable to those of the unconstrained case, in contrast to controllers that rely on hard saturation heuristics, which suffer significant performance degradation under active constraints. Simulation results using a nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom rigid body aircraft model further validate the effectiveness of our method in achieving constraint satisfaction, robustness, and effective anti-windup protection.</description>

      <title>When the Correct Model Fails: The Optimality of Stackelberg Equilibria with Follower Intention Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-player dynamic Stackelberg game between a leader and a follower. Classical formulations of the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) assume that the follower's best response (BR) mapping is known to the leader. However, this is not always true in practice. In those cases the leader needs to simultaneously infer this BR function while fulfilling an internal objective. We study a setting in which the leader selects a control strategy that optimizes an objective given an initial belief about the follower's best response. This belief is updated during the finite decision horizon, prompting the leader to reoptimize its control. We characterize the optimality guarantees of the SE solutions under this belief update for both open loop (OL) and feedback (FB) information structures. In particular, we show that it is possible that assuming an incorrect follower BR map obtains a lower cost over the game horizon than knowing the true BR. We support these claims with numerical examples in a linear quadratic (LQ) Stackelberg game.</description>

      <title>Lite VLA: Efficient Vision-Language-Action Control on CPU-Bound Edge Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of artificial intelligence models at the edge is increasingly critical for autonomous robots operating in GPS-denied environments where local, resource-efficient reasoning is essential. This work demonstrates the feasibility of deploying small Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on mobile robots to achieve real-time scene understanding and reasoning under strict computational constraints. Unlike prior approaches that separate perception from mobility, the proposed framework enables simultaneous movement and reasoning in dynamic environments using only on-board hardware. The system integrates a compact VLM with multimodal perception to perform contextual interpretation directly on embedded hardware, eliminating reliance on cloud connectivity. Experimental validation highlights the balance between computational efficiency, task accuracy, and system responsiveness. Implementation on a mobile robot confirms one of the first successful deployments of small VLMs for concurrent reasoning and mobility at the edge. This work establishes a foundation for scalable, assured autonomy in applications such as service robotics, disaster response, and defense operations.</description>

      <title>STAIR: Stability criterion for Time-windowed Assignment and Internal adversarial influence in Routing and decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major limitation of existing routing algorithms for multi-agent systems is that they are designed without considering the potential presence of adversarial agents in the decision-making loop, which could lead to severe performance degradation in real-life applications where adversarial agents may be present. We study autonomous pickup-and-delivery routing problems in which adversarial agents launch coordinated denial-of-service attacks by spoofing their locations. This deception causes the central scheduler to assign pickup requests to adversarial agents instead of cooperative agents. Adversarial agents then choose not to service the requests with the goal of disrupting the operation of the system, leading to delays, cancellations, and potential instability in the routing policy. Policy stability in routing problems is typically defined as the cost of the policy being uniformly bounded over time, and it has been studied through two different lenses: queuing theory and reinforcement learning (RL), which are not well suited for routing with adversaries. In this paper, we propose a new stability criterion, STAIR, which is easier to analyze than queuing-theory-based stability in adversarial settings. Furthermore, STAIR does not depend on a chosen discount factor as is the case in discounted RL stability. STAIR directly links stability to desired operational metrics, like a finite number of rejected requests. This characterization is particularly useful in adversarial settings as it provides a metric for monitoring the effect of adversaries in the operation of the system. Furthermore, we demonstrate STAIR's practical relevance through simulations on real-world San Francisco mobility-on-demand data. We also identify a phenomenon of degenerate stability that arises in the adversarial routing problem, and we introduce time-window constraints in the decision-making algorithm to mitigate it.</description>

      <title>Controller-Light CI/CD with Jenkins: Remote Container Builds and Automated Artifact Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Jenkins installations often perform resource-intensive builds directly on the controller, which can overload system resources and decrease reliability. This paper presents a controller-light CI/CD framework in which Jenkins runs as a containerized controller with persistent volumes, delegating heavy build and packaging operations to a remote Docker host. The controller container maintains secure SSH connections to remote compute nodes and focuses solely on orchestration and reporting. Atomic deployments with time-stamped backups, containerized build environments, immutable artifact packaging, and automatic notifications are all integrated into the system. Experimental evaluation shows reduced CPU and RAM usage on the controller, faster build throughput, and lower artifact delivery latency. For small and medium-sized DevOps organizations looking for scalable automation without adding orchestration complexity, this method offers a repeatable, low-maintenance CI/CD pipeline.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Time Budgets for Safe and Comfortable Vehicle Control Transition in Conditionally Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditionally automated driving requires drivers to resume vehicle control promptly when automation reaches its operational limits. Ensuring smooth vehicle control transitions is critical for the safety and efficiency of mixed-traffic transportation systems, where complex interactions and variable traffic behaviors pose additional challenges. This study addresses this challenge by introducing an adaptive time budget framework that provides drivers with sufficient time to complete takeovers both safely and comfortably across diverse scenarios. We focus in particular on the takeover buffer, that is, the extra time available after drivers consciously resume control to complete evasive maneuvers. A driving simulator experiment is conducted to evaluate the influence of different takeover buffer lengths on safety-related indicators (minimum time-to-collision, maximum deceleration, and steering wheel angle) and subjective assessments (perceived time sufficiency, perceived risk, and performance satisfaction). Results show that (i) takeover buffers of about 5-6 seconds consistently lead to optimal safety and comfort; and (ii) drivers prefer relatively stable takeover buffers across varying traffic densities and n-back tasks. This study introduces an adaptive time budget framework that dynamically allocates transition time by incorporating a predicted takeover time and a preferred takeover buffer (piecewise function). This can serve as an important first step toward providing drivers with sufficient time to resume vehicle control across diverse scenarios, which needs to be validated in more diverse and real-world driving contexts. By aligning the provided time budget with driver needs under specific circumstances, the adaptive framework can improve reliability of control transitions, facilitate human-centered automated driving, reduce crash risk, and maintain overall traffic efficiency.</description>

      <title>Catching Contamination Before Generation: Spectral Kill Switches for Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic language models compose multi step reasoning chains, yet intermediate steps can be corrupted by inconsistent context, retrieval errors, or adversarial inputs, which makes post hoc evaluation too late because errors propagate before detection. We introduce a diagnostic that requires no additional training and uses only the forward pass to emit a binary accept or reject signal during agent execution. The method analyzes token graphs induced by attention and computes two spectral statistics in early layers, namely the high frequency energy ratio and spectral entropy. We formalize these signals, establish invariances, and provide finite sample estimators with uncertainty quantification. Under a two regime mixture assumption with a monotone likelihood ratio property, we show that a single threshold on the high frequency energy ratio is optimal in the Bayes sense for detecting context inconsistency. Empirically, the high frequency energy ratio exhibits robust bimodality during context verification across multiple model families, which enables gating decisions with overhead below one millisecond on our hardware and configurations. We demonstrate integration into retrieval augmented agent pipelines and discuss deployment as an inline safety monitor. The approach detects contamination while the model is still processing the text, before errors commit to the reasoning chain.</description>

      <title>Secret Protection in Labeled Petri Nets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the secret protection problem (SPP), where the objective is to find a policy of minimal cost ensuring that every execution path from an initial state to a secret state contains a sufficient number of protected events. The problem was originally introduced and studied in the setting of finite automata. In this paper, we extend the framework to labeled Petri nets. We consider two variants of the problem: the Parikh variant, where all occurrences of protected events along an execution path contribute to the security requirement, and the indicator variant, where each protected event is counted only once per execution path. We show that both variants can be solved in exponential space for labeled Petri nets, and that their decision versions are ExpSpace-complete. As a consequence, there is no polynomial-time or polynomial-space algorithm for these problems.</description>

      <title>LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning with Representative Agents for Traffic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as behavioral proxies for self-interested travelers in agent-based traffic models. Although more flexible and generalizable than conventional models, the practical use of these approaches remains limited by scalability due to the cost of calling one LLM for every traveler. Moreover, it has been found that LLM agents often make opaque choices and produce unstable day-to-day dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose to model each homogeneous traveler group facing the same decision context with a single representative LLM agent who behaves like the population's average, maintaining and updating a mixed strategy over routes that coincides with the group's aggregate flow proportions. Each day, the LLM reviews the travel experience and flags routes with positive reinforcement that they hope to use more often, and an interpretable update rule then converts this judgment into strategy adjustments using a tunable (progressively decaying) step size. The representative-agent design improves scalability, while the separation of reasoning from updating clarifies the decision logic while stabilizing learning. In classic traffic assignment settings, we find that the proposed approach converges rapidly to the user equilibrium. In richer settings with income heterogeneity, multi-criteria costs, and multi-modal choices, the generated dynamics remain stable and interpretable, reproducing plausible behavioral patterns well-documented in psychology and economics, for example, the decoy effect in toll versus non-toll road selection, and higher willingness-to-pay for convenience among higher-income travelers when choosing between driving, transit, and park-and-ride options.</description>

      <title>Scalable Verification of Neural Control Barrier Functions Using Linear Bound Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) are a popular tool for safety certification of nonlinear dynamical control systems. Recently, CBFs represented as neural networks have shown great promise due to their expressiveness and applicability to a broad class of dynamics and safety constraints. However, verifying that a trained neural network is indeed a valid CBF is a computational bottleneck that limits the size of the networks that can be used. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework for verifying neural CBFs based on piecewise linear upper and lower bounds on the conditions required for a neural network to be a CBF. Our approach is rooted in linear bound propagation (LBP) for neural networks, which we extend to compute bounds on the gradients of the network. Combined with McCormick relaxation, we derive linear upper and lower bounds on the CBF conditions, thereby eliminating the need for computationally expensive verification procedures. Our approach applies to arbitrary control-affine systems and a broad range of nonlinear activation functions. To reduce conservatism, we develop a parallelizable refinement strategy that adaptively refines the regions over which these bounds are computed. Our approach scales to larger neural networks than state-of-the-art verification procedures for CBFs, as demonstrated by our numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Fair and Efficient Urban Traffic Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization of urban traffic is threatened by the complexity of achieving a balance between transport efficiency and the maintenance of privacy, as well as the equitable distribution of traffic based on socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods. Current centralized traffic management schemes invade user location privacy and further entrench traffic disparity by offering disadvantaged route suggestions, whereas current federated learning frameworks do not consider fairness constraints in multi-objective traffic settings. This study presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed FedFair-Traffic, that jointly and simultaneously optimizes travel efficiency, traffic fairness, and differential privacy protection. This is the first attempt to integrate three conflicting objectives to improve urban transportation systems. The proposed methodology enables collaborative learning between related vehicles with data locality by integrating Graph Neural Networks with differential privacy mechanisms ($\epsilon$-privacy guarantees) and Gini coefficient-based fair constraints using multi-objective optimization. The framework uses federated aggregation methods of gradient clipping and noise injection to provide differential privacy and optimize Pareto-efficient solutions for the efficiency-fairness tradeoff. Real-world comprehensive experiments on the METR-LA traffic dataset showed that FedFair-Traffic can reduce the average travel time by 7\% (14.2 minutes) compared with their centralized baselines, promote traffic fairness by 73\% (Gini coefficient, 0.78), and offer high privacy protection (privacy score, 0.8) with an 89\% reduction in communication overhead. These outcomes demonstrate that FedFair-Traffic is a scalable privacy-aware smart city infrastructure with possible use-cases in metropolitan traffic flow control and federated transportation networks.</description>

      <title>Public Transport Under Epidemic Conditions: Nonlinear Trade-Offs Between Risk and Accessibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epidemics expose critical tensions between protecting public health and maintaining essential urban mobility. Public transport systems face this dilemma most acutely: they enable access to jobs, education, and services, yet also facilitate close contact among travelers. We develop an integrated modeling framework that couples agent-based epidemic simulation (EpiSim) with an optimization-based public transport flow model under capacity constraints. Using Munich as a case study, we analyze how combinations of facility closures and transport restrictions shape epidemic outcomes and accessibility. The results reveal three key insights. First, epidemic interventions redistribute rather than simply reduce infection risks, shifting transmission to households. Second, epidemic and transport policies interact nonlinearly - moderate demand suppression can offset large capacity cuts. Third, epidemic pressures amplify temporal and spatial inequalities, disproportionately affecting peripheral and peak-hour travelers. These findings highlight that blanket restrictions are both inefficient and inequitable, calling for targeted, time- and space-differentiated measures to build epidemic-resilient and socially fair transport systems.</description>

      <title>From Demonstrations to Safe Deployment: Path-Consistent Safety Filtering for Diffusion Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion policies (DPs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on complex manipulation tasks by learning from large-scale demonstration datasets, often spanning multiple embodiments and environments. However, they cannot guarantee safe behavior, so external safety mechanisms are needed. These, however, alter actions in ways unseen during training, causing unpredictable behavior and performance degradation. To address these problems, we propose path-consistent safety filtering (PACS) for DPs. Our approach performs path-consistent braking on a trajectory computed from the sequence of generated actions. In this way, we keep execution consistent with the policy's training distribution, maintaining the learned, task-completing behavior. To enable a real-time deployment and handle uncertainties, we verify safety using set-based reachability analysis. Our experimental evaluation in simulation and on three challenging real-world human-robot interaction tasks shows that PACS (a) provides formal safety guarantees in dynamic environments, (b) preserves task success rates, and (c) outperforms reactive safety approaches, such as control barrier functions, by up to 68% in terms of task success.

      <title>On Driftless Systems with m controls and 2m or 2m-1 states that are Flat by Pure Prolongation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely recognized that no tractable necessary and sufficient conditions exist for determining whether a system is, in general, differentially flat. However, specific cases do provide such conditions. For instance, driftless systems with two inputs have known necessary and sufficient conditions. For driftless systems with three or more inputs, the available conditions are only sufficient. This paper presents new findings on determining whether a system with m inputs and $2m$ or $2m-1$ states is flat by pure prolongation, a specific subclass of differential flatness. While this condition is more restrictive than general differential flatness, the algorithm for computing flat outputs remains remarkably simple, and the verification requirements are relatively lenient. Moreover, the conditions proposed in this work broaden the class of systems recognized as differentially flat, as our sufficient condition differs from existing criteria.</description>

      <title>Efficient Approximation of Volterra Series for High-Dimensional Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems via the Volterra series has significant potential, but has been severely hindered by the curse of dimensionality. Tensor Network (TN) methods such as the Modified Alternating Linear Scheme (MVMALS) have been a breakthrough for the field, offering a tractable approach by exploiting the low-rank structure in Volterra kernels. However, these techniques still encounter prohibitive computational and memory bottlenecks due to high-order polynomial scaling with respect to input dimension. To overcome this barrier, we introduce the Tensor Head Averaging (THA) algorithm, which significantly reduces complexity by constructing an ensemble of localized MVMALS models trained on small subsets of the input space. In this paper, we present a theoretical foundation for the THA algorithm. We establish observable, finite-sample bounds on the error between the THA ensemble and a full MVMALS model, and we derive an exact decomposition of the squared error. This decomposition is used to analyze the manner in which subset models implicitly compensate for omitted dynamics. We quantify this effect, and prove that correlation between the included and omitted dynamics creates an optimization incentive which drives THA's performance toward accuracy superior to a simple truncation of a full MVMALS model. THA thus offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for identifying previously intractable high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of vision-based system identification techniques in quadrotor modeling and control. Through experiments and analysis, we address the complexities and limitations of quadrotor modeling, particularly in relation to thrust and drag coefficients. Grey-box modeling is employed to mitigate uncertainties, and the effectiveness of an onboard vision system is evaluated. An LQR controller is designed based on a system identification model using data from the onboard vision system. The results demonstrate consistent performance between the models, validating the efficacy of vision based system identification. This study highlights the potential of vision-based techniques in enhancing quadrotor modeling and control, contributing to improved performance and operational capabilities. Our findings provide insights into the usability and consistency of these techniques, paving the way for future research in quadrotor performance enhancement, fault detection, and decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Aerial Image Stitching Using IMU Data from a UAV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely used for aerial photography and remote sensing applications. One of the main challenges is to stitch together multiple images into a single high-resolution image that covers a large area. Featurebased image stitching algorithms are commonly used but can suffer from errors and ambiguities in feature detection and matching. To address this, several approaches have been proposed, including using bundle adjustment techniques or direct image alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses a combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques for stitching images captured by a UAV. Our method involves several steps such as estimating the displacement and rotation of the UAV between consecutive images, correcting for perspective distortion, and computing a homography matrix. We then use a standard image stitching algorithm to align and blend the images together. Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by the IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily integrated into existing UAV workflows. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, outperforming some of the existing feature-based image stitching algorithms in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in challenging scenarios such as large displacements, rotations, and variations in camera pose.</description>

      <title>Radio-Coverage-Aware Path Planning for Cooperative Autonomous Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fleets of autonomous vehicles (AV) often are at the core of intelligent transportation scenarios for smart cities, and may require a wireless Internet connection to offload computer vision tasks to data centers located either in the edge or the cloud section of the network. Cooperation among AVs is successful when the environment is unknown, or changes dynamically, so as to improve coverage and trip time, and minimize the traveled distance. The AVs, while mapping the environment with range-based sensors, move across the wireless coverage areas, with consequences on the achieved access bit rate, latency, and handover rate. In this paper, we propose to modify the cost of path planning algorithms such as Dijkstra and A*, so that not only the traveled distance is considered in the best path solution, but also the radio coverage experience. To this aim, several radio-related cost-weighting functions are introduced and tested, to assess the performance of the proposed techniques with extensive simulations. The proposed mapping algorithm can achieve a mapping error probability below 2%, while the proposed path-planning algorithms extend the experienced radio coverage of the AVs, with limited distance increase with respect to shortest-path existing methods, such as conventional Dijkstra and A* algorithms.</description>

      <title>Roundabout Constrained Convex Generators: A Unified Framework for Multiply-Connected Reachable Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Roundabout Constrained Convex Generators (RCGs), a set representation framework for modeling multiply connected regions in control and verification applications. The RCG representation extends the constrained convex generators framework by incorporating an inner exclusion zone, creating sets with topological holes that naturally arise in collision avoidance and safety-critical control problems. We present two equivalent formulations: a set difference representation that provides geometric intuition and a unified parametric representation that facilitates computational implementation. The paper establishes closure properties under fundamental operations, including linear transformations, Minkowski sums, and intersections with convex generator sets. We derive special cases, including roundabout zonotopes and roundabout ellipsotopes, which offer computational advantages for specific norm selections. The framework maintains compatibility with existing optimization solvers while enabling the representation of non-convex feasible regions that were previously challenging to model efficiently.</description>

      <title>Modeling Unsteady Aircraft Aerodynamics Using Lorenz Attractor: A Reduced-Order Approach for Wing Rock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel modeling approach for unsteady aircraft airflow, leveraging the Lorenz attractor framework. The proposed model is based on the force distribution exerted by a lift-generating wing on the surrounding fluid. It distinguishes between turbulent and nominal components of the force distribution, with the nominal force distribution modeled to peak at the wing and decay linearly into the free stream. This separation allows the turbulent component to be represented by a transport equation that is influenced by flight conditions, specifically dynamic pressure and angle of attack. Consequently, the Navier-Stokes equations, along with the turbulence transport equation, can be transformed into a reduced-order model characterized by three scalar ordinary differential equations - similar to the Lorenz attractor. This resulting system effectively captures chaotic behavior, facilitating the exploration of complex dynamics without the computational demands of solving the full Navier-Stokes equations. A simulation trade study is conducted that models wing rock phenomena at high angles of attack, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing the intricate dynamics of unsteady aircraft aerodynamics.</description>

      <title>From Discrete to Continuous Binary Best-Response Dynamics: Discrete Fluctuations Almost Surely Vanish with Population Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01995v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In binary decision-making, individuals often choose either the rare or the common action. In the framework of evolutionary game theory, the best-response update rule can be used to model this dichotomy. Those who prefer the common action are called \emph{coordinators}, and those who prefer the rare one are called \emph{anticoordinators}. A finite mixed population of the two types may undergo perpetual fluctuations, the characterization of which appears to be challenging. It is particularly unknown whether the fluctuations persist as population size grows. To fill this gap, we approximate the discrete finite population dynamics of coordinators and anticoordinators with the associated mean dynamics in the form of differential inclusions. We show that the family of the state sequences of the discrete dynamics for increasing population sizes forms a generalized stochastic approximation process for the differential inclusion. On the other hand, we show that the differential inclusions always converge to an equilibrium. This implies that the reported perpetual fluctuations in the finite discrete dynamics of coordinators and anticoordinators almost surely vanish with population size. The results encourage to first analyze the often simpler {continuous-time} mean dynamics of the discrete population dynamics as the continuous-time dynamics partly reveal the asymptotic behavior of the discrete dynamics.</description>

      <title>Intent Demonstration in General-Sum Dynamic Games via Iterative Linear-Quadratic Approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous agents should coordinate effectively without prior knowledge of others' intents. While prior work has focused on intent inference, we address the inverse problem: how agents can strategically demonstrate their intents within general-sum dynamic games. We model this problem and propose an algorithm that balances intent demonstration with task performance. To handle nonlinear dynamic games with continuous state-action spaces, our method leverages iterative linear-quadratic game approximations and provides efficient intent-teaching guarantees: the uncertain agent's belief can be driven rapidly to the ground truth, while the demonstrating agent avoids expending effort on unnecessary belief alignment when it does not improve task performance. Theoretical analysis and hardware experiments confirm that our approach enables the demonstrating agent to reconcile task execution with belief alignment and strategically manage the information asymmetry among agents, even as its intent evolves during deployment.</description>

      <title>Bidding in Ancillary Service Markets: An Analytical Approach Using Extreme Value Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02308v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To enable the participation of stochastic distributed energy resources in ancillary service markets, the Danish transmission system operator, Energinet, mandates that flexibility providers satisfy a minimum 90% reliability requirement for reserve bids. This paper examines the bidding strategy of an electric vehicle aggregator under this regulation and develops a chance-constrained optimization model. In contrast to conventional sample-based approaches that demand large datasets to capture uncertainty, we propose an analytical reformulation that leverages extreme value theory to characterize the tail behavior of flexibility distributions. A case study with real-world charging data from 1400 residential electric vehicles in Denmark demonstrates that the analytical solution improves out-of-sample reliability, reducing bid violation rates by up to 8% relative to a sample-based benchmark. The method is also computationally more efficient, solving optimization problems up to 4.8 times faster while requiring substantially fewer samples to ensure compliance. Moreover, the proposed approach enables the construction of feasible bids with reliability levels as high as 99.95%, which would otherwise require prohibitively large scenario sets under the sample-based method. Beyond its computational and reliability advantages, the framework also provides actionable insights into how reliability thresholds influence aggregator bidding behavior and market participation. This study establishes a regulation-compliant, tractable, and risk-aware bidding methodology for stochastic flexibility aggregators, enhancing both market efficiency and power system security.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16797v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study singularly perturbed systems that exhibit input-to-state stability (ISS) with fixed-time properties in the presence of bounded disturbances. In these systems, solutions converge to the origin within a time frame independent of initial conditions when undisturbed, and to a vicinity of the origin when subjected to bounded disturbances. First, we extend the traditional composite Lyapunov method, commonly applied in singular perturbation theory to analyze asymptotic stability, to include fixed-time ISS. We demonstrate that if both the reduced system and the boundary layer system exhibit fixed-time ISS, and if certain interconnection conditions are met, the entire multi-time scale system retains this fixed-time ISS characteristic, provided the separation of time scales is sufficiently pronounced. Next, we illustrate our findings via analytical and numerical examples, including a novel application in fixed-time feedback optimization for dynamic plants with slowly varying cost functions.</description>

Abstract: A two-layer control architecture is proposed, which promotes scalable implementations for constraint-based decision strategies, such as model predictive controllers. The bottom layer is based upon a distributed feedback-feedforward scheme, which directs the controlled network's information flow according to a pre-specified communication infrastructure. Explicit expressions for the resulting closed-loop maps are obtained, and an offline model-matching procedure is proposed for designing the first layer. The obtained control laws are deployed via distributed state-space-based implementations, and the resulting closed-loop models enable predictive control design for the constraint management procedure described in our companion paper.</description>

Abstract: A two-layer control architecture is proposed, which promotes scalable implementations for model predictive controllers. The top layer acts as both reference governor for the bottom layer, and as a feedback controller for the regulated network. By employing set-based methods, global theoretical guarantees are obtained by enforcing local constraints upon the network's variables and upon those of the first layer's implementation. The proposed technique offers recursive feasibility guarantees as one of its central features, and the expressions of the resulting predictive strategies bear a striking resemblance to classical formulations from model predictive control literature, allowing for flexible and easily customizable implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To achieve global coverage and ubiquitous connectivity, the non-terrestrial network (NTN) has been regarded as a key enabler in the sixth generation (6G) network, which includes uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), high-altitude platforms (HAPs), and satellites. Since the unique characteristics of various NTN platforms strongly affect their implementation and lead to a highly dynamic and heterogeneous NTN scenario, achieving distributed coordination remains an important research direction. However, the explicit and systematic analysis of the individual layers' challenges and corresponding distributed coordination solutions in heterogeneous NTNs has not been proposed yet. Therefore, in this paper, we summarize the unique characteristics of each NTN platform, identify communication challenges within individual layers, and propose potential delay-tolerant or delay-sensitive coordinated solutions accordingly. We further analyse the feasibility of leveraging multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithms to achieve the proposed coordinated solutions. Finally, we present a case study of the joint scheduling and trajectory optimization problem in heterogeneous NTN, where a two-timescale multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (TTS-MADDPG) algorithm is developed to validate the effectiveness of distributed coordination.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Enforce Non-Negativity Constraint in Neural Network Approximation for Optimal Voltage Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power system voltage regulation is crucial to maintain power quality while integrating intermittent renewable resources in distribution grids. However, the system model on the grid edge is often unknown, making it difficult to model physical equations for optimal control. Therefore, previous work proposes structured data-driven methods like input convex neural networks (ICNN) for "optimal" control without relying on a physical model. While ICNNs offer theoretical guarantees based on restrictive assumptions of non-negative neural network parameters, can one improve the approximation power with an extra step on negative duplication of inputs? We show that such added mirroring step fails to improve accuracy, as a linear combination of the original input and duplicated input is equivalent to a linear operation of ICNN's input without duplication. While this design can not improve performance, we propose a unified approach to embed the non-negativity constraint as a regularized optimization of the neural network, contrary to the existing methods, which added a loosely integrated second step for post-processing on parameter negation. Our integration directly ties back-propagation to simultaneously minimizing the approximation error while enforcing the convexity constraints. Numerical experiments validate the issues of the mirroring method and show that our integrated objective can avoid problems such as unstable training and non-convergence existing in other methods for optimal control.

Abstract: This paper proposes a system identification algorithm for systems with multi-rate sensors in a discrete-time framework. It is challenging to obtain an accurate mathematical model when the ratios of inputs and outputs are different in the system. A cyclic reformulation-based model for multi-rate systems is formulated, and the multi-rate system can be reduced to a linear time-invariant system to derive the model under the multi-rate sensing environment. The proposed algorithm integrates a cyclic reformulation with a state coordinate transformation of the cycled system to enable precise identification of systems under the multi-rate sensing environment. The effectiveness of the proposed system identification method is demonstrated using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Safe On-Orbit Dislodging of Deployable Structures via Robust Adaptive MPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel robust adaptive model predictive controller for on-orbit dislodging. We study orbit dislodging where a servicing spacecraft uses a robotic arm to free a jammed and unactuated solar panel mounted on a hybrid hinge that acts as a time-varying client on a space station. Our method couples online set-membership identification with a robust adaptive MPC to enforce safety under bounded disturbances. The controller explicitly balances exploration to excite the system and shrink uncertainty and exploitation to improve control performance through a dual-mode cost. The feasibility of the developed robust adaptive MPC method is also examined through dislodging simulations and hardware experiments in freefall and terrestrial laboratory environments, respectively. In addition, the advantages of our method are shown through comparison experiments with several state-of-the-art control schemes for both accuracy of parameter estimation and control performance.</description>

      <title>Inverted Gaussian Process Optimization for Probabilistic Koopman Operator Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Koopman Operator Theory has opened the doors to data-driven learning of globally linear representations of complex nonlinear systems. However, current methodologies for Koopman Operator discovery struggle with uncertainty quantification and the dependency on a finite dictionary of heuristically chosen observable functions. We leverage Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to learn a probabilistic Koopman linear model from data, while removing the need for heuristic observable specification. We present inverted Gaussian Process optimization based Koopman operator learning (iGPK), an automatic differentiation-based approach to simultaneously learn the observable-operator combination. Our numerical results show that the iGPK method is able to learn complex nonlinearities from simulation data while being resilient to measurement noise in the training data and consistently encapsulating the ground truth in the predictive distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) enable smart wireless environments by dynamically controlling signal propagation to enhance communication and localization. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can act as flying base stations and thus, improve system performance by avoiding signal blockages. In this paper, we propose a gradient ascent and coordinate search based method to determine the optimal location for a system that consists of a UAV and a RIS, where the UAV serves cellular users (CUs) and the RIS serves device-to-device (D2D) pairs. In particular, by optimizing the net throughput for both the D2D pairs and the CUs, the suggested method establishes the ideal location for the RIS-mounted UAV. We consider both line of sight (LoS) and non-LoS paths for the RIS and UAV to calculate the throughput while accounting for blockages in the system. The numerical results show that the proposed method performs better than the existing approaches in terms of both the net throughput and the user fairness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of spatio-temporally chaos is challenging because of high dimensionality and unpredictability. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) discovers optimal control policies by interacting with the system, typically requiring observations of the full physical state. In practice, sensors often provide only partial and noisy measurements (observations) of the system. The objective of this paper is to develop a framework that enables the control of chaotic systems with partial and noisy observability. The proposed method, data-assimilated model-informed reinforcement learning (DA-MIRL), integrates (i) low-order models to approximate high-dimensional dynamics; (ii) sequential data assimilation to correct the model prediction when observations become available; and (iii) an off-policy actor-critic RL algorithm to adaptively learn an optimal control strategy based on the corrected state estimates. We test DA-MIRL on the spatiotemporally chaotic solutions of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We estimate the full state of the environment with (i) a physics-based model, here, a coarse-grained model; and (ii) a data-driven model, here, the control-aware echo state network, which is proposed in this paper. We show that DA-MIRL successfully estimates and suppresses the chaotic dynamics of the environment in real time from partial observations and approximate models. This work opens opportunities for the control of partially observable chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Approach for Topology Correction in Low Voltage Distribution Networks with PVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To correct the outdated and incomplete topology of low voltage distribution networks (LVDNs) solely based on voltage magnitudes, a data driven approach is developed based on machine learning algorithms and correlation analysis. Meanwhile, to address the similarity among smart meter (SM) data induced by distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems, a time based SM data selection strategy is combined with the proposed correlation analysis. Unlike offline approaches, the proposed approach uses up to date voltage magnitudes to help distribution system operators determine switch states via supervised learning and refine user feeder connections and customer phase labels through a modified hierarchical clustering algorithm. The feasibility and robustness of the proposed approach are validated using modified real world LVDNs and multiple incomplete SM datasets collected from customers in the Netherlands. The results demonstrate that the time-based SM data selection strategy effectively mitigates its impact on phase identification, and the corrected topology not only improves network observability but also supports network operators in load balancing and PV consumption.</description>

      <title>Opinion Clustering under the Friedkin-Johnsen Model: Agreement in Disagreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The convergence of opinions in the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) framework is well studied, but the topological conditions leading to opinion clustering remain less explored. To bridge this gap, we examine the role of topology in the emergence of opinion clusters within the network. The key contribution of the paper lies in the introduction of the notion of topologically prominent agents, referred to as Locally Topologically Persuasive (LTP) agents. Interestingly, each LTP agent is associated with a unique set of (non-influential) agents in its vicinity. Using them, we present conditions to obtain opinion clusters in the FJ framework in any arbitrarily connected digraph. A key advantage of the proposed result is that the resulting opinion clusters are independent of the edge weights and the stubbornness of the agents. Finally, we demonstrate using simulation results that, by suitably placing LTP agents, one can design networks that achieve any desired opinion clustering.</description>

      <title>An Alternative Derivation and Optimal Design Method of the Generalized Bilinear Transformation for Discretizing Analog Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common approach to digital system design involves transforming a continuous-time (s-domain) transfer function into the discrete-time (z-domain) using methods such as Euler or Tustin. These transformations are shown to be specific cases of the Generalized Bilinear Transformation (GBT), characterized by a design parameter, $\alpha$, whose physical interpretation and optimal selection remain inadequately explored. In this paper, we propose an alternative derivation of the GBT derived by employing a new hexagonal shape to approximate the enclosed area of the error function, and we define the parameter $\alpha$ as a shape factor. We reveal, for the first time, the physical meaning of $\alpha$ as the backward rectangular ratio of the proposed hexagonal shape. Through domain mapping, the stable range of is rigorously established to be [0.5, 1]. Depending on the operating frequency and the chosen $\alpha$, we observe two distinct distortion modes, i.e., the magnitude and phase distortion. We further develop an optimal design method for $\alpha$ by minimizing a normalized magnitude or phase error objective function. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through the design and testing of a low-pass filter (LPF), demonstrating strong agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Recurrent Adjacency Memory Network for Mixed-Generation Power System Stability Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources exhibit complex dynamic behaviors that challenge the scalability and generalizability of traditional stability assessment methods. This paper presents a dynamic recurrent adjacency memory network (DRAMN) that combines physics-informed analysis with deep learning for real-time power system stability forecasting. The framework employs sliding-window dynamic mode decomposition to construct time-varying, multi-layer adjacency matrices from phasor measurement unit and sensor data to capture system dynamics such as modal participation factors, coupling strengths, phase relationships, and spectral energy distributions. As opposed to processing spatial and temporal dependencies separately, DRAMN integrates graph convolution operations directly within recurrent gating mechanisms, enabling simultaneous modeling of evolving dynamics and temporal dependencies. Extensive validations on modified IEEE 9-bus, 39-bus, and a multi-terminal HVDC network demonstrate high performance, achieving 99.85%, 99.90%, and 99.69% average accuracies, respectively, surpassing all tested benchmarks, including classical machine learning algorithms and recent graph-based models. The framework identifies optimal combinations of measurements that reduce feature dimensionality by 82% without performance degradation. Correlation analysis between dominant measurements for small-signal and transient stability events validates generalizability across different stability phenomena. DRAMN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing enhanced interpretability for power system operators, making it suitable for real-time deployment in modern control centers.</description>

      <title>A Learning-Based Control Barrier Function for Car-Like Robots: Toward Less Conservative Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a learning-based Control Barrier Function (CBF) to reduce conservatism in collision avoidance for car-like robots. Traditional CBFs often use the Euclidean distance between robots' centers as a safety margin, which neglects their headings and approximates their geometries as circles. Although this simplification meets the smoothness and differentiability requirements of CBFs, it may result in overly conservative behavior in dense environments. We address this by designing a safety margin that considers both the robot's heading and actual shape, thereby enabling a more precise estimation of safe regions. Because this safety margin is non-differentiable, we approximate it with a neural network to ensure differentiability. In addition, we propose a notion of relative dynamics that makes the learning process tractable. In a case study, we establish the theoretical foundation for applying this notion to a nonlinear kinematic bicycle model. Numerical experiments in overtaking and bypassing scenarios show that our approach reduces conservatism (e.g., requiring 33.5% less lateral space for bypassing) without incurring significant extra computation time.

      <title>TIMESAFE: Timing Interruption Monitoring and Security Assessment for Fronthaul Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 5G and beyond cellular systems embrace the disaggregation of Radio Access Network (RAN) components, exemplified by the evolution of the fronthaul (FH) connection between cellular baseband and radio unit equipment. Crucially, synchronization over the FH is pivotal for reliable 5G services. In recent years, there has been a push to move these links to an Ethernet-based packet network topology, leveraging existing standards and ongoing research for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). However, TSN standards, such as Precision Time Protocol (PTP), focus on performance with little to no concern for security. This increases the exposure of the open FH to security risks. Attacks targeting synchronization mechanisms pose significant threats, potentially disrupting 5G networks and impairing connectivity.
  In this paper, we demonstrate the impact of successful spoofing and replay attacks against PTP synchronization. We show how a spoofing attack is able to cause a production-ready O-RAN and 5G-compliant private cellular base station to catastrophically fail within 2 seconds of the attack, necessitating manual intervention to restore full network operations. To counter this, we design a Machine Learning (ML)-based monitoring solution capable of detecting various malicious attacks with over 97.5% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Properties of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling payoffs in repeated games is one of the important topics in control theory of multi-agent systems. Recently proposed zero-determinant strategies enable players to unilaterally enforce linear relations between payoffs. Furthermore, based on the mathematics of zero-determinant strategies, regional payoff control, in which payoffs are enforced into some feasible regions, has been discovered in social dilemma situations. More recently, theory of payoff control was extended to multichannel games, where players parallelly interact with each other in multiple channels. However, the existence of payoff-controlling strategies in multichannel games seems to require the existence of payoff-controlling strategies in some channels, and properties of zero-determinant strategies specific to multichannel games are still not clear. In this paper, we elucidate properties of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games. First, we relate the existence condition of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games to that of zero-determinant strategies in each channel. We then show that the existence of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games requires the existence of zero-determinant strategies in some channels. This result implies that the existence of zero-determinant strategies in multichannel games is tightly restricted by structure of games played in each channel.</description>

      <title>Online Learning and Coverage of Unknown Fields Using Random-Feature Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for multi-robot systems to perform simultaneous learning and coverage of a domain of interest characterized by an unknown and potentially time-varying density function. To overcome the limitations of Gaussian Process (GP) regression, we employ Random Feature GP (RFGP) and its online variant (O-RFGP) which enables online and incremental inference. By integrating these with Voronoi-based coverage control and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) sampling strategy, a team of robots can adaptively focus on important regions while refining the learned spatial field for efficient coverage. The incremental update mechanism of O-RFGP naturally supports time-varying environments, allowing efficient adaptation without retaining historical data. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, we provide the first theoretical analysis of online learning and coverage through a regret-based formulation, establishing asymptotic no-regret guarantees in the time-invariant setting. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through simulations with both time-invariant and time-varying density functions, along with a physical experiment with a time-varying density function.</description>

      <title>Toward an Agricultural Operational Design Domain: A Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The agricultural sector increasingly relies on autonomous systems that operate in complex and variable environments. Unlike on-road applications, agricultural automation integrates driving and working processes, each of which imposes distinct operational constraints. Handling this complexity and ensuring consistency throughout the development and validation processes requires a structured, transparent, and verified description of the environment. However, existing Operational Design Domain (ODD) concepts do not yet address the unique challenges of agricultural applications.
  Therefore, this work introduces the Agricultural ODD (Ag-ODD) Framework, which can be used to describe and verify the operational boundaries of autonomous agricultural systems. The Ag-ODD Framework consists of three core elements. First, the Ag-ODD description concept, which provides a structured method for unambiguously defining environmental and operational parameters using concepts from ASAM Open ODD and CityGML. Second, the 7-Layer Model derived from the PEGASUS 6-Layer Model, has been extended to include a process layer to capture dynamic agricultural operations. Third, the iterative verification process verifies the Ag-ODD against its corresponding logical scenarios, derived from the 7-Layer Model, to ensure the Ag-ODD's completeness and consistency.
  Together, these elements provide a consistent approach for creating unambiguous and verifiable Ag-ODD. Demonstrative use cases show how the Ag-ODD Framework can support the standardization and scalability of environmental descriptions for autonomous agricultural systems.</description>
