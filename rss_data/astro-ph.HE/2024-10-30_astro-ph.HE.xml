      <title>Inferring the Morphology of the Galactic Center Excess with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Descriptions of the Galactic Center using Fermi gamma-ray data have so far modeled the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) as a template with fixed spatial morphology or as a linear combination of such templates. Although these templates are informed by various physical expectations, the morphology of the excess is a priori unknown. For the first time, we describe the GCE using a flexible, non-parametric machine learning model -- the Gaussian process (GP). We assess our model's performance on synthetic data, demonstrating that the model can recover the templates used to generate the data. We then fit the \Fermi data with our model in a single energy bin from 2-20 GeV (leaving a spectral GP analysis of the GCE for future work) using a variety of template models of diffuse gamma-ray emission to quantify our fits' systematic uncertainties associated with diffuse emission modeling. We interpret our best-fit GP in terms of GCE templates consisting of an NFW squared template and a bulge component to determine which bulge models can best describe the fitted GP and to what extent the best-fit GP is described better by an NFW squared template versus a bulge template. The best-fit GP contains morphological features that are typically not associated with traditional GCE studies. These include a localized bright source at around $(\ell,b) = (20^{\circ}, 0^{\circ})$ and a diagonal arm extending Northwest from the Galactic Center. In spite of these novel features, the fitted GP is explained best by a template-based model consisting of the bulge presented in Coleman et al. (2020) and a squared NFW component. Our results suggest that the physical interpretation of the GCE in terms of stellar bulge and NFW-like components is highly sensitive to the assumed morphologies, background models, and the region of the sky used for inference.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of SN 2022jli: the first double-peaked stripped-envelope supernova showing periodic undulations and dust emission at late times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical and IR observations from maximum light until around 600 d of SN 2022jli, a peculiar SE SN showing two maxima, each one with a peak luminosity of about 3 x 10^{42} erg/s and separated by 50 d. The second maximum is followed by periodic undulations with a period of P ~ 12.5 days. The spectra and the photometric evolution of the first maximum are consistent with the behaviour of a standard SE SN with an ejecta mass of 1.5 +/- 0.4 Msun, and a nickel mass of 0.12 +/- 0.01 Msun. The optical spectra after 400 d correspond to a standard SN Ic event, and at late times SN 2022jli exhibits a significant drop in the optical luminosity implying that the physical phenomena that produced the secondary maximum has ceased to power the SN light curve. One possibility is that the second maximum is powered by a magnetar with an initial spin period of P=48.5 ms and a magnetic field of B = 8.5x10^{14} G, while the light curve periodic undulations could be produced by accretion of material from a companion star onto the neutron star in a binary system. The near-IR spectra shows clear 1st CO overtone emission from about 190 d after the first maximum, and it becomes undetected at 400 d. A significant near-IR excess from hot dust emission is detected at 238 d produced by either newly formed dust in the SN ejecta or due to a strong near-IR dust echo. Depending on the assumptions of the dust composition, the estimated dust mass is 2-16 x 10^{-4} Msun. The magnetar power of the second maximum can fit in a more general picture where magnetars are the power source of super-luminous SNe, could produce their frequent bumps and undulations, and where pulsars could produce the late time excess observed in some SE SNe. The detection of CO and the potential detection of dust formed in the ejecta of SN2022jli are important to understand the formation molecules and dust in the ejecta of SE SNe.</description>

      <title>Bow Shock and Local Bubble Plasma Unveiled by the Scintillating Millisecond Pulsar J0437$-$4715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar medium of the Milky Way contains turbulent plasma with structures driven by energetic processes that fuel star formation and shape the evolution of our Galaxy. Radio waves from pulsars are scattered off the small (au-scale and below) structures, resulting in frequency-dependent interference patterns that are modulated in time because of the relative motions of the pulsar, Earth, and plasma. Power spectral analyses of these patterns show parabolic arcs with curvatures that encode the locations and kinematics of individual structures. Here we report the discovery of at least 25 distinct plasma structures in the direction of the brilliant millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437$-$4715, in observations obtained with the MeerKAT radio telescope. Four arcs reveal structures within 5000 au of the pulsar, from a series of shocks induced as the pulsar and its wind interact with the ambient insterstellar medium. The measured radial distance and velocity of the main shock allows us to solve the shock geometry and space velocity of the pulsar in three dimensions, while the velocity of another structure unexpectedly indicates a back flow from the direction of the shock or pulsar-wind tail. The remaining 21 arcs represent a surprising abundance of structures sustained by turbulence within the Local Bubble -- a region of the interstellar medium thought to be depleted of gas by a series of supernova explosions about 14 Myr ago.</description>

      <title>The more accurately we model the metal-dependent star formation rate, the larger the predicted excess of binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the number of gravitational-wave detections grows, the merger rate of binary black holes (BBHs) can help us to constrain their formation, the properties of their progenitors, and their birth environment. Here, we aim to address the impact of the metal-dependent star formation rate (SFR) on the BBH merger rate. To this end, we have developed a fully data-driven approach to model the metal-dependent SFR and coupled it to BBH evolution. We have adopted the most up-to-date scaling relations, based on recent observational results, and we have studied how the BBH merger rate density varies over a wide grid of galaxy and binary evolution parameters. Our results show that including a realistic metal-dependent SFR evolution yields a value of the merger rate density which is too high compared to the one inferred from GW data. Moreover, variations of the SFR in low-mass galaxies ($M_\ast \lesssim 10^8 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) do not contribute more than a factor $\sim 2$ to the overall merger rate density at redshift $z=0$. These results suggest that the discrepancy between the BBH merger rate density inferred from data and theoretical models is not caused by approximations in the treatment of the metal-dependent SFR, but rather stems from stellar evolution models and/or BBH formation channels.</description>

      <title>Connecting the X-ray/UV variability of Fairall 9 with NICER: A Possible Warm Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Seyfert 1 AGN Fairall 9 was targeted by NICER, Swift, and ground-based observatories for a $\sim$1000-day long reverberation mapping campaign. The following analysis of NICER spectra taken at a two-day cadence provides new insights into the structure and heating mechanisms of the central black hole environment. Observations of Fairall 9 with NICER and Swift revealed a strong relationship between the flux of the UV continuum and the X-ray soft excess, indicating the presence of a "warm" Comptonized corona which likely lies in the upper layers of the innermost accretion flow, serving as a second reprocessor between the "hot" X-ray corona and the accretion disk. The X-ray emission from the hot corona lacks sufficient energy and variability to power slow changes in the UV light curve on timescales of 30 days or longer, suggesting an intrinsic disk-driven variability process in the UV and soft X-rays. Fast variability in the UV on timescales shorter than 30 days can be explained through X-ray reprocessing, and the observed weak X-ray/UV correlation suggests that the corona changes dynamically throughout the campaign.</description>

      <title>Variable structures in the stellar wind of the HMXB Vela X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong stellar winds are an important feature in wind-accreting high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) systems, providing insights into stellar evolution and their impact on surrounding environments. However, the long-term evolution and temporal variability of these winds are not fully understood. This work probes the archetypal wind-accreting HMXB Vela X-1 using MAXI observations over 14 years, focusing on orbit-to-orbit absorption variability in the 2-10 keV band. Additionally, the relation between hardness ratio trends in binary orbits and neutron star spin states is investigated. We calculate hardness ratios to track absorption variability, comparing flux changes across energy bands, as the effect of absorption on the flux is energy-dependent. Variability is analyzed by comparing hardness ratio trends across binary orbits to the MAXI long-term averaged evolution. The long-term averaged hardness ratio evolution displays a stable pattern. Yet, individual binary orbits reveal different hardness ratio evolutions between consecutive orbits with no evident periodicity. Less than half of the binary orbits align with the long-term evolution. Moreover, neutron star spin-up episodes exhibit harder-than-average hardness trends compared to spin-down episodes, although their distributions overlap considerably. The long-term averaged hardness ratio dispersion is consistent with absorption column densities reported in literature from shorter observations, suggesting that heterogeneous wind structures, including accretion wakes and wind clumps, drive observed variations. The orbit-to-orbit variability indicates that pointed X-ray observations provide limited insight into wind structure. The link between neutron star spin states and hardness trends underscores the influence of accretion on absorption, with variability tied to stellar wind density fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Einstein Probe discovery of EP240408a: a peculiar X-ray transient with an intermediate timescale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a peculiar X-ray transient, EP240408a, by Einstein Probe (EP) and follow-up studies made with EP, Swift, NICER, GROND, ATCA and other ground-based multi-wavelength telescopes. The new transient was first detected with Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) on board EP on April 8th, 2024, manifested in an intense yet brief X-ray flare lasting for 12 seconds. The flare reached a peak flux of 3.9x10^(-9) erg/cm2/s in 0.5-4 keV, about 300 times brighter than the underlying X-ray emission detected throughout the observation. Rapid and more precise follow-up observations by EP/FXT, Swift and NICER confirmed the finding of this new transient. Its X-ray spectrum is non-thermal in 0.5-10 keV, with a power-law photon index varying within 1.8-2.5. The X-ray light curve shows a plateau lasting for about 4 days, followed by a steep decay till becoming undetectable about 10 days after the initial detection. Based on its temporal property and constraints from previous EP observations, an unusual timescale in the range of 7-23 days is found for EP240408a, which is intermediate between the commonly found fast and long-term transients. No counterparts have been found in optical and near-infrared, with the earliest observation at 17 hours after the initial X-ray detection, suggestive of intrinsically weak emission in these bands. We demonstrate that the remarkable properties of EP240408a are inconsistent with any of the transient types known so far, by comparison with, in particular, jetted tidal disruption events, gamma-ray bursts, X-ray binaries and fast blue optical transients. The nature of EP240408a thus remains an enigma. We suggest that EP240408a may represent a new type of transients with intermediate timescales of the order of about 10 days. The detection and follow-ups of more of such objects are essential for revealing their origin.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a peculiar Einstein Probe transient EP240408a: an exotic gamma-ray burst or an abnormal jetted tidal disruption event?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of our multi-wavelength (X-ray to radio) follow-up campaign of the Einstein Probe transient EP240408a. The initial 10 s trigger displayed bright soft X-ray (0.5-4 keV) radiation with peak luminosity $L_\textrm{X} \gtrsim 10^{49}$ ($10^{50}$) erg s$^{-1}$ for an assumed redshift z&gt;0.5 (2.0). The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR discovered a fading X-ray counterpart lasting for $\sim$5 d (observer frame), which showed a long-lived (~4 d) plateau-like emission ($t^{-0.5}$) before a sharp powerlaw decline ($t^{-7}$). The plateau emission was in excess of $L_\textrm{X} \gtrsim 10^{46}$ ($10^{47}$) erg s$^{-1}$ at z&gt;0.5 (2.0). Deep optical and radio observations resulted in non-detections of the transient. Our observations with Gemini South revealed a faint potential host galaxy ($r \approx 24$ AB mag) near the edge of the X-ray localization. The faint candidate host, and lack of other potential hosts ($r \gtrsim 26$ AB mag; $J \gtrsim 23$ AB mag), implies a higher redshift origin (z&gt;0.5), which produces extreme X-ray properties that are inconsistent with many known extragalactic transient classes. In particular, the lack of a bright gamma-ray counterpart, with the isotropic-equivalent energy ($10 - 10,000$ keV) constrained by GECam and Konus-Wind to $E_{\gamma,\textrm{iso}} \lesssim 4\times10^{51}$ ($6\times10^{52}$) erg at z&gt;0.5 (2.0), conflicts with known gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) of similar X-ray luminosities. We therefore favor a jetted tidal disruption event (TDE) as the progenitor of EP240408a at z&gt;1.0, possibly caused by the disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole. The alternative is that EP240408a may represent a new, previously unknown class of transient.</description>

      <title>A 34-Year Timing Solution of the Redback Millisecond Pulsar Terzan 5A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 34-year timing solution of the redback pulsar system Terzan 5A (Ter5A). Ter5A, also known as B1744$-$24A or J1748$-$2446A, has a 11.56 ms pulse period, a $\sim$0.1 solar mass dwarf companion star, and an orbital period of 1.82 hours. Ter5A displays highly variable eclipses and orbital perturbations. Using new timing techniques, we have determined a phase-connected timing solution for this system over 34 years. This is the longest ever published for a redback pulsar. We find that the pulsar's spin variability is much larger than most globular cluster pulsars. In fact, of the nine redback pulsars with published or in preparation long-term timing solutions, Ter5A is by far the noisiest. We see no evidence of strong correlations between orbital and spin variability of the pulsar. We also find that long-term astrometric timing measurements are likely too contaminated by this variability to be usable, and therefore require careful short-term timing to determine reasonable positions. Finally, we measure an orbital period contraction of $-2.5(3) \times 10^{-13}$, which is likely dominated by the general relativistic orbital decay of the system. The effects of the orbital variability due to the redback nature of the pulsar are not needed to explain the observed orbital period derivative, but they are constrained to less than $\sim$30% of the observed value.</description>

      <title>The Soft X-ray Aspect of Gamma-ray Bursts in the Einstein Probe Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein Probe (EP) satellite, dedicated at time-domain high-energy astrophysics and multi-messenger astronomy, was recently launched and successfully put into operation. The wide-field X-ray telescope (WXT, 0.5-4 keV) onboard has identified multiple gamma-ray burst (GRB) events, with an average duration of approximately 100 seconds. This duration is several times longer than the average duration of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, which typically stands at around 20 seconds. Additionally, EP has detected some unknown X-ray transients whose connection to GRBs is uncertain, due to the absence of gamma-ray counterparts and efficient follow-up observation at multi-wavelengths. It is urgent to understand the physical origin of the intriguing EP GRBs. Inspired by studies of GRB 170817A, we suggest that EP GRBs may primarily consist of off-axis viewed bursts, forming a unique population among the GRB zoo. Based on LGRBs' statistical properties during the prompt phase, we explore observable properties of on-axis and off-axis LGRBs in the soft X-ray band. We predict the characteristics of several observables for these GRBs, including the duration, energy fluence, low-energy spectral index, and the slopes of Amati and Yonetoku relations, which could be tested with a larger sample of GRB events detected by EP in the future.</description>

      <title>Spectral study of very high energy gamma rays from SS 433 with HAWC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very-high-energy (0.1-100 TeV) gamma-ray emission was observed in HAWC data from the lobes of the microquasar SS 433, making them the first set of astrophysical jets that were resolved at TeV energies. In this work, we update the analysis of SS 433 using 2,565 days of data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory. Our analysis reports the detection of a point-like source in the east lobe at a significance of $6.6\,\sigma$ and in the west lobe at a significance of $8.2\,\sigma$. For each jet lobe, we localize the gamma-ray emission and identify a best-fit position. The locations are close to the X-ray emission sites "e1" and "w1" for the east and west lobes, respectively. We analyze the spectral energy distributions and find that the energy spectra of the lobes are consistent with a simple power-law $\text{d}N/\text{d}E\propto E^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha = -2.44^{+0.13+0.04}_{-0.12-0.04}$ and $\alpha = -2.35^{+0.12+0.03}_{-0.11-0.03}$ for the east and west lobes, respectively. The maximum energy of photons from the east and west lobes reaches 56 TeV and 123 TeV, respectively. We compare our observations to various models and conclude that the very-high-energy gamma-ray emission can be produced by a population of electrons that were efficiently accelerated.</description>

      <title>The Proper Motion of the High Galactic Latitude Pulsar Calvera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calvera (1RXS J141256.0+792204) is a pulsar of characteristic age 285 kyr at a high Galactic latitude of b=+37{\deg}, detected only in soft thermal X-rays. We measure a new and precise proper motion for Calvera using Chandra HRC-I observations obtained 10 years apart. We also derive a new phase-connected ephemeris using 6 years of NICER data, including the astrometric position and proper motion as fixed parameters in the timing solution. Calvera is located near the center of a faint, circular radio ring that was recently discovered by LOFAR and confirmed as a supernova remnant (SNR) by the detection of gamma-ray emission with Fermi/LAT. The proper motion of $78.5 \pm 2.9$ mas/yr at position angle $241{\deg}.3 \pm 2{\deg}.2$ (in Galactic coordinates) points away from the center of the ring, a result which differs markedly from a previous low-significance measurement, and greatly simplifies the interpretation of the SNR/pulsar association. It argues that the supernova indeed birthed Calvera &lt;10 kyr ago, with an initial spin period close to its present value of 59 ms. The tangential velocity of the pulsar depends on its uncertain distance, $v_t=(372 \pm 14) d_{1 kpc}$ km/s, but is probably dominated by the supernova kick, while its progenitor could have been a runaway O or B star from the Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Causality for first-order phase transition and its implication to neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causality is an important factor determining the maximum mass of a neutron star. Previous works studies causality for smooth equation of state. The density at the core of neutron stars can be few times nuclear saturation density, where the occurrence of first-order phase transition has not been ruled out. The causality condition for first-order phase transition is characteristically different from the causality condition of smooth equation of state which can be evident in the mass-radius expression. In this letter we examine the causality condition for first-order phase transition and its observational significance in the mass-radius sequence. We find that equation of state having first-order phase transition, the causality line deviates considerably from the that of smooth equation of state. Depending on the strength of the discontinuity and the onset density of phase transition there is a narrow band in the mass-radius plot which is available only to the stars having smooth equation of state. This can have significant consequence in the sense that if some pulsars are to lie in this band one can rule out equation of state having first-order phase transition occurring at that particular onset density.</description>

      <title>Neutrino detection rates from lepto-hadronic model simulations of bright blazar flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is mounting evidence that blazars are the sources of part of the very-high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux detected by IceCube. In particular, there have been several spatial and temporal coincidences of individual IceCube neutrino events with flaring blazars, the most prominent of them being IceCube-170922A, coincident with a multi-wavelength flare of TXS~0506+056. Motivated by this, we used the time-dependent lepto-hadronic code OneHaLe to model the spectral energy distributions and light curves of a sample of bright $\gamma$-ray flares of blazars detected by Fermi-LAT, for which Kreter et al. (2020) provided calorimetric estimates of the expected neutrino detection rates. Flares were modelled with temporal changes of the proton injection spectra. Our analysis shows that the calorimetric approach overestimates the increase in neutrino production by a factor of typically $\sim 10$ if the $\gamma$-ray emission is dominated by proton-synchrotron radiation.</description>

      <title>Rapid cooling of the Cassiopeia A neutron star due to superfluid quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid cooling of the neutron star in Cassiopeia A is speculated to arise from an enhanced neutrino emission caused by the onset of $^3P_2$-wave neutron superfluidity in the core. However, the neutrino emissivity due to Cooper-pair breaking and formation is too small to yield the observed cooling rate. Here, we show that such a rapid cooling can be explained once the non-Fermi liquid behavior of the non-superfluid neutron liquid induced by superfluid quantum criticality is included into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling, without assuming the existence of additional energy loss processes. Our results indicate that the neutron star in Cassiopeia A remains in the thermal relaxation stage, which is greatly prolonged by the non-Fermi liquid behavior. The good agreement between our theoretical results and recent observational cooling data points to the pivotal role played by superfluid quantum criticality in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Characterization and classification of $\gamma$-ray bursts from blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars are the most common sources of $\gamma$-ray photons in the extra-galactic sky. Their $\gamma$-ray light-curves are characterized by bright flaring episodes, similarly to what is observed at longer wavelengths. These Gamma-Ray Bursts from Blazars (GRBBLs) have been extensively studied individually, but never in terms of a population. The goal of this work is to provide a global characterization of GRBBLs, to investigate the parameter space of the population, and ultimately to classify GRBBLs. Their global properties could give insights on the physical mechanisms responsible for the $\gamma$-ray radiation and on the origin of the observed variability. I analyze a sample of publicly available Fermi-LAT light-curves, utilizing only blazars with certain redshift measurements. The redshift-corrected light-curves are then automatically scanned to identify GRBBLs. A simple flare profile, with exponential rise and decay, is then fitted to all events. The fit parameters, together with global properties from the LAT catalog, are then used as input for unsupervised machine learning classification. The analysis shows that the GRBBL population is remarkably homogeneous. When using only the properties of the integral light-curves, the classifier converges into a single population. When adding information on the evolution of the photon index, the classifier splits the population into achromatic (the large majority) and chromatic (the outliers) GRBBLs. As by product of this study, I identify a correlation between the rising/decay time-scales of the GRBBLs and their peak luminosity.</description>

      <title>A data-driven approach for modeling the temporal and spectral evolution of kilonova systematic uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kilonovae, possible electromagnetic counterparts to neutron star mergers, provide important information about high-energy transient phenomena and, in principle, also allow us to obtain information about the source properties responsible for powering the kilonova. Unfortunately, numerous uncertainties exist in kilonova modeling that, at the current stage, hinder accurate predictions. Hence, one has to account for possible systematic modeling uncertainties when interpreting the observed transients. In this work, we provide a data-driven approach to account for time-dependent and frequency-dependent uncertainties in kilonova models. Through a suite of tests, we find that the most reliable recovery of the source parameters and description of the observational data can be obtained through a combination of kilonova models with time- and frequency-dependent systematic uncertainties. We apply our new method to analyze AT2017gfo. While recovering a total ejecta mass consistent with previous studies, our approach gives insights into the temporal and spectral evolution of the systematic uncertainties of this kilonova. We consistently find a systematic error below $1$ mag between $1$ to $5$ days after the merger. Our work addresses the need for early follow-up of kilonovae at earlier times, and improved modeling of the kilonova at later times, to reduce the uncertainties outside of this time window.</description>

      <title>SN 1885A and supernova remnants in the centre of M31 with LOFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first LOFAR image of the centre of M31 at a frequency of 150 MHz. We clearly detect three supernova remnants, which, along with archival VLA data at 3 GHz and other published radio and X-ray data allows us to characterize them in detail. Our observations also allow us to obtain upper limits the historical SN 1885A which is undetected even at a low frequency of 150 MHz. From analytical modelling we find that SN 1885A will stay in its free-expansion phase for at least another couple of centuries. We find an upper limit of $n_{\rm H}~\lesssim 0.04$ cm$^{-3}$ for the interstellar medium of SN 1885A, and that the SN ejecta density is not shallower than $\propto r^{-9}$ (on average). From the $2.6\sigma$ tentative detection in X-ray, our analysis shows that non-thermal emission is expected to dominate the SN 1885A emission. Comparing our results with those on G1.9+0.3, we find that it is likely that the asymmetries in G1.9+0.3 make it a more efficient radio and X-ray emitter than SN 1885A. For Braun 80, 95 and 101, the other remnants in this region, we estimate ages of 5200, 8100, and 13,100 years, and shock speeds of 1150, 880, and 660 km s$^{-1}$}, respectively. Based on this, the supernova rate in the central 0.5 kpc $\times$ 0.6 kpc of M31 is at least one per $\sim 3000~{\rm yr}$. We estimate radio spectral indices of $-0.66\pm0.05$, $-0.37\pm0.03$ and $-0.50\pm0.03$ for the remnants, respectively, which match fairly well with previous studies.</description>

      <title>Pulsar timing methods for evaluating dispersion measure time series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio pulsars allow the study of the ionised interstellar medium and its dispersive effects, a major noise source in gravitational wave searches using pulsars. In this paper, we compare the functionality and reliability of three commonly used schemes to measure temporal variations in interstellar propagation effects in pulsar-timing data. We carry out extensive simulations at low observing frequencies (100-200 MHz) by injecting long-term correlated noise processes with power-law spectra and white noise, to evaluate the robustness, accuracy and precision of the following three mitigation methods: epoch-wise (EW) measurements of interstellar dispersion; the DMX method of simultaneous, piece-wise fits to interstellar dispersion; and DMGP, which models dispersion variations through Gaussian processes using a Bayesian analysis method. We then evaluate how reliably the input signals are reconstructed and how the various methods react to the presence of achromatic long-period noise. All the methods perform well, provided the achromatic long-period noise is modeled for DMX and DMGP. The most precise method is DMGP, followed by DMX and EW, while the most accurate is EW, followed by DMX and DMGP. We also test different scenarios including simulations of L-band ToAs and realistic DM injection, with no significant variation in the obtained results. Given the nature of our simulations and our scope, we deem that EW is the most reliable method to study the Galactic ionized media. Future works should be conducted to confirm this result via more realistic simulations. We note that DM GP and DMX seem to be the most performing techniques in removing long-term correlated noise, and hence for gravitational wave studies. However, full simulations of pulsar timing array experiments are needed to support this interpretation.</description>

      <title>Confinement of relativistic particles in the vicinity of accelerators: a key for understanding the anomalies in secondary cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent cosmic ray (CR) measurements have revealed unexpected anomalies in secondary CRs, namely deviations from the predictions of the so-called standard Galactic CR paradigm regarding the composition and energy spectra of the products of interactions of primary (accelerated) CRs with interstellar gas: (i) antiparticles (positrons and antiprotons), (ii) light elements of the (Li, Be, B) group, and (iii) diffuse gamma rays. We argue that the new measurements can still be explained within the standard CR paradigm but with an additional assumption that CRs spend a significant part of their lifetime near their formation sites. The latter can be realized if CRs propagate more slowly in these localized regions than in the interstellar medium (ISM). Postulating that CRs accumulate on average energy-independent "grammage" of $0.7 \ \rm g/cm^2$ near the major contributors to galactic CRs, one can explain self-consistently the new measurements of the B/C ratio by DAMPE and the diffuse ultra-high-energy gamma-rays by LHAASO, involving a minimal number of model parameters: the energy-dependent "grammage" in the interstellar medium $\rm \lambda \approx 8 (E/10 \ GeV)^{-0.55}~\rm g/cm^{2}$ and the average CR acceleration (sourcee) spectrum, $\rm Q(E) \propto E^{-2.3}$.</description>

      <title>Temporal and spectral variations of the X-ray pulsar Cen X-3 observed by NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a time-resolved analysis of the accreting X-ray pulsar Cen X-3 using observations carried out by NuSTAR, which cover approximately two binary orbits in different intensity states. The pulse profile is relatively stable over the orbital phase and shows energy dependence. It has an obvious double-peaked shape in the energy band below 15 keV -- with the second pulse peak decreasing as energy increases -- and is gradually dominated by a single peak in higher energy bands. We find that the pulse profile in the energy band of 3-5 keV at high-intensity states shows a subtle triple-peaked shape, with the main peak divided into two subpeaks. We also find a positive correlation between the pulse fraction and both energy and flux. Our spectral analysis reveals that the spectra can be well described by the continuum of Fermi-Dirac cutoff and NPEX models, and the cyclotron line is detected with the centroid energies varying from 26 keV to 29 keV, along with the iron emission line around 6.4 keV. We investigated the dependence between the cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) centroid energy and luminosity and discuss the theoretical critical luminosity. Although the variation of $E_{\rm cyc}- L_X$ is not distinct, there is a possibility that the critical luminosity lies within the range of $\sim (0.5-4)\times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the band of $4-78$ keV. The photon index shows a strong positive correlation with luminosity. Our orbital-phase analysis reveals that the spectral parameters show orbital variability, and the highly variable photoelectric absorption may indicate the existence of clumpy stellar winds.</description>

      <title>Non-LTE Synthetic Observables of a Multidimensional Model of Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many promising explosion models for the elusive origin of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) ultimately fail to completely reproduce a number of observed properties of these events. One limiting factor for many of these models is the use of the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) assumption in the calculation of their synthetic observables, which has been shown to prevent the accurate prediction of a number of fundamental features of SNe Ia. The inclusion of high-accuracy non-LTE physics, however, increases computational cost and complexity such that multidimensional non-LTE calculations are often unfeasible, which can be problematic for models that are inherently multidimensional. In this work, we conduct radiative transfer calculations using 1D profiles that each correspond with a line of sight from an asymmetric, 2D SN Ia model. We find, in LTE, that the synthetic observables from these calculations efficiently reproduce those from the 2D calculation when an equivalence of bolometric luminosities between the 1D and 2D treatments is enforced. This allows for the accurate calculation of synthetic observables in 1D while still preserving multidimensional effects associated with the model. We leverage this to produce high accuracy observables from 1D non-LTE calculations, showing significantly improved agreement with observation, including a roughly 50% reduction of $B$-band decline rate into congruence with the observed Phillips relation. Additionally, our non-LTE observables show Si II $\lambda$5972 pEWs that are much more similar to observation, while spanning multiple Branch classes, suggesting that some spectral classifications of SNe Ia arise from line of sight effects.</description>

      <title>A wiggling filamentary jet at the origin of the blazar multi-wavelength behaviour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars are beamed active galactic nuclei known for their strong multi-wavelength variability on timescales from years down to minutes. We aim to investigate the suitability of the twisting jet model presented in previous works to explain the multi-wavelength behaviour of BL Lacertae, the prototype of one of the blazar classes. According to this model, the jet is inhomogeneous, curved, and twisting, and the long-term variability is due to changes in the Doppler factor due to variations in the orientation of the jet-emitting regions. We analysed optical data of the source obtained during monitoring campaigns organised by the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) in 2019-2022, together with radio data from the WEBT and other teams, and gamma-ray data from the Fermi satellite. In this period, BL Lacertae underwent an extraordinary activity phase, reaching its historical optical and gamma-ray brightness maxima. The application of the twisting jet model to the source light curves allows us to infer the wiggling motion of the optical, radio, and gamma-ray jet-emitting regions. The optical-radio correlation shows that the changes in the radio viewing angle follow those in the optical viewing angle by about 120 days, and it suggests that the jet is composed of plasma filaments, which is in agreement with some radio high-resolution observations of other sources. The gamma-ray emitting region is found to be co-spatial with the optical one, and the analysis of the gamma-optical correlation is consistent with both the geometric interpretation and a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) origin of the high-energy photons. We propose a geometric scenario where the jet is made up of a pair of emitting plasma filaments in a sort of double-helix curved rotating structure, whose wiggling motion produces changes in the Doppler beaming and can thus explain the observed multi-wavelength long-term variability.</description>

      <title>Unfolding X-ray Spectral Data: Conditions and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present conditions for which X-ray spectra can be ``unfolded'' to present accurate representation of the true source spectra. The method we use to unfold the data is implemented in the \textit{Interactive Spectral Interpretation Software} \citep{Houck2000} and distinguishes itself as being model-independent. We find that this method of unfolding makes accurate representations of the true source spectra (1) The detector is high-resolution and (2) The spectrum is not steeply sloped. These criteria are not simple conditions that give concrete determinations; each detector and spectrum must be judged individually. We find that both grating and imaging detectors can be unfolded with minimal distortions as compared to both continuum and local spectral features; the latter CCD detectors being much more energy dependent. We also provide example use cases for unfolding in the context of current generation X-ray observatories and important caveats.</description>

      <title>Pi in the Sky: Neutron Stars with Exceptionally Light QCD Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of axion condensed neutron stars that arise in models of an exceptionally light axion that couples to quantum chromodynamics (QCD). These axions solve the strong-charge-parity (CP) problem, but have a mass-squared lighter than that due to QCD by a factor of $\varepsilon&lt;1$. Inside dense matter, the axion potential is altered, and much of the matter in neutron stars resides in the axion condensed phase where the strong-CP parameter $\theta =\pi$ and CP remains a good symmetry. In these regions, masses and interactions of nuclei are modified, in turn changing the equation of state (EOS), structure and phenomenology of the neutron stars. We take first steps toward the study of the EOS of neutron star matter at $\theta =\pi$ within chiral effective field theory and use relativistic mean field theory to deduce the resulting changes to nuclear matter and the neutron star low-density EOS. We derive constraints on the exceptionally light axion parameter space based on observations of the thermal relaxation of accreting neutron stars, isolated neutron star cooling, and pulsar glitches, excluding the region up to $5 \times 10^{-7} \lesssim \varepsilon \lesssim 0.2$ for $ m_a \gtrsim 2\times 10^{-9}\,{\rm eV} $. We comment on potential changes to the neutron star mass-radius relationship, and discuss the possibility of novel, nuclear-density compact objects with $\theta =\pi$ that are stabilized not by gravity but by the axion potential.</description>

      <title>Millilensing induced systematic biases in parameterized tests of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tests of general relativity (GR) can be systematically biased when our waveform models are inaccurate. We here study systematic biases in tests of general relativity induced by neglecting lensing effects for millilensed gravitational-wave signals, where the lens mass is typically in the $10^3M_\odot$--$10^5M_\odot$ range. In particular, we use a nested-sampling Bayesian parameter estimation and model selection analysis of a millilensed signal with an unlensed parameterized post-Einsteinian (ppE) recovery model. We find that the ppE model is significantly biased toward a detection of a deviation from general relativity at signal-to-noise ratios of 30 and higher, especially when the source is aligned with the lens mass (the lensing effect is pronounced) and when its total mass is low (the signal duration is long). We use a toy model and the linear signal and Laplace approximations to provide a semi-analytic explanation for the trends in the systematic errors found in the nested sampling analysis. Moreover, a Bayes factor analysis reveals that the (unlensed) ppE model is weakly favored over the (unlensed) GR model, and a fitting factor study shows there is a significant loss of signal-to-noise ratio when using the (unlensed) ppE model. This implies that although a parameter estimation study may incorrectly infer a deviation from general relativity, a residual signal-to-noise ratio test would reveal that the ppE model is not a good fit to the data. Thus, with current detectors, millilensing-induced systematic biases are unlikely to result in false positive detections of GR deviations.</description>

      <title>Ultraheavy multiscattering dark matter: DUNE, CYGNUS, kilotonne detectors, and tidal streams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In direct searches of dark matter, multi-scatter signatures are now being sought to probe scattering cross sections that are large enough to make the detector optically thick to incident particles. We provide some significant updates to the multi-scatter program. Using considerations of energy deposition, we derive the reaches in cross section and mass of various proposed large-volume detectors: a kilotonne fiducial mass "module of opportunity" at DUNE, a kilotonne xenon detector suggested for neutrinoless double beta decay, the gaseous detector CYGNUS, and the dark matter detectors XLZD and Argo. Where the velocity vector can be reconstructed event-by-event, the Galactic dark matter velocity distribution may be inferred. We exploit this to show that halo substructure such as tidal streams can be picked up if they make up about 10% of the local dark matter density.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent flavour ratios in neutrino telescopes from charm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the observed diffuse neutrino flux is not yet known. Studies of the relative flavour content of the neutrino flux detected at Earth can give information on the production mechanisms at the sources and on flavour mixing, complementary to measurements of the spectral index and normalisation. Here we demonstrate the effects of neutrino fluxes with different spectral shapes and different initial flavour compositions dominating at different energies, and we study the sensitivity of future measurements with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. Where one kind of flux gives way to another, this shows up as a non-trivial energy dependence in the flavour compositions. We explore this in the context of slow-jet supernovae and magnetar-driven supernovae -- two examples of astrophysical sources where charm production may be effective. Using current best-fit neutrino mixing parameters and their projected 2040 uncertainties, we use event ratios of different event morphologies at IceCube to illustrate the possibilities of distinguishing the energy dependence of neutrino flavour ratios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06867v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first high-energy neutrino source identified by IceCube was a blazar -- an active galactic nucleus driving a relativistic jet towards Earth. Jets driven by accreting black holes are commonly assumed to be needed for high-energy neutrino production. Recently, IceCube discovered neutrinos from Seyfert galaxies, which appears unrelated to jet activity. Here, we show that the observed luminosity ratios of neutrinos and hard X-rays from blazars TXS 0506+056 and GB6 J1542+6129 are consistent with neutrino production in a $\gamma$-obscured region near a central supermassive black hole, with the X-ray flux corresponding to reprocessed $\gamma$-ray emission with flux comparable to that of neutrinos. Similar neutrino - hard X-ray flux ratios are found for four Seyfert galaxies, NGC 1068, NGC 4151, CGCG 420-015 and NGC 3079, raising the possibility of a common neutrino production mechanism that may not involve a strong jet.</description>

      <title>Origin of the break in the cosmic-ray electron plus positron spectrum at ~ 1 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the cosmic-ray electron plus positron spectrum by several experiments have confirmed the presence of a break at $\sim\,1$ TeV. The origin of the break is still not clearly understood. In this work, we explore different possibilities for the origin which include an electron source spectrum with a broken power-law, a power-law with an exponential or super-exponential cut-offs and the absence of potential nearby cosmic-ray sources. Based on the observed electron plus positron data from the DAMPE and the H.E.S.S experiments, and considering supernova remnants as the main sources of cosmic rays in the Galaxy, we find statistical evidence in favour of the scenario with a broken power-law source spectrum with the best-fit source parameters obtained as $\Gamma=2.39$ for the source spectral index, $E_0\approx 1.6$ TeV for the break energy and $f=1.59\times 10^{48}$ ergs for the amount of supernova kinetic energy injected into cosmic-ray electrons. Such a power-law break in the spectrum has been predicted for electrons confined inside supernova remnants after acceleration via diffusive shock acceleration process, and also indicated by the multi-wavelength study of supernova remnants. All these evidences have shown that the observed spectral break provides a strong indication of a direct link between cosmic-ray electrons and their sources. Our findings further show that electrons must undergo spectral changes while escaping the source region in order to reconcile the difference between the spectral index of electrons observed inside supernova remnants and that obtained from Galactic cosmic-ray propagation studies.</description>

      <title>Recurring tidal disruption events a decade apart in IRAS F01004-2237</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a second optical flare that occurred in September 2021 in IRAS F01004-2237, where the first flare occurred in 2010 has been reported, and present a detailed analysis of multi-band data. The position of the flare coincides with the galaxy centre with a precision of 650 pc. The flare peaks in $\sim50$ days with an absolute magnitude of $\sim-21$ and fades in two years roughly following $L\propto t^{-5/3}$. It maintains a nearly constant blackbody temperature of $\sim$22,000 K in the late time. Its optical and UV spectra show hydrogen and helium broad emission lines with full width at half maxima of 7,000--21,000 km s$^{-1}$ and He II/H$\alpha$ ratio of 0.3--2.3. It shows weak X-ray emission relative to UV emission, with X-ray flares lasting for $&lt;2-3$ weeks, during which the spectrum is soft with a power-law index $\Gamma=4.4^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$. These characters are consistent with a tidal disruption event (TDE), ruling out the possibilities of a supernova or an active galactic nuclei flare. With a TDE model, we infer a peak UV luminosity of $3.3\pm0.2\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and an energy budget of $4.5\pm0.2\times10^{51}$ erg. The two optical flares separated by $10.3\pm0.3$ years can be interpreted as repeating partial TDEs, double TDEs, or two independent TDEs. Although no definitive conclusion can be drawn, the partial TDEs interpretation predicts a third flare around 2033, and the independent TDEs interpretation predicts a high TDE rate of $\gtrsim10^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ in F01004-2237, both of which can be tested by future observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate the dynamics of about 600 quantum vortices in a spinning-down cylindrical container using a Gross--Pitaevskii model. For the first time, we find convincing spatial-temporal evidence of avalanching behaviour resulting from vortex depinning and collective motion. During a typical avalanche, about 10 to 20 vortices exit the container in a short period, producing a glitch in the superfluid angular momentum and a localised void in the vorticity. After the glitch, vortices continue to depin and circulate around the vorticity void in a similar manner to that seen in previous point-vortex simulations. We present evidence of collective vortex motion throughout this avalanche process. We also show that the effective Magnus force can be used to predict when and where avalanches will occur. Lastly, we comment on the challenge of extrapolating these results to conditions in real neutron stars, which contain many orders of magnitude more vortices.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation and transformation in the frame of magnetohydrodynamics with a vortex electric field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17724v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bright transient objects in different wave bands have been discovered in recent years. To explain these short (from ms to s), and very powerful events different models, galactic and extragalactic, have been considered. One of popular model is based on the suggestion of transformation of the magnetized plasma blob, presumably a MHD shock wave, moving with relativistic speed, into electromagnetic pulse after collision with some obstacle, or at entering in media with different properties. Such transformation cannot be described in the frame of classical MHD equations, which don't contain the displacement current, and don't include such transformation. Updating of the classic MHD equations by using of full set of Maxwell equation with displacement current, made recently by several authors, gave a possibility to describe hydrodynamic phenomena, together with electromagnetic ones by the same set of equations. Here we apply these equations for study of propagation of different waves with account of displacement current, and of transformation between different kind of waves in the nonuniform media. We derive a dispersion equation describing a propagation of a weak linear wave in a uniform magnetized plasma, and consider in details the cases with perpendicular and parallel motion to the magnetic field. It contains MHD, HD, Alfven and EM waves in the limiting cases, and some new types of behaviour in a general situation. We consider a plasma with zero viscosity and heat conductivity, with a finite scalar electric conductivity. We have shown, that transformation of MHD into EM wave may happen only in a highly magnetized plasma, and have found the region of parameters, where no waves exist, and only damping static perturbations may be present.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Magnus effect from scalar dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In fluid dynamics, the Magnus effect is the force perpendicular to the motion of a spinning object as it moves through a medium. In general relativity, an analogous effect exists for a spinning compact object moving through matter, purely as a result of gravitational interactions. In this work we consider a Kerr black hole moving at relativistic velocities through scalar dark matter that is at rest. We simulate the system numerically and extract the total spin-curvature force on the black hole perpendicular to its motion. We confirm that the force scales linearly with the dimensionless spin parameter $a/M$ of the black hole up to $a/M = 0.99$, and measure its dependence on the speed $v$ of the black hole in the range $0.1 \le v \le 0.55$ for a fixed spin. Compared to previous analytic work applicable at small $v$, higher-order corrections in the velocity are found to be important: the total force is nonzero, and the dependence is not linear in $v$. We find that in all cases the total force is in the opposite direction to the hydrodynamical analogue, although at low speeds it appears to approach the expectation that the Weyl and Magnus components cancel. Spin-curvature effects may leave an imprint on gravitational wave signals from extreme mass-ratio inspirals, where the secondary black hole has a nonnegligible spin and moves in the presence of a dark matter cloud. We hope that our simulations can be used to support and extend the limits of analytic results, which are necessary to better quantify such effects in the relativistic regime.</description>

Abstract: Sub-GeV neutrinos produced in a stellar core may emerge from main sequence stars, white dwarfs and brown dwarfs producing possible observable signals of dark matter capture. A distribution of these stars near the Milky Way galactic center will produce a neutrino flux that can be probed at Earth based neutrino observatories like Super-Kamiokande and Hyper-Kamiokande. We demonstrate that this can provide a handle to probe dark matter masses in the 200 MeV - 2 GeV mass scales that compares favourably with present day direct detection bounds.</description>
