      <title>Bernardo Dessau, fisico, scienziato, maestro, da Bologna a Perugia tra i marosi del secolo breve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seventy-five years ago, Bernardo Dessau passed away. He had been the sole professor of Physics at the University of Perugia for thirty years. With this brief contribution we intend to repay a debt of gratitude, first of all because his scientific merits were probably underestimated, having spent the first fifteen years of his career under the shadow of the great Augusto Righi in Bologna, where he also witnessed meetings with the young Marconi. He was then relegated to the Faculty of Medicine of Perugia, without a real laboratory, disregarded by the national scientific community and unable to move to better equipped locations. Nevertheless, he proved to be a gifted teacher and popularizer of science. He published a comprehensive three-volume physics textbook that was widely used in Italy and abroad. Despite becoming an Italian citizen in 1894, Dessau's German origins led to his suspension from service during World War I. Furthermore, his Jewish identity made him a target of Nazi-fascist antisemitism. He was dismissed from both the University of Perugia and from the Italian Society of Physics, of which he had been a member since its beginning, fortunately escaping deportation.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Quantum Indeterminacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent philosophical discussions about metaphysical indeterminacy have been substantiated with the idea that quantum mechanics, one of the most successful physical theories in the history of science, provides explicit instances of worldly indefiniteness. Against this background, several philosophers underline that there are alternative formulations of quantum theory in which such indeterminacy has no room and plays no role. A typical example is Bohmian mechanics in virtue of its clear particle ontology. Contrary to these latter claims, this paper aims at showing that different pilot-wave theories do in fact instantiate diverse forms of metaphysical indeterminacy. Namely, I argue that there are various questions about worldly states of affairs that cannot be determined by looking exclusively at their ontologies and dynamical laws. Moreover, it will be claimed that Bohmian mechanics generates a new form of modal indeterminacy. Finally, it will be concluded that ontological clarity and indeterminacy are not mutually exclusive, i.e., the two can coexist in the same theory.</description>

      <title>From S-matrix theory to strings: Scattering data and the commitment to non-arbitrariness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early history of string theory is marked by a shift from strong interaction physics to quantum gravity. The first string models and associated theoretical framework were formulated in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the context of the S-matrix program for the strong interactions. In the mid-1970s, the models were reinterpreted as a potential theory unifying the four fundamental forces. This paper provides a historical analysis of how string theory was developed out of S-matrix physics, aiming to clarify how modern string theory, as a theory detached from experimental data, grew out of an S-matrix program that was strongly dependent upon observable quantities. Surprisingly, the theoretical practice of physicists already turned away from experiment before string theory was recast as a potential unified quantum gravity theory. With the formulation of dual resonance models (the "hadronic string theory"), physicists were able to determine almost all of the models' parameters on the basis of theoretical reasoning. It was this commitment to "non-arbitrariness", i.e., a lack of free parameters in the theory, that initially drove string theorists away from experimental input, and not the practical inaccessibility of experimental data in the context of quantum gravity physics. This is an important observation when assessing the role of experimental data in string theory.</description>

      <title>QCD at 50: Golden Anniversary, Golden Insights, Golden Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk of this paper centers around the tension between confinement and freedom in QCD. I discuss how it can be understood heuristically as a manifestation of self-adhesive glue and how it fits within the larger contexts of energy-time uncertainty and $\textit{real virtuality}$. I discuss the possible emergence of $\textit{treeons}$ as a tangible ingredient of (at least) pure gluon $SU(3)$. I propose $\textit{flux channeling}$ as a method to address that and allied questions about triality flux numerically, and indicate how to implement it for electric and magnetic flux in material systems. That bulk is framed with broad-stroke, necessarily selective sketches of the past and possible future of strong interaction physics. At the end, I've added an expression of gratitude for my formative experience at the Erice school, in 1973.</description>

      <title>What is the Q of a Blackbody? A small contribution to Gustav Robert Kirchhoff's bicentennial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The blackbody spectrum "half-power points" are used to assign effective Q "quality factor" values that are found to be less than unity whether frequency or wavelength scaling is used. A comparison with values for coherent oscillators is made. This exercise blends two of Kirchhoff's interests, and is instructive in its own right, as it bridges the often mutually exclusive engineering and scientific disciplines.</description>
