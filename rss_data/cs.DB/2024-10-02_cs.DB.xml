      <title>Revisiting the Index Construction of Proximity Graph-Based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximity graphs (PG) have gained increasing popularity as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions to $k$-approximate nearest neighbor ($k$-ANN) search on high-dimensional data, which serves as a fundamental function in various fields, e.g. information retrieval and retrieval-augmented generation~(RAG). Although PG-based approaches have the best $k$-ANN search performance, their index construction cost is superlinear to the number of points, since they have to identify close neighbors for each point to establish the edges. Such superlinear cost substantially limits their scalability in the era of big data. Hence, the goal of this paper is to accelerate the construction of PG-based methods without compromising their $k$-ANN search performance.
  To achieve this goal, two mainstream categories of PG are revisited: relative neighborhood graph (RNG) and navigable small world graph (NSWG). By revisiting their construction process, we find the issues of construction efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a new construction framework with a novel pruning strategy for edge selection, which accelerates RNG construction while keeping its $k$-ANN search performance. Then, we integrate this framework into NSWG construction to enhance both the construction efficiency and $k$-ANN search performance. Moreover, extensive experiments are conducted to validate our construction framework for both RNG and NSWG. The results demonstrate that it significantly reduces the PG construction cost, achieving up to 5.6x speedup while not compromising the $k$-ANN search performance.</description>

      <title>Competitive Ratio of Online Caching with Predictions: Lower and Upper Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of learning-augmented online caching in the scenario when each request is accompanied by a prediction of the next occurrence of the requested page. We improve currently known bounds on the competitive ratio of the BlindOracle algorithm, which evicts a page predicted to be requested last. We also prove a lower bound on the competitive ratio of any randomized algorithm and show that a combination of the BlindOracle with the Marker algorithm achieves a competitive ratio that is optimal up to some constant.</description>

      <title>On the topology and geometry of population-based SHM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population-Based Structural Health Monitoring (PBSHM), aims to leverage information across populations of structures in order to enhance diagnostics on those with sparse data. The discipline of transfer learning provides the mechanism for this capability. One recent paper in PBSHM proposed a geometrical view in which the structures were represented as graphs in a metric "base space" with their data captured in the "total space" of a vector bundle above the graph space. This view was more suggestive than mathematically rigorous, although it did allow certain useful arguments. One bar to more rigorous analysis was the absence of a meaningful topology on the graph space, and thus no useful notion of continuity. The current paper aims to address this problem, by moving to parametric families of structures in the base space, essentially changing points in the graph space to open balls. This allows the definition of open sets in the fibre space and thus allows continuous variation between fibres. The new ideas motivate a new geometrical mechanism for transfer learning in data are transported from one fibre to an adjacent one; i.e., from one structure to another.</description>

      <title>Towards Privacy-Preserving Relational Data Synthesis via Probabilistic Relational Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic relational models provide a well-established formalism to combine first-order logic and probabilistic models, thereby allowing to represent relationships between objects in a relational domain. At the same time, the field of artificial intelligence requires increasingly large amounts of relational training data for various machine learning tasks. Collecting real-world data, however, is often challenging due to privacy concerns, data protection regulations, high costs, and so on. To mitigate these challenges, the generation of synthetic data is a promising approach. In this paper, we solve the problem of generating synthetic relational data via probabilistic relational models. In particular, we propose a fully-fledged pipeline to go from relational database to probabilistic relational model, which can then be used to sample new synthetic relational data points from its underlying probability distribution. As part of our proposed pipeline, we introduce a learning algorithm to construct a probabilistic relational model from a given relational database.</description>

      <title>OneGen: Efficient One-Pass Unified Generation and Retrieval for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), which have significantly enhanced the generative capabilities for various NLP tasks, LLMs still face limitations in directly handling retrieval tasks. However, many practical applications demand the seamless integration of both retrieval and generation. This paper introduces a novel and efficient One-pass Generation and retrieval framework (OneGen), designed to improve LLMs' performance on tasks that require both generation and retrieval. The proposed framework bridges the traditionally separate training approaches for generation and retrieval by incorporating retrieval tokens generated autoregressively. This enables a single LLM to handle both tasks simultaneously in a unified forward pass. We conduct experiments on two distinct types of composite tasks, RAG and Entity Linking, to validate the pluggability, effectiveness, and efficiency of OneGen in training and inference. Furthermore, our results show that integrating generation and retrieval within the same context preserves the generative capabilities of LLMs while improving retrieval performance. To the best of our knowledge, OneGen is the first to enable LLMs to conduct vector retrieval during the generation.</description>
