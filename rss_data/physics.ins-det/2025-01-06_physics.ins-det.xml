      <title>Beam test performance of a prototype muon trigger detector for the PSI muEDM experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the performance evaluation of a prototype muon trigger detector for the PSI muEDM experiment, conducted as a proof-of-principle test at the $\pi$E1 beamline of the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) using \SI{27.5}{MeV/c} muons. The detector is designed to identify muons within the acceptance phase space of a compact storage solenoid and activate a pulsed magnetic kicker for muon storage; it was tested without the application of a magnetic field. It comprises a telescope made up of four scintillators in anticoincidence with a gate scintillator, all read out by silicon photomultipliers. The study focused on characterizing the detector's response to various muon trajectories and the light yield of its plastic scintillators. Experimental results demonstrated strong agreement with Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate optical photon modeling, confirming the detector's concept and its potential for meeting the stringent requirements of the muEDM experiment.</description>

      <title>A high-speed, high-resolution Transition Edge Sensor spectrometer for soft X-rays at the Advanced Photon Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project explores the design and development of a transition edge sensor (TES) spectrometer for resonant soft X- ray scattering (RSXS) measurements developed in collaboration between Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Soft X-ray scattering is a powerful technique for studying the electronic and magnetic properties of materials on a microscopic level. However, the lack of high-performance soft X-ray spectrometers has limited the potential of this technique. TES spectrometers have the potential to overcome these limitations due to their high energy resolution, high efficiency, and broad energy range. This project aims to optimize the design of a TES spectrometer for RSXS measurements and more generally soft X-ray spectroscopy at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) 29-ID, leading to improved understanding of advanced materials. We will present a detailed description of the instrument design and implementation. The spectrometer consists of a large array of approximately 250 high-speed and high-resolution pixels. The pixels have saturation energies of approximately 1 keV, sub-ms pulse duration and energy resolution of approximately 1 eV. The array is read out using microwave multiplexing chips with MHz bandwidth per channel, enabling efficient data throughput. To facilitate measurement of samples in situ under ultra-high vacuum conditions at the beamline, the spectrometer is integrated with an approximately 1 m long snout.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic Energy Resolution of LaBr$_3$(Ce) Crystal for GECAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to provide an accurate estimation of the intrinsic resolution of LaBr$_3$(Ce) crystal through a combination of experimental and simulation methods. We re-analyzed the data from previous Wide-Angle Compton Coincidence (WACC) and Hard X-ray Calibration Facility (HXCF) experiments, conducted PMT Single-Photoelectron Calibration (SPEC) and radial non-uniformity (also called Spot Scanning, SS) experiments to acquire new data, and combined these results with Geant4 simulations to isolate the contribution of each physical process to the total energy resolution, thereby allowing for a precise estimation of the scintillator's intrinsic resolution. For 100 keV X-rays, the total energy resolution of LaBr$_3$(Ce) crystal is 3.99% $\pm$ 0.04% (expressed as 1-$\sigma$), with statistical fluctuations and intrinsic resolution as the main components, contributing 2.47% $\pm$ 0.00% and 3.06% $\pm$ 0.06%, respectively. We identify two main sources of intrinsic resolution: one primarily due to non-proportional scintillation, contributing 2.28% $\pm$ 0.00%, and the other due to fluctuations in the energy transfer process, contributing 2.04% $\pm$ 0.08%. We quantified six components of the total energy resolution and reconstructed the photon response using Geant4. The consistency between the reconstructed relative light yield and the experimental measurements validated the mass model of the LaBr$_3$(Ce) detector used in the simulations.</description>

      <title>Development of a linac-based LEPD experimental station for surface structure analysis and coordination with synchrotron radiation ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the development of a low-energy positron diffraction (LEPD) experimental station for surface structure analysis using a linac-based slow-positron beam. LEPD, the positron counterpart of low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), offers higher accuracy in surface structure determination. The station enables acquisition of LEPD I-V curves within a few hours, allowing measurements before surface degradation occurs. It consists of two ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chambers: one for sample preparation and the other for LEPD observations. The preparation chamber includes an Ar+ sputtering system, a triple-pocket electron beam evaporator, three gas introduction systems, additional user-configurable ports, and a LEED/Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) system. Sample manipulators enable rapid cooling, precise positioning, and orientation adjustments. In the preparation chamber, the manipulator also supports direct current heating up to 1200 {\deg}C. The sample holder is compatible with the LEPD station at SPF-A4 and the ARPES station at PF BL-13B, both located at the Tsukuba campus of the Institute of Materials Structure Science (IMSS), KEK. Design concepts and experimental demonstrations are presented.</description>
