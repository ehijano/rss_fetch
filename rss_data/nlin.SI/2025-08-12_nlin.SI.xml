      <title>The two--component discrete KP hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete KP hierarchy is also known as the $(l-l')$--th modified KP hierarchy. Here in this paper, we consider the corresponding two--component generalization, called the two--component discrete KP (2dKP) hierarchy. Firstly, starting from the bilinear equation of the 2dKP hierarchy, we derive the corresponding Lax equation by the Shiota method, this is using scalar Lax operators involving two difference operators $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$. Then starting from the 2dKP Lax equation, we obtain the corresponding bilinear equation, including the existence of the tau function. From above discussions, we can determine which are essential in the 2dKP Lax formulation. Finally, we discuss the reduction of the 2dKP hierarchy corresponding to the loop algebra $\widehat{sl}_{M+N}=sl_{M+N}[\lambda,\lambda^{-1}]\oplus\mathbb{C}c \ (M,N\geq1)$.</description>

      <title>Lack of collisional hydrodynamics in a harmonically trapped one-dimensional Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the theory of generalized hydrodynamics, we study the dipole compression collective oscillations of a harmonically trapped one-dimensional Bose gas in the crossover from weak to strong repulsive interactions. In the uniform limit, the system is described by the integrable Lieb-Liniger model, while the presence of the trap breaks integrability. In contrast to previous predictions based on the classical hydrodynamic variational ansatz -- which yields a single-frequency dipole compression mode -- we observe a beating signal comprising two frequencies across all regimes of the gas. Furthermore, we find that the higher frequency crosses over from the low-temperature phononic hydrodynamic regime to the collisionless limit as the temperature increases -- without saturating at the previously predicted value characteristic of the high-temperature collisional hydrodynamic regime. This crossover occurs around the so-called hole-induced anomaly temperature, above which the quasiparticle picture of excitations no longer applies. This explains the absence of the collisional hydrodynamic regime and resolves a long-standing open question about its validity at high temperatures in systems where integrability is nearly broken by weak confinement. Our findings reveal intricate connections between excitations, thermodynamics, correlations, dynamics, and interparticle collisions, and may prove relevant to other atomic, nuclear, solid-state, electronic, and spin systems that exhibit similar anomalies or thermal second-order phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Quantized Quiver Varieties and the Quantum Spin Ruijsenaars-Schneider Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the long-standing problem of quantizing the rational spin Ruijsenaars--Schneider model originating in the work of Krichever and Zabrodin. We make use of the technique of quantum Hamiltonian reduction to construct a quantized quiver variety $\mathfrak{A}_{N,\ell}$ associated to the framed Jordan quiver. This quantized quiver variety is simultaneously the algebra of quantum observables of the rational spin Ruijsenaars--Schneider model of $N$ particles with $\ell$ spin polarizations. Inside this algebra, we find a loop algebra and Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}_\ell$ and conjecture that in the limit of infinitely many particles, the algebra $\mathfrak{A}_{N,\ell}$ becomes a shifted affine Yangian. We also exhibit a difference equation for eigenstates of the lowest Hamiltonian that reduces to the spinless case when $\ell=1$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic approach to a $d$-dimensional matrix Hamiltonian with so($d+1)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel spin-extended so($d+1$,1) algebra is introduced and shown to provide an interesting framework for discussing the properties of a $d$-dimensional matrix Hamiltonian with spin 1/2 and so($d+1$) symmetry. With some $d+2$ additional operators, spanning a basis of an so($d+1$,1) irreducible representation, the so($d+1$,1) generators provide a very easy way for deriving the integrals of motion of the matrix Hamiltonian in Sturm representation. Such integrals of motion are then transformed into those of the matrix Hamiltonian in Schr\"odinger representation, including a Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector with spin. This leads to a derivation of the latter, as well as its properties in a more extended algebraic framework.</description>

      <title>From Toda Hierarchy to KP Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the matrix-resolvent method and a formula of the second-named author on the $n$-point function for a KP tau-function, we show that the tau-function of an arbitrary solution to the Toda lattice hierarchy is a KP tau-function. We then generalize this result to tau-functions for the extended Toda hierarchy (ETH) by developing the matrix-resolvent method for the ETH. As an example the partition function of Gromov-Witten invariants of the complex projective line is a KP tau-function, and an application on irreducible representations of the symmetric group is obtained.</description>

      <title>Existence of Liouvillian solutions in the Hess-Sretensky case of the problem of motion of a gyrostat with a fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1890 W. Hess found the new special case of integrability of the Euler - Poisson equations of motion of a heavy rigid body with a fixed point. In 1963 L.N. Sretensky proved that the special case of integrability, similar to the Hess case, also exists in the problem of the motion of a heavy gyrostat - a heavy rigid body with a fixed point, which contains a rotating homogeneous rotor. Further numerous generalizations of the classical Hess case were proposed, which take place during the motion of a heavy rigid body and a gyrostat with a fixed point in various force fields.
  The first studies that provided a qualitative description of the motion of a heavy rigid body in the integrable Hess case were published almost immediately after this case was found. In 1892 P.A. Nekrasov proved, that the solution of the problem of motion of a heavy rigid body with a fixed point in the Hess case is reduced to the integration the second order linear homogeneous differential equation with variable coefficients. A similar result regarding the problem of the motion of a heavy gyrostat in the Hess - Sretensky case was presented by Sretensky.
  In this paper we present the derivation of the corresponding second order linear differential equation and reduce the coefficients of this equation to the form of rational functions. Then, using the Kovacic algorithm we study the problem of the existence of liouvillian solutions of the corresponding second order linear differential equation. We obtain the conditions for the parameters of the problem, under which the liouvillian solutions of the corresponding linear differential equation exist. Under these conditions equations of motion of a heavy gyrostat with a fixed point in the Hess - Sretensky case can be integrated in quadratures.</description>
