      <title>Interleaved Friezes: Celtic Knotwork and Hitomezashi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both Celtic knotwork and strips of hitomezashi stitching can be interpreted as being two-sided friezes wherein the patterns on the sides are interleaved. We prove which of the thirty-one two-sided friezes can, and cannot, be realized in hitomezashi, and compare this to the case of Celtic knotwork.</description>

      <title>Community-driven data science practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematics researchers are becoming more involved with research questions at the interface of data science and social justice. This type of research needs to be grounded in the needs of the community in order to have significant impact. In this paper, we examine two examples of community-research partnerships in data science for social justice co-authored by both community members and mathematical researchers. The first, VECINA, is a place-based community-research partnership focused on environmental justice. VECINA introduces a framework for developing fruitful local collaborations. The second example, SToPA, originates in citizens' request for an analysis of their town's policing data, but focuses on how to scale this work beyond that place-based setting. SToPA's research helps us imagine how we can continue to actively collaborate with community members even when working to scale projects beyond a single community. In both of these case studies, we examine the harmonies between established principles of power, process, and perspective with our framework for research-community partnerships. We use a duoethnography approach, directly illustrating the experiences of researchers. We also offer a set of reflections on the impact of these research-community partnerships.</description>

      <title>A formula for any real number, maybe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss how to write down three specific natural numbers $A$, $B$, $C$ such that for any real number $r$ you've probably ever thought of, it is consistent with $\mathsf{ZFC}$ set theory that $$\def\Rb{\mathbb{R}}\def\Nb{\mathbb{N}}r = \log\left(\sup_{x_0,x_1 \in \Rb} \inf_{x_2 \in \Rb} \sup_{x_3 \in \Rb}\inf_{x_4 \in \Rb}\sup_{m \in \Nb}\inf_{n_0,\dots,n_{A} \in \Nb} x^2_0
  \begin{bmatrix} \phantom{+}(n_0 - 2)^2 + (n_1-m)^2 \\ + n_2 + (n_B - n_C)^2 \\ + n_3 \sum_{k=0}^4 ( x_k - \frac{n_{k+5}}{1+n_4} +n_4)^2 \\ + \sum_{i,j = 0}^B (n_{9+2^i3^j} - n_i^{n_j})^2 \end{bmatrix}
  \right).$$ We also discuss why it's possible, assuming the existence of certain large cardinals, for there to be a real number $s$ which cannot be the value of this formula for our particular $A$, $B$, $C$. This involves set-theoretic mice.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic Origins of the Dirichlet Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dirichlet Principle is an approach to solving the Dirichlet problem by means of a Dirichlet energy integral. It is part of the folklore of mathematics that the genesis of this argument was motivated by physical analogy involving electrostatic fields. The story goes something like this: If an electrostatic potential is prescribed on the boundary of a region, it will extend to a potential in the interior of the region which is harmonic when the electric field is in stable equilibrium, and that electrostatic field has minimum Dirichlet energy. The details of this argument are seldom given and where they are, they are typically scant, redacted, and speculative while often omitting either physics details or mathematics details. The purpose of this article is to give a detailed reconstruction of the electrostatic argument by combining accounts in several contemporary and historical disparate sources. Particular attention is given to explaining the frequently omitted physics and mathematical details and how they fit together to give the physical motivation.</description>
