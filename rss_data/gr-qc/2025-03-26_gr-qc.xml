      <title>The Measure of a Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of mass is central to any theory of gravity. Nevertheless, defining mass in general relativity is a difficult task, and even when it can be accomplished, we still need to investigate whether the typical properties of mass in Newtonian gravity are still true in Einsteinian gravity. In this essay, we discuss "the measure of a mass" in relativity by considering some of the many different definitions (Komar, ADM, and Bondi) and how they are related. Finally, we discuss when and whether the mass is positive, as is usually expected, and which physical properties of matter and gravity can ensure this result.</description>

      <title>Light trajectories and wave dynamics in optical wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the optical properties of a wormhole geometry characterized by a constant negative Gaussian curvature. This distinctive optical structure is modeled using the optical metric of the static BTZ black hole, corresponding to the hyperbolic wormhole framework. Within this model, we derive the arbitrary geodesics and the associated effective potential. Our analysis reveals that the effective potential becomes increasingly narrow as the curvature radius of the optical wormhole decreases, with all possible trajectories converging at the optical origin \(\rho = 0\). We further analyze the wave modes governing light propagation on this curved surface, demonstrating that the effective potential is purely repulsive in both the small and large \(\rho\) limits. While the potential remains finite in both regimes, its behavior differs markedly. Near the optical origin, the magnetic quantum number (\(m\)) exerts a significant influence on the effective repulsive potential, particularly for large values of \(m\), where the potential resembles a typical barrier. However, this effect diminishes with increasing optical distance. Using this framework, we compute the reflection and transmission coefficients for \(m \neq 0\). Our findings indicate that the optical properties of the background are predominantly governed by the curvature radius of the optical wormhole, highlighting its critical role in shaping light propagation in such geometries.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability of f(Q) gravity theory and a possible resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both the generalized teleparallel theories of gravity suffer from some serious problems. The strong coupling issue appearing as a consequence of extra degrees of freedom in the `generalized metric teleparallel gravity' theory, prompted to consider `generalized symmetric teleparallel gravity' theory (GSTG). Unfortunately, recent perturbative analysis in the background of maximally symmetric space-time revealed that GSTG also suffers from the strong coupling issue and the ghost degrees of freedom. It has also been cognised that GSTG does not admit diffeomorphic invariance in general. Lately, it has been shown that except for the first, the other two connections associated with spatially flat Robertson-Walker metric do not even admit GSTG, while the first connection leads to an eerie Hamiltonian upon ensuing Dirac-Bergmann constraint analysis. Here we show that the only existing non-flat connection is also not viable in the same sense. Thus GSTG happens to be jeopardized. These problems do not showup in $f(R,Q)$ theory of gravity. Modified Dirac-Bergmann constraint analysis is deployed to formulate the phase-space structure. Quantization, probabilistic interpretation and semi-classical approximation connote that such a theory is well behaved in the context of early inflation, which has also been studied.</description>

      <title>Photonic Modes in Bonnor-Melvin Domain Walls: Photon Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic dynamics of vector bosons in a \((2+1)\)-dimensional Bonnor-Melvin magnetic spacetime, which features a magnetic field aligned with the symmetry axis \(z\) and a nonzero cosmological constant \(\Lambda\). This cylindrically symmetric background preserves Lorentz invariance under boosts in the \(z\)-direction and corresponds to the \((2+1+0)\)-brane solution of the Bonnor-Melvin magnetic spacetime in gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics. By deriving the radial wave equation, which is mathematically identical to the Helmholtz equation, we obtain exact eigenvalue solutions applicable to both massive and massless vector bosons (photons). Notably, we find that photons acquire a nonzero ground-state energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that their states form magnetized, rotating ring-like structures, which can be interpreted as rotating magnetic vortices.</description>

      <title>Black hole solutions in Cotton gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The framework of General Relativity (GR) has recently been expanded through the introduction of Cotton Gravity (CG), a theoretical extension proposed by J. Harada. This modified approach integrates the Cotton tensor into the gravitational field equations, naturally encompassing all conventional GR solutions while allowing the cosmological constant to emerge as an integration constant. In this study, we delve into the implications of CG when coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED), constructing and analyzing three distinct static, spherically symmetric configurations. Our investigation centers on the horizon structure, metric characteristics, and the underlying NLED Lagrangian density of each model. We also confront the theoretical predictions with observational data by comparing the calculated shadow radii of these solutions to constraints imposed by the Event Horizon Telescope's (EHT) measurements of Sgr A$^{*}$. The results reveal an extensive spectrum of spacetime geometries, ranging from multi-horizon structures to naked singularities. Furthermore, the agreement between the predicted shadow sizes and EHT observations reinforces the viability of these models in describing the astrophysical image of Sgr A$^{*}$ within certain parameter bounds.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity as entropic cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work reveals a direct correspondence between modified theories of gravity (cosmology) and entropic cosmology based on the thermodynamics of apparent horizon. It turns out that due to the total differentiable property of entropy, the usual thermodynamic law (used for Einstein gravity) needs to be generalized for modified gravity theories having more than one thermodynamic degrees of freedom (d.o.f.). For the modified theories having $n$ number of thermodynamic d.o.f., the corresponding horizon entropy is given by: $S_\mathrm{h} \sim S_\mathrm{BH} +$ terms containing the time derivatives of $S_\mathrm{BH}$ up to $(n-1)$-th order, and moreover, the coefficient(s) of the derivative term(s) are proportional to the modification parameter of the gravity theory (compared to the Einstein gravity; $S_\mathrm{BH}$ is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy). By identifying the independent thermodynamic variables from the first law of thermodynamics, we show that the equivalent thermodynamic description of modified gravity naturally allows the time derivative of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in the horizon entropy.</description>

      <title>Constraints of extended gravity theory in the regime of Universe accelerated extension: turnaround radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying the definition of the turnaround radius and the fact that the best agreement with observational data on extragalactic scales is currently provided by general relativity with the cosmological constant we consider the behaviour of spherically symmetric solutions of the Horndeski and Dvali-Gabadadze-Poratti models on these scales. Therefore, the conditions on the turning radius together with astronomical data for galaxy clusters allow us to place additional constraints on the parameters of extended gravity theories.</description>

      <title>A cryogenic test-mass suspension with flexures operating in compression for third-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of the conceptual design of a novel silicon suspension for the cryogenic test-mass mirrors of the low-frequency detector of the Einstein Telescope gravitational-wave observatory. In traditional suspensions, tensional stress is a severe limitation for achieving low thermal noise, safer mechanical margins and high thermal conductance simultaneously. In order to keep the tensional stress sufficiently low, we propose the use of rigid beams with large cross sections, combined with short flexures under compressional load. This configuration takes advantage of the many times higher strength of silicon in compression to respect to its strength in tension. The flexures are mechanically robust and at the same time soft in the working direction, thus producing low suspension thermal noise and, by being short, provide high thermal conductance for cryogenic cooling. The rigid beams, located between the test mass and an intermediate mass, allow the elimination of the recoil mass used conventionally for applying control forces for interferometer lock, and the use of optical anti-springs to reduce the pendulum resonant frequency to further improve the vibration isolation of the test mass. The configuration has the capability to reach a lower mirror operational temperature, which is expected to produce a substantial reduction of the thermal noise in the mirrors of the interferometer.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that ultra-massive spacetimes exist also in 2 + 1 dimensions with a positive cosmological constant {\Lambda} &gt; 0. They can be created through the collapse of a spherical null dust shell. The exterior of the shell is then a Mess spacetime, that is to say a locally de Sitter spacetime that cannot be obtained as a quotient of de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Spinoptics in the Kerr Spacetime: Polarized Wave Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study propagation of high-frequency electromagnetic and gravitational waves in the gravitational field of a rotating black hole. Due to the interaction of the spin of the field with the spacetime curvature, the standard geometric optics approximation that is used for obtaining the approximate high-frequency solutions of the wave equation should be modified. The corresponding modified spinoptics equations show that the worldline of the spinning massless particle is still null, but no longer a geodesic. We demonstrate that using the hidden symmetries of the Kerr metric one can obtain the corresponding spinoptics equations in the leading order of a $1/{\omega}$ expansion in an explicit form. We focus on the case of the spinning massless fields scattering in the region near the equatorial plane. We demonstrate that the asymptotic planes of the corresponding null ray's motion are slightly tilted. We study this effect and its dependence on the spin of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Towards entropic uncertainty relations for non-regular Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Entropic Uncertainty Relations (EUR) result from inequalities that are intrinsic to the Hilbert space and its dual with no direct connection to the Canonical Commutation Relations. Bialynicky-Mielcisnky obtained them in \cite{bialynicki1975uncertainty} attending Hilbert spaces with a Lebesgue measure. The analysis of these EUR in the context of singular Hilbert spaces has not been addressed. Singular Hilbert spaces are widely used in scenarios where some discretization of the space (or spacetime) is considered, e.g., loop quantum gravity, loop quantum cosmology and polymer quantum mechanics. In this work, we present an overview of the essential literature background and the road map we plan to follow to obtain the EUR in polymer quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Solar System Constraints on Light Propagation from Higher Derivative Corrections to General Relativity and the Weak Gravity Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the two derivative action of gravitation is specified uniquely, higher derivative operators are also allowed with coefficients that are not specified uniquely by effective field theory. We focus on a four derivative operator in which the Riemann tensor couples directly to the electromagnetic field $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$. We compute the corresponding corrections to the Shapiro time delay in the solar system and compare this to data from the Cassini probe. We place an observational upper bound on the coefficient $a$ at 95% confidence $|a|&lt;26\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. We compare this to the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) prediction of a bound on the coefficients $a,\,b$ of four derivative operators involving the graviton and the photon; this includes the above term $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$ as well as $b\,F^4$. We show that by using the observed value of the $b$ coefficient from measurements of light by light scattering, which arises in the Standard Model from integrating out the electron, the WGC predicted bound for $a$ is $a\lesssim 7.8\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. This is consistent with the above observational bound, but is intriguingly close and can be further probed in other observations.</description>

      <title>Extension principles for the Einstein Yang--Mills system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an extension principle for the spherically symmetric Einstein Yang--Mills system (SSEYM) with $H^1$ data. Based on this result, we further prove an extension theorem for developments of weighted $H^1$ data. In particular, the weighted $H^1$ space allows H\"{o}lder continuous data. Therefore, our result is consistence with the conjecture that well-posedness holds for H\"{o}lder continuous data (with sufficiently many angular derivatives) in vacuum where the axis is included.
  In contrast to a massless scalar field, the purely magnetic Yang--Mills field in spherical symmetry satisfies a wave-type equation with singular potential. The proof of Christodoulou [10], based on an $L^\infty-L^\infty$ estimate, fails for the Yang--Mills scenario. Instead, we employ the $L^2$ method, which works for the (massless or massive) scalar matter field as well.</description>

      <title>A comparison between best-fit eccentricity definitions and the standardized definition of eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the absence of a unique, gauge-independent definition of eccentricity in General Relativity, there have been efforts to standardize the definition for Gravitational-Wave astronomy. Recently, Shaikh et al. proposed a model-independent measurement of eccentricity $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ from the phase evolution of the dominant mode. Many works use loss functions (LFs) to assign eccentricity to a reference waveform, for instance by fitting a Post-Newtonian expression to assign eccentricity to Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations. Therefore, we ask whether minimizing common LFs on gauge-dependent model parameters, such as the mismatch $\mathcal{M}$ or the $L_2$-norm of the dominant mode $h_{22}$ residuals, for non-precessing binaries, ensures a sufficient $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ agreement. We use $10$ eccentric NR simulations and the eccentric waveform TEOBResumS-Dali as the parametric model to fit on eccentricity $e_0$ and reference frequency $f_0$. We first show that a minimized mismatch, the $\mathcal{M} \sim 10^{-3}- 10^{-2}$ results in better $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ fractional differences ($\sim 1\%$) than with the minimized $h_{22}$ residuals. Nonetheless, for small eccentricity NR simulations $(e_{\mathrm{gw}} \lesssim 10^{-2}$), the mismatch can favor quasi-circular ($e_0=0$) best-fit models. Thus, with sufficiently long NR simulations, we can include $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ in the LF. We explain why solely fitting with $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ constitutes a degenerate problem. To circumvent these limitations, we propose to minimize a convex sum of $\mathcal{M}$ and the $e_{\mathrm{gw}}$ difference to both assign non-zero eccentric values to NR strains and to control the mismatch threshold.</description>

      <title>Energy estimates for the good-bad-ugly model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a relationship between the equations that constitute the so-called good-bad-ugly model, whose nonlinearities are known to mimic those present in the Einstein field equations in generalized harmonic gauge. This relationship between ugly fields and good and bad ones stems from the fact that one can write the equation for the rescaled derivative of an ugly along an incoming null direction as a good or a bad equation depending on whether there are source terms or not. This provides a new interpretation of the logarithms of the radial coordinate that show up in expansions of solutions to ugly equations near null infinity. This furthermore allows us to use the Klainerman-Sobolev inequality for the standard wave equation on Cauchy slices to show uniform boundedness for the ugly equation. In the second part of this paper we perform a first order reduction of the ugly equation with given sources in flat space and we radially compactify the coordinates in order to show an energy estimate for that equation on hyperboloidal slices. This result is an important first step towards establishing energy estimates for the hyperboloidal initial value problem of the first order compactified Einstein field equations in generalized harmonic gauge.</description>

      <title>Null Geodesics, Thermodynamics, Weak Gravitational Lensing, and Black Hole Shadow Characteristics of a Frolov Regular Black Hole with Constraints from EHT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the properties of null geodesics, thermodynamics, gravitational lensing, and black hole shadows in the vicinity of a static regular Frolov black hole. By analyzing the trajectories of null geodesics, we investigate the bending of light in weak field regimes. The black hole shadow is studied in detail, with constraints on its parameters derived from observational data of the EHT collaboration. Further, we examine shadow images under a spherically symmetric accretion flow and compute the energy emission rate to understand the black hole radiation characteristics. The obtained results demonstrate how the Frolov black hole differs from well-known black hole solutions, such as Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, and Hayward black holes. This study provides new insights into the impact of modified non-rotating regular black hole metrics on observational signatures. The findings have significant implications for future astrophysical observations and the testing of alternative gravity theories.</description>

      <title>EFT Corrections to Majumdar-Papapetrou Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies on extremal black holes within effective field theories (EFT) of gravity have revealed an intriguing phenomenon: tidal forces near the horizon experience significant enhancement due to EFT corrections, potentially leading to a breakdown of the EFT framework. In this work, we investigate this effect in a two-black-hole Majumdar-Papapetrou spacetime modified by four-derivative EFT correction terms. Our analysis shows that while the scaling exponents, which measure the strength of the tidal forces near the horizon, remain unchanged under EFT corrections in $D=4$, they decrease for higher dimensions, enhancing the near-horizon tidal forces. We find an expression for the EFT corrections to the scaling exponents till $D \le 10$ and demonstrate that the metric corrections can be structured such that only the near-horizon $AdS_2$ throat undergoes angle-dependent modifications, while the transverse $S^{D-2}$ sector remains unaffected.</description>

      <title>Effect of ultralight dark matter on compact binary mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing catalogue of gravitational wave events enables a statistical analysis of compact binary mergers, typically quantified by the merger rate density. This quantity can be influenced by ambient factors, following which, in this work we have investigated the impact of dark matter environment on the merger statistics. We construct a baseline astrophysical model of compact binary mergers and extend it by incorporating a model of ultra light dark matter, which affects the orbital evolution of binaries through accretion and dynamical friction. Our analysis of the merged population of binary progenitors demonstrates that, compared to the baseline model, ULDM can significantly alter the merger statistics when its ambient density becomes larger than 104GeV/cm3. A comparison with the gravitational wave data from the GWTC-3 catalogue provides insight into potential observational signatures of the ULDM in merger events, leading to possible constraints on the existence and density of dark matter distribution in galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish for the first time the conditions that must be imposed on the action for a magnetic universe in a theory of non-linear electrodynamics in order to have an asymptotically de Sitter initial state followed by a slow roll inflationary phase. We show that models so far proposed in the literature do not allow for a prolonged inflationary phase consistent with observations. We construct a Lagrangian that reduces to the Maxwell one in weak field; this is the only class of models that satisfies the required conditions for slow roll in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally induced entanglement at finite temperature: A memory-driven time-crystalline phase?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of thermal effects on gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) in a system of quantum harmonic oscillators interacting with classical linearly polarized gravitational waves (GWs). Specifically, we model the endpoints of interferometer arms in LIGO-like detectors as two-dimensional oscillators. Following the thermofield dynamics (TFD) approach, our analysis reveals that while thermal effects alone do not generate entanglement between independent oscillator modes, they serve as a catalyst, modifying the dynamical imprint of GWs. Notably, we identify a mixing of Bose-Einstein and Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions driven by thermal influences, which affects the statistical behavior of the quantum subsystem. Furthermore, gravitational interactions induce a quantum memory effect, leading to emergent periodic behavior in the reduced subsystem. This suggests a novel gravitationally induced breaking of time-translation symmetry, reminiscent of a prethermal time crystal (PTC). Our findings indicate that such effects could provide new theoretical insights into classical gravitational wave interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Proca stars in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) Ellis wormholes. This study distinguishes itself from the analysis of the Proca stars in asymptotically flat spacetimes. In the AdS Ellis wormhole background, the mass of the wormhole solutions vanishes. Consequently, we employ numerical techniques to investigate in detail the impact of the cosmological constant on both the matter field and the wormhole geometry, while categorizing the solutions in accordance with the symmetries of the Proca field. The results show that when the cosmological constant decreases, not only does the characteristic spiral behavior of the Proca star solutions, namely the charge-frequency relation $Q$-$\omega$, gradually disappear, but the throat or both sides of the wormhole may also develop a ``horizon", presenting a ``black bounce" characteristic.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of $f(Q)$ cosmology with quintom-like scenario: the phantom field as effective realization of the non-trivial connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that $f(Q)$ cosmology with a non-trivial connection, namely the Connection II of the literature, is dynamically equivalent with a quintom-like model. In particular, we show that the scalar field arising from the non-linear $f(Q)$ form, and the scalar field associated to the non-trivial connection, are combined to provide one canonical and one phantom field in the minisuperspace Lagrangian. Hence, the combination of two well-behaved fields appears effectively as a phantom field. This is fundamentally different from the usual approach in phantom and quintom cosmology, in which the phantom field is introduced ad hoc, and thus it may open a new way to handle the phantom fields, namely as effective realizations of the connection-related canonical fields.</description>

      <title>Joint estimation of the cosmological model and the mass and redshift distributions of the binary black hole population with the Einstein Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the capability of constraining the mass and redshift distributions of binary black hole systems jointly with the underlying cosmological model using one year of observations of the Einstein Telescope. We found that as the SNR decreases, the precision on the matter density parameter $\Omega_{m,0}$ and the Hubble constant $H_0$, improves significantly due to the increased number of detectable events at high redshift. However, degeneracies between cosmological and astrophysical parameters exist and evolve with the SNR threshold. Finally, we showed that one year of observations will serve to reconstruct the mass distribution with its features. Conversely, the redshift distribution will be poorly constrained and will need more observations to improve. To reach this result, we fixed the underlying cosmological model to a flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and then we considered the mass distribution given by a smoothed power law and the redshift distributions given by the Madau-Dickinson model. We built mock catalogs with different SNR thresholds and finally inferred astrophysical and cosmological parameters jointly adopting a hierarchical Bayesian framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relationality is the paradigmatic conceptual core of general-relativistic gauge field theory. It can be made manifest via the Dressing Field Method (DFM) of symmetry reduction, a systematic tool to achieve gauge-invariance by extracting the physical degrees of freedom representing relations among field variables. We review and further expand on some applications of the DFM to the very foundations of the supersymmetric framework, where it allows to build relational supersymmetric field theory and (dis)solves crucial issues. Furthermore, we elaborate on a novel approach within the relational supersymmetric field theory framework giving a unified description of fermionic matter fields and bosonic gauge fields, and thus close to Berezin's original motivation for the introduction of supergeometry in fundamental physics: a Matter-Interaction Supergeometric Unification (MISU). This new approach stands irrespective from the ultimate empirical status of standard supersymmetric field theory, about which it is agnostic.</description>

      <title>Entanglement cones and horizons in analogue cosmological production of Dirac fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although gravitational particle production in curved quantum field theories (cQFTs) is key to our understanding of the early universe and black hole physics, its direct observation requires extreme conditions or unrealistic sensitivities. Recent progress in quantum simulators indicates that analogues of gravitational particle production can be observed in table-top experiments of cold atomic gases described by effective cQFTs. This promises a high degree of tunability in the synthesised curved spacetimes and, moreover, sets a clear roadmap to explore the interplay of gravitational particle production with other non-perturbative effects genuine to interacting QFTs. We hereby focus on the appearance of fermion condensates for self-interacting Dirac fermions, and study how dynamical mass generation and spontaneous symmetry breaking affects real-time dynamics. We use the entanglement contour as a tool to analyze the spatio-temporal causal structure of particle production, showing how it can account for the cosmological horizon in accelerating spacetimes, while also being sensitive to the effect of different symmetry-breaking processes. In particular, we show that the combined breakdown of time-reversal symmetry due to the expanding spacetime, and parity due to a pseudo-scalar condensate, manifest through the structure of the light-cone-like propagation of entanglement in this analogue cQFT.</description>

      <title>I-C-Q relations for rapidly rotating stable hybrid stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A number of hadronic equations of state for neutron stars have been investigated for the purpose of the present paper, considering the fact that at sufficiently high density, heavy baryons and quark phases may appear. The observational limits from NICER, GW170817, etc., are obeyed by our choice of equations of state. The universal relations are investigated for both slowly and rapidly rotating neutron stars with heavy baryons present inside the core. For slowly rotating stars, the universality of the I-Love-Q relations is verified, and the I-C-Q relations are inferred to be universal for rapidly rotating stars. Further, we extend the investigation to obtain the universal relations for compact stars containing the quark core, where the connected stable branch of such hybrid stars is considered. The parameters of the I-Love-Q and I-C-Q universal relations are obtained for slowly rotating and rapidly rotating hybrid stars, respectively. These relations would enable extracting information, within the context of general relativity, from astrophysical systems involving rapidly rotating neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work delves into probing the importance of mutual information of relevant subsystems in obtaining the correct time-evolution of fine-grained entropy of Hawking radiation, as suggested by Page. This was done by considering a functional renormalization group improved or simply, quantum corrected Schwarzschild black solution which captures the flavour of an effective theory of quantum gravity. The mentioned black hole solution emerges from a asymptotically safe average effective action which describes a trajectory in momentum-space and satisfies a renormalizarion group equation. Furthermore, in the before Page time scenario, the behaviour of the mutual information between appropriate subsystems over time leads to the Hartman-Maldacena time. The observations made for the quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole have been compared to the same made for the standard Schwarzschild black hole in order to draw some novel conclusions. Based upon our observations, we also propose a formula for computing fine-grained entropy of Hawking radiation for an eternal black hole, in presence of the island.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that in the absence of gravity there exist non-$O(4)$-symmetric instanton solutions with finite action beyond Coleman's instantons. In this paper, focusing on the false-vacuum decay in a single scalar field in flat Euclidean space, we provide a general discussion on $O(4)$-symmetric instantons that are singular at the true-vacuum bubble. We find that, for the action to remain finite without introducing a UV cutoff, the potential must be unbounded from below and take the exponential form, thereby evading Coleman's theorem. We then consider two explicit examples of such instantons and perturbatively analyze the dynamics of small deformations around them. We find that one of them does not allow regular deformations, which indicates that the $O(4)$ symmetric solution still gives the minimum action, while the other one is found to allow regular deformations that cost no additional action at second order in perturbation. The latter example opens up the possibility of the existence of non-$O(4)$-symmetric solutions with lower action if we allow singular instantons with finite action.</description>

      <title>Dip and non-linearity in the curvature perturbation from inflation with a transient non-slow-roll stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider models of inflation that contain a transient non-slow-roll stage and investigate the conditions under which a dip appears in the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation. Using the $\delta N$ formalism, we derive a general relation between the comoving curvature perturbation ${\cal{R}}$ and the scalar field perturbation $\delta\varphi$ and its velocity perturbation $\delta\pi$. Compared with the result obtained in linear perturbation theory, it turns out that properly taking account of the $\delta\pi$ contribution is essential to reproduce the dip in the power spectrum. Namely, the curvature perturbation is proportional to a specific linear combination of $\delta\varphi$ and $\delta\pi$ at the linear order. We also investigate the non-linearity at the dip scale and find that models with a bump or an upward step exhibit much larger non-linearity than ultra-slow-roll and Starobinsky's linear potential models. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of non-linearity by computing the probability density functions (PDFs) for the above-mentioned models and show that highly asymmetric PDFs are realised for models with a bump or a step.</description>

Abstract: Holographic duality provides a microscopic interpretation of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter supergravity solutions. The dual states of the field theory give rise to expectation values of light operators. These expectation values correspond to coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of gauge-invariant combinations of supergravity fields. We consider the duality between type IIB theory on AdS$_5 \times $S$^5$ and 4D $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory, focusing on the half-BPS sector. We clarify the structure of the precision holographic dictionary, making explicit the distinction between single-trace operators and single-particle operators, where the latter contain admixtures of multi-traces. We rewrite the holographic dictionary for half-BPS operators of dimension four in the single-particle basis. We then apply this dictionary to perform precision holographic studies of two different smooth supergravity solutions in the class derived by Lin, Lunin and Maldacena, that have been recently used to compute all-light four-point correlators by making extrapolations of heavy-light correlators.</description>

      <title>Collapse-based models for gravity do not violate the Entanglement-Based Witness of non-classicality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that an entanglement-based witness of non-classicality can be applied to testing quantum effects in gravity. Specifically, if a system can create entanglement between two quantum probes by local means only, then it must be non-classical. Recently, claims have been made that collapse-based models of classical gravity, i.e. Di\'osi-Penrose model, can predict gravitationally induced entanglement between quantum objects, resulting in gravitationally induced entanglement is insufficient to conclude that gravity is fundamentally quantum, contrary to the witness statement. Here we vindicate the witness. We analyze the underlying physics of collapse-based models for gravity and show that these models have nonlocal features, violating the principle of locality.</description>

      <title>Generating Jackiw-Teitelboim Euclidean gravity from static three-dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider pure three-dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons electrodynamics in the static limit. We show that this theory can be mapped onto a two-dimensional gravitational model in the first-order formalism of Riemannian manifolds with Euclidean signature, coupled to a real scalar field naturally interpreted as a dilaton. In this framework, the Newtonian and cosmological constants in two dimensions are fully determined by the electric charge. The solution to this gravitational model is found to be trivial: a constant dilaton field on a flat manifold. However, we introduce two distinct shifts of the spin-connection that transform the model into Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Specifically, we identify two additional solutions: a hyperbolic manifold with also a constant dilaton configuration; and a spherical manifold where, again, the dilaton assumes a constant, nonzero field configuration. In both non-flat cases, by employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem in the specific cases of compact manifolds, we establish that the manifold's radius is fixed by the cosmological constant (and, therefore, by the electric charge).</description>

      <title>The role of natural language in understanding the universe: a teaching-learning sequence for high school students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introducing gravitational physics at high school provides educational means for bridging the gap between the image of science held by students and science itself. Natural language is fundamental in this learning. It engages students in constructing an understanding of a concept or a notion, establishing new relations between previous and new elements of knowledge. We present a teaching/learning sequence (TLS) aimed to contextualize gravitational physics along the lines of the Einstein Telescope educational program in Sardinia devoted to upper secondary school students. We focused on the role of debates and controversy in the evolution of science, proposing science-reflexive meta discourses to present physics as a unified knowledge textbook. We discuss our design and present results by analyzing students' semiotic registers to recap their learning during the activity. Finally, we discuss the potentiality of our TLS in orientating students towards STEM.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is ample evidence that the bulk dual of a $T\overline{T}$ deformed holographic CFT is a gravitational system with a finite area cutoff boundary. For states dual to black holes, the finite cutoff surface cannot be moved beyond the event horizon. We overcome this by considering an extension of the $T\overline{T}$ deformation with a boundary cosmological constant and a prescription for a sequence of flows that successfully pushes the cutoff boundary past the event horizon and arbitrarily close to the black hole singularity. We show how this sequence avoids the complexification of the deformed boundary energies. The approach to the singularity is reflected on the boundary by the approach of the deformed energies to an accumulation point in the limit of arbitrarily large distance in deformation space. We argue that this sequence of flows is automatically implemented by the gravitational path integral given only the values of the initial ADM charges and the area of the finite cutoff surface, suggesting a similar automatic boundary mechanism that keeps all the deformed energies real at arbitrary values of the deformation parameter. This leads to a natural definition of a deformed boundary canonical ensemble partition function that sums over the entire spectrum and remains real for any value of the deformation parameter. We find that this partition function displays Hagedorn growth at the scale set by the deformation parameter, which we associate to the region near the inner horizon in the bulk dual.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally coupled gravity constraints from DESI DR2 data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been observed that the hint about phantom crossing in the DESI BAO observation might point to non-minimally coupled gravity. We analyzed DESI DR2 BAO together with CMB and Type Ia supernova data to constrain non-minimal coupling of gravity in the effective field theory (EFT) approach. Using a non-parametric method to infer the EFT functions, we found that with DESI BAO, DESY5 SN, and Planck CMB data the signal for non-minimal coupling reaches $\sim3\sigma$. It is found that current data can constrain up to the quadratic order $(n=2)$ if the EFT function representing non-minimal coupling is Taylor expanded as a general function of the dark energy fraction $\Omega_{\rm{DE}}$, i.e. $\Omega^{\text{EFT}}(a)=\sum_{i=0}^{n} c^{\rm{EFT}}_i \Omega^i_{\text{DE}}(a)$. This calls for a more flexible parametrization of the EFT functions than commonly used ones in literature.</description>

Abstract: We present a modification to a 'rotating' version of the dynamical Alcubierre spacetime, which was previously shown to permit closed timelike curves. We find that if the effective rotation rate is made dependent on the spacetime coordinates within the bubble, a class of closed timelike curves are promoted to spatially circular geodesics. These paths provide a simple model of a free particle interacting with a CTC for a finite proper time interval, entering and exiting in flat spacetime. Despite the questionable physical realisability of our metric, we suggest that it may provide a useful background for future theoretical studies of classical and quantum models of time travel in a general relativistic setting.</description>

      <title>$\mu$-GLANCE: A Novel Technique to Detect Chromatically and Achromatically Lensed Gravitational Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing in the wave-optics (WO) regime occurs when the Schwarzschild radius of a lensing object is comparable to or smaller than the wavelength of incoming gravitational waves (GWs), producing chromatic amplitude and phase modulations. In contrary, geometric optics effects happen when wavelength is much smaller than the lensing object leading to frequency independent amplifications and phase shifts. GWs can undergo both effects of lensing due to interactions with objects of different scales. To detect and characterize the wave-optics features from a lensed GW, we have developed a novel method \texttt{$\mu$-GLANCE} (Micro-Gravitational Lensing Authenticator using Non-modelled Cross-correlation Exploration). In this technique, we calculate the cross-correlation between the residuals from different detectors. We assign a false alarm rate to each potential WO microlensed candidate from a statistical viewpoint, depending on how many times the noise cross-correlation matches the strength of the residual cross-correlation of the candidate over a certain period of time. We show that for an event with a matched-filtering signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) close to thirty, a residual due to wave-optics lensing with an amplitude about $10\%$ of magnification $\mu\approx 3.2$ will start to show deviation from noise distribution at more than $68\%$ Confidence interval with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA sensitivity for the fourth observation run. This method provides the first technique to detect geometric optics and wave-optics effects from a WO microlensed GW without assuming any specific lensing model, and its application on the current and future GW data can identify events with both chromatic and achromatic lensed scenarios.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Motion of Test Particles around the Scalar Hairy Black Holes with Asymmetric Vacua</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An asymptotically flat hairy black hole (HBH) can exhibit distinct characteristics when compared to the Schwarzschild black hole, due to the evasion of no-hair theorem by minimally coupling the Einstein gravity with a scalar potential which possesses asymmetric vacua, i.e, a false vacuum $(\phi=0)$ and a true vacuum $(\phi=\phi_1)$. In this paper, we investigate the geodesic motion of both massive test particles and photons in the vicinity of HBH with $\phi_1=0.5$ and $\phi_1=1.0$ by analyzing their effective potentials derived from the geodesic equation. By fixing $\phi_1$, the effective potential of a massive test particle increases monotonically when its angular momentum $L$ is very small. When $L$ increases to a critical value, the effective potential possesses an inflection point which is known as the innermost stable of circular orbit (ISCO), where the test particle can still remain stable in a circular orbit with a minimal radius without being absorbed by the HBH or fleeing to infinity. Beyond the critical value of $L$, the effective potential possesses a local minimum and a local maximum, indicating the existence of unstable and stable circular orbits, respectively. Moreover, the HBH possesses an unstable photon sphere but its location slightly deviates from the Schwarzschild black hole. The trajectories of null geodesics in the vicinity of HBH can also be classified into three types, which are the direct, lensing and photon sphere, based on the deflection angle of light, but the values of impact parameters can vary significantly than the Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Scattering Transform for Gravitational Waves Analysis. An Application to Glitch Characterization</title>

Abstract: Gravitational waves, first predicted by Albert Einstein within the framework of general relativity, were confirmed in 2015 by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration, marking a pivotal breakthrough in astrophysics. Despite this achievement, a key challenge remains in distinguishing true gravitational wave signals from noise artifacts, or "glitches," which can distort data and affect the quality of observations. Current state-of-the-art methods, such as the Q-transform, are widely used for signal processing, but face limitations when addressing certain types of signals. In this study, we investigate the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST), a recent signal analysis method, as a complementary approach. Theoretical motivation for WST arises from its stability under signal deformations and its equivariance properties, which make it particularly suited for the complex nature of gravitational wave data. Our experiments on the LIGO O1a dataset show that WST simplifies classification tasks and enables the use of more efficient architectures compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we explore the potential benefits of integrating WST with the Q-transform, demonstrating that ensemble methods exploiting both techniques can capture complementary features of the signal and improve overall performance. This work contributes to advancing machine learning applications in gravitational wave analysis, introducing refined preprocessing techniques that improve signal detection and classification.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the relationship of black-hole kicks and multipole asymmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precession in black-hole binaries is caused by a misalignment between the total spin and the orbital angular momentum. The gravitational-wave emission of such systems is anisotropic, which leads to an asymmetry in the $\pm m$ multipoles when decomposed into a spherical harmonic basis. This asymmetric emission can impart a kick to the merger remnant black hole as a consequence of linear momentum conservation. Despite the astrophysical importance of kicks, multipole asymmetries contribute very little to the overall signal strength and, therefore, the majority of current gravitational-wave models do not include them. Recent efforts have been made to include asymmetries in waveform models. However, those efforts focus on capturing finer features of precessing waveforms without making explicit considerations of remnant kick velocities. Here we close that gap and present a comprehensive analysis of the linear momentum flux expressed in terms of multipole asymmetries. As expected, large asymmetries are needed to achieve the largest kick velocities. Interestingly, the same large asymmetries may lead to negligible kick velocities if the antisymmetric and symmetric waveform parts are perpendicular to each other around merger. We also present a phenomenological tool for testing the performance of waveform models with multipole asymmetries. This tool helped us to fix an inconsistency in the phase definition of the IMRPhenomXO4a waveform model.</description>

      <title>The Resolution of the Gauge Problem of Cosmology provides Insight into the Formation of the First Structures in the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to four fundamental problems in the field of cosmological perturbation theory. Firstly, the issue of gauge dependence has been addressed by demonstrating the existence of unique and gauge-invariant quantities corresponding to the actual perturbations. Secondly, the formation of primordial structures after decoupling of matter and radiation is dependent on the existence of local fluid flows resulting from local pressure gradients. To take pressure gradients into account, it is necessary to consider both the energy density and the particle number density. Thirdly, the novel relativistic perturbation theory applies to an open, flat, and closed Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe. The derivation of the novel perturbation theory definitively reveals the inherent limitations of Newtonian gravitation as a framework for investigating cosmological density perturbations. Finally, the application of the perturbation theory to a flat universe demonstrates that, prior to decoupling, perturbations in both Cold Dark Matter and ordinary matter are coupled to perturbations in radiation. Therefore, the universe's earliest structures formed only after decoupling, at which point local nonadiabatic random pressure fluctuations became a significant factor. Negative nonadiabatic pressure fluctuations resulted in a brief, rapid growth of density fluctuations until the total pressure fluctuations became positive. In contrast, positive nonadiabatic pressure fluctuations led to the formation of voids. Perturbations with masses about $2.2\times10^{4}\,\text{M}_\odot$ became nonlinear already $60$ million years after the Big Bang, and perturbations with masses between $6.7\times10^2\,\text{M}_\odot$ and $1.2\times10^6\,\text{M}_\odot$ became nonlinear within about $600$ million years.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The results indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general relativity as well as gauge theories, non-trivial symmetries can appear at boundaries. In the presence of radiation some of the symmetries are not Hamiltonian vector fields, hence the definition of charges for the symmetries becomes delicate. It can lead to the problem of field-dependent 2-cocycles in the charge algebra, as opposed to the central extensions allowed in standard classical mechanics. We show that if the Wald-Zoupas prescription is implemented, its covariance requirement guarantees that the algebra of Noether currents is free of field-dependent 2-cocycles, and its stationarity requirement further removes central extensions. Therefore the charge algebra admits at most a time-independent field-dependent 2-cocycle, whose existence depends on the boundary conditions. We report on new results for asymptotic symmetries at future null infinity that can be derived with this approach.</description>

      <title>Canonical Quantization of the U(1) Gauge Field in the Rindler Coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the canonical quantization of the U(1) gauge field across all four regions in the Rindler coordinates in the Lorentz-covariant gauge. Concretely, in the four regions (future, past, left and right Rindler-wedges) in the Rindler coordinates, the gauge-fixed Lagrangian in the Lorentz-covariant gauge is obtained, which is composed of the U(1) gauge field, the B-field and ghost fields. Since the U(1) gauge and B-fields are decoupled from the ghost fields by the property of the U(1) gauge theory, the U(1) gauge field and the B-field are examined in this study. Then, by solving the equations of motion obtained from the gauge-fixed Lagrangian, the solutions of each mode of the U(1) gauge field and the B-field can be obtained. Following this, with the Klein-Gordon inner-product defined in the Rindler coordinates, the normalization constants of each of those mode-solutions are determined. Subsequently, formulating the canonical commutation relations of the U(1) gauge field and its canonical conjugate momentum, the equal-time commutation relations of the coefficient of each mode-solution in each direction of the U(1) gauge field in each region of the Rindler coordinates are obtained. From these, it can be seen that those coefficients have physical meaning as creation/annihilation operators. The polarization vectors in each region of the Rindler coordinates are also given in this study.</description>

      <title>New limits on warm inflation from pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) generated in the post-inflationary universe to infer new limits on warm inflation. We specifically examine the evolution of primordial GWs by scalar perturbations produced during the radiation-dominated epoch. For this purpose, we assume a weak regime of warm inflation under the slow-roll approximation, with a dissipation coefficient linearly dependent on the temperature of the radiation bath. We then derive analytical expressions for the curvature power spectrum and the scalar index, in the cases of chaotic and exponential potentials of the inflationary field. Subsequently, we compare the theoretical predictions regarding the relic energy density of GWs with the stochastic GW background signal recently detected by the NANOGrav collaboration through the use of pulsar timing array measurements. In so doing, we obtain numerical constraints on the free parameters of the inflationary models under study. Finally, we conduct a model selection analysis through the Bayesian inference method to measure the statistical performance of the different theoretical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics of a Spherically Symmetric Causal Diamond in Minkowski Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the phase space of a spherically symmetric causal diamond in $(d+2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Utilizing the covariant phase space formalism, we identify the relevant degrees of freedom that localize to the $d$-dimensional bifurcate horizon and, upon canonical quantization, determine their commutators. On this phase space, we find two Iyer-Wald charges. The first of these charges, proportional to the area of the causal diamond, is responsible for shifting the null time along the horizon and has been well-documented in the literature. The second charge is much less understood, being integrable for $d \geq 2$ only if we allow for field-dependent diffeomorphisms and is responsible for changing the size of the causal diamond.</description>

      <title>Effects of dark boson mediated feeble interaction between dark matter (DM) and quark matter on $f$-mode oscillation of DM admixed quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the prominent non-radial fundamental $f$-mode oscillations of dark matter (DM) admixed strange quark stars (DMSQSs), by adopting an equation of state (EoS) developed in Ref.~\cite{Sen:2022pfr}, which considers the possible presence of feebly interacting DM in strange quark stars (SQSs) for the first time. Within the model, feeble interaction between fermionic DM $\chi$ and strange quark matter (SQM) is invoked via a vector new physics mediator $\xi$ with coupling strength $y_{\xi}$. The pure SQM is described by the vector MIT Bag model. By varying different EoS parameters, the structural properties viz. the mass, radius and tidal deformability ($\Lambda$) of the DMSQSs are studied with respect to various astrophysical constraints. We study in detail the $f$-mode spectra within the Cowling approximation by obtaining the frequencies as a function of mass, compactness and $\Lambda$ of the star. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of non-radial $f$-mode oscillations of DMSQSs. Our investigation indicates that the presence of DM and its interaction with SQM has great impact on the $f$-modes. We show that the $f$-mode frequencies are larger for DMSQSs, which are largely populated with massive DM fermions, compared to the SQSs. Further, we obtain a linear empirical relation between the $f$-modes and the average density of the star. We also find that the mass-scaled angular frequency varies universally with compactness and $\ln{\Lambda}$ for DMSQSs. Further, our studies indicate that the inclusion of DM in compact stars reduces the deviation of $f$-mode frequency from general relativistic to Cowling approximation.</description>

      <title>An Open Effective Field Theory for light in a medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many scenarios of interest, a quantum system interacts with an unknown environment, necessitating the use of open quantum system methods to capture dissipative effects and environmental noise. With the long-term goal of developing a perturbative theory for open quantum gravity, we take an important step by studying Abelian gauge theories within the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. We begin with a pedagogical review of general results for open free theories, setting the stage for our primary focus: constructing the most general open effective field theory for electromagnetism in a medium. We assume locality in time and space, but allow for an arbitrary finite number of derivatives. Crucially, we demonstrate that the two copies of the gauge group associated with the two branches of the Schwinger-Keldysh contour are not broken but are instead deformed by dissipative effects. We provide a thorough discussion of gauge fixing, define covariant gauges, and calculate the photon propagators, proving that they yield gauge-invariant results. A notable result is the discovery that gauge invariance is accompanied by non-trivial constraints on noise fluctuations. We derive these constraints through three independent methods, highlighting their fundamental significance for the consistent formulation of open quantum gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Black hole information turbulence and the Hubble tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major outstanding challenge in cosmology is the persistent discrepancy between the Hubble constant obtained from early and late universe measurements -- the Hubble tension. Examining cosmological evolution through the lens of information growth within a black hole we show the appearence of two fractal growing processes characterizing the early and late ages. These fractals induce space growth rates of $62.79\pm5.59$ km/s/Mpc and $70.07\pm0.09$ km/s/Mpc; close to the current values of the Hubble constants involved in the tension. These results strongly suggest that the Hubble tension is not given by unexpected large-scale structures or multiple, unrelated errors but by innate properties underlying the universe dynamics.</description>

      <title>A common origin of two accelerating universes: inflation and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a quantum theory of inflaton and its decay product of various gauge boson pairs to investigate the preheating towards thermalized universe. The inflaton decay into gauge-boson pairs is shown to be inevitably accompanied by tachyon-mass-like correction to inflation potential that ultimately leads to an inflaton escape out of trapped local potential minimum towards the field infinity. This gives rise to a conversion mechanism of early inflationary acceleration to a quintessence dark energy acceleration at late stages of cosmic evolution. The success of the escape depends on how standard particles are incorporated into a scheme of extended Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity. New types of super-radiance mechanism that enhance the ending of preheating are identified and compared with the Dicke model.</description>
