      <title>Measuring a localization phase diagram controlled by the interplay of disorder and driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of localizing and delocalizing mechanisms such as disorder, interactions, and driving is a central topic of modern condensed matter physics. In this work we experimentally explore the interplay between quasiperiodic disorder and periodic driving, each of which in isolation is capable of driving a metal-insulator phase transition. Using a 1D quasiperiodic cold-atom chain we measure transport across the full phase diagram varying both drive strength and quasi-disorder strength. We observe lobes of metallic phases bounded by quantum phase transitions which depend on both drive and disorder. While these observations are broadly consistent with expectations from a high-drive-frequency theoretical model, we also observe clear departures from the predictions of this model, including anomalous changes in localization behavior at lower drive frequency. We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that understanding the full measured phase diagram requires an extension to commonly-used approximate theories of Floquet matter.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold atom-molecule collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report numerically exact quantum scattering calculations on magnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold, strongly anisotropic atom-molecule [Rb($^2$S) + SrF($^2\Sigma^+$)] collisions based on state-of-the-art ab initio potential energy surfaces. We find broad resonances mediated by the intermolecular spin-exchange interaction, as well as narrow resonances due to the intramolecular spin-rotation interaction, which are unique to atom-molecule collisions. Remarkably, the density of resonances in atom-molecule collisions is not much higher than that in atomic collisions despite the presence of a dense manifold of molecular rotational states, which can be rationalized by analyzing the adiabatic states of the collision complex.</description>

      <title>Ytterbium atom interferometry for dark matter searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the sensitivity of a laboratory-scale ytterbium atom interferometer to scalar, vector, and axion dark matter signals. A frequency ratio measurement between two transitions in $^{171}$Yb enables a search for variations of the fine-structure constant that could surpass existing limits by a factor of 100 in the mass range $10^{-22}$ eV to $10^{-16}$ eV. Differential accelerometry between Yb isotopes yields projected sensitivities to scalar and vector dark matter couplings that are stronger than the limits set by the MICROSCOPE equivalence principle test, and an analogous measurement in the MAGIS-100 long-baseline interferometer would be more sensitive than previous bounds by factors of 10 or more. A search for anomalous spin torque in MAGIS-100 is projected to reach similar sensitivity to atomic magnetometry experiments. We discuss strategies for mitigating the main systematic effects in each measurement. These results indicate that improved dark matter searches with Yb atom interferometry are technically feasible.</description>

      <title>Double, triple, and quadruple magic wavelengths for cesium ground, excited, and Rydberg states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic polarizabilities of cesium Rydberg states, explicitly $nS_{1/2}$, $nP_{1/2}$, $nP_{3/2}$, $nD_{3/2}$, and $nD_{5/2}$, where the principal quantum number $n$ is $40$ to $70$, are presented for linearly polarized light. The dynamic polarizability is calculated using the sum-over-states approach. We identify double magic wavelengths in the range of $1,000-2,000$~nm for simultaneous trapping of the ground state and a Rydberg state, which are, respectively, red-detuned and blue-detuned with respect to a low-lying excited auxiliary state. Based on calculations of the radiative lifetime, blackbody radiation induced transitions, and population transfer out of the Rydberg and auxiliary states (estimated within two-state as well as master equation models), we conclude that magic wavelength trapping is particularly promising experimentally for the $nD_{J,|M_J|}$ Rydberg series with angular momentum $J=3/2$ and projection quantum numbers $M_J=\pm 1/2$ (auxiliary state $8P_{1/2}$) and $M_J=\pm 3/2$ (auxiliary state $8P_{3/2}$), using trap depths as large as $10$~$\mu$K. Moreover, by tuning the angle between the quantization axis and the polarization vector of the light, we identify triple and quadruple magic wavelengths, for which the polarizabilities of the ground state, a Rydberg state, and, respectively, one and two low-lying excited states are equal. Our comprehensive theoretical study provides much needed guidance for on-going experimental efforts on cesium Rydberg-state based quantum simulations that operate on time scales up to several $\mu$s.</description>

      <title>Slowing Down a Coherent Superposition of Circular Rydberg States of Strontium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg alkaline earth atoms are promising tools for quantum simulation and metrology. When one of the two valence electrons is promoted to long-lived circular states, the second valence electron can be optically manipulated without significant autoionization. We harness this feature to demonstrate laser slowing of a thermal atomic beam of circular strontium atoms. By driving the main ion core 422 nm wavelength resonance, we observe a velocity reduction of 50 m/s without significant autoionization. We also show that a superposition of circular states undergoes very weak decoherence during the cooling process, up to the scattering of more than thousand photons. This robustness opens new perspectives for quantum simulations over long timescales with circular atoms, while simultaneously cooling their motional state. It makes it possible to mitigate the harmful effects of unavoidable heating due to spin-motion coupling during a quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Tessellated phase diagram and extended criticality in driven quasicrystals and quantum Hall matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known mapping between 1D quasiperiodic systems and 2D integer quantum Hall matter can also be applied in the presence of driving. Here we explore the effect of time-varying electric fields on the transport properties and phase diagram of Harper-Hofstadter materials. We consider light of arbitrary polarization illuminating a 2D electron gas at high magnetic field; this system maps to a 1D quasicrystal subjected to simultaneous phasonic and dipolar driving. We show that this generalized driving generates a tessellated phase diagram featuring a nested duality-protected pattern of metal-insulator transitions. Circularly or elliptically polarized light can create an extended critical phase, opening up a new route to achieving wavefunction multifractality without fine-tuning to a critical point, as well as induce Floquet topological insulators. We describe in detail a path to experimental realization of these phenomena using lattice-trapped ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and modeling of $^{171}$Yb Rydberg states for high-fidelity two-qubit gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multichannel quantum defect (MQDT) models for highly excited $^{174}$Yb and $^{171}$Yb Rydberg states with $L \leq 2$. The models are developed using a combination of existing literature data and new, high-precision laser and microwave spectroscopy in an atomic beam, and validated by detailed comparison with experimentally measured Stark shifts and magnetic moments. We then use these models to compute interaction potentials between two Yb atoms, and find excellent agreement with direct measurements in an optical tweezer array. From the computed interaction potential, we identify an anomalous F\"orster resonance that likely degraded the fidelity of previous entangling gates in $^{171}$Yb using $F=3/2$ Rydberg states. We then identify a more suitable $F=1/2$ state, and achieve a state-of-the-art controlled-Z gate fidelity of $\mathcal{F}=0.994(1)$, with the remaining error fully explained by known sources. This work establishes a solid foundation for the continued development quantum computing, simulation and entanglement-enhanced metrology with Yb neutral atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Influence of spectra sewing on XCT measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents an analysis of the possible spectra manipulation and its consequence for the specific application of XCT. The focus was on the modification of the registered spectra dominantly by the sewing/stitching method. A model spectrum was created to analyse the possible behaviour of the spectral components when specifically arranged. The model and processing of real experimental data revealed that careful spectral sewing can be a very useful procedure and typically leads to improvement of the results obtained with the XCT technique. The results recommended also cautiousness in the choice of the applied modification and scale. In some cases gain or spectral enhancement of a part of the spectrum can be considered also as a sort of sewing, and improve the XCT results.</description>

      <title>Isotopologue-selective laser cooling of molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct laser cooling of molecules has made significant progress in recent years. However, the selective cooling and manipulation of molecules based on their isotopic composition, which is ubiquitous in atomic laser cooling, has not yet been achieved. Here, we demonstrate such isotopologue-selective laser cooling of molecules, using barium monofluoride (BaF) as an example. The manipulation of the rare and previously uncooled 136BaF is achieved within a molecular beam containing several isotopologues of significantly higher natural abundance. Our results enable intense molecular beams and high fidelity detection of select low-abundance isotopologues or isotopic mixtures. Such beams are a first step towards isotopologue-selective molecular trapping and will be useful for applications in trace gas analysis, cold chemistry and precision tests of fundamental symmetries.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Hopf-Euler insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a class of three-band non-Abelian topological insulators in three dimensions which carry a single bulk Hopf index protected by spatiotemporal ($\mathcal{PT}$) inversion symmetry. These phases may also host subdimensional topological invariants given by the Euler characteristic class, resulting in real Hopf-Euler insulators. Such systems naturally realize helical nodal structures in the 3D Brillouin zone, providing a physical manifestation of the linking number described by the Hopf invariant. We show that, by opening a gap between the valence bands of these systems, one finds a fully-gapped `flag' phase, which displays a three-band multi-gap Pontryagin invariant. Unlike the previously reported $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric four-band real Hopf insulator, which hosts a $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$ invariant, these phases are not unitarily equivalent to two copies of a complex two-band Hopf insulator. We show that these uncharted phases can be obtained through dimensional extension of two-dimensional Euler insulators, and that they support (1) an optical bulk integrated circular shift effect quantized by the Hopf invariant, (2) quantum-geometric breathing in the real space Wannier functions, and (3) surface Euler topology on boundaries. Consequently, our findings pave a way for novel experimental realizations of real-space quantum-geometry, as these systems may be directly simulated by utilizing synthethic dimensions in metamaterials or ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear propagation of cylindrical vector beam through a non-degenerate four level atomic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase-induced susceptibilities for both components of the probe vector beam (PVB) within an atomic system. The atoms are prepared in a non-degenerate four-level configuration. The transitions are coupled by a $\pi$ polarized control field and two orthogonally polarized components of a PVB. We show that the linear susceptibility of the medium depends on the phase shift between the control field and PVB, characterizing loss or gain in the system. Additionally, the phase shift causes polarization rotation in the vector beams (VBs) as they propagate. We further study the effect of nonlinearity on the VB propagation through the medium for a couple of Rayleigh lengths. The self-focusing and defocusing phenomena are observed for radial, azimuthal, and spiral VBs. The special chain-like self-focusing and defocusing leads to the formation of consecutive smaller spot sizes with moderate gain. Therefore, the mechanism of control of susceptibility and self-focusing may hold promise for applications such as transitioning from an absorber to an amplifier, high-resolution microscopy, and optical trap systems.</description>

      <title>A single-photon large-momentum-transfer atom interferometry scheme for Sr or Yb atoms with application to determining the fine-structure constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The leading experimental determinations of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, currently rely on atomic photon-recoil measurements from Ramsey-Bord\'e atom interferometry with large momentum transfer to provide an absolute mass measurement. We propose an experimental scheme for an intermediate-scale differential atom interferometer to measure the photon-recoil of neutral atomic species with a single-photon optical clock transition. We calculate trajectories for our scheme that optimise the recoil phase while nullifying the undesired gravity-gradient phase by considering independently launching two clouds of ultracold atoms with the appropriate initial conditions. For Sr and Yb, we find an atom interferometer of height 3m to be sufficient for an absolute mass measurement precision of $\Delta m / m \sim 1\times 10^{-11}$ with current technology. Such a precise measurement (the first of its kind for Sr or Yb) would halve the uncertainty in $\alpha$ -- an uncertainty that would no longer be limited by an absolute mass measurement. The removal of this limitation would allow the uncertainty in $\alpha$ to be reduced by a factor of 10 by corresponding improvements in relative mass measurements, thus paving the way for higher-precision tests of the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resolving the locations and discriminating the spin states of individual trapped ions with high fidelity is critical for a large class of applications in quantum computing, simulation, and sensing. We report on a method for high-fidelity state discrimination in large two-dimensional (2D) crystals with over 100 trapped ions in a single trapping region, combining a hardware detector and an artificial neural network. A high-data-rate, spatially resolving, single-photon sensitive timestamping detector performs efficient single-shot detection of 2D crystals in a Penning trap, exhibiting rotation at about $25\,\mathrm{kHz}$. We then train an artificial neural network to process the fluorescence photon data in the rest frame of the rotating crystal in order to identify ion locations with a success rate of $~90\%$, accounting for substantial illumination inhomogeneity across the crystal. Finally, employing a time-binned state detection method, we arrive at an average spin-state detection fidelity of $94(2)\%$. This technique can be used to analyze spatial and temporal correlations in arrays of hundreds of trapped-ion qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Registers of trapped neutral atoms, excited to Rydberg states to induce strong long-distance interactions, are extensively studied for direct applications in quantum computing. Here, we present a novel $CC\Phi$ quantum phase gate protocol based on radio-frequency-induced F\"{o}rster resonant interactions in the array of highly excited $^{87}$Rb atoms. The extreme controllability of interactions provided by RF field application enables high-fidelity and robust gate performance for a wide range of parameters of the atomic system, as well as it significantly facilitates the experimental implementation of the gate protocol. Taking into account finite Rydberg states lifetimes and atomic position control imperfections, we achieve theoretical gate fidelities of up to $99.7 \%$ in a cryogenic environment, thus showing the protocol compatibility with modern quantum error correction techniques.</description>

      <title>Tripartite quantum Rabi model with trapped Rydberg ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a tripartite quantum Rabi model (TQRM) wherein a bosonic mode concurrently couples to two spin-$1/2$ particles through a spin-spin interaction, resulting in a spin-spin-boson coupling -- a departure from conventional quantum Rabi models featuring bipartite spin-boson couplings. The symmetries of the TQRM depend on the detuning parameter, representing the energy difference between the spin states. At zero detuning a parity symmetry renders the TQRM reducible to a quantum Rabi model. A subradiant to superradiant transition in the groundstate is predicted as the tripartite coupling strength increases. For non-zero detuning the total spin emerges as the sole conserved quantity in the TQRM. It is found that superradiance prevails in the groundstate as long as the tripartite coupling remains non-zero. We derive the Braak $\mathcal{G}$-function of the TQRM analytically, with which the eigenspectra are obtained. The TQRM can be realized in a viable trapped Rydberg ion quantum simulator, where the required tripartite couplings and single body interactions in the TQRM are naturally present. Our study opens opportunities to explore and create novel correlations and entanglement in the spin and motional degrees of freedoms with the TQRM.</description>

Abstract: We entangle two co-trapped atomic barium ion qubits by collecting single visible photons from each ion through in-vacuo 0.8 NA objectives, interfering them through an integrated fiber-beamsplitter and detecting them in coincidence. This projects the qubits into an entangled Bell state with an observed fidelity lower bound of F &gt; 94%. We also introduce an ytterbium ion for sympathetic cooling to remove the need for recooling interruptions and achieve a continuous entanglement rate of 250 1/s.</description>
