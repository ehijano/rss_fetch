      <title>Nonlinear mechanical metamaterial cloaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of cloaking -- hiding objects from external detection -- has seen wide success in linear systems. Yet, translating these advancements to nonlinear mechanical systems remains an open challenge. Here, we present a new approach to nonlinear mechanical cloaking that frames cloaking as an optimization problem aimed at replicating a target mechanical response. We solve this problem using a differentiable simulation framework coupled with gradient-based optimization. We implement this approach in a class of mechanical metamaterials constructed from rigid units with elastic couplings that support large deformation and contact interactions. Using both numerical simulations and physical experiments, we design optimal cloak structures that effectively mask internal inhomogeneities and shield against external mechanical disturbances both in static and dynamic regimes. This approach provides a versatile design paradigm for creating mechanical systems with integrated cloaking functionality across a broad range of loading scenarios.</description>

      <title>Deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization using N\'eel order-engineered out-of-plane spin in a single ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perpendicular switching of a ferromagnet induced by spin torques is crucial for building high density spin-based memory and logic devices, where out-of-plane spin polarization ($\sigma_z$) has become a long sought-after goal for deterministic switching without assisted magnetic fields. Here we report the observation of$\sigma_z$ and resultant field-free perpendicular switching in a single ferromagnet without any spin torque generation layers, where $\sigma_z$ is achieved through the self-generated spin polarization in the ferromagnet that is engineered by the N\'eel order of an adjacent antiferromagnetic insulator. We further demonstrated that $\sigma_z$ emerges when the self-generated spin polarization is collinear with the N\'eel vector, where the spin current is reflected back to the ferromagnet, along with rotated spin polarization toward the out-of-plane direction to induce $\sigma_z$. Since no current is shunted by antiferromagnetic insulators and the N\'eel order does not rely on single-crystalline materials, these results may provide a CMOS-compatible solution for constructing energy-efficient field-free spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>When Energy and Information Revolutions Meet 2D Janus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The depletion of energy sources, worsening environmental issues, and the quantum limitations of integrated circuits for information storage in the post-Moore era, are pressing global concerns. Fortunately, two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials, possessing broken spatial symmetry, with emerging pressure-dependent and non-linear optical response, piezoelectricity, valley polarization, Rashba spin splitting and more, have established a substantial platform for exploring and applying modifiable physical, chemical and biological properties in material science and offered a promising solution for these energy and information issues. To furnish researchers with a comprehensive repository of 2D Janus family, this review systematically summarizes their theoretical predictions, experimental preparations, and modulation strategies. It also retrospectively outlines the recent advances in modifiable properties, applications, and inherent mechanisms in optics, catalysis, piezoelectricity, electrochemistry, thermoelectricity, magnetism, and electronics, with a focus on experimentally realized hexagonal and trigonal Janus structures. Additionally, their current research state is summarized, and potential opportunities and challenges that may arise are highlighted. Overall, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for designing, fabricating, regulating, and applying 2D Janus systems, both theoretically and experimentally. This review will strongly promote the advanced academic investigations and industrial applications of 2D Janus materials in energy and information fields.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved 3D imaging opportunities with XMPI at ForMAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-rays are commonly used in imaging experiments due to their penetration power, which enables non-destructive resolution of internal structures in samples that are opaque to visible light. Time-resolved X-ray tomography is the state-of-the-art method for obtaining volumetric 4D (3D + time) information by rotating the sample and acquiring projections from different angular viewpoints over time. This method enables studies to address a plethora of research questions across various scientific disciplines. However, it faces several limitations, such as incompatibility with single-shot experiments, challenges in rotating complex sample environments that restrict the achievable rotation speed or range, and the introduction of centrifugal forces that can affect the sample's dynamics. These limitations can hinder and even preclude the study of certain dynamics. Here, we present an implementation of an alternative approach, X-ray Multi-Projection Imaging (XMPI), which eliminates the need for sample rotation. Instead, the direct incident X-ray beam is split into beamlets using beam splitting X-ray optics. These beamlets intersect at the sample position from different angular viewpoints, allowing multiple projections to be acquired simultaneously. We commissioned this setup at the ForMAX beamline at MAX IV. We present projections acquired from two different sample systems - fibers under mechanical load and particle suspension in multi-phase flow - with distinct spatial and temporal resolution requirements. We demonstrate the capabilities of the ForMAX XMPI setup using the detector's full dynamical range for the relevant sample-driven spatiotemporal resolutions: i) at least 12.5 kHz framerates with 4 micrometer pixel sizes (fibers) and ii) 40 Hz acquisitions with 1.3 micrometer pixel sizes (multi-phase flows), setting the basis for a permanent XMPI endstation at ForMAX.</description>

      <title>Electrical Control of Excitons in Bare-MoSe2 and MoSe2/NbSe2 Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are promising materials for next-generation optoelectronic devices, owing to their strong excitonic responses and atomic thickness. Controlling their light emission electrically is a crucial step towards realizing practical nanoscale optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes and optical modulators. However, photoluminescence (PL) quenching in van der Waals TMDC/metal heterostructures, caused by ultrafast interlayer charge or energy transfer, impedes such electrical modulation. Here, we investigate monolayer-MoSe2/bulk-NbSe2 heterostructures and demonstrate that a vertical electric field can effectively recover the PL intensity up to ~ 80% of bare-MoSe2. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the room temperature PL intensity can be tuned by nearly three orders of magnitude in bare-MoSe2 and by about one order of magnitude in MoSe2/NbSe2 heterostructures. First-principles calculations incorporating spin-orbit coupling reveal that the perpendicular electric fields drive a transition from a direct to an indirect bandgap, fundamentally altering the optical response in the heterostructure. Unlike bare-MoSe2, the heterostructure exhibits a pronounced thermal dependence of the enhancement factor, implying that exciton lifetime dominates over interfacial transfer processes. Our findings demonstrate reversible, electric-field-driven PL control at a TMDC/metal interface, providing a pathway to electrically tunable light emission and improved contact engineering in two-dimensional optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Simulating Gadolinium-Induced Magnetic Field Variations for Temperature Sensing with Magneto-Mechanical Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-size magneto-mechanical resonators (MMR) represent an emerging class of passive, wireless sensors that combine a sensing functionality with a tracking option. The operation principle is based on a resonating rotor oscillation whose frequency is defined by the magnetic flux density of a stator magnet. One general sensing mechanism is the coupling of an external parameter to this resonator frequency. In this study, we investigate an approach for encoding a temperature information as a shift in the natural oscillation frequency utilizing the temperature-dependent magnetic properties of gadolinium (Gd). We perform an isolated simulation study on the temperature scaling of the magnetic field generation for stators coated with Gd of varying thickness. Our results show that the magnetic phase transition of Gd at its Curie temperature leads to a pronounced change in the magnetic permeability enabling a significant magnetic shielding behavior only for lower temperatures. In the transition regime, we find a peak sensitivity reaching 45.8 Hz/K exceeding existing values from the literature by up to a factor of $\sim$ 20. The findings of this work are an important step toward quantitative high-sensitivity temperature extraction with MMRs.</description>

      <title>Ion-Beam-Sputtered Mid-Infrared Coatings for Hybrid Supermirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the development of low-loss ion-beam-sputtered (IBS) mid-infrared coatings for hybrid supermirrors. Two highly reflective designs were realized: HR1, a 4-period a-Si/SiO$_2$ DBR with an Al$_2$O$_3$ bonding layer, and HR2, a 6-period a-Si/Ta$_2$O$_5$ DBR with an a-Si terminating layer for bonding. Combined with a GaAs/AlGaAs crystalline mirror, HR2-based hybrids yielded a total loss of 9.3 ppm and excess loss of 6.8 ppm at 4.45 $\mu$m, with cavity finesse up to 396000. For the first time, we used IBS-deposited a-Si directly as a bonding layer, verified its sub-angstrom roughness, and demonstrated excellent performance. This establishes a clear path toward scalable coatings for longer mid-infrared wavelengths, building on prior results in Nat. Commun. 14, 7846 (2023).</description>

      <title>Permittivity-asymmetric qBIC metasurfaces for refractive index sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) provide exceptional light confinement due to their inherent decoupling from radiative channels. Small symmetry breaking transforms BIC into quasi-BIC (qBIC) that couples to free-space radiation enabling ultra-high-quality-factor (Q-factor) resonances desirable for refractive index (RI) sensing. In practical implementations, geometric asymmetry is typically employed. However, since the radiative loss remains fixed once fabricated, such metasurfaces exhibit only a horizontal translation of the resonance spectrum in RI sensing, without modification of its overall shape. Here, we demonstrate a permittivity-asymmetric qBIC ({\epsilon}-qBIC) metasurface, which encodes environmental refractive index variations directly into the asymmetry factor, resulting in indexes response involving both resonance wavelength shift and modulation variation. In addition to exhibiting a competitive transmittance sensitivity of ~5300%/RIU under single-wavelength conditions, the {\epsilon}-qBIC design provides a substantially improved linear response. Specifically, the linear window area of its sensing data distribution, calculated as the integrated wavelength region where the linearity parameter remains above the preset threshold, is 104 times larger than that of the geometry-asymmetric qBIC (g-qBIC), enabling more robust and reliable single-wavelength signal readout. Additionally, numerical results reveal that environmental permittivity asymmetry can optically restore the g-qBIC to a state with ultra-high-Q (over 10^7), approaching to BIC condition. Unlike traditional BICs, which are typically inaccessible once perturbed, the permittivity-restored BIC becomes accessible through environmental perturbations. These findings suggest an alternative design strategy for developing high-performance photonic devices for practical sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of an optical microwave rectification by a superconducting diode with near 100% efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting electronics offer significant advantages in speed and power efficiency for next-generation computing and communication systems. However, their practical deployment is limited by the absence of simple, efficient, and scalable superconducting counterparts to key semiconductor components. In this work, we investigate diodes based on planar Josephson junctions fabricated from a conventional niobium superconductor. The nonreciprocity in these diodes arises from the self-field effect induced by the geometrical asymmetry of the junction. By deliberate tuning of the junction parameters, we achieved effectively infinite nonreciprocity (within experimental resolution), characterized by a complete suppression of the superconducting critical current in one direction while maintaining a significant current in the opposite direction. The key novelty of this work lies in the demonstration of the optical diode effect. We observed threshold-free rectification of 75 GHz microwave radiation, indicating that these diodes exhibit near-ideal optical nonreciprocity. Our results open new avenues for ultrafast superconducting electronics and lay the groundwork for wireless sub-THz signal processing.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency infrared upconversion imaging with nonlinear silicon metasurfaces empowered by quasi-bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared imaging is indispensable for its ability to penetrate obscurants and visualize thermal signatures, yet its practical use is hindered by the intrinsic limitations of conventional detectors. Nonlinear upconversion, which converts infrared light into the visible band, offers a promising pathway to address these challenges. Here, we demonstrate high-efficiency infrared upconversion imaging using nonlinear silicon metasurfaces. By strategically breaking in-plane symmetry, the metasurface supports a high-$Q$ quasi-bound states in the continuum resonance, leading to strongly enhanced third-harmonic generation (THG) with a conversion efficiency of $3\times10^{-5}$ at a pump intensity of 10 GW/cm$^{2}$. Through this THG process, the metasurface enables high-fidelity upconversion of arbitrary infrared images into the visible range, achieving a spatial resolution of $\sim 6$ $\upmu$m as verified using a resolution target and various customized patterns. This work establishes a robust platform for efficient nonlinear conversion and imaging, highlighting the potential of CMOS-compatible silicon metasurfaces for high-performance infrared sensing applications with reduced system complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-based Quantum Computation(MBQC) utilize entanglement as resource for performing quantum computation. Generating cluster state using entanglement as resource is a key bottleneck for the adoption of MBQC. To generate cluster state with charge-qubit arrrays, we provide analytical derivations and numerical validations for 4-qubit cluster state. We compare our fidelities under ideal (noise-free) Hamiltonian evolution and due to effect of decoherence. We show incorporating energy relaxation ($T_1$) yields $&gt;$90\% fidelity while pure dephasing $T_2$ show $70\%$ decays at fourth harmonics. We further show under noise $T_2$ decays to 50\% within 15 time units, versus $&gt;$70\% under relaxation time units ($T_1$)--only. This decay quantify degradation effect of $T_2$ on preparing cluster--state preparation is more than $T_1$. We highlight the critical need for targeted error-mitigation strategies in near-term MBQC implementations.</description>

Abstract: The effectiveness of biochemical antivirals are vulnerable to mutations, motivating physical approaches. Recent experiments with ultrasound reveal viral disruption at MHz frequencies, yet the mechanism remains unclear. We model viruses as fluid-like inclusions and analyze internal acoustic fields. Exact solutions reveal that impedance mismatch induces resonances even for subwavelength scatterers. Beyond the monopole, higher-order modes trap significant energy with significant resonance peak broadening even in absence of explicit dissipation mechanisms. These findings suggest internal acoustic resonances as a mechanism for viral destabilization and acoustic metamaterial applications.</description>

      <title>Natural Frequency Dependency of Magneto-Mechanical Resonators on Magnet Distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise derivation of physical quantities like temperature or pressure at arbitrary locations is useful in numerous contexts, e.g. medical procedures or industrial process engineering. The novel sensor technology of magneto-mechanical resonators (MMR), based on the interaction of a rotor and stator permanent magnet, allows for the combined tracking of the sensor position and orientation while simultaneously sensing an external measurand. Thereby, the quantity is coupled to the torsional oscillation frequency, e.g. by varying the magnet distance. In this paper, we analyze the (deflection angle-independent) natural frequency dependency of MMR sensors on the rotor-stator distance, and evaluate the performance of theoretical models. The three presented sensors incorporate magnets of spherical and/or cylindrical geometry and can be operated at adjustable frequencies within the range of 61.9-307.3 Hz. Our proposed method to obtain the natural frequency demonstrates notable robustness to variations in the initial deflection amplitudes and quality factors resulting in statistical errors on the mean smaller than 0.05 %. We find that the distance-frequency relationship is well described by an adapted dipole model accounting for material and manufacturing uncertainties. Their combined effect can be compensated by an adjustment of a single parameter which drives the median model deviation generally below 0.2 %. Our depicted methods and results are important for the design and calibration process of new sensor types utilizing the MMR technique.</description>

Abstract: As a fundamental force, friction exerts a profound influence on various aspects of our daily lives across multiple disciplines. To understand why adhesive friction is associated with the contact area, here we investigate the generic sliding of elastic solids adhered to a rigid surface by considering re-attachment/healing. We then reveal multiple adhesive fronts closely aligning along the interface with the number of these regions generally increasing with the contact area. These adhesive fronts exhibit rich dynamics and their accumulation along an interface can aid each other through re-attachment/healing in friction, apparently resulting in the increase in the calculated shear-off force with the contact area. Based on these findings, we propose a refined law of adhesive friction. Our analysis further suggests that accumulating adhesive fronts along the interface can trigger crack-like propagation of individual fronts at high velocities, which potentially bridges the gap between tribology and fracture mechanics. We also discuss the relevance of this work to earthquake mechanics, which might provide a unified framework that captures key aspects of fault behavior. We expect that this work can supply a fundamental understanding of healing-mediated interfacial phenomena in diverse systems spanning biology, geology, and engineering.</description>

      <title>Spectral tuning and nanoscale localization of single color centers in silicon via controllable strain</title>

Abstract: The development of color centers in silicon enables scalable quantum technologies by combining telecom-wavelength emission and compatibility with mature silicon fabrication. However, large-scale integration requires precise control of each emitter's optical transition to generate indistinguishable photons for quantum networking. Here, we demonstrate a foundry-fabricated photonic integrated circuit (PIC) combining suspended silicon waveguides with a microelectromechanical (MEMS) cantilever to apply local strain and spectrally tune individual G-centers. Applying up to 35 V between the cantilever and the substrate induces a reversible wavelength shift of the zero-phonon line exceeding 100 pm, with no loss in brightness. Moreover, by modeling the strain-induced shifts with a digital twin physical model, we achieve vertical localization of color centers with sub-3 nm vertical resolution, directly correlating their spatial position, dipole orientation, and spectral behavior. This method enables on-demand, low-power control of emission spectrum and nanoscale localization of color centers, advancing quantum networks on a foundry-compatible platform.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Josephson Junction Barrier Variation -- a Combined Electron Microscopy, Breakdown and Monte-Carlo Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions manufactured to tight tolerances are necessary components for superconducting quantum computing. Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimise. Here we consider complementary techniques assessing what conclusions they allow us to draw about the barriers in junctions. Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20% of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.</description>

      <title>Light-matter interaction between templated molecular layers and surface lattice resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We couple a templated layer of merocyanine molecules with surface lattice resonances in a plasmonic grating. The templating of the molecular layer is achieved using a layer of aligned graphene nanoribbons, resulting in anisotropic optical properties. The anisotropy manifests itself in polarization-dependent coupling between excitons in the organic layer and lattice plasmons in the grating. We study the influence of the templating on the coupling and find that surprisingly the more orientational ordered templated layer displays a lower coupling strength than an identical amorphous merocyanine layer. Our work demonstrates the use of molecular templating in controlling the interaction of excitons with excitations in optical nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Multistability and Noise-Induced Transitions in Dispersively-Coupled Nonlinear Nanomechanical Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the noisy dynamics of two coupled bistable modes of a nanomechanical beam. When de-coupled, each driven mode obeys the Duffing equation of motion, with a well-defined bistable region in the frequency domain. When both modes are driven, intermodal dispersive coupling emerges due to the amplitude dependence of the modal frequencies and leads to coupled states of the two modes. We map out the dynamics of the system by sweeping the drive frequencies of both modes in the presence of added noise. The system then samples all accessible states at each combination of frequencies, with the probability of each stable state being proportional to its occupancy time at steady state. In the frequency domain, the system exhibits four stable regions -- one for each coupled state -- which are separated by five curves. These curves are reminiscent of coexistence curves in an equilibrium phase diagram: each curve is defined by robust inter-state transitions, with equal probabilities of finding the system in the two contiguous states. Remarkably, the curves intersect in two triple points, where the system now transitions between three distinct contiguous states. A physical analogy can be made between this nonequilibrium system and a multi-phase thermodynamic system, with possible applications in computing, precision sensing, and signal processing.</description>
