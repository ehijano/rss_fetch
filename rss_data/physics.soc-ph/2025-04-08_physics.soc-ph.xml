      <title>How communities shape epidemic spreading: A hierarchically structured metapopulation perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent outbreaks of COVID-19, Zika, Ebola, and influenza have renewed interest in advancing epidemic models to better reflect the complexities of disease spreading. Modern approaches incorporate social norms, mobility patterns, and heterogeneous community structures to capture the interplay between social and biological dynamics. This study examines epidemic propagation in hierarchically structured metapopulation networks, where individuals interact within localized communities -- such as schools, workplaces, and theaters -- and diffuse across them. Using mean-field averaging, we derive a scaling law linking contagion rates to the mean connectivity degree, while stability analysis identifies thresholds for infection surges. In networks with heterogeneous mean degrees, spectral perturbation theory reveals how structural variability accelerates and amplifies disease spreading. We find that nodes with above-average degrees are not only infected earlier but also act as key outbreak drivers. Framing epidemic dynamics as a continuous phase transition, we apply pattern formation theory to show that the critical eigenvectors governing system stability are shaped by the network's degree distribution. Crucially, by analyzing Laplacian eigenvector localization, we uncover a one-to-one correspondence between community infection densities and the entries of the critical eigenvector -- revealing how internal community structure directly shapes global infection patterns. This work provides a systematic framework for understanding and predicting epidemic dynamics in structured populations, while highlighting the fundamental role of community organization.</description>

      <title>Co-evolution of cooperation and resource allocation in the advantageous environment-based spatial multi-game using adaptive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-life complex systems, individuals often encounter multiple social dilemmas that cannot be effectively captured using a single-game model. Furthermore, the environment and limited resources both play a crucial role in shaping individuals' decision-making behaviors. In this study, we employ an adaptive control mechanism by which agents may benefit from their environment, thus redefining their individual fitness. Under this setting, a detailed examination of the co-evolution of individual strategies and resource allocation is carried. Through extensive simulations, we find that the advantageous environment mechanism not only significantly increases the proportion of cooperators in the system but also influences the resource distribution among individuals. Additionally, limited resources reinforce cooperative behaviors within the system while shaping the evolutionary dynamics and strategic interactions across different dilemmas. Once the system reaches equilibrium, resource distribution becomes highly imbalanced. To promote fairer resource allocation, we introduce a minimum resource guarantee mechanism. Our results show that this mechanism not only reduces disparities in resource distribution across the entire system and among individuals in different dilemmas but also significantly enhances cooperative behavior in higher resource intervals. Finally, to assess the robustness of our model, we further examine the influence of the advantageous environment on system-wide cooperation in small-world and random graph network models.</description>

      <title>Measuring changes in polarisation using Singular Value Decomposition of network graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18191v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present new methods of measuring polarisation in social networks. We use Random Dot Product Graphs to embed social networks in metric spaces. Singular Value Decomposition of this social network then provider an embedded dimensionality which corresponds to the number of uncorrelated dimensions in the network. A decrease in the optimal dimensionality for the embedding of the network graph means that the dimensions in the network are becoming more correlated, and therefore the network is becoming more polarised.
  We demonstrate this method by analysing social networks such as communication interactions among New Zealand Twitter users discussing climate change issues and international social media discussions of the COP conferences. In both cases, the decreasing embedded dimensionality indicates that these networks have become more polarised over time. We also use networks generated by stochastic block models to explore how an increase of the isolation between distinct communities, or the increase of the predominance of one community over the other, in the social networks decrease the embedded dimensionality and are therefore identifiable as polarisation processes.</description>
