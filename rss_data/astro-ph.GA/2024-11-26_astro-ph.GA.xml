      <title>Investigating the Star-Formation Characteristics of Radio Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies represents a fundamental question in astrophysics. One approach to investigating this question involves comparing the star-formation rates (SFRs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with those of typical star-forming galaxies. At relatively low redshifts ($z\lesssim 1$), radio AGNs manifest diminished SFRs, indicating suppressed star formation, but their behavior at higher redshifts is unclear. To examine this, we leveraged galaxy and radio AGN data from the well-characterized W-CDF-S, ELAIS-S1, and XMM-LSS fields. We established two mass-complete reference star-forming galaxy samples and two radio AGN samples, consisting of 1,763 and 6,766 radio AGNs, the former being higher in purity and the latter more complete. We subsequently computed star-forming fractions ($f_{\text{SF}}$; the fraction of star-forming galaxies to all galaxies) for galaxies and radio-AGN-host galaxies and conducted a robust comparison between them up to $z\approx3$. We found that the tendency for radio AGNs to reside in massive galaxies primarily accounts for their low $f_{\text{SF}}$, which also shows a strong negative dependence upon $M_{\star}$ and a strong positive evolution with $z$. To investigate further the star-formation characteristics of those star-forming radio AGNs, we constructed the star-forming main sequence (MS) and investigated the behavior of the position of AGNs relative to the MS at $z\approx0-3$. Our results reveal that radio AGNs display lower SFRs than star-forming galaxies in the low-$z$ and high-$M_{\star}$ regime and, conversely, exhibit comparable or higher SFRs than MS star-forming galaxies at higher redshifts or lower $M_{\star}$.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Internal Radial Gradient of Chemical Abundances in Spiral Galaxies from CALIFA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of chemical evolution is of paramount importance for understanding the galaxies evolution. Models and observations propose an inside-out mechanism in the formation of spiral galaxy disks implying a negative radial gradient of elemental abundances when represented in logarithmic scale. However, observed chemical abundance gradients, in some instances, deviate from a single linear negative straight line, revealing inner drops or outer flattenings, particularly in more massive galaxies. This study analyzes oxygen abundance gradients in spiral galaxies based on observations from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey. Our focus is specifically on examining oxygen abundance gradient profiles, as obtained with data from HII regions, with a special emphasis on the inner radial gradient. We employ an automated fitting procedure to establish correlations between the physical properties of galaxies and bulges and the presence of these inner drops, seeking for potential explanations for these gradient variations. We find that the different criteria used in the literature to distinguish HII regions from other ionization sources in the galaxy, such as Active Galactic Nuclei, significantly impact the results, potentially altering abundance gradient profiles and uncovering galaxies with distinct inner drops. Additionally, we analyze the abundance radial gradients to investigate the impact of diffuse ionized gas (DIG) decontamination on oxygen abundances over the featuring inner drops. We observe that DIG, concentrated mainly in the central regions of galaxies, can modify oxygen abundance gradient profiles if left unaddressed.</description>

      <title>Where is the Super-virial Gas? II: Insight from the Survey of Galactic Sightlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have revealed a super-virial temperature gas phase at log(T/K) $\sim7$ in the Milky Way, challenging existing galaxy-formation models. This hot gas phase was discovered toward extragalactic absorption sightlines and blank-sky emission fields, both at high galactic latitudes. The location of this hot component is unknown; is it in the extended circumgalactic medium (CGM) or in the interstellar medium (ISM) instead? We analyzed X-ray spectra from Chandra's High-Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) observations of 27 Galactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) to investigate whether the hot gas component is present in the ISM. We searched for absorption lines of SXVI K$\alpha$, SiXIV K$\alpha$, and NeX K$\alpha$, which are the tell-tale signatures of the hot gas and which have been detected toward extragalactic sightlines. Of the 27 targets, these lines were detected in the spectra of only 7, with two sources displaying broad line features likely intrinsic to the XRB systems. Additionally, most of the detected lines are time-variable, reinforcing their likely association with the XRBs. Our results suggest that the super-virial temperature gas is not a widespread component of the ISM but may instead be located in extraplanar regions or the extended CGM, in line with some recent simulation results.</description>

      <title>Metal-Poor Stars in the Milky Way System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ancient, long-lived stars remain present in all components of our home galaxy, the Milky Way. Born a few hundred million after the Big Bang and during a time that marked the very beginning of the chemical evolution, these stars display very low abundances of elements heavier and hydrogen and helium, making them "metal-poor". Studying the chemical composition of these stars reveals direct information about the conditions of the early universe because each of them has long preserved the local chemical signature of their individual birth gas clouds in their stellar atmosphere. There are many different types of metal-poor stars, each of them providing information on a different element production history that occurred prior to their own births. Large samples of metal-poor stars enable the reconstruction of nucleosynthesis and the chemical evolution of our Galaxy, early star formation processes, and various aspects of the assembly and evolution of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>An upgraded GMRT and MeerKAT study of radio relics in the low mass merging cluster PSZ2 G200.95-28.16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse radio sources known as radio relics are direct tracers of shocks in the outskirts of merging galaxy clusters. PSZ2 G200.95-28.16, a low-mass merging cluster($\textrm{M}_{500} = (2.7 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{14}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) features a prominent radio relic, first identified by Kale et al. 2017. We name this relic as the Seahorse. The MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey has confirmed two additional radio relics, R2 and R3 in this cluster. We present new observations of this cluster with the Upgraded GMRT at 400 and 650 MHz paired with the Chandra X-ray data. The largest linear sizes for the three relics are~1.53 Mpc, 1.12~kpc, and 340~kpc. All three radio relics are polarized at 1283~MHz. Assuming the diffusive shock acceleration model, the spectral indices of the relics imply shock Mach Numbers of $3.1 \pm 0.8$ and $2.8 \pm 0.9$ for the Seahorse and R2, respectively. The Chandra X-ray surface brightness map shows two prominent subclusters, but the relics are not perpendicular to the likely merger axis as typically observed; no shocks are detected at the locations of the relics. We discuss the possible merger scenarios in light of the low mass of the cluster and the radio and X-ray properties of the relics. The relic R2 follows the correlation known in the radio relic power and cluster mass plane, but the Seahorse and R3 relics are outliers. We have also discovered a radio ring in our 650~MHz uGMRT image that could be an Odd radio circle candidate.</description>

      <title>SILVERRUSH. XIV. Lya Luminosity Functions and Angular Correlation Functions from ~20,000 Lya Emitters at z~2.2-7.3 from upto 24 ${\rm deg}^2$ HSC-SSP and CHORUS Surveys: Linking the Post-Reionization Epoch to the Heart of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the luminosity functions (LFs) and angular correlation functions (ACFs) derived from 18,960 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z=2.2-7.3$ over a wide survey area of $\lesssim24 {\rm deg^2}$ that are identified in the narrowband data of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) and the Cosmic HydrOgen Reionization Unveiled with Subaru (CHORUS) surveys. Confirming the large sample with the 241 spectroscopically identified LAEs, we determine Ly$\alpha$ LFs and ACFs in the brighter luminosity range down to $0.5L_{\star}$, and confirm that our measurements are consistent with previous studies but offer significantly reduced statistical uncertainties. The improved precision of our ACFs allows us to clearly detect one-halo terms at some redshifts, and provides large-scale bias measurements that indicate hosting halo masses of $\sim 10^{11} M_\odot$ over $z\simeq 2-7$. By comparing our Ly$\alpha$ LF (ACF) measurements with reionization models, we estimate the neutral hydrogen fractions in the intergalactic medium to be $x_{\rm \HI}&lt;0.05$ (=${0.06}^{+0.12}_{-0.03}$), $0.15^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$ (${0.21}^{+0.19}_{-0.14}$), $0.18^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$, and $0.75^{+0.09}_{-0.13}$ at $z=5.7$, $6.6$, $7.0$, and $7.3$, respectively. Our findings suggest that the neutral hydrogen fraction remains relatively low, $x_{\rm \HI} \lesssim 0.2$, at $z=5-7$, but increases sharply at $z &gt; 7$, reaching $x_{\rm \HI} \sim 0.9$ by $z \simeq 8-9$, as indicated by recent JWST studies. The combination of our results from LAE observations with recent JWST observations suggests that the major epoch of reionization occurred around $z \sim 7-8$, likely driven by the emergence of massive sources emitting significant ionizing photons.</description>

      <title>The Detection of H$_2$O Maser Emission from mid-IR Red Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of H$_2$O maser emission in 4 out of 77 (5.2%) mid-IR red galaxies that meet the color criteria of $W1-W2 &gt; 0.5$ and $W1-W4 &gt; 7$ and are classified as Type-2 AGNs based on optical, near-IR, and mid-IR spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. Here, $W1$, $W2$, and $W4$ represent the IR magnitudes at 3.4, 4.6, and 22 micron, respectively, as measured by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. Three of the four newly identified maser galaxies are classified as either Seyfert 2 or LINER systems, but none are disk maser systems. Our analysis indicates that AGN identifications based solely on SED fitting are unreliable, resulting in an unexpectedly low detection rate. By restricting our sample to optically classified Type 2 AGNs that satisfy the mid-IR color criteria, we achieve a maser detection rate of ~13-18%, aligning with previous predictions for mid-IR red sources. These selection criteria are the most effective to date for facilitating new maser detections, particularly in light of the recent identification of additional Type 2 AGNs identified from ongoing galaxy and AGN surveys.</description>

      <title>Radio Halo Detection in MWA Data using Deep Neural Networks and Generative Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting diffuse radio emission, such as from halos, in galaxy clusters is crucial for understanding large-scale structure formation in the universe. Traditional methods, which rely on X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) cluster pre-selection, introduce biases that limit our understanding of the full population of diffuse radio sources. In this work, we provide a possible resolution for this astrophysical tension by developing a machine learning (ML) framework capable of unbiased detection of diffuse emission, using a limited real dataset like those from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). We generate for the first time radio halo images using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs) and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), and apply them to train a neural network classifier independent of pre-selection methods. The halo images generated by DDPMs are of higher quality than those produced by WGANs. The diffusion-supported classifier with a multi-head attention block achieved the best average validation accuracy of 95.93% over 10 runs, using 36 clusters for training and 10 for testing, without further hyperparameter tuning. Using our classifier, we rediscovered 9/12 halos (75% detection rate) from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS) Catalogue, and 5/8 halos (63% detection rate) from the Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich Catalogue 2 (PSZ2) within the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) survey. In addition, we identify 11 potential new halos, minihalos, or candidates in the COSMOS field using XMM-chandra-detected clusters in GLEAM data. This work demonstrates the potential of ML for unbiased detection of diffuse emission and provides labeled datasets for further study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 6-meter BTA telescope has been used to determine radial velocities for 40 galaxies, recently identified in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys as nearby objects. Half of them have kinematic distances within 11 Mpc being new probable companions to the bright Local Volume galaxies: NGC628, Maffei2, NGC2787, M81, NGC4605 and NGC4631. Six relatively isolated objects with heliocentric velocities in the range of $[-150, +70]$km s$^{-1}$, together with the blue compact dwarf NGC 6789, form a diffuse association of dwarf galaxies located in the near part of the Local Void.</description>

      <title>A catalog of ringed galaxies in the TNG50 simulation: Analysis of their properties and structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The catalog of ringed galaxies was compiled through visual classification of synthetic images from the TNG50 simulation. Galaxies were selected based on specific criteria: a redshift range of $0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.1$, stellar mass $M_\star &gt;10^9 M_\odot$, stellar half-mass radius $r_{50} &gt; 1$ kpc, and specific star formation rate (sSFR), $\rm{log(sSFR/yr}^{-1}) &gt; -13$. Our classification allowed for differentiation between inner rings, outer rings, combinations of rings, and partial rings (pseudo-rings), including barred and non-barred ringed galaxies.
  We constructed a control sample of non-ringed galaxies with similar redshift, stellar mass, and environmental density distributions. We identified 807 ringed galaxies. Approximately 59% possess an inner ring, 22% a partial ring, 12% an outer ring, and 7% have i+o rings. Our statistical analysis reveals that 64% (507 galaxies) exhibit bars. Ringed galaxies exhibit lower efficiency for star formation, reduced gas fractions, redder colors, and higher metallicities compared to non-ringed disk objects. They also show greater variability in metallicity for a given stellar mass.
  From the analysis of radial profiles, galaxies with outer rings exhibit a $r_{50}$ similar to or slightly larger than their control group, while those with inner or partial rings tend to have smaller sizes. A deeper exploration of radial density profiles revealed a pronounced central mass deficit preceding the ring structures, with inner and outer rings located at $r_{50}$ and $1.5 , r_{50}$, respectively. Galaxies with both i+o rings have inner rings that are more compact and massive. Additionally, galaxies with partial rings exhibit deeper mass profiles than their controls, particularly in central areas. These findings improve our understanding of galactic evolution and the complex interplay between mass distribution and morphology.</description>

      <title>Regular distribution of star formation regions along the spiral arms and rings of disk galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Last years studies have shown that the spatial regularity in the distribution of young stellar population along the spiral arms and rings of galaxies, previously considered to be rare, is a fairly common phenomenon. Spatial regularity has been found in the spiral arms and rings of galaxies of various morphology, from lenticular to extremely late-type spiral. The characteristic regularity scale is equal to 350-500 pc or a multiple thereof in all studied galaxies. Theoretical models predict a scale of instability of the stellar-gas disk on the order of a few kpc, which is several times larger than observed, although the most recent magneto-hydrodynamic simulations predict the formation of regular chains of star formation regions in spiral arms on a scale of 500-700 pc for the Milky Way-like galaxies. Modern high-quality surveys, such as PHANGS-MUSE, provide the necessary observational data (surface densities and velocity dispersions of gas and stellar population) to directly calculate the regularity scales in galaxies with high spatial resolution and wide field of view, which is a promising direction for research in this field.</description>

      <title>Spectral Energy Distribution Modeling of Broad Emission Line Quasars: From X-ray to Radio Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the differences in physical properties of quasar-host galaxies using an optically selected sample of radio loud (RL) and radio quiet (RQ) quasars (in the redshift range 0.15 &lt; z &lt; 1.9) which we have further cross-matched with the VLA-FIRST survey catalog. The sources in our sample have broad Hbeta and MgII emission lines (1000 km/s &lt; FWHM &lt; 15000 km/s) with a subsample of high broad line quasars (FWHM &gt; 15000 km/s). We construct the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of our broad line quasars using multi-wavelength archival data and targeted observations with the AstroSat telescope. We use the state-of-the-art SED modeling code CIGALE v2022.0 to model the SEDs and determine the best-fit physical parameters of the quasar host galaxies namely their star-formation rate (SFR), main-sequence stellar mass, luminosity absorbed by dust, e-folding time and stellar population age. We find that the emission from the host galaxy of our sources is between 20%-35% of the total luminosity, as they are mostly dominated by the central quasars. Using the best-fit estimates, we reconstruct the optical spectra of our quasars which show remarkable agreement in reproducing the observed SDSS spectra of the same sources. We plot the main-sequence relation for our quasars and note that they are significantly away from the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. Further, the main sequence relation shows a bimodality for our RL quasars indicating populations segregated by Eddington ratios. We conclude that RL quasars in our sample with lower Eddington ratios tend to have substantially lower star-formation rates for similar stellar mass. Our analyses, thus, provide a completely independent route in studying the host galaxies of quasars and addressing the radio dichotomy problem from the host galaxy perspective.</description>

      <title>Optically active and optically inactive radio galaxies as sub-populations of the main galaxy sample of the SDSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the ROGUE I and II catalogues of radio sources associated with optical galaxies to revisit the characterization of radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in terms of radio luminosities and properties derived from the analyses of the optical spectra of their associated galaxies. We propose a physically based classification of radio galaxies into `optically inactive' and `optically active' (OPARGs and OPIRGs). In our sample, there are 14082 OPIRGs and 2721 OPARGs.After correcting for the Malmquist bias, we compared the global properties of our two classes of radio galaxies and put them in the context of the global population of galaxies. To compare the Eddington ratios of OPARGs with those of Seyferts, we devised a method to obtain the bolometric luminosities of these objects, taking into account the contribution of young stars to the observed line emission. We provide formulae to derive bolometric luminosities from the [Oiii] luminosity. We find that the distributions of radio luminosities of OPARGs and OPIRGs are undistinguishable. On average, the black hole masses and stellar masses in OPIRGs are larger than in OPARGs. OPARGs show signs of some recent star formation. Plotting the OPARGs in the BPT diagram and comparing their distribution with that of the remaining galaxies, we find that there is a sub-family of very high excitation OPARGs at the top of the AGN wing. This group is slightly displaced towards the left of the rest of the AGN galaxies, suggesting a stronger ionizing radiation field with respect to the gas pressure. Only very-high excitation radio galaxies (VHERGs) have Eddington ratios higher than 0.01, which are canonically considered as the lower limit for the occurrence of radiative efficient accretion. If our estimates of the bolometric luminosities are correct, this means than only a small proportion of mainstream HERGs are indeed radiatively efficient.</description>

      <title>Kalkayotl 2.0 Bayesian phase-space modelling of star-forming regions, stellar associations, and open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Star-forming regions, stellar associations, and open clusters are fundamental stellar systems where predictions from star-formation theories can be robustly contrasted with observations. Aims: We aim to provide the astrophysical community with a free and open-source code to infer the phase-space (i.e. positions and velocities) parameters of stellar systems with $\lesssim$1000 stars based on \textit{Gaia} astrometry and possibly observed radial velocities. Methods: We upgrade an existing Bayesian hierarchical model and extend it to model 3D (positions) and 6D (positions and velocities) stellar coordinates and system parameters with a flexible variety of statistical models, including a linear velocity field. This velocity field allows for the inference of internal kinematics, including expansion, contraction, and rotation. Results: We extensively validated our statistical models using realistic simulations that mimic the properties of the \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3. We applied \textit{Kalkayotl} to $\beta$-Pictoris, the Hyades, and Praesepe, recovering parameter values compatible with those from the literature. In particular, we found an expansion age of $19.1\pm1.0$ Myr for $\beta$-Pictoris and rotational signal of $32\!\pm\!11\,\rm{m\,s^{-1}\,pc^{-1}}$ for the Hyades and that Praesepe's rotation reported in the literature comes from its periphery. Conclusions: The robust and flexible Bayesian hierarchical model that we make publicly available here represents a step forward in the statistical modelling of stellar systems. The products it delivers, such as expansion, contraction, rotation, and velocity dispersions, can be directly contrasted with predictions from star-formation theories.</description>

      <title>The Frequency and Mass-Ratio Distribution of Binaries in Clusters -- III: Probabilistic Generative Modelling of Six Young Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply probabilistic generative modelling of colour-magnitude diagrams to six young Galactic open star clusters and determine their mass functions, binary mass-ratio distributions, and the frequencies of binary stars. We find that younger clusters tend to exhibit a higher incidence of binaries than their older counterparts. The mass-ratio distribution is fairly flat for the clusters with one exception that exhibits a sharp increase for $q\gtrsim0.9$. The ratio of the number of cluster binaries for which $q&gt;0.75$ to the number of binaries for which $q&gt;0.5$ (referred to as $FQ_{75}$) ranges from $\sim0.4 - 0.8$. This metric increases with the binary-star frequency of a cluster, but declines with cluster age. This may be due to non-ionizing 3-body dynamical processing of a primordial population of close binaries with initial mass ratios, $q \simeq 1$.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Stellar and Gas Properties in NGC 628: Spatial Distributions, Radial Gradients, and Resolved Scaling Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on our previous research of multi-wavelength data from UV to IR, we employ spectroscopic observations of ionized gas, as well as neutral hydrogen gas obtained from the Five-hundred Meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), to explore the intrinsic processes of star formation and chemical enrichment within NGC 628. Our analysis focuses on several key properties, including gas-phase extinction, star formation rate (SFR) surface density, oxygen abundance, and H I mass surface density. The azimuthal distributions of these parameters in relation to the morphological and kinematic features of FAST H I reveal that NGC 628 is an isolated galaxy that has not undergone recent interactions. We observe a mild radial extinction gradient accompanied by a notable dispersion. The SFR surface density also shows a gentle radial gradient, characteristic of typical spiral galaxies. Additionally, we find a negative radial metallicity gradient of $-0.44$ dex $R_{25}^{-1}$, supporting the "inside-out" scenario of galaxy formation. We investigate the resolved Mass-Metallicity Relation (MZR) and the resolved Star Formation Main Sequence (SFMS) alongside their dependencies on the physical properties of both ionized and neutral hydrogen gas. Our findings indicate no secondary dependency of the resolved MZR on SFR surface density or H I mass surface density. Furthermore, we observe that gas-phase extinction and the equivalent width of H{\alpha} both increase with SFR surface density in the resolved SFMS.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Stellar Age-Velocity Spiral Pattern in NGC 4030</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The processes driving the formation and evolution of late-type galaxies (LTGs) continue to be a debated subject in extragalactic astronomy. Investigating stellar kinematics, especially when combined with age estimates, provides crucial insights into the formation and subsequent development of galactic discs. Post-processing of exceptionally high-quality Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) data of NGC 4030 acquired with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), clearly reveals a striking grand design spiral pattern in the velocity dispersion map not previously detected in other galaxies. This pattern spatially correlates with HII regions, suggesting that stars currently being born exhibit lower velocity dispersion as compared to surrounding areas where star formation (SF) is less active. We examine the age-velocity relation (AVR) and propose that its configuration might be shaped by a combination of heating mechanisms, seemingly consistent with findings from recent high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations. The complex structure of the uncovered AVR of NGC 4030 support the hypothesis that stellar populations initially inherit the velocity dispersion {\sigma} of the progenitor cold molecular gas, which depends on formation time and galactocentric distance, subsequently experiencing kinematic heating by cumulative gravitational interactions during their lifetime. While advancing our understanding of the AVR, these findings offer a new framework for investigating disk heating mechanisms, and their role in the evolution of galactic disks.</description>

      <title>Detecting clusters and groups of galaxies populating the local Universe in large optical spectroscopic surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-field cosmological surveys provide hundreds of thousands of spectroscopically confirmed galaxy groups and clusters, valuable for tracing baryonic matter distribution. However, controlling systematics in identifying host dark matter halos and estimating their properties is crucial. We evaluate three group detection methods on a simulated dataset replicating the GAMA selection to understand systematics and selection effects. This is key for interpreting data from SDSS, GAMA, DESI, WAVES, and leveraging optical catalogues in the (X-ray) eROSITA era to quantify baryonic mass in galaxy groups. Using a lightcone from the Magneticum hydrodynamical simulation, we simulate a spectroscopic galaxy survey in the local Universe (down to $z&lt;0.2$ and stellar mass completeness $M_{\star}\geq10^{9.8} M_{\odot}$). We assess completeness and contamination of reconstructed halo catalogues, evaluate membership accuracy, and analyse the halo mass recovery rate of group finders. All three group finders achieve high completeness ($&gt;80\%$) at group and cluster scales, confirming optical selection's suitability for dense regions. Contamination at low masses ($M_{200}&lt;10^{13} M_{\odot}$) arises from interlopers and fragmentation. Membership is at least 70\% accurate above the group mass scale, but inaccuracies bias halo mass estimates using galaxy velocity dispersion. Alternative proxies, like total stellar luminosity or mass, yield more accurate halo masses. The cumulative luminosity function of galaxy members matches predictions, showing the group finders' accuracy in identifying galaxy populations. These results confirm the reliability and completeness of spectroscopic catalogues produced by state-of-the-art group finders. This supports studies requiring large spectroscopic samples of galaxy groups and clusters, as well as investigations into galaxy evolution across diverse environments.</description>

      <title>Interaction between the Supernova Remnant W44 and the Infrared Dark Cloud G034.77-00.55: shock induced star formation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How Supernova Remnant (SNR) shocks impact nearby molecular clouds is still poorly observationally constrained. It is unclear if SNRs can positively or negatively affect clouds star formation potential. We have studied the dense gas morphology and kinematics toward the Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G034.77-00.55, shock-interacting with the SNR W44, to identify evidence of early stage star formation induced by the shock. We have used high-angular resolution N2H+(1-0) images across G034.77-00.55, obtained with ALMA. N2H+ is a well known tracer of dense and cold material, optimal to identify gas with the highest potential to harbour star formation. The N2H+ emission is distributed into two elongated structures, one toward the dense ridge at the edge of the source and one toward the inner cloud. Both elongations are spatially associated with well-defined mass-surface density features. The velocities of the gas in the two structures i.e., 38-41 km s-1 and 41-43 km s-1 are consistent with the lowest velocities of the J- and C-type parts of the SNR-driven shock, respectively. A third velocity component is present at 43-45.5 km s-1. The dense gas shows a fragmented morphology with core-like fragments of scales consistent with the Jeans lengths, masses $\sim$1-20 M$_{\odot}$, densities (n(H$_2$)$\geq$10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$) sufficient to host star formation in free-fall time scales (few 10$^4$ yr) and with virial parameters that hint toward possible collapse. The W44 driven shock may have swept up the encountered material which is now seen as a dense ridge, almost detached from the main cloud, and an elongation within the inner cloud, well constrained in both N2H+ emission and mass surface density. This shock compressed material may have then fragmented into cores that are either in a starless or pre-stellar stage. Additional observations are needed to confirm this scenario and the nature of the cores.</description>

      <title>The perils of stacking optically selected groups in eROSITA data. The Magneticum perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamical simulation predictions are often compared with observational data without fully accounting for systematics and biases specific to observational techniques. Using the magnetohydrodynamical simulation Magneticum, we generate mock eROSITA eRASS:4 data, combined with GAMA-like spectroscopic surveys and optically selected galaxy catalogs from the same light-cone, to analyze hot gas properties in galaxy groups via a stacking technique. This study aims to (i) incorporate observational systematics into predictions and (ii) evaluate the reliability of stacking techniques for determining average X-ray properties of galaxy groups. Our analysis provides X-ray emission predictions from Magneticum, including contributions from AGN, X-ray binaries (XRBs), and the Intra-Group Medium (IGM) as a function of halo mass, covering Milky Way (MW)-like groups to poor clusters. We find that AGN and XRBs dominate the X-ray surface brightness profiles of low-mass halos. The reliability of stacking techniques is tested by reproducing input X-ray surface brightness and electron density profiles, accounting for completeness and contamination of prior samples, miscentering of optical group centers, uncertainties in X-ray emissivity due to gas temperature and metallicity assumption, and systematics in halo mass proxies. The halo mass proxy emerges as the primary source of systematics, affecting X-ray surface brightness and scaling relations. We show that stacked X-ray luminosity-mass relations are flatter than input relations but consistent with observations. Additionally, the retrieved hot gas fraction-mass relation aligns well with observational data. These results highlight the need to account for systematic errors when comparing stacking techniques to other methods using different prior catalogs or predictions.</description>

      <title>The hot gas mass fraction in halos. From Milky Way-like groups to massive clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using eROSITA data in the eFEDS area, we provide a measure of the hot gas fraction vs. halo mass relation over the largest halo mass range, from Milky Way-sized halos to massive clusters, and to the largest radii ever probed so far in local systems. To cope with the incompleteness and selection biases of the X-ray selection, we apply the stacking technique in eROSITA data of a highly complete and tested sample of optically selected groups. The method has been extensively tested on mock observations. In massive clusters, the hot gas alone provides a baryon budget within $R_{200}$ consistent with the cosmic value. At the same time, at the group mass scale, it accounts only for 20-40% of it. The hot gas fraction vs. halo mass relation is well-fitted by a power law, with a consistent shape and a normalization varying at maximum by a factor of 2 from $r_{500}$ to $r_{200}$. Such a relation is consistent with other works in the literature that consider X-ray survey data at the same depth as eFEDS. However, it provides a lower average gas fraction in the group regime than works based on X-ray bright group samples. The comparison of the observed relation with the predictions of several hydrodynamical simulations (BAHAMAS, FLAMINGO, SIMBA, Illustris, IllustrisTNG, MillenniumTNG, and Magneticum) shows that all simulations but Magneticum and SIMBA overpredict the gas fraction, with the largest discrepancy (up to a factor of 3) in the massive group-poor cluster halo mass range. We emphasize the need for mechanisms that can effectively expel gas to larger radii in galaxy groups without excessively quenching star formation in their member galaxies. Current hydrodynamical simulations face a significant challenge in balancing their subgrid physics: none can sufficiently evacuate gas from the halo virial region without negatively impacting the properties of the resident galaxy population.</description>

      <title>Chemical enrichment in LINERs from MaNGA. I. Tracing Oxygen and Nitrogen Nuclear Abundances in LINERs with Varied Ionizing Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical enrichment in low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) is still an issue with spatial resolution spectroscopic data due to the lack of studies and the uncertainties in the nature of their ionizing source, despite being the most abundant type of active galaxies in the nearby Universe. Considering different scenarios for the ionizing source (hot old stellar populations, active galactic nuclei (AGN) or inefficient accretion disks), we analyze the implications of these assumptions to constrain the chemical content of the gas-phase interstellar medium (ISM). We used a sample of 105 galaxies from Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, whose nuclear central spaxels show LINER-like emission. For each scenario considered, we built a grid of photoionization models (4928 models for each considered ionizing source) which are later used in the open-source code HII-CHI-Mistry, allowing us to estimate chemical abundance ratios such as 12+log(O/H) or log(N/O) and constrain the ionization parameter that characterize the ionized ISM in those galaxies. We obtain that oxygen abundances in the nuclear region of LINER-like galaxies spread over a wide range 8.08 &lt; 12+log(O/H) &lt; 8.89, with a median solar value (in agreement with previous studies) if AGN models are considered. Nevertheless, the derived nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio is much less affected by the assumptions on the ionizing source, and point towards suprasolar values (log(N/O) = -0.69). By comparing the different analyzed scenarios, we show that if hot old stellar populations were responsible of the ionization of the ISM a complex picture (such as outflows and/or inflows scaling with galaxy chemical abundance) would be needed to explain the chemical enrichment history, whereas the assumption of AGN activity is compatible with the standard scenario found in most galaxies.</description>

      <title>Large-scale dual AGN in large-scale cosmological hydrodynamical simulations</title>

Abstract: Detecting dual active galactic nuclei (DAGN) in observations and understanding theoretically which massive black holes (MBHs) compose them and in which galactic and large-scale environment they reside are becoming increasingly important questions as we enter the multi-messenger era of MBH astronomy. This paper presents the abundance and properties of DAGN produced in nine large-scale cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We focus on DAGN powered by AGN with Lbol &gt; 1e43 erg/s and belonging to distinct galaxies, i.e. pairs that can be characterised with current and near-future electromagnetic observations. We find that the number density of DAGN separated by a few to 30 proper kpc varies from 1e-8 (or none) to 1e-3 comoving Mpc^3 in the redshift range z=0-7. At a given redshift, the densities of the DAGN numbers vary by up to two orders of magnitude from one simulation to another. However, for all simulations, the DAGN peak is in the range z=1-3, right before the peak of cosmic star formation or cosmic AGN activity. The corresponding fractions of DAGN (with respect to the total number of AGN) range from 0 to 6 percent. We find that simulations could produce too few DAGN at z=0 (or merge pairs too quickly) compared to current observational constraints while being consistent with preliminary constraints at high redshift (z = 3). Next-generation observatories (e.g., AXIS) will be of paramount importance to detect DAGN across cosmic times. We predict the detectability of DAGN with future X-ray telescopes and discuss DAGN as progenitors for future LISA gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Impacts of UV Radiation from an AGN on Planetary Atmospheres and Consequences for Galactic Habitability</title>

Abstract: We present a study of the effects of ultraviolet (UV) emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) on the atmospheric composition of planets and potential impact on life. It is expected that all supermassive black holes, which reside at galactic centers, have gone through periods of high AGN activity in order to reach their current masses. We examine potential damaging effects on lifeforms on planets with different atmosphere types and receiving different levels of AGN flux, using data on the sensitivity of various species' cells to UV radiation to determine when radiation becomes ``dangerous''. We also consider potential chemical changes to planetary atmospheres as a result of UV radiation from AGN, using the PALEO photochemical model. We find the presence of sufficient initial oxygen (surface mixing ratio $\geq 10^{-3} \rm\, mol/mol$) in the planet's atmosphere allows a thicker ozone layer to form in response to AGN radiation, which reduces the level of dangerous UV radiation incident on the planetary surface from what it was in absence of an AGN. We estimate the fraction of solar systems in galaxies that would be affected by AGN UV radiation, and find that the impact is most pronounced in compact galaxies such as ``red nugget relics'', as compared to typical present-day ellipticals and spirals (using M87 and the Milky Way as examples). Our work generally supports the Gaia hypothesis, where the development of life on a planet (and resulting oxygenation of the atmosphere) causes the environment to become more stable against potential extinction events in the future.</description>

      <title>tonalli: an asexual genetic code to characterise APOGEE-2 stellar spectra. I. Validation with synthetic and solar spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present tonalli, a spectroscopic analysis python code that efficiently predicts effective temperature, stellar surface gravity, metallicity, $\alpha$-element abundance, and rotational and radial velocities for stars with effective temperatures between 3200 and 6250 K, observed with the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2). tonalli implements an asexual genetic algorithm to optimise the finding of the best comparison between a target spectrum and the continuum-normalised synthetic spectra library from the Model Atmospheres with a Radiative and Convective Scheme (MARCS), which is interpolated in each generation. Using simulated observed spectra and the APOGEE-2 solar spectrum of Vesta, we study the performance, limitations, accuracy and precision of our tool. Finally, a Monte Carlo realisation was implemented to estimate the uncertainties of each derived stellar parameter. The ad hoc continuum-normalised library is publicly available on Zenodo (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.12736546).</description>

      <title>Chemical Links between a Young M-type T Tauri Star and its Substellar Companion: Spectral Analysis and C/O Measurement of DH Tau A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemical abundance measurements of host stars and their substellar companions provide a powerful tool to trace the formation mechanism of the planetary systems. We present a detailed high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of a young M-type star, DH Tau A, which is located in the Taurus molecular cloud belonging to the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. This star is host to a low-mass companion, DH Tau b, and both star and the companion are still in their accreting phase. We apply our technique (Hejazi et al. 2024) to measure the abundances of carbon and oxygen using carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules, such as CO and OH, respectively. We determine a near-solar carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratio of C/O=0.555$\pm$0.063 for the host star DH Tau A. We compare this stellar abundance ratio with that of the companion from our previous study (C/O=0.54$^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$, Xuan et al. 2024), which also has a near-solar value. This confirms the chemical homogeneity in the DH Tau system, which suggests a formation scenario for the companion consistent with a direct and relatively fast gravitational collapse, rather than a slow core accretion process.</description>

      <title>Beryllium: The smoking gun of a rejuvenated star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The chemistry and Galactic velocity components of the star HD 65907 suggest that despite its young isochronal age of $\sim$5 Gyr, it is in fact a merger of two old Population II stars. Its low Li abundance is also consistent with a mass accretion episode. Aims. We determine Li and Be abundances for this star and evaluate its radial velocity time series, activity cycle, and spectral energy distribution in search of clues regarding the origin of this enigmatic star. Methods. Li and Be abundances were determined via spectral synthesis of their resonance lines using HARPS and UVES spectra, respectively. HARPS data were also used to study variations in the star's radial velocity and activity levels. Photometric data were adopted to evaluate the stellar spectral energy distribution. Results. HD 65908 is severely Li- and Be-depleted. Its radial velocity is nearly constant ($\sigma =$ 2 m/s), with a small modulation likely associated with stellar activity, and the star shows no further signs of an undetected close companion. The excess infrared emission is consistent with a 30 K blackbody, which is interpreted as a debris disk surrounding the star. The post-merger mass, rotation rate, and evolution of this star are discussed. Conclusions. The low Li and Be abundances, in addition to the lack of evidence for a companion, are strong pieces of evidence in favor of the stellar merger scenario. In this context, Be can be used to confirm other blue stragglers among field solar-type stars, as proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Mean Free Path of HI Ionizing Photons at $3.2\leq z\leq4.6$ with DESI Y1 Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mean free path of ionizing photons for neutral hydrogen ($\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$) is a crucial quantity in modelling the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the extragalactic ultraviolet background (EUVB), and is widely used in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies and reionization. We construct the largest quasar spectrum dataset to date -- 12,595 $\mathrm{S/N}&gt;3$ spectra -- using the Y1 observation of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to make the most precise model-independent measurement of the mean free path at $3.2\leq z\leq 4.6$. By stacking the spectra in 17 redshift bins and modelling the Lyman continuum profile, we get a redshift evolution $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}\propto(1+z)^{-4.27}$ at $2\leq z\leq 5$, which is much shallower than previous estimates. We then explore the sources of systematic bias, including the choice of intrinsic quasar continuum, the consideration of Lyman series opacity and Lyman limit opacity evolution and the definition of $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$. Combining our results with estimates of $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$ at higher redshifts, we conclude at high confidence that the evolution in $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$ steepens at $z \approx 5$. We interpret this inflection as the transition from the end of HI reionization to a fully ionized plasma which characterizes the intergalactic medium of the past $\sim10$ billion years.</description>

      <title>Distribution models of antennas in radio astronomy: Efficiency comparison of the golden spiral interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work compares the performance of different antenna configurations in radio astronomy interferometry, including the golden spiral, a grid, a random arrangement, and the "Y" configuration similar to the Very Large Array. One hundred antennas are simulated in each configuration, and the resulting UV coverage and image quality are analyzed. The results show that the golden spiral provides more uniform UV coverage without significant gaps, which improves image quality by reducing sidelobes and artifacts. In comparison, the grid exhibits periodic structures in the UV coverage that can degrade image quality due to gaps and artifacts. The random arrangement offers more natural coverage but is less efficient in terms of resolution and sidelobe control. The "Y" configuration proves effective in achieving high resolution along its arms but lacks complete coverage in certain directions, which can negatively affect image quality at those angles. The self-similar nature of the golden spiral allows for efficient capture of both large and small structures in observed sources, maximizing the spatial information obtained. We conclude that, for applications where resolution and sensitivity are critical, the golden spiral represents the optimal configuration, followed by the "Y" configuration, with the grid being the least suitable.</description>

      <title>Diversity of Fuzzy Dark Matter Solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations, fuzzy dark matter (FDM) can form a stable equilibrium configuration, the so-called FDM soliton. In principle, given the FDM particle mass, the profile of FDM soliton is fixed. In practice, however, there is a great diversity of structures in the Universe. In this paper, we enumerate some possible causes of such diversity, such as the effects of the gravitoelectric field, the gravitomagnetic field, an extra denser and compact FDM soliton and an ellipsoidal baryon background. And we find that the effects of the gravitomagnetic field are very weak but the effects of the others are considerable.</description>

      <title>Ro-vibrational quenching calculations of C$_2^-$ in collision with H$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The molecular anion C$_2^-$ has been of interest in the last few years as a candidate for laser cooling due to its electronic structure and favourable branching ratios to the ground electronic and vibrational state. Molecular hydrogen has been used by the Wester group in Innsbruck as a buffer gas to cool the molecule's internal ro-vibrational motion. In the present work, we generate a new, five dimensional (5D) interaction potential for the system by considering the H$_2$ as a rigid rotor and the C$_2^-$ as a rotating-vibrating diatomic molecule. We thereafter calculate the cross sections and rate coefficients for ro-vibrational inelastic collisions of C$_2^-$ with both para- and ortho-H$_2$ on this new 5D \textit{ab initio} potential energy surface using quantum scattering theory for the dynamics. The rates for vibrational quenching are obtained over the range of temperatures which covers the single value measured by the experiments. A comparison is also made with the earlier results using a simpler 3D interaction potential. Furthermore, para-H$_2$ is found to be more efficient than ortho-H$_2$ (with or without undergoing rotational excitation) in cooling C$_2^-$. The rate coefficients for cooling the anions has been computed by appropriately weighting the ortho- and para-H$_2$ and compared with the available experimental result at 20 K. When the vibrational de-excitation rate coefficients are taken to be the ones not causing any concurrent rotational excitations in the final C$_2^-$ anions, the properly averaged results are found to get smaller and to become very close to the experimental measurements. The implications of these new results for laser cooling of C$_2^-$ are analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study we quantitatively examine the manner pulsar wind, supernova ejecta and defunct stellar wind materials distribute and melt together into plerions. We performed 2.5D MHD simulations of the entire evolution of their stellar surroundings and different scenarios are explored, whether the star dies as a red supergiant and Wolf Rayet supernova progenitors, and whether it moved with velocity 20 km/s or 40 km/s through the ISM. Within the post explosion, early 10 kyr, the H burning products rich red supergiant wind only mixes by &lt;= 20 per cent, due to its dense circumstellar medium filling the progenitor bow shock trail, still unaffected by the supernova blastwave. Wolf Rayet materials, enhanced in C, N, O elements, distribute circularly for the 35 Mo star moving at 20 km/s and oblongly at higher velocities, mixing efficiently up to 80 per cent. Supernova ejecta, filled with Mg, Si, Ca, Ti and Fe, remain spherical for longer times at 20 km/s but form complex patterns at higher progenitor speeds due to earlier interaction with the bow shock, in which they mix more efficiently. The pulsar wind mixing is more efficient for Wolf Rayet (25 per cent) than red supergiant progenitors (20 per cent). This work reveals that the past evolution of massive stars and their circumstellar environments critically shapes the internal distribution of chemical elements on plerionic supernova remnants, and, therefore, governs the origin of the various emission mechanisms at work therein. This is essential for interpreting multi-frequency observations of atomic and molecular spectral lines, such as in optical, infrared, and soft X rays.</description>

      <title>Non-linear saturation and energy transport in global simulations of magneto-thermal turbulence in the stratified intracluster medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The magneto-thermal instability (MTI) is one of many possible drivers of stratified turbulence in the intracluster medium (ICM) outskirts of galaxy clusters, where the background temperature gradient is aligned with the gravity. This instability occurs because of the fast anisotropic conduction of heat along magnetic field lines; but to what extent it impacts the ICM dynamics, energetics and overall equilibrium is still a matter of debate. Aims. This work aims at understanding MTI turbulence in an astrophysically stratified ICM atmosphere, its saturation mechanism, and its ability to carry energy and to provide non-thermal pressure support. Methods. We perform a series of 2D and 3D numerical simulations of the MTI in global spherical models of stratified ICM, thanks to the finite-volume code IDEFIX, using Braginskii-magnetohydrodynamics. We use volume-, shell-averaged and spectral diagnostics to study the saturation mechanism of the MTI, and its radial transport energy budget. Results. The MTI is found to saturate through a dominant balance between injection and dissipation of available potential energy, which amounts to marginalising the Braginskii heat flux but not the background temperature gradient itself. Accordingly, the strength and injection length of MTI-driven turbulence exhibit clear dependencies on the thermal diffusivity. The MTI drives cluster-size motions with Mach numbers up to $\mathcal{M} \sim 0.3$, even in presence of strong stable entropy stratification. We show that such mildly compressible flows can provide about $\sim 15\%$ of non-thermal pressure support in the outermost ICM regions, and that the convective transport itself is much less efficient than conduction at radially transporting energy. Finally, we show that the MTI saturation can be described by a diffusive mixing-length theory, shedding light on the diffusive buoyant nature of the instability.</description>

      <title>Optical monitoring in southern blazars. Analysis of variability and spectral colour behaviours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of the optical monitoring of 18 southern blazars in the V and R Johnson-Cousins bands. Our main objective is to study the variations in the optical flux and theis relationship with the colour and spectral variabilities. The optical observations were acquired with the 2.15 m "Jorge Sahade" telescope, CASLEO, Argentina.The whole campaign comprised from 2014 April to 2019 September. In addition, X-ray data were taken from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Swift/XRT databases, and gamma-ray data were taken from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope 3FGL catalogue. From the total of 18 blazars, we found variability in each one of the time-scales considired for 6 blazars (PKS 0208-512, PKS 1116-46, PKS 1440-389, PKS 1510-089, PKS 2005-489, and PKS 2155-304). In particular, from the colour-magnitude and the multiwavelength analysis, we found that PKS 1510-089 (flat-spectrum radio quasar) is undergoing an activity phase. For the case of PKS 2005-489 (BL Lac), this blazar is in a quiescent state, in which it has been for more than a decade, and it is compatible with its bluer-when-brighter moderate tendency, possibly due to the presence of shocks within the jet.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the kiloparsec-scale jets of nearby radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio galaxies have long been considered as potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Recent analyses of the UHECR spectrum, composition, and arrival directions indicate that the nearest radio galaxy, Centaurus A, could be linked to the reported dipole anisotropy, though the mechanism underlying the acceleration remains elusive. In this Letter, we explore UHECR acceleration in the kiloparsec-scale jets of radio galaxies, exemplified by Centaurus A. Using high-resolution relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic and test-particle simulations without sub-grid physics, we investigate the acceleration of the highest-energy particles in the turbulent sheath of a fast-moving jet. Our findings demonstrate that acceleration close to the maximum theoretical expectation is possible. When extrapolated to nearby radio galaxies, our results suggest that the kiloparsec-scale jets of Centaurus A could account for the dipole anisotropy in UHECRs, while more potent Fanaroff-Riley type II radio galaxies may account for the observed UHECR spectrum with a rigidity cutoff at a few Exavolts.</description>

We identify 30 out of the 130 galaxies with broad components of FWHM~200-700 km/s in the emission lines of H${\alpha}$ and [OIII] that trace ionized outflows, and find no excesses from the star-formation main sequence. Four out of the 30 outflowing galaxies are Type 1 AGN whose H${\alpha}$ emission lines include line profile components as broad as FWHM&gt;1000 km/s. With the velocity shift and line widths of the outflow broad lines, we obtain ~80-500 km/s for the outflow velocities. We find that the outflow velocities as a function of star-formation rate are comparable to or higher than those of galaxies at z~1, accounting for the selection bias, while the outflow velocities of AGN are large but not significantly different from the others. Interestingly, these outflow velocities are typically not high enough to escape from the galactic potentials, suggestive of fountain-type outflows, which are concluded on the basis of thorough comparisons with recent JWST results. We estimate mass loading factors ${\eta}$ to be 0.1-1 that are not particularly large, but comparable with those of z~1 outflows. The large fraction of galaxies with outflows (30% with high resolution data) provides constraints on outflow parameters, suggesting a wide opening angle of &gt;45 deg and a large duty-cycle of &gt;30%, which gives a picture of more frequent and spherical outflows in high-z galaxies.</description>

      <title>Feeding and feedback processes in the Spiderweb proto-intracluster medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the detailed analysis of the thermal, diffuse emission of the proto-intracluster medium (ICM) detected in the halo of the Spiderweb Galaxy at z=2.16, within a radius of $\sim$ 150 kpc. We combined deep X-ray data from Chandra and millimeter observations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect obtained by ALMA. Thanks to independent measurements of the pressure profile from ALMA SZ observation and the electron density profile from the available X-ray data, we derived, for the first time, the temperature profile in the ICM of a z&gt;2 protocluster. It reveals the presence of a strong cool core (comparable to the local ones) that may host a significant mass deposition flow, consistent with measured local star formation values. We also find mild evidence of an asymmetry in the X-ray surface brightness distribution, which may be tentatively associated with a cavity carved into the proto-ICM by the radio jets or, alternatively, may be due to the young dynamical status of the halo. The cooling time of baryons in the core of the Spiderweb Protocluster is estimated to be $\sim$ 0.1 Gyr, implying that the baryon cycle in the first stages of the protocluster formation is characterised by a high-duty cycle and a very active environment. In the case of the Spiderweb protocluster, we are witnessing the presence of a strongly peaked core that is possibily hosting a cooling flow with a mass deposition rate up to 250-1000 $M_{\odot}$/yr, responsible for feeding both the central supermassive black hole and the high star formation rate observed in the Spiderweb Galaxy. This phase is expected to be rapidly followed by active galactic nucleus feedback events, whose onset may have already left an imprint in the radio and X-ray appearance of the Spiderweb protocluster, eventually driving the ICM into a self-regulated, long-term evolution in less than one Gyr.</description>

      <title>Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE) VIII: Complex and Stochastic Metallicity Gradients at z &gt; 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gas-phase metallicity gradients are a crucial element in understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies. We use the FOGGIE simulations to study the metallicity gradients ($\nabla Z$) of six Milky Way-like galaxies throughout their evolution. FOGGIE galaxies generally exhibit steep negative gradients for most of their history, with only a few short-lived instances reaching positive slopes that appear to arise mainly from interactions with other galaxies. FOGGIE concurs with other simulation results but disagrees with the robust observational finding that flat and positive gradients are common at $z&gt;1$. By tracking the metallicity gradient at a rapid cadence of simulation outputs ($\sim 5$--10 Myr), we find that theoretical gradients are highly stochastic: the FOGGIE galaxies spend $\sim 30-50$\% of their time far away from a smoothed trajectory inferred from analytic models or other, less high-cadence simulations. This rapid variation makes instantaneous gradients from observations more difficult to interpret in terms of physical processes. Because of these geometric and stochastic complications, we explore non-parametric methods of quantifying the evolving metallicity distribution at $z &gt; 1$. We investigate how efficiently non-parametric measures of the 2-D metallicity distribution respond to metal production and mixing. Our results suggest that new methods of quantifying and interpreting gas-phase metallicity will be needed to relate trends in upcoming high-$z$ {\it JWST} observations with the underlying physics of gas accretion, expulsion, and recycling in early galaxies.</description>

      <title>Identifying Host Galaxies of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Found by PTAs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) present us with exciting opportunities for multi-messenger science. These systems are thought to form naturally in galaxy mergers and therefore have the potential to produce electromagnetic (EM) radiation as well as gravitational waves (GWs) detectable with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Once GWs from individually resolved SMBHBs are detected, the identification of the host galaxy will be a major challenge due to the ambiguity in possible EM signatures and the poor localization capability of PTAs. In order to aid EM observations in choosing which sources to follow up, we attempt to quantify the number of plausible hosts in both realistic and idealistic scenarios. We outline a host galaxy identification pipeline that injects a single-source GW signal into a simulated PTA dataset, uses production-level techniques to recover the signal, quantifies the localization region and number of galaxies contained therein, and finally imposes cuts on the galaxies using the binary parameters estimated from the GW search. In an ideal case, we find that the 90% credible areas span 29 deg^2 to 241 deg^2, containing about 14 to 341 galaxies. After cuts, the number of galaxies remaining ranges from 22 at worst to 1 (the true host) at best. In a more realistic case, if the signal is sufficiently localized, the sky areas range from 287 deg^2 to 530 deg^2 and enclose about 285 to 1238 galaxies. After cuts, the number of galaxies is 397 at worst and 27 at best. While the signal-to-noise ratio is the primary determinant of the localization area of a given source, we find that the size of the area is also influenced by the proximity of nearby pulsars on the sky and the chirp mass of the source.</description>

      <title>The radiative torque spin-up efficiency of ballistic dust grain aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims. Understanding the rotational dynamics of interstellar dust grains is quintessential for the analysis of the observed dust polarization signal. We aim to constrain the set of parameters for an accurate description of the rotational spin-up process of ballistic dust grain aggregates driven by radiative torques (RATs).
  Methods. We model the dust grains as complex fractal aggregates grown by the ballistic aggregation of uniform spherical particles (monomers) of different sizes. A broad variation of dust materials, shapes, and sizes are studied in the presence of different radiation sources.
  Results. We find that the canonical parametrization for the torque efficiency overestimates the maximal angular velocity $\omega_{\mathrm{RAT}}$ caused by RATs of grain aggregates, and to resolve this problem we propose a new parametrization which predicts $\omega_{\mathrm{RAT}}$ more accurately. We find that RATs are strongest for larger grains with smaller monomer-density, this manifests as size and monomer-density dependence in the constant part of the parametrization. Following the constant part, the parametrization has two power-laws with different slopes, which retain the universality for all grain sizes. The maximum grain rotation does not scale linearly with radiation strength, due to different drag mechanisms dominating depending on grain material and environment. The angular velocity $\omega_{\mathrm{RAT}}$ of individual single dust grains has a wide distribution and may even differ from the mean by up to two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Early Enrichment Population Theory at High Redshift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An Early Enrichment Population (EEP) has been theorized to produce the observed intracluster medium (ICM) metallicity of galaxy clusters. This population likely existed at high redshifts (z$\sim$10), relics of which we posit exist today as dwarf galaxies. Previous work argues that the initial mass function (IMF) of the EEP must be flatter than those found at lower redshifts, but with considerable uncertainties. In this work, we present a more quantitative model for the EEP and demonstrate how observational constraints can be applied to the IMF using supernova Type Ia (SN Ia) rates, delay time distribution (DTD), and the luminosity function (LF) of galaxy clusters. We determine best-fit values for the slope and mass break of the IMF by comparing IMFs from literature with observed DTDs, and the low-luminosity component ($M(R)&gt; -12$) of the Coma LF. We derive two best-fit IMFs, flatter than standard IMFs: (1) $\alpha_{lo} = -0.13 \pm 0.24$ for $0.07 &lt; M/M_\odot &lt; 1.75$ and $\alpha_{hi} = 0.53 \pm 0.01$ for $1.75 &lt; M/M_\odot &lt; 150$, and (2) $\alpha_{lo} = 1.06 \pm 0.11$ for $0.07 &lt; M/M_\odot &lt; 6$ and $\alpha_{hi} = 0.53 \pm 0.01$ for $6 &lt; M/M_\odot &lt; 150$. We compare these with \textit{sl-5} from \cite{Loew2013}, with $\alpha=0.5$ for $0.07 &lt; M/M_\odot &lt; 8$, and $\alpha=0.3$ for $8 &lt; M/M_\odot &lt; 150$. This EEP model, along with stars formed at later times, can produce the observed ICM metallicity, is consistent with observations, and predicts a significant rise in the SN Ia rate at increasing redshift.</description>

      <title>Ejective feedback as a quenching mechanism in the 1.5 billion years of the universe: detection of neutral gas outflow in a $z=4$ recently quenched galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The confirmation of massive quiescent galaxies emerging within the first billion years of the universe poses intriguing questions about the mechanisms of galaxy formation. There must be highly efficient processes at work to shut down star formation in galaxies at cosmic dawn. I present the detection of neutral outflowing gas in a massive recently quenched galaxy at $z=4$, showing ejective back as a quenching mechanism. Based on JWST spectrum, the star formation rate of this has been declining with a rapid e-folding timescale of $\sim50$ Myrs. The current specific star formation rate is $5\times10^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$, roughly 40 times lower than that of the star-forming main sequence at comparable redshifts. Emission line ratios of [NeIII]/[OII] and [OIII]/H$\beta$ are similar to AGN at comparable redshifts. A series of FeII and MgII absorption lines appear blueshifted by $\sim250$~km~s$^{-1}$ relative to the stellar continuum, suggesting an outflow of neutral gas. The estimated mass outflow rate is approximately 7 times greater than the star formation rate derived from the stellar continuum, implying that the suppression of star formation is likely due to gas being depleted by the outflow. If the emission lines are AGN-driven, the AGN can also provide sufficient energy to launch the outflow observed. This galaxy represents the most distant example of its kind known to date. This study offers a compelling explanation for the existence of massive quiescent galaxies in the first billion years of the universe.</description>

      <title>Deciphering spatially resolved Lyman-alpha profiles in reionization analogs: the Sunburst Arc at cosmic noon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10604v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hydrogen Lyman-alpha (Lya) emission line, the brightest spectral feature of a photoionized gas, is considered an indirect tracer of the escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons, particularly when the intergalactic medium is too opaque for direct detection. However, resonant scattering complicates interpreting the empirical properties of Lya photons, necessitating radiative transfer simulations to capture their strong coupling with underlying gas kinematics. In this study, we leverage the exceptional spatial resolution from strong gravitational lensing to investigate the connection between Lya line profiles and LyC leakage on scales of a few 100 pc in the Sunburst Arc galaxy at $z\sim2.37$. New optical echelle spectra obtained using Magellan MIKE show that both the LyC leaking and non-leaking regions exhibit a classic double-peak Lya feature with an enhanced red peak, indicating outflows at multiple locations in the galaxy. Both regions also show a central Gaussian peak atop the double peaks, indicating directly escaped Lya photons independent of LyC leakage. We introduce a machine learning-based method for emulating Lya simulations to quantify intrinsic dynamics ($\sigma_{\mathrm{int}}$), neutral hydrogen column density ($N_{\mathrm{HI}}$), outflow velocity ($v_{\mathrm{exp}}$), and effective temperature ($T$) across continuous parameter spaces. By comparing the spatially and spectrally resolved Lya lines in Sunburst, we argue that the directly escaped Lya photons originate in a volume-filling, warm ionized medium spanning $\sim1$ kpc, while the LyC leakage is confined to regions of $\lesssim200$ pc. These sub-kpc variations in Lya profiles highlight the complexity of interpreting integrated properties in the presence of inhomogeneous mixtures of gas and young stars, emphasizing the need for spatially and spectrally resolved observations of distant galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A moving mass makes a gravitational wake in the partially ionized interstellar medium, which acts as a lens for radio-frequency light. Consequently, plasma microlensing could complement gravitational microlensing in the search for invisible massive objects, such as stellar remnants or compact dark matter. This work explores the spatial structure of the plasma lens associated with a gravitational wake. Far away from the moving mass, the characteristic lensing signal is the steady demagnification or magnification of a radio source as the wake passes in front of it at the speed of sound. Sources can be plasma lensed at a much greater angular distance than they would be gravitationally lensed to the same degree by the same object. However, only the wakes of objects greatly exceeding stellar mass are expected to dominate over the random turbulence in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of five galaxy candidates at redshifts between $15.9&lt;z&lt;18.6$ in JWST observations from the GLIMPSE survey. These robust sources were identified using a combination of Lyman-break selection and photometric redshift estimates. The ultra-deep NIRCam imaging from GLIMPSE, combined with the strong gravitational lensing of the Abell S1063 galaxy cluster, allows us to probe an intrinsically fainter population (down to $M_{\rm UV}=-17.5$ mag) than previously achievable. These galaxies have absolute magnitudes ranging from $M_{\rm UV}= -17.7$ to $-18.0$ mag, with UV continuum slopes between $\beta \simeq -2.3$ and $\beta \simeq -3.0$, consistent with young, dust-free stellar populations. The number density of these objects, log$_{\rm 10}$ ($\phi$/[Mpc$^{-3}$ mag$^{-1}$])=$-3.43^{+0.28}_{-0.64}$ at $M_{\rm UV}=-18$ is in clear tension with pre-JWST theoretical predictions, extending the over-abundance of galaxies from $z\sim10$ to $z\sim 18.6$. These results, together with the scarcity of brighter galaxies in other public surveys, suggest a steep decline in the bright-end of the UV luminosity function at $z \sim 17$, implying efficient star formation and possibly a close connection to the halo mass function at these redshifts. Testing a variety of star formation histories suggests that these sources are plausible progenitors of the unusually UV-bright galaxies that JWST now routinely uncovers at $z = 10-14$. Overall, our results indicate that the luminosity distribution of the earliest star-forming galaxies could be shifting towards fainter luminosities, implying that future surveys of cosmic dawn will need to explore this faint luminosity regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1907.02528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectra emitted from ionized nebulae typically contain collisionally excited and recombination lines, which can be used to trace physical conditions and chemical abundances of the interstellar medium in our Galaxy and other galaxies. "AtomNeb" is a database containing atomic data stored in the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) file format, including the data for collisionally excited and recombination lines often observed in nebular astrophysics. The AtomNeb interface library is equipped with several application programming interface (API) functions developed in the Interactive Data Language (IDL), also usable in the GNU Data Language (GDL), and in the high-level, general-purpose programming language Python. The IDL library relies on the FITS file-related IDL procedures from the IDL Astronomy User's library, while the Python package depends on the Python packages Astropy and NumPy. The AtomNeb IDL library and the corresponding Python package, in conjunction with the "proEQUIB" IDL library and "pyEQUIB" Python package, respectively, can be used to perform plasma diagnostics and abundance analysis of emission lines from ionized gaseous nebulae.</description>

      <title>Once a Triple, Not Always a Triple: The Evolution of Hierarchical Triples that Yield Merged Inner Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: More than half of all main-sequence (MS) stars have one or more companions, and many of those with initial masses &lt;8 M$_\odot$ are born in hierarchical triples. These systems feature two stars in a close orbit (the inner binary) while a tertiary star orbits them on a wider orbit (the outer binary). In hierarchical triples, three-body dynamics combined with stellar evolution drives interactions and, in many cases, merges the inner binary entirely to create a renovated `Post-Merger Binary' (PMB). By leveraging dynamical simulations and tracking binary interactions, we explore the outcomes of merged triples and investigate whether PMBs preserve signatures of their three-body history. Our findings indicate that in 26-54% of wide double WD binaries (s&gt;100 au), the more massive white dwarf (WD) is a merger product, implying that these DWD binaries were previously triples. Overall, we estimate that $44\pm14\%$ of observed wide DWDs originated in triple star systems and thereby have rich dynamical histories. Additionally, our results suggest that the separations of inner and outer binaries are uncorrelated at birth, providing insights into stellar formation processes. We also examine MS+MS and MS+Red Giant mergers manifesting as Blue Straggler stars (BSSs). These PMBs have orbital configurations and ages similar to most observed BSS binaries. While the triple+merger formation channel can explain the observed chemical abundances, moderate eccentricities, and companion masses in BSS binaries, it likely only accounts for $\sim$20-25% of BSSs. Meanwhile, we predict that the majority of observed single BSSs formed as collisions in triples and harbor long-period (&gt;10 yr) companions. Furthermore, both BSS binaries and DWDs exhibit signatures of WD birth kicks.</description>

      <title>Hertzsprung gap stars in nearby galaxies and the Quest for Luminous Red Novae Progenitors</title>

Abstract: After the main sequence phase, stars more massive than 2.5 M$_\odot$ rapidly evolve through the Hertzsprung gap as yellow giants and supergiants (YSG), before settling into the red giant branch. Identifying YSG in nearby galaxies is crucial for pinpointing progenitors of luminous red novae (LRNe) - astrophysical transients attributed to stellar mergers. In the era of extensive transient surveys like the Vera Rubin Observatory's LSST, this approach offers a new way to predict and select common envelope transients. This study investigates potential progenitors and precursors of LRNe by analysing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry of stellar populations in galaxies within 20 Mpc to identify YSG candidates. Additionally, we use ZTF and MeerLICHT/BlackGEM to identify possible precursors, preparing for future observations by the LSST. We compiled a sample of 369 galaxies with HST exposures in the F475W, F555W, F606W, and F814W filters. We identified YSG candidates using MESA stellar evolution tracks and statistical analysis of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). Our sample includes 154,494 YSG candidates with masses between 3 and 20 $M_\odot$ and is affected by various contaminants, such as foreground stars and extinguished main-sequence stars. After excluding foreground stars using Gaia proper motions, contamination is estimated at 1\% from foreground stars and 20\% from extinction affecting main-sequence stars. Combining our YSG candidates with time-domain catalogs yielded several interesting candidates. Notably, we identified 12 LRN precursor candidates for which followup is encouraged. We highlight the importance of monitoring future transients that match YSG candidates to avoid missing potential LRNe and other rare transients. LSST will be a game changer in the search for LRN progenitors and precursors, discovering over 300,000 new YSG and 100 precursors within 20 Mpc.</description>

      <title>Mixed Warm Dark Matter Constraints using Milky Way Satellite Galaxy Counts</title>

Abstract: Warm dark matter has been strongly constrained in recent years as the sole component of dark matter. However, a less-explored alternative is that dark matter consists of a mixture of warm and cold dark matter (MWDM). In this work, we use observations of Milky Way satellite galaxies to constrain MWDM scenarios where the formation of small-scale structure is suppressed either by generic thermal relic warm dark matter or a sterile neutrino produced through the Shi-Fuller mechanism. To achieve this, we model satellite galaxies by combining numerical simulations with semi-analytical models for the subhalo population, and use a galaxy--halo connection model to match galaxies onto dark matter subhalos. By comparing the number of satellites predicted by MWDM models to the observed satellite population from the Dark Energy Survey and Pan-STARRS1, we constrain the fraction of warm dark matter, $f_{\rm WDM}$, as a function of its mass, $m_{\rm WDM}$. We exclude dark matter being composed entirely of thermal relic warm dark matter with $m_{\rm WDM} \leq 6.6 $ keV at a posterior ratio of 10:1, consistent with previous works. However, we find that warm dark matter with smaller mass is allowed when mixed with cold dark matter, and that the $f_{\rm WDM}$ constraints strengthen with decreasing $m_{\rm WDM}$ until they plateau at $f_{\rm WDM} \lesssim 0.45 $ for $m_{\rm WDM} \lesssim 1.5$ keV. Likewise, in the case of a sterile neutrino with mass of 7 keV produced through the Shi-Fuller mechanism, we exclude a fraction of $f_{\nu_s} \lesssim 0.45$, independent of mixing angle. Our results extend constraints on MWDM to a region of parameter space that has been relatively unconstrained with previous analysis.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Consequences of Black Holes in Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity: Shadows and Strong Gravitational Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the astrophysical consequences of black holes in asymptotically safe quantum gravity, characterized by the parameters $S_0$, $S_2$, $m_0$, and $m_2$, in addition to the black hole mass $M$. To evaluate the physical validity of the fundamental asymptotically safe theory of quantum gravity black hole solutions, we analyze their gravitational lensing properties in the strong field regime. Specifically, we examine the shadow cast by the asymptotically safe quantum gravity black hole and constrain its parameters using observational data from the M87* and Sgr A* supermassive black holes. Our analysis reveals that, within the $1\sigma$ confidence level, a significant portion of the parameter space for asymptotically safe quantum gravity black holes is consistent with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87* and Sgr A*. This suggests these black holes are plausible candidates for describing astrophysical black holes. As an additional observational test, we perform a detailed investigation of the strong gravitational lensing properties of these black holes. We explore the fundamental strong lensing observables in detail, including the angular positions and separations of the lensed images, the relative magnifications, the radius of the outermost Einstein ring, and the relativistic time delay between images. We compare the predictions of the asymptotically safe quantum gravity black hole for each observable with those of the classical Schwarzschild solution using realistic astrophysical data. Our findings provide a pathway for testing asymptotically safe quantum gravity at galactic and extragalactic scales, offering new insights into the observational properties of black hole solutions within this framework.</description>

      <title>Astronomaly Protege: Discovery Through Human-Machine Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern telescopes generate catalogs of millions of objects with the potential for new scientific discoveries, but this is beyond what can be examined visually. Here we introduce Astronomaly: Protege, an extension of the general purpose machine learning-based active anomaly detection framework Astronomaly. Protege is designed to provide well-selected recommendations for visual inspection, based on a small amount of optimized human labeling. The resulting sample contains rare or unusual sources which are simultaneously as diverse as the human trainer chooses, and of scientific interest to them. We train Protege on images from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey, leveraging the self-supervised deep learning algorithm Bootstrap Your Own Latent to find a low-dimensional representation of the radio galaxy cutouts. By operating in this feature space, Protege is able to recommend interesting sources with completely different morphologies in image space to those it has been trained on. This provides important advantages over similarity searches, which can only find more examples of known sources, or blind anomaly detection, which selects unusual, but not necessarily scientifically interesting sources. Using an evaluation subset, we show that, with minimal training, Protege provides excellent recommendations and find that it is even able to recommend sources that the authors missed. We briefly highlight some of Protege's top recommendations, which include X- and circular-shaped sources, filamentary structures and one-sided structures. These results illustrate the power of an optimized human-machine collaboration such as Protege to make unexpected discoveries in samples beyond human-accessible scales.</description>
