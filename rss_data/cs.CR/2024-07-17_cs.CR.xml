      <title>Toward Availability Attacks in 3D Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the great progress of 3D vision, data privacy and security issues in 3D deep learning are not explored systematically. In the domain of 2D images, many availability attacks have been proposed to prevent data from being illicitly learned by unauthorized deep models. However, unlike images represented on a fixed dimensional grid, point clouds are characterized as unordered and unstructured sets, posing a significant challenge in designing an effective availability attack for 3D deep learning. In this paper, we theoretically show that extending 2D availability attacks directly to 3D point clouds under distance regularization is susceptible to the degeneracy, rendering the generated poisons weaker or even ineffective. This is because in bi-level optimization, introducing regularization term can result in update directions out of control. To address this issue, we propose a novel Feature Collision Error-Minimization (FC-EM) method, which creates additional shortcuts in the feature space, inducing different update directions to prevent the degeneracy of bi-level optimization. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates the effectiveness of the FC-EM attack. Extensive experiments on typical point cloud datasets, 3D intracranial aneurysm medical dataset, and 3D face dataset verify the superiority and practicality of our approach.

      <title>Was it Slander? Towards Exact Inversion of Generative Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) requires a substantial investment of time and money. To get a good return on investment, the developers spend considerable effort ensuring that the model never produces harmful and offensive outputs. However, bad-faith actors may still try to slander the reputation of an LLM by publicly reporting a forged output. In this paper, we show that defending against such slander attacks requires reconstructing the input of the forged output or proving that it does not exist. To do so, we propose and evaluate a search based approach for targeted adversarial attacks for LLMs. Our experiments show that we are rarely able to reconstruct the exact input of an arbitrary output, thus demonstrating that LLMs are still vulnerable to slander attacks.</description>

      <title>MaPPing Your Model: Assessing the Impact of Adversarial Attacks on LLM-based Programming Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM-based programming assistants offer the promise of programming faster but with the risk of introducing more security vulnerabilities. Prior work has studied how LLMs could be maliciously fine-tuned to suggest vulnerabilities more often. With the rise of agentic LLMs, which may use results from an untrusted third party, there is a growing risk of attacks on the model's prompt. We introduce the Malicious Programming Prompt (MaPP) attack, in which an attacker adds a small amount of text to a prompt for a programming task (under 500 bytes). We show that our prompt strategy can cause an LLM to add vulnerabilities while continuing to write otherwise correct code. We evaluate three prompts on seven common LLMs, from basic to state-of-the-art commercial models. Using the HumanEval benchmark, we find that our prompts are broadly effective, with no customization required for different LLMs. Furthermore, the LLMs that are best at HumanEval are also best at following our malicious instructions, suggesting that simply scaling language models will not prevent MaPP attacks. Using a dataset of eight CWEs in 16 scenarios, we find that MaPP attacks are also effective at implementing specific and targeted vulnerabilities across a range of models. Our work highlights the need to secure LLM prompts against manipulation as well as rigorously auditing code generated with the help of LLMs.</description>

      <title>SemiAdv: Query-Efficient Black-Box Adversarial Attack with Unlabeled Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial attack has garnered considerable attention due to its profound implications for the secure deployment of robots in sensitive security scenarios. To potentially push for advances in the field, this paper studies the adversarial attack in the black-box setting and proposes an unlabeled data-driven adversarial attack method, called SemiAdv. Specifically, SemiAdv achieves the following breakthroughs compared with previous works. First, by introducing the semi-supervised learning technique into the adversarial attack, SemiAdv substantially decreases the number of queries required for generating adversarial samples. On average, SemiAdv only needs to query a few hundred times to launch an effective attack with more than 90% success rate. Second, many existing black-box adversarial attacks require massive labeled data to mitigate the difference between the local substitute model and the remote target model for a good attack performance. While SemiAdv relaxes this limitation and is capable of utilizing unlabeled raw data to launch an effective attack. Finally, our experiments show that SemiAdv saves up to 12x query accesses for generating adversarial samples while maintaining a competitive attack success rate compared with state-of-the-art attacks.</description>

      <title>Building Intelligence Identification System via Large Language Model Watermarking: A Survey and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into diverse industries, posing substantial security risks due to unauthorized replication and misuse. To mitigate these concerns, robust identification mechanisms are widely acknowledged as an effective strategy. Identification systems for LLMs now rely heavily on watermarking technology to manage and protect intellectual property and ensure data security. However, previous studies have primarily concentrated on the basic principles of algorithms and lacked a comprehensive analysis of watermarking theory and practice from the perspective of intelligent identification. To bridge this gap, firstly, we explore how a robust identity recognition system can be effectively implemented and managed within LLMs by various participants using watermarking technology. Secondly, we propose a mathematical framework based on mutual information theory, which systematizes the identification process to achieve more precise and customized watermarking. Additionally, we present a comprehensive evaluation of performance metrics for LLM watermarking, reflecting participant preferences and advancing discussions on its identification applications. Lastly, we outline the existing challenges in current watermarking technologies and theoretical frameworks, and provide directional guidance to address these challenges. Our systematic classification and detailed exposition aim to enhance the comparison and evaluation of various methods, fostering further research and development toward a transparent, secure, and equitable LLM ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Data Preprocessing and Hyperparameter Optimization on the Performance of Machine Learning Models Applied to Intrusion Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of cybersecurity of modern communications networks, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been continuously improved, many of them incorporating machine learning (ML) techniques to identify threats. Although there are researches focused on the study of these techniques applied to IDS, the state-of-the-art lacks works concentrated exclusively on the evaluation of the impacts of data pre-processing actions and the optimization of the values of the hyperparameters of the ML algorithms in the construction of the models of threat identification. This article aims to present a study that fills this research gap. For that, experiments were carried out with two data sets, comparing attack scenarios with variations of pre-processing techniques and optimization of hyperparameters. The results confirm that the proper application of these techniques, in general, makes the generated classification models more robust and greatly reduces the execution times of these models' training and testing processes.</description>

      <title>CICAPT-IIOT: A provenance-based APT attack dataset for IIoT environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a transformative paradigm that integrates smart sensors, advanced analytics, and robust connectivity within industrial processes, enabling real-time data-driven decision-making and enhancing operational efficiency across diverse sectors, including manufacturing, energy, and logistics. IIoT is susceptible to various attack vectors, with Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) posing a particularly grave concern due to their stealthy, prolonged, and targeted nature. The effectiveness of machine learning-based intrusion detection systems in APT detection has been documented in the literature. However, existing cybersecurity datasets often lack crucial attributes for APT detection in IIoT environments. Incorporating insights from prior research on APT detection using provenance data and intrusion detection within IoT systems, we present the CICAPT-IIoT dataset. The main goal of this paper is to propose a novel APT dataset in the IIoT setting that includes essential information for the APT detection task. In order to achieve this, a testbed for IIoT is developed, and over 20 attack techniques frequently used in APT campaigns are included. The performed attacks create some of the invariant phases of the APT cycle, including Data Collection and Exfiltration, Discovery and Lateral Movement, Defense Evasion, and Persistence. By integrating network logs and provenance logs with detailed attack information, the CICAPT-IIoT dataset presents foundation for developing holistic cybersecurity measures. Additionally, a comprehensive dataset analysis is provided, presenting cybersecurity experts with a strong basis on which to build innovative and efficient security solutions.</description>

      <title>Static Detection of Filesystem Vulnerabilities in Android Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filesystem vulnerabilities persist as a significant threat to Android systems, despite various proposed defenses and testing techniques. The complexity of program behaviors and access control mechanisms in Android systems makes it challenging to effectively identify these vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present PathSentinel, which overcomes the limitations of previous techniques by combining static program analysis and access control policy analysis to detect three types of filesystem vulnerabilities: path traversals, hijacking vulnerabilities, and luring vulnerabilities. By unifying program and access control policy analysis, PathSentinel identifies attack surfaces accurately and prunes many impractical attacks to generate input payloads for vulnerability testing. To streamline vulnerability validation, PathSentinel leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate targeted exploit code based on the identified vulnerabilities and generated input payloads. The LLMs serve as a tool to reduce the engineering effort required for writing test applications, demonstrating the potential of combining static analysis with LLMs to enhance the efficiency of exploit generation and vulnerability validation. Evaluation on Android 12 and 14 systems from Samsung and OnePlus demonstrates PathSentinel's effectiveness, uncovering 51 previously unknown vulnerabilities among 217 apps with only 2 false positives. These results underscore the importance of combining program and access control policy analysis for accurate vulnerability detection and highlight the promising direction of integrating LLMs for automated exploit generation, providing a comprehensive approach to enhancing the security of Android systems against filesystem vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>A2E: Attribute-based Anonymity-Enhanced Authentication for Accessing Driverless Taxi Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driverless vehicle as a taxi is gaining more attention due to its potential to enhance urban transportation efficiency. However, both unforeseen incidents led by unsupervised physical users' driverless taxi (DT) rides and personalized needs of users when riding in a DT necessitate the authentication of user identity and attributes. Moreover, safeguarding user identity privacy and quickly tracing malicious users if necessary to enhance the adoption of DTs remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel Attribute-based Anonymity Enhanced (A2E) authentication scheme for users to access DT service. From the security aspect, A2E has attribute verifiability, which is achieved by designing a user attribute credential based on redactable signature. Meanwhile, this attribute credential also satisfies unlinkability and unforgeability. In addition, A2E has enhanced anonymity, which is achieved by designing a decentralized credential issuance mechanism utilizing ring signature and secret sharing, safeguarding user attributes from association with anonymous identities. Moreover, this mechanism provides traceability and non-frameability to users. From the performance aspect, A2E causes low overhead when tracing malicious users and updating credentials. Besides, both scalability and lightweight are satisfied, which contributes to A2E's practicability. We conduct security analysis and performance evaluation to the security and performance capabilities of A2E.</description>

      <title>UNIT: Backdoor Mitigation via Automated Neural Distribution Tightening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated effectiveness in various fields. However, DNNs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which inject a unique pattern, called trigger, into the input to cause misclassification to an attack-chosen target label. While existing works have proposed various methods to mitigate backdoor effects in poisoned models, they tend to be less effective against recent advanced attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel post-training defense technique UNIT that can effectively eliminate backdoor effects for a variety of attacks. In specific, UNIT approximates a unique and tight activation distribution for each neuron in the model. It then proactively dispels substantially large activation values that exceed the approximated boundaries. Our experimental results demonstrate that UNIT outperforms 7 popular defense methods against 14 existing backdoor attacks, including 2 advanced attacks, using only 5\% of clean training data. UNIT is also cost efficient. The code is accessible at https://github.com/Megum1/UNIT.</description>

      <title>Cover-separable Fixed Neural Network Steganography via Deep Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image steganography is the process of hiding secret data in a cover image by subtle perturbation. Recent studies show that it is feasible to use a fixed neural network for data embedding and extraction. Such Fixed Neural Network Steganography (FNNS) demonstrates favorable performance without the need for training networks, making it more practical for real-world applications. However, the stego-images generated by the existing FNNS methods exhibit high distortion, which is prone to be detected by steganalysis tools. To deal with this issue, we propose a Cover-separable Fixed Neural Network Steganography, namely Cs-FNNS. In Cs-FNNS, we propose a Steganographic Perturbation Search (SPS) algorithm to directly encode the secret data into an imperceptible perturbation, which is combined with an AI-generated cover image for transmission. Through accessing the same deep generative models, the receiver could reproduce the cover image using a pre-agreed key, to separate the perturbation in the stego-image for data decoding. such an encoding/decoding strategy focuses on the secret data and eliminates the disturbance of the cover images, hence achieving a better performance. We apply our Cs-FNNS to the steganographic field that hiding secret images within cover images. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of visual quality and undetectability. Moreover, we show the flexibility of our Cs-FNNS in terms of hiding multiple secret images for different receivers.</description>

      <title>Enhancing TinyML Security: Study of Adversarial Attack Transferability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent strides in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have propelled the rise of TinyML, a paradigm enabling AI computations at the edge without dependence on cloud connections. While TinyML offers real-time data analysis and swift responses critical for diverse applications, its devices' intrinsic resource limitations expose them to security risks. This research delves into the adversarial vulnerabilities of AI models on resource-constrained embedded hardware, with a focus on Model Extraction and Evasion Attacks. Our findings reveal that adversarial attacks from powerful host machines could be transferred to smaller, less secure devices like ESP32 and Raspberry Pi. This illustrates that adversarial attacks could be extended to tiny devices, underscoring vulnerabilities, and emphasizing the necessity for reinforced security measures in TinyML deployments. This exploration enhances the comprehension of security challenges in TinyML and offers insights for safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring device dependability in AI-powered edge computing settings.</description>

      <title>MaskedHLS: Domain-Specific High-Level Synthesis of Masked Cryptographic Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and synthesis of masked cryptographic hardware implementations that are secure against power side-channel attacks (PSCAs) in the presence of glitches is a challenging task. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) is a promising technique for generating masked hardware directly from masked software, offering opportunities for design space exploration. However, conventional HLS tools make modifications that alter the guarantee against PSCA security via masking, resulting in an insecure RTL. Moreover, existing HLS tools can't place registers at designated places and balance parallel paths in a cryptographic design which is needed to stop glitch propagation. This paper introduces a domain-specific HLS approach tailored to obtain a PSCA secure masked hardware implementation directly from a masked software implementation. It places the registers at specific locations required by the glitch-robust masking gadgets, resulting in a secure RTL. Moreover, our tool automatically balances parallel paths and facilitates a reduction in latency while preserving the PSCA security guaranteed by masking. Experimental results with the PRESENT Cipher's S-box and AES Canright's S-box masked with four state-of-the-art gadgets, show that MaskedHLS produces RTLs with 73.9% decrease in registers and 45.7% decrease in latency on an average} compared to manual register insertions. The PSCA security of the MaskedHLS generated RTLs is also shown with TVLA test.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Covert Communication in Relay Systems Using Multi-Antenna Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper exploits the multi-antenna technique to enhance the covert communication performance in a relay system, where a source S conducts covert communication with a destination D via a relay R, subjecting to the detections of transmissions in the two hops from a single-antenna warden W. To demonstrate the performance gain from adopting the multi-antenna technique, we first consider the scenario when S, R and D all adopt single antenna, and apply hypothesis testing and statistics theories to develop a theoretical framework for the covert performance modeling in terms of detection error probability (DEP) and covert throughput. We then consider the scenario when S, R and D all adopt multiple antennas, and apply the hypothesis testing, statistics and matrix theories to develop corresponding theoretical framework for performance modeling. We further explore the optimal designs of the target rate and transmit power for covert throughput maximization under above both scenarios, subjecting to the constraints of covertness, reliability and transmit power. To solve the optimization problems, we employ Karushi-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions method in the single antenna scenario and a search algorithm in the multi-antenna scenario. Finally, we provide extensive numerical results to illustrate how the multi-antenna technique can enhance the covert performance in two-hop relay systems.</description>

      <title>Ascend-CC: Confidential Computing on Heterogeneous NPU for Emerging Generative AI Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud workloads have dominated generative AI based on large language models (LLM). Specialized hardware accelerators, such as GPUs, NPUs, and TPUs, play a key role in AI adoption due to their superior performance over general-purpose CPUs. The AI models and the data are often highly sensitive and come from mutually distrusting parties. Existing CPU-based TEEs such as Intel SGX or AMD SEV do not provide sufficient protection. Device-centric TEEs like Nvidia-CC only address tightly coupled CPU-GPU systems with a proprietary solution requiring TEE on the host CPU side. On the other hand, existing academic proposals are tailored toward specific CPU-TEE platforms.
  To address this gap, we propose Ascend-CC, a confidential computing architecture based on discrete NPU devices that requires no trust in the host system. Ascend-CC provides strong security by ensuring data and model encryption that protects not only the data but also the model parameters and operator binaries. Ascend-CC uses delegation-based memory semantics to ensure isolation from the host software stack, and task attestation provides strong model integrity guarantees. Our Ascend-CC implementation and evaluation with state-of-the-art LLMs such as Llama2 and Llama3 shows that Ascend-CC introduces minimal overhead with no changes in the AI software stack.</description>

      <title>Systematic Literature Review of AI-enabled Spectrum Management in 6G and Future Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has advanced significantly in various domains like healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity, with successes such as DeepMind's medical imaging and Tesla's autonomous vehicles. As telecommunications transition from 5G to 6G, integrating AI is crucial for complex demands like data processing, network optimization, and security. Despite ongoing research, there's a gap in consolidating AI-enabled Spectrum Management (AISM) advancements. Traditional spectrum management methods are inadequate for 6G due to its dynamic and complex demands, making AI essential for spectrum optimization, security, and network efficiency. This study aims to address this gap by: (i) Conducting a systematic review of AISM methodologies, focusing on learning models, data handling techniques, and performance metrics. (ii) Examining security and privacy concerns related to AI and traditional network threats within AISM contexts. Using the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology, we meticulously analyzed 110 primary studies to: (a) Identify AI's utility in spectrum management. (b) Develop a taxonomy of AI approaches. (c) Classify datasets and performance metrics used. (d) Detail security and privacy threats and countermeasures. Our findings reveal challenges such as under-explored AI usage in critical AISM systems, computational resource demands, transparency issues, the need for real-world datasets, imbalances in security and privacy research, and the absence of testbeds, benchmarks, and security analysis tools. Addressing these challenges is vital for maximizing AI's potential in advancing 6G technology.</description>

      <title>Backdoor Graph Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, graph condensation has emerged as a prevalent technique to improve the training efficiency for graph neural networks (GNNs). It condenses a large graph into a small one such that a GNN trained on this small synthetic graph can achieve comparable performance to a GNN trained on a large graph. However, while existing graph condensation studies mainly focus on the best trade-off between graph size and the GNNs' performance (model utility), the security issues of graph condensation have not been studied. To bridge this research gap, we propose the task of backdoor graph condensation. While graph backdoor attacks have been extensively explored, applying existing graph backdoor methods for graph condensation is not practical since they can undermine the model utility and yield low attack success rate.
  To alleviate these issues, we introduce two primary objectives for backdoor attacks against graph condensation: 1) the injection of triggers cannot affect the quality of condensed graphs, maintaining the utility of GNNs trained on them; and 2) the effectiveness of triggers should be preserved throughout the condensation process, achieving high attack success rate. To pursue the objectives, we devise the first backdoor attack against graph condensation, denoted as BGC. Specifically, we inject triggers during condensation and iteratively update the triggers to ensure effective attacks. Further, we propose a poisoned node selection module to minimize the influence of triggers on condensed graphs' quality. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack. BGC achieves a high attack success rate (close to 1.0) and good model utility in all cases. Furthermore, the results demonstrate our method's resilience against multiple defense methods. Finally, we conduct comprehensive studies to analyze the factors that influence the attack performance.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Framework for Adversarial Vulnerability in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work starts with the intention of using mathematics to understand the intriguing vulnerability observed by ~\citet{szegedy2013} within artificial neural networks. Along the way, we will develop some novel tools with applications far outside of just the adversarial domain. We will do this while developing a rigorous mathematical framework to examine this problem. Our goal is to build out theory which can support increasingly sophisticated conjecture about adversarial attacks with a particular focus on the so called ``Dimpled Manifold Hypothesis'' by ~\citet{shamir2021dimpled}. Chapter one will cover the history and architecture of neural network architectures. Chapter two is focused on the background of adversarial vulnerability. Starting from the seminal paper by ~\citet{szegedy2013} we will develop the theory of adversarial perturbation and attack.
  Chapter three will build a theory of persistence that is related to Ricci Curvature, which can be used to measure properties of decision boundaries. We will use this foundation to make a conjecture relating adversarial attacks. Chapters four and five represent a sudden and wonderful digression that examines an intriguing related body of theory for spatial analysis of neural networks as approximations of kernel machines and becomes a novel theory for representing neural networks with bilinear maps. These heavily mathematical chapters will set up a framework and begin exploring applications of what may become a very important theoretical foundation for analyzing neural network learning with spatial and geometric information. We will conclude by setting up our new methods to address the conjecture from chapter 3 in continuing research.</description>

      <title>Optimal Defender Strategies for CAGE-2 using Causal Modeling and Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CAGE-2 challenge is considered a standard benchmark to compare methods for autonomous cyber defense. Current state-of-the-art methods evaluated against this benchmark are based on model-free (offline) reinforcement learning, which does not provide provably optimal defender strategies. We address this limitation and present a formal (causal) model of CAGE-2 together with a method that produces a provably optimal defender strategy, which we call Causal Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning (C-POMCP). It has two key properties. First, it incorporates the causal structure of the target system, i.e., the causal relationships among the system variables. This structure allows for a significant reduction of the search space of defender strategies. Second, it is an online method that updates the defender strategy at each time step via tree search. Evaluations against the CAGE-2 benchmark show that C-POMCP achieves state-of-the-art performance with respect to effectiveness and is two orders of magnitude more efficient in computing time than the closest competitor method.</description>

      <title>SENTINEL: Securing Indoor Localization against Adversarial Attacks with Capsule Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for edge device powered location-based services in indoor environments, Wi-Fi received signal strength (RSS) fingerprinting has become popular, given the unavailability of GPS indoors. However, achieving robust and efficient indoor localization faces several challenges, due to RSS fluctuations from dynamic changes in indoor environments and heterogeneity of edge devices, leading to diminished localization accuracy. While advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in mitigating these phenomena, it remains an open problem. Additionally, emerging threats from adversarial attacks on ML-enhanced indoor localization systems, especially those introduced by malicious or rogue access points (APs), can deceive ML models to further increase localization errors. To address these challenges, we present SENTINEL, a novel embedded ML framework utilizing modified capsule neural networks to bolster the resilience of indoor localization solutions against adversarial attacks, device heterogeneity, and dynamic RSS fluctuations. We also introduce RSSRogueLoc, a novel dataset capturing the effects of rogue APs from several real-world indoor environments. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SENTINEL achieves significant improvements, with up to 3.5x reduction in mean error and 3.4x reduction in worst-case error compared to state-of-the-art frameworks using simulated adversarial attacks. SENTINEL also achieves improvements of up to 2.8x in mean error and 2.7x in worst-case error compared to state-of-the-art frameworks when evaluated with the real-world RSSRogueLoc dataset.</description>

      <title>Empirical Mean and Frequency Estimation Under Heterogeneous Privacy: A Worst-Case Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) is the current gold-standard for measuring privacy. Estimation problems under DP constraints appearing in the literature have largely focused on providing equal privacy to all users. We consider the problems of empirical mean estimation for univariate data and frequency estimation for categorical data, two pillars of data analysis in the industry, subject to heterogeneous privacy constraints. Each user, contributing a sample to the dataset, is allowed to have a different privacy demand. The dataset itself is assumed to be worst-case and we study both the problems in two different formulations -- the correlated and the uncorrelated setting. In the former setting, the privacy demand and the user data can be arbitrarily correlated while in the latter setting, there is no correlation between the dataset and the privacy demand. We prove some optimality results, under both PAC error and mean-squared error, for our proposed algorithms and demonstrate superior performance over other baseline techniques experimentally.</description>

      <title>Feature Inference Attack on Shapley Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a solution concept in cooperative game theory, Shapley value is highly recognized in model interpretability studies and widely adopted by the leading Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) providers, such as Google, Microsoft, and IBM. However, as the Shapley value-based model interpretability methods have been thoroughly studied, few researchers consider the privacy risks incurred by Shapley values, despite that interpretability and privacy are two foundations of machine learning (ML) models.
  In this paper, we investigate the privacy risks of Shapley value-based model interpretability methods using feature inference attacks: reconstructing the private model inputs based on their Shapley value explanations. Specifically, we present two adversaries. The first adversary can reconstruct the private inputs by training an attack model based on an auxiliary dataset and black-box access to the model interpretability services. The second adversary, even without any background knowledge, can successfully reconstruct most of the private features by exploiting the local linear correlations between the model inputs and outputs. We perform the proposed attacks on the leading MLaaS platforms, i.e., Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and IBM aix360. The experimental results demonstrate the vulnerability of the state-of-the-art Shapley value-based model interpretability methods used in the leading MLaaS platforms and highlight the significance and necessity of designing privacy-preserving model interpretability methods in future studies. To our best knowledge, this is also the first work that investigates the privacy risks of Shapley values.</description>

      <title>Cloud-based Semi-Quantum Money</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 1970s, Wiesner introduced the concept of quantum money, where quantum states generated according to specific rules function as currency. These states circulate among users with quantum resources through quantum channels or face-to-face interactions. Quantum mechanics grants quantum money physical-level unforgeability but also makes minting, storing, and circulating it significantly challenging. Currently, quantum computers capable of minting and preserving quantum money have not yet emerged, and existing quantum channels are not stable enough to support the efficient transmission of quantum states for quantum money, limiting its practicality. Semi-quantum money schemes support fully classical transactions and complete classical banks, reducing dependence on quantum resources and enhancing feasibility. To further minimize the system's reliance on quantum resources, we propose a cloud-based semi-quantum money (CSQM) scheme. This scheme relies only on semi-honest third-party quantum clouds, while the rest of the system remains entirely classical. We also discuss estimating the computational power required by the quantum cloud for the scheme and conduct a security analysis.</description>

      <title>Investigating Imperceptibility of Adversarial Attacks on Tabular Data: An Empirical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks are a potential threat to machine learning models, as they can cause the model to make incorrect predictions by introducing imperceptible perturbations to the input data. While extensively studied in unstructured data like images, their application to structured data like tabular data presents unique challenges due to the heterogeneity and intricate feature interdependencies of tabular data. Imperceptibility in tabular data involves preserving data integrity while potentially causing misclassification, underscoring the need for tailored imperceptibility criteria for tabular data. However, there is currently a lack of standardised metrics for assessing adversarial attacks specifically targeted at tabular data. To address this gap, we derive a set of properties for evaluating the imperceptibility of adversarial attacks on tabular data. These properties are defined to capture seven perspectives of perturbed data: proximity to original inputs, sparsity of alterations, deviation to datapoints in the original dataset, sensitivity of altering sensitive features, immutability of perturbation, feasibility of perturbed values and intricate feature interdepencies among tabular features. Furthermore, we conduct both quantitative empirical evaluation and case-based qualitative examples analysis for seven properties. The evaluation reveals a trade-off between attack success and imperceptibility, particularly concerning proximity, sensitivity, and deviation. Although no evaluated attacks can achieve optimal effectiveness and imperceptibility simultaneously, unbounded attacks prove to be more promised for tabular data in crafting imperceptible adversarial examples. The study also highlights the limitation of evaluated algorithms in controlling sparsity effectively. We suggest incorporating a sparsity metric in future attack design to regulate the number of perturbed features.</description>

      <title>TGIF: Text-Guided Inpainting Forgery Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital image manipulation has become increasingly accessible and realistic with the advent of generative AI technologies. Recent developments allow for text-guided inpainting, making sophisticated image edits possible with minimal effort. This poses new challenges for digital media forensics. For example, diffusion model-based approaches could either splice the inpainted region into the original image, or regenerate the entire image. In the latter case, traditional image forgery localization (IFL) methods typically fail. This paper introduces the Text-Guided Inpainting Forgery (TGIF) dataset, a comprehensive collection of images designed to support the training and evaluation of image forgery localization and synthetic image detection (SID) methods. The TGIF dataset includes approximately 80k forged images, originating from popular open-source and commercial methods; SD2, SDXL, and Adobe Firefly. Using this data, we benchmark several state-of-the-art IFL and SID methods. Whereas traditional IFL methods can detect spliced images, they fail to detect regenerated inpainted images. Moreover, traditional SID may detect the regenerated inpainted images to be fake, but cannot localize the inpainted area. Finally, both types of methods fail when exposed to stronger compression, while they are less robust to modern compression algorithms, such as WEBP. As such, this work demonstrates the inefficiency of state-of-the-art detectors on local manipulations performed by modern generative approaches, and aspires to help with the development of more capable IFL and SID methods.

      <title>Pseudorandom density matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudorandom states (PRSs) are state ensembles that cannot be distinguished from Haar random states by any efficient quantum algorithm. However, the definition of PRSs has been limited to pure states and lacks robustness against noise. In this work, we introduce pseudorandom density matrices (PRDMs), ensembles of $n$-qubit states that are computationally indistinguishable from the generalized Hilbert-Schmidt ensemble, which is constructed from $(n+m)$-qubit Haar random states with $m$ qubits traced out. For a mixedness parameter $m=0$, PRDMs are equivalent to PRSs, whereas for $m=\omega(\log n)$, PRDMs are computationally indistinguishable from the maximally mixed state. In contrast to PRSs, PRDMs with $m=\omega(\log n)$ are robust to unital noise channels and a recently introduced $\mathsf{PostBQP}$ attack. Further, we construct pseudomagic and pseudocoherent state ensembles, which possess near-maximal magic and coherence, but are computationally indistinguishable from states with zero magic and coherence. PRDMs can exhibit a pseudoresource gap of $\Theta(n)$ vs $0$, surpassing previously found gaps. We introduce noise-robust EFI pairs, which are state ensembles that are computationally indistinguishable yet statistically far, even when subject to noise. We show that testing entanglement, magic and coherence is not efficient. Further, we prove that black-box resource distillation requires a superpolynomial number of copies. We also establish lower bounds on the purity needed for efficient testing and black-box distillation. Finally, we introduce memoryless PRSs, a noise-robust notion of PRS which are indistinguishable to Haar random states for efficient algorithms without quantum memory. Our work provides a comprehensive framework of pseudorandomness for mixed states, which yields powerful quantum cryptographic primitives and fundamental bounds on quantum resource theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomized smoothing is a defensive technique to achieve enhanced robustness against adversarial examples which are small input perturbations that degrade the performance of neural network models. Conventional randomized smoothing adds random noise with a fixed noise level for every input sample to smooth out adversarial perturbations. This paper proposes a new variational framework that uses a per-sample noise level suitable for each input by introducing a noise level selector. Our experimental results demonstrate enhancement of empirical robustness against adversarial attacks. We also provide and analyze the certified robustness for our sample-wise smoothing method.</description>

      <title>IPA-NeRF: Illusory Poisoning Attack Against Neural Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) represents a significant advancement in computer vision, offering implicit neural network-based scene representation and novel view synthesis capabilities. Its applications span diverse fields including robotics, urban mapping, autonomous navigation, virtual reality/augmented reality, etc., some of which are considered high-risk AI applications. However, despite its widespread adoption, the robustness and security of NeRF remain largely unexplored. In this study, we contribute to this area by introducing the Illusory Poisoning Attack against Neural Radiance Fields (IPA-NeRF). This attack involves embedding a hidden backdoor view into NeRF, allowing it to produce predetermined outputs, i.e. illusory, when presented with the specified backdoor view while maintaining normal performance with standard inputs. Our attack is specifically designed to deceive users or downstream models at a particular position while ensuring that any abnormalities in NeRF remain undetectable from other viewpoints. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our Illusory Poisoning Attack, successfully presenting the desired illusory on the specified viewpoint without impacting other views. Notably, we achieve this attack by introducing small perturbations solely to the training set. The code can be found at https://github.com/jiang-wenxiang/IPA-NeRF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate shift-invariant vectorial Boolean functions on $n$~bits that are lifted from Boolean functions on $k$~bits, for $k\leq n$. We consider vectorial functions that are not necessarily permutations, but are, in some sense, almost bijective. In this context, we define an almost lifting as a Boolean function for which there is an upper bound on the number of collisions of its lifted functions that does not depend on $n$. We show that if a Boolean function with diameter $k$ is an almost lifting, then the maximum number of collisions of its lifted functions is $2^{k-1}$ for any $n$. Moreover, we search for functions in the class of almost liftings that have good cryptographic properties and for which the non-bijectivity does not cause major security weaknesses. These functions generalize the well-known map $\chi$ used in the Keccak hash function.</description>

      <title>There Are No Post-Quantum Weakly Pseudo-Free Families in Any Nontrivial Variety of Expanded Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a finite set of finitary operation symbols and let $\mathfrak V$ be a nontrivial variety of $\Omega$-algebras. Assume that for some set $\Gamma\subseteq\Omega$ of group operation symbols, all $\Omega$-algebras in $\mathfrak V$ are groups under the operations associated with the symbols in $\Gamma$. In other words, $\mathfrak V$ is assumed to be a nontrivial variety of expanded groups. In particular, $\mathfrak V$ can be a nontrivial variety of groups or rings. Our main result is that there are no post-quantum weakly pseudo-free families in $\mathfrak V$, even in the worst-case setting and/or the black-box model. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to families $(H_d\mathbin|d\in D)$ of computational and black-box $\Omega$-algebras (where $D\subseteq\{0,1\}^*$) such that for every $d\in D$, each element of $H_d$ is represented by a unique bit string of length polynomial in the length of $d$. In our main result, we use straight-line programs to represent nontrivial relations between elements of $\Omega$-algebras. Note that under certain conditions, this result depends on the classification of finite simple groups. Also, we define and study some types of weak pseudo-freeness for families of computational and black-box $\Omega$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Defining and Preventing Asymmetric Mempool DoS in Ethereum with saferAd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11721v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents secure mempool designs under asymmetric DoS attacks. We formulate safety definitions under two abstract DoSes, namely eviction- and locking-based attacks.
  We propose a safe transaction admission framework for securing mempools, named saferAd, that achieves both eviction- and locking-safety. The proven security stems from an upper bound of the attack damage under locking DoSes and a lower bound of the attack cost under eviction DoSes. The evaluation by replaying real transaction traces shows saferAd incurs negligible latency or insignificant change of validator revenue.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Federated Unlearning: Challenges, Methods, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20448v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the notion of ``the right to be forgotten" (RTBF) has become a crucial aspect of data privacy for digital trust and AI safety, requiring the provision of mechanisms that support the removal of personal data of individuals upon their requests. Consequently, machine unlearning (MU) has gained considerable attention which allows an ML model to selectively eliminate identifiable information. Evolving from MU, federated unlearning (FU) has emerged to confront the challenge of data erasure within federated learning (FL) settings, which empowers the FL model to unlearn an FL client or identifiable information pertaining to the client. Nevertheless, the distinctive attributes of federated learning introduce specific challenges for FU techniques. These challenges necessitate a tailored design when developing FU algorithms. While various concepts and numerous federated unlearning schemes exist in this field, the unified workflow and tailored design of FU are not yet well understood. Therefore, this comprehensive survey delves into the techniques and methodologies in FU providing an overview of fundamental concepts and principles, evaluating existing federated unlearning algorithms, and reviewing optimizations tailored to federated learning. Additionally, it discusses practical applications and assesses their limitations. Finally, it outlines promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Constructing a fully homomorphic encryption scheme with the Yoneda Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper redefines the foundations of asymmetric cryptography's homomorphic cryptosystems through the application of the Yoneda Lemma. It explicitly illustrates that widely adopted systems, including ElGamal, RSA, Benaloh, Regev's LWE, and NTRUEncrypt, directly derive from the principles of the Yoneda Lemma. This synthesis gives rise to a holistic homomorphic encryption framework named the Yoneda Encryption Scheme. Within this scheme, encryption is elucidated through the bijective maps of the Yoneda Lemma Isomorphism, and decryption seamlessly follows from the naturality of these maps. This unification suggests a conjecture for a unified model theory framework, providing a basis for reasoning about both homomorphic and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes. As a practical demonstration, the paper introduces an FHE scheme capable of processing arbitrary finite sequences of encrypted multiplications and additions without the need for additional tweaking techniques, such as squashing or bootstrapping. This not only underscores the practical implications of the proposed theoretical advancements but also introduces new possibilities for leveraging model theory and forcing techniques in cryptography to facilitate the design of FHE schemes.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Request: Harnessing HTTP Response Headers for Cross-Browser Web Tracker Classification in an Imbalanced Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The World Wide Web's connectivity is greatly attributed to the HTTP protocol, with HTTP messages offering informative header fields that appeal to disciplines like web security and privacy, especially concerning web tracking. Despite existing research employing HTTP request messages to identify web trackers, HTTP response headers are often overlooked. This study endeavors to design effective machine learning classifiers for web tracker detection using binarized HTTP response headers. Data from the Chrome, Firefox, and Brave browsers, obtained through the traffic monitoring browser extension T.EX, serves as our dataset. Ten supervised models were trained on Chrome data and tested across all browsers, including a Chrome dataset from a year later. The results demonstrated high accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and minimal log-loss error for Chrome and Firefox, but subpar performance on Brave, potentially due to its distinct data distribution and feature set. The research suggests that these classifiers are viable for web tracker detection. However, real-world application testing remains pending, and the distinction between tracker types and broader label sources could be explored in future studies.</description>

      <title>A Watermark-Conditioned Diffusion Model for IP Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ethical need to protect AI-generated content has been a significant concern in recent years. While existing watermarking strategies have demonstrated success in detecting synthetic content (detection), there has been limited exploration in identifying the users responsible for generating these outputs from a single model (owner identification). In this paper, we focus on both practical scenarios and propose a unified watermarking framework for content copyright protection within the context of diffusion models. Specifically, we consider two parties: the model provider, who grants public access to a diffusion model via an API, and the users, who can solely query the model API and generate images in a black-box manner. Our task is to embed hidden information into the generated contents, which facilitates further detection and owner identification. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Watermark-conditioned Diffusion model called WaDiff, which manipulates the watermark as a conditioned input and incorporates fingerprinting into the generation process. All the generative outputs from our WaDiff carry user-specific information, which can be recovered by an image extractor and further facilitate forensic identification. Extensive experiments are conducted on two popular diffusion models, and we demonstrate that our method is effective and robust in both the detection and owner identification tasks. Meanwhile, our watermarking framework only exerts a negligible impact on the original generation and is more stealthy and efficient in comparison to existing watermarking strategies.</description>

      <title>JailbreakBench: An Open Robustness Benchmark for Jailbreaking Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01318v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks cause large language models (LLMs) to generate harmful, unethical, or otherwise objectionable content. Evaluating these attacks presents a number of challenges, which the current collection of benchmarks and evaluation techniques do not adequately address. First, there is no clear standard of practice regarding jailbreaking evaluation. Second, existing works compute costs and success rates in incomparable ways. And third, numerous works are not reproducible, as they withhold adversarial prompts, involve closed-source code, or rely on evolving proprietary APIs. To address these challenges, we introduce JailbreakBench, an open-sourced benchmark with the following components: (1) an evolving repository of state-of-the-art adversarial prompts, which we refer to as jailbreak artifacts; (2) a jailbreaking dataset comprising 100 behaviors -- both original and sourced from prior work (Zou et al., 2023; Mazeika et al., 2023, 2024) -- which align with OpenAI's usage policies; (3) a standardized evaluation framework at https://github.com/JailbreakBench/jailbreakbench that includes a clearly defined threat model, system prompts, chat templates, and scoring functions; and (4) a leaderboard at https://jailbreakbench.github.io/ that tracks the performance of attacks and defenses for various LLMs. We have carefully considered the potential ethical implications of releasing this benchmark, and believe that it will be a net positive for the community.</description>

      <title>Learning to Break Deep Perceptual Hashing: The Use Case NeuralHash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06628v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Apple recently revealed its deep perceptual hashing system NeuralHash to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on user devices before files are uploaded to its iCloud service. Public criticism quickly arose regarding the protection of user privacy and the system's reliability. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive empirical analysis of deep perceptual hashing based on NeuralHash. Specifically, we show that current deep perceptual hashing may not be robust. An adversary can manipulate the hash values by applying slight changes in images, either induced by gradient-based approaches or simply by performing standard image transformations, forcing or preventing hash collisions. Such attacks permit malicious actors easily to exploit the detection system: from hiding abusive material to framing innocent users, everything is possible. Moreover, using the hash values, inferences can still be made about the data stored on user devices. In our view, based on our results, deep perceptual hashing in its current form is generally not ready for robust client-side scanning and should not be used from a privacy perspective.</description>

      <title>Ensure Differential Privacy and Convergence Accuracy in Consensus Tracking and Aggregative Games with Coupling Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16395v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address differential privacy for fully distributed aggregative games with shared coupling constraints. By co-designing the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) seeking mechanism and the differential-privacy noise injection mechanism, we propose the first GNE seeking algorithm that can ensure both provable convergence to the GNE and rigorous epsilon-differential privacy, even with the number of iterations tending to infinity. As a basis of the co-design, we also propose a new consensus-tracking algorithm that can achieve rigorous epsilon-differential privacy while maintaining accurate tracking performance, which, to our knowledge, has not been achieved before. To facilitate the convergence analysis, we also establish a general convergence result for stochastically-perturbed nonstationary fixed-point iteration processes, which lie at the core of numerous optimization and variational problems. Numerical simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Boosting the Transferability of Adversarial Attacks with Global Momentum Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding human-imperceptible perturbations to the benign inputs. Simultaneously, adversarial examples exhibit transferability across models, enabling practical black-box attacks. However, existing methods are still incapable of achieving the desired transfer attack performance. In this work, focusing on gradient optimization and consistency, we analyse the gradient elimination phenomenon as well as the local momentum optimum dilemma. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Global Momentum Initialization (GI), providing global momentum knowledge to mitigate gradient elimination. Specifically, we perform gradient pre-convergence before the attack and a global search during this stage. GI seamlessly integrates with existing transfer methods, significantly improving the success rate of transfer attacks by an average of 6.4% under various advanced defense mechanisms compared to the state-of-the-art method. Ultimately, GI demonstrates strong transferability in both image and video attack domains. Particularly, when attacking advanced defense methods in the image domain, it achieves an average attack success rate of 95.4%. The code is available at $\href{https://github.com/Omenzychen/Global-Momentum-Initialization}{https://github.com/Omenzychen/Global-Momentum-Initialization}$.</description>

      <title>PromptRobust: Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Large Language Models on Adversarial Prompts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04528v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs) across academia and industry necessitates a comprehensive understanding of their robustness to prompts. In response to this vital need, we introduce PromptRobust, a robustness benchmark designed to measure LLMs' resilience to adversarial prompts. This study uses a plethora of adversarial textual attacks targeting prompts across multiple levels: character, word, sentence, and semantic. The adversarial prompts, crafted to mimic plausible user errors like typos or synonyms, aim to evaluate how slight deviations can affect LLM outcomes while maintaining semantic integrity. These prompts are then employed in diverse tasks including sentiment analysis, natural language inference, reading comprehension, machine translation, and math problem-solving. Our study generates 4,788 adversarial prompts, meticulously evaluated over 8 tasks and 13 datasets. Our findings demonstrate that contemporary LLMs are not robust to adversarial prompts. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive analysis to understand the mystery behind prompt robustness and its transferability. We then offer insightful robustness analysis and pragmatic recommendations for prompt composition, beneficial to both researchers and everyday users.</description>

      <title>Gradients Look Alike: Sensitivity is Often Overestimated in DP-SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the canonical approach to private deep learning. While the current privacy analysis of DP-SGD is known to be tight in some settings, several empirical results suggest that models trained on common benchmark datasets leak significantly less privacy for many datapoints. Yet, despite past attempts, a rigorous explanation for why this is the case has not been reached. Is it because there exist tighter privacy upper bounds when restricted to these dataset settings, or are our attacks not strong enough for certain datapoints? In this paper, we provide the first per-instance (i.e., ``data-dependent") DP analysis of DP-SGD. Our analysis captures the intuition that points with similar neighbors in the dataset enjoy better data-dependent privacy than outliers. Formally, this is done by modifying the per-step privacy analysis of DP-SGD to introduce a dependence on the distribution of model updates computed from a training dataset. We further develop a new composition theorem to effectively use this new per-step analysis to reason about an entire training run. Put all together, our evaluation shows that this novel DP-SGD analysis allows us to now formally show that DP-SGD leaks significantly less privacy for many datapoints (when trained on common benchmarks) than the current data-independent guarantee. This implies privacy attacks will necessarily fail against many datapoints if the adversary does not have sufficient control over the possible training datasets.</description>

      <title>Did the Neurons Read your Book? Document-level Membership Inference for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With large language models (LLMs) poised to become embedded in our daily lives, questions are starting to be raised about the data they learned from. These questions range from potential bias or misinformation LLMs could retain from their training data to questions of copyright and fair use of human-generated text. However, while these questions emerge, developers of the recent state-of-the-art LLMs become increasingly reluctant to disclose details on their training corpus. We here introduce the task of document-level membership inference for real-world LLMs, i.e. inferring whether the LLM has seen a given document during training or not. First, we propose a procedure for the development and evaluation of document-level membership inference for LLMs by leveraging commonly used data sources for training and the model release date. We then propose a practical, black-box method to predict document-level membership and instantiate it on OpenLLaMA-7B with both books and academic papers. We show our methodology to perform very well, reaching an AUC of 0.856 for books and 0.678 for papers. We then show our approach to outperform the sentence-level membership inference attacks used in the privacy literature for the document-level membership task. We further evaluate whether smaller models might be less sensitive to document-level inference and show OpenLLaMA-3B to be approximately as sensitive as OpenLLaMA-7B to our approach. Finally, we consider two mitigation strategies and find the AUC to slowly decrease when only partial documents are considered but to remain fairly high when the model precision is reduced. Taken together, our results show that accurate document-level membership can be inferred for LLMs, increasing the transparency of technology poised to change our lives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used in societal applications, yet legal and privacy concerns demand that they very often be kept confidential. Consequently, there is a growing distrust about the fairness properties of these models in the minds of consumers, who are often at the receiving end of model predictions. To this end, we propose \name -- a system that uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs (a cryptographic primitive) to publicly verify the fairness of a model, while maintaining confidentiality. We also propose a fairness certification algorithm for fully-connected neural networks which is befitting to ZKPs and is used in this system. We implement \name in Gnark and demonstrate empirically that our system is practically feasible. Code is available at https://github.com/infinite-pursuits/FairProof.</description>

      <title>MeanCache: User-Centric Semantic Cache for Large Language Model Based Web Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Llama have revolutionized natural language processing and search engine dynamics. However, these models incur exceptionally high computational costs. For instance, GPT-3 consists of 175 billion parameters, where inference demands billions of floating-point operations. Caching is a natural solution to reduce LLM inference costs on repeated queries, which constitute about 31% of the total queries. However, existing caching methods are incapable of finding semantic similarities among LLM queries nor do they operate on contextual queries, leading to unacceptable false hit-and-miss rates. This paper introduces MeanCache, a user-centric semantic cache for LLM-based services that identifies semantically similar queries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache, the response to a user's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a local cache rather than re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service provider load, and environmental impact. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train a query similarity model without violating user privacy. By placing a local cache in each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces the latency and costs and enhances model performance, resulting in lower false hit rates. MeanCache also encodes context chains for every cached query, offering a simple yet highly effective mechanism to discern contextual query responses from standalone. Our experiments benchmarked against the state-of-the-art caching method, reveal that MeanCache attains an approximately 17% higher F-score and a 20% increase in precision during semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions while performing even better on contextual queries. It also reduces the storage requirement by 83% and accelerates semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions by 11%.</description>

      <title>Beyond Words: On Large Language Models Actionability in Mission-Critical Risk Analysis</title>

Abstract: Context. Risk analysis assesses potential risks in specific scenarios. Risk analysis principles are context-less; the same methodology can be applied to a risk connected to health and information technology security. Risk analysis requires a vast knowledge of national and international regulations and standards and is time and effort-intensive. A large language model can quickly summarize information in less time than a human and can be fine-tuned to specific tasks. Aim. Our empirical study aims to investigate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned LLM in Risk analysis. To our knowledge, no prior study has explored its capabilities in risk analysis. Method. We manually curated \totalscenarios unique scenarios leading to \totalsamples representative samples from over 50 mission-critical analyses archived by the industrial context team in the last five years. We compared the base GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models versus their Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned counterparts. We employ two human experts as competitors of the models and three other three human experts to review the models and the former human expert's analysis. The reviewers analyzed 5,000 scenario analyses. Results and Conclusions. HEs demonstrated higher accuracy, but LLMs are quicker and more actionable. Moreover, our findings show that RAG-assisted LLMs have the lowest hallucination rates, effectively uncovering hidden risks and complementing human expertise. Thus, the choice of model depends on specific needs, with FTMs for accuracy, RAG for hidden risks discovery, and base models for comprehensiveness and actionability. Therefore, experts can leverage LLMs for an effective complementing companion in risk analysis within a condensed timeframe. They can also save costs by averting unnecessary expenses associated with implementing unwarranted countermeasures.</description>

      <title>Wicked Oddities: Selectively Poisoning for Effective Clean-Label Backdoor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10825</link>

Abstract: Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, a type of adversarial attack that poisons the training data to manipulate the behavior of models trained on such data. Clean-label attacks are a more stealthy form of backdoor attacks that can perform the attack without changing the labels of poisoned data. Early works on clean-label attacks added triggers to a random subset of the training set, ignoring the fact that samples contribute unequally to the attack's success. This results in high poisoning rates and low attack success rates. To alleviate the problem, several supervised learning-based sample selection strategies have been proposed. However, these methods assume access to the entire labeled training set and require training, which is expensive and may not always be practical. This work studies a new and more practical (but also more challenging) threat model where the attacker only provides data for the target class (e.g., in face recognition systems) and has no knowledge of the victim model or any other classes in the training set. We study different strategies for selectively poisoning a small set of training samples in the target class to boost the attack success rate in this setting. Our threat model poses a serious threat in training machine learning models with third-party datasets, since the attack can be performed effectively with limited information. Experiments on benchmark datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our strategies in improving clean-label backdoor attacks.</description>
