      <title>Using Frame Randomization to Mitigate Errors in Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error mitigation is essential for near-term quantum devices, and one promising technique is frame randomization. This method inserts random twirling gates into a circuit to reduce errors while preserving unitarity and depth. We apply frame randomization to the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with $p=1$ on a superconducting quantum circuit system, demonstrating its potential to improve energy calculations. Specifically, we investigate the use of QAOA to calculate the lowest energy state of a frustrated Ising ring system and compare the results of randomized circuits generated using two different randomized techniques. Our results show that both methods can mitigate errors, with expected extremal energy values of $5.25\pm0.145$ and $4.08\pm0.36$, for Randomized Compilation and Pauli frame randomization respectively, compared to $2.63\pm0.068$ without randomization and $5.676\pm0.006$ with a noiseless simulator.</description>

      <title>Importance of Correlations for Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful variational ansatz for representing quantum many-body wave functions. Their internal mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. We investigate the role of correlations for NQS-like quantum state representation by employing a correlation-based interpretable neural network architecture and thereafter proving our observations based on Boolean function theory. The correlator neural network demonstrates that, even for simple product states, up to all system-size correlation orders in the chosen computational basis are required to represent a quantum state faithfully. We explain these observations using the Fourier expansion, which reveals the correlator basis as the effective basis of the internal NQS structure, the resulting necessity for high-order correlations, potential linear dependencies in constrained Hilbert spaces, and connections between spin basis-rotations and the correlator basis. Furthermore, we analyze how activation functions, network architectures, and choice of reference basis influence correlation requirements. Our results provide new insights and a better understanding of the internal structure and requirements of NQS, enabling a more systematic use of NQS in future research.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Quantum Thermal Machine: Harnessing Relativistic Effects to Surpass Carnot Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a three-level maser quantum thermal machine in which the system-reservoir interaction is modeled via Unruh-DeWitt type coupling, with one or both reservoirs undergoing relativistic motion relative to the working medium. Motion induces Doppler reshaping of the reservoir spectra, modifying energy-exchange rates and enabling operation beyond the Carnot efficiency at finite power. We numerically analyze families of efficiency-power curves and extract the analytic form of a generalized Carnot bound, which recovers the Carnot limit. In addition, Doppler reshaping alters the boundaries between heat-engine and refrigerator operation, making it possible to extract positive work even in the absence of a temperature gradient. These findings establish relativistic motion as a genuine thermodynamic resource.</description>

      <title>Flag at origin: a modular fault-tolerant preparation for CSS codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant (FT) preparation of diverse logical stabilizer states in quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes is essential for FT computation. Existing constructions of these FT circuits are often constrained by classical computational resources or result in unnecessarily large quantum circuits. This work introduces a modular construction for FT preparation circuits in CSS codes of arbitrary distance, yielding significantly more resource-efficient circuits than previous approaches, especially for the largest codes studied. The key insight is that in bipartite CX circuits used to prepare CSS states, $X$ errors propagate in one direction across the qubit partition, while $Z$ errors propagate in the opposite direction. By appending $X$-detecting flag gadgets to the first partition and $Z$-detecting flag gadgets to the second, the circuit becomes FT. To manage the associated overhead, we propose an algorithm that discovers optimal (or near-optimal) flag gadgets at any distance. These gadgets are reusable across different QEC codes and FT subroutines, such as flag-based QEC. We estimate the logical state preparation error using subset-sampling Monte Carlo simulations at the circuit level, combined with approximate maximum-likelihood look-up table decoding. On Quantinuum's H2-1 device, preparation of the $\lvert\bar{0}\rangle$ state in the [[23,1,7]] Golay code achieves a logical SPAM error rate of $3.3_{-2.4}^{+8.6} \times 10^{-4}$ with an acceptance rate of $47.23(86)\%$. This surpasses (within $95\%$ confidence intervals) the minimum SPAM error rate of $6.0(1.6) \times 10^{-4}$ for a physical $\lvert 0\rangle$, as well as the best previously demonstrated logical state preparations.</description>

      <title>Logical Error Rates for the Surface Code Under a Mixed Coherent and Stochastic Circuit-Level Noise Model Inspired by Trapped Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) on the horizon, it is critical to understand sources of logical error in plausible hardware implementations of quantum error-correcting codes (QECC). In this work, we consider logical error rates for the surface code implemented on a hypothetical grid-based trapped-ion quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture. Specifically, we construct logical channels for the idling surface code and examine its diamond error under a mixed coherent and stochastic circuit-level noise model inspired by trapped ions. We include the coherent dephasing noise that is known to accumulate during physical qubit idling and transport in these systems, determining idling and transport durations using the time-resolved output of the trapped-ion surface code compiler (TISCC). To estimate expectation values of logical Pauli observables following hardware circuits containing non-Clifford sources of noise, we utilize a Monte Carlo technique to sample from an underlying quasi-probability distribution of Clifford circuits that we independently simulate in a phase-sensitive fashion. We verify error suppression up to code distance $d=11$ at coherent dephasing rates near and below those of current-generation trapped-ion quantum computers and find that logical error rates align with those of analogous fully stochastic simulations in this regime. Exploring higher dephasing rates at $d=3-5$, we find evidence for growing coherent rotations about all three logical Pauli axes, increased diagonal logical error process matrix elements relative to those of stochastic simulations, and a reduced dephasing rate threshold. Overall, our work paves a way toward realistic hardware emulation of small fault-tolerant quantum processes, e.g., members of a FTQC instruction set.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimers -- a cryptic combination under prevailing theoretical models. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in Venus dimer circular dichroism (CD) spectra, revealing large negative dimer coupling energy, while antibunching was confirmed by antibunching-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To explain this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled here within a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of characteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations predict rapid decoherence, consistent with antibunching, indicating that coherence in both the excitonic and site bases is too short-lived to affect photon emission statistics. Despite the absence of long-lived coherence, Venus dimers provide a tractable platform for probing evolutionary pressures on fluorescent protein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling could extend coherence lifetimes into the regime required for quantum gate operations, suggesting a route toward fluorescent protein-based qubits. More broadly, the results highlight a structural design principle -- a "bioexciton motif" -- that links excitonic coupling, decoherence, and protein architecture, pointing to general rules by which biology both constrains and inspires quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A high-temperature limit penalizing high-frequency quantum fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Caldeira-Leggett model of quantum Brownian motion with Ohmic spectral density, and derive an additional contribution to the decoherence kernel in a new high-temperature limit at arbitrarily large cut-off frequency. This contribution reveals a novel mechanism for the classicalization of high-frequency quantum fluctuations. We further demonstrate that it leads to a Markovian master equation that is in guaranteed Lindblad form. Our approach considers in detail the behavior of the decoherence kernel at both the initial and final times of the process on the time scale of the bath memory.</description>

      <title>Strong Confinement of a Nanoparticle in a Needle Paul Trap: Towards Matter-Wave Interferometry with Nanodiamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle, can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in completely new regimes, as well as the interface between QM and GR, e.g., testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several paths are being pursued, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds as our particle, and a spin embedded in the nanodiamond together with Stern-Gerlach forces, to achieve a closed loop in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. In this work, we achieve strong confinement of a levitated particle, which is crucial for angular confinement, precise positioning, and perhaps also advantageous for deep cooling. We designed a needle Paul trap with a controllable distance between the electrodes, giving rise to a strong electric gradient. By combining it with an effective charging method - electrospray - we reach a trap frequency of up to 40 kHz, which is more than twice the state of the art. We believe that the designed trap could become a significant tool in the hands of the community working towards massive matter-wave interferometry. We would be happy to make more details available upon request.</description>

      <title>Non-representable quantum measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grade-$d$ measures on a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{A}\subseteq 2^X$ over a set $X$ are generalizations of measures satisfying one of a hierarchy of weak additivity-type conditions initially introduced as interference operators in quantum mechanics. Every signed polymeasure $\lambda$ on $(X,\mathcal{A})^d$ produces a grade-$d$ measure as its diagonal $\widetilde{\lambda}(A):=\lambda(A,\cdots,A)$, and we prove that as soon as $d\ge 2$ measures (as opposed to polymeasures) do not suffice: the separate $\sigma$-additivity of a $\lambda$ producing $\mu=\widetilde{\lambda}$ cannot, generally, be amplified to global $\sigma$-additivity. This amends a result in the literature, asserting the contrary in case $d=2$.</description>

      <title>Free-Particle State Realized via Optimal Filtering in Optomechanics: Implications for Gravity-Induced Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the conditional quantum state of a mechanical mirror in an optomechanical system under continuous measurement, feedback control, and quantum filtering. Our study identifies a regime in which the mirror's momentum is squeezed beyond the standard quantum limit achievable through appropriate tuning of the homodyne detection angle. We show that in this regime, optimal filtering effectively realizes a free-particle-like state. Notably, when applied to a setup involving two optomechanical systems, this phenomenon significantly boosts the signal of gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) because the momentum squeezing not only accentuates the difference between the common mode and the differential mode but, when the purity is high, also increases the position uncertainty due to the uncertainty principle, thereby enlarging the spatial extent of the superposition. Our results provide new insights into strategies for verifying the quantum nature of gravity using optomechanical platforms.</description>

      <title>Quasiprobability Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a quantum extension of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation where dynamical fluctuations are quantified by the Terletsky-Margenau-Hill quasiprobability, a quantum generalization of the classical joint probability. The obtained inequality plays a complementary role to existing quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations, focusing on observables' change rather than exchange of charges through jumps and respecting initial coherence. Quasiprobabilities show anomalous behaviors that are forbidden in classical systems, such as negativity; we reveal that such behaviors are necessary to reduce dissipation beyond classical limitations and show that they are stronger requirements than that the state has quantum coherence. To illustrate these statements, we employ a model that can exhibit a dissipationless heat current, which would be prohibited in classical systems; we construct a state that has much coherence but does not lead to a dissipationless current due to the absence of anomalous behaviors in quasiprobabilities.</description>

      <title>Stoquasticity is not enough: towards a sharper diagnostic for Quantum Monte Carlo simulability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are powerful tools for simulating quantum many-body systems, yet their applicability is limited by the infamous sign problem. We approach this challenge through the lens of Vanishing Geometric Phases (VGP) \cite{Hen_2021}, introducing it as a `geometric' criterion for diagnosing QMC simulability. We characterize the class of VGP Hamiltonians, and analyze the complexity of recognizing this class, identifying both hard and efficiently identifiable cases. We further highlight the practical advantage of the VGP criterion by exhibiting specific Hamiltonians that are readily identified as sign-problem-free through VGP, yet whose stoquasticity is difficult to ascertain. These examples underscore the efficiency and sharpness of VGP as a diagnostic tool compared to stoquasticity-based heuristics. Beyond classification, we propose a family of VGP-inspired diagnostics that serve as quantitative indicators of sign problem severity. While exact evaluation of these quantities is generically intractable, we demonstrate their mathematical power in performing scaling analysis for the average sign under unitary transformations. Our results provide both a conceptual foundation and practical tools for understanding and mitigating the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Finite-Dimensional Quantum Systems under the Fourth Law of Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Steepest Entropy Ascent (SEA) ansatz, recently recognized as the fourth law of thermodynamics, governs the irreversible evolution of a system from a non-equilibrium state toward a unique maximum-entropy equilibrium. SEA builds upon the second law to unify mechanics and thermodynamics. Due to its nonlinear nature, exact solutions to the SEA equation of motion are scarce. To address this, the Fixed Lagrange Multiplier (FLM) method is developed as an approximate analytical tool, applicable to both two-level and higher-dimensional quantum systems. Using quantum walks, a universal computation model, the study applies FLM to analyze and solve the SEA dynamics for single-component $N-$level systems. The approximate FLM solutions show strong agreement with full numerical simulations, particularly in regions of maximum entropy production consistent with SEA predictions. To extend SEA analysis to composite systems, especially two-qubit systems, the work provides a general framework for $N-$level Bloch vector parametrization. It includes analytical roots for $N=3$ and a complete parametrization for $N=4$, along with a method for analytically computing operator traces in this representation. Finally, the study examines the no-signaling condition in nonlinear quantum theories. While nonlinearity often implies faster-than-light signaling, the SEA framework inherently respects no-signaling. The equation of motion for both separable and entangled (e.g., Bell-diagonal) composites confirms that SEA maintains locality and provides a robust foundation for modeling decoherence in both open and closed quantum systems.

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Criticality-Enhanced Quantum Sensing with Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting quantum features allows for estimating external parameters with precisions well beyond the capacity of classical sensors, a phenomenon known as quantum-enhanced precision. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource for achieving such enhancements with respect to the probe size. However, they demand complex probe preparation and measurement and the achievable enhancement is ultimately restricted to narrow parameter regimes. On the other hand, non-equilibrium probes harness dynamics, enabling quantum-enhanced precision with respect to time over a wide range of parameters through simple probe initialization. Here, we unify these approaches through a Stark-Wannier localization platform, where competition between a linear gradient field and particle tunneling enables quantum-enhanced sensitivity across an extended parameter regime. The probe is implemented on a 9-qubit superconducting quantum device, in both single- and double-excitation subspaces, where we explore its performance in the extended phase, the critical point and the localized phase. Despite employing only computational-basis measurements we have been able to achieve near-Heisenberg-limited precision by combining outcomes at distinct evolution times. In addition, we demonstrate that the performance of the probe in the entire extended phase is significantly outperforming the performance in the localized regime. Our results highlight Stark-Wannier systems as versatile platforms for quantum sensing, where the combination of criticality and non-equilibrium dynamics enhances precision over a wide range of parameters without stringent measurement requirements.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Interpolating Quantum Transform: A Quantum-Native Framework for Efficient Transform Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning on quantum computers has attracted attention for its potential to deliver computational speedups in different tasks. However, deep variational quantum circuits require a large number of trainable parameters that grows with both qubit count and circuit depth, often rendering training infeasible. In this study, we introduce the Adaptive Interpolating Quantum Transform (AIQT), a quantum-native framework for flexible and efficient learning. AIQT defines a trainable unitary that interpolates between quantum transforms, such as the Hadamard and quantum Fourier transforms. This approach enables expressive quantum state manipulation while controlling parameter overhead. It also allows AIQT to inherit any quantum advantages present in its constituent transforms. Our results show that AIQT achieves high performance with minimal parameter count, offering a scalable and interpretable alternative to deep variational circuits.</description>

      <title>All incompatible sets of measurements can generate Buscemi nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of Bell-nonlocality in the correlations arising from measuring spatially-separated systems guarantees that the sets of measurements used are necessarily incompatible. Not all sets of incompatible measurements can however lead to Bell-nonlocality, as there exist incompatible sets of measurements which can only produce local correlations. In this work we prove that all sets of incompatible measurements are nevertheless able to generate nonlocality in an extended Bell scenario where quantum, instead of classical, measurement inputs are considered. In particular, this holds true for all incompatible-local sets of measurements and, consequently, shows that these sets of measurements posses a form of hidden nonlocality which can be revealed in such a scenario. We furthermore prove that the maximum amount of nonlocality that can be extracted in such a way is limited by the degree of incompatibility of the given set of measurements, thus effectively establishing an achievable upper bound. In order to obtain these results, we introduce a new object which we term a \emph{generalised set of measurements}, which provides a unifying way to study any scenario involving quantum inputs.</description>

      <title>Multi-player conflict avoidance through entangled quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to solve complex problems faster and more efficiently than classical computing. It can achieve speedups by leveraging quantum phenomena like superposition, entanglement, and tunneling. Quantum walks (QWs) form the foundation for many quantum algorithms. Unlike classical random walks, QWs exhibit quantum interference, leading to unique behaviors such as linear spreading and localization. These properties make QWs valuable for various applications, including universal computation, time series prediction, encryption, and quantum hash functions. One emerging application of QWs is decision making. Previous research has used QWs to model human decision processes and solve multi-armed bandit problems. This paper extends QWs to collective decision making, focusing on minimizing decision-conflict cases where multiple agents choose the same option, leading to inefficiencies like traffic congestion or overloaded servers. Prior research using quantum interference has addressed two-player conflict avoidance but struggled with three-player scenarios. This paper proposes a novel method using QWs to entirely eliminate decision conflicts in three-player cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in collective decision making.</description>

      <title>Preparation of Hamming-Weight-Preserving Quantum States with Log-Depth Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation is a critical task in quantum computing, particularly in fields such as quantum machine learning, Hamiltonian simulation, and quantum algorithm design. The depth of preparation circuit for the most general state has been optimized to approximately optimal, but the log-depth appears only when the number of ancillary qubits reaches exponential. Actually, few log-depth preparation algorithms assisted by polynomial ancillary qubits have been come up with even for a certain kind of non-uniform state. We focus on the Hamming-Weight-preserving states, defined as $|\psi_{\text{H}}\rangle = \sum_{\text{HW}(x)=k} \alpha_x |x\rangle$, which have leveraged their strength in quantum machine learning. Especially when $k=2$, such Hamming-Weight-preserving states correspond to simple undirected graphs and will be called graph-structured states. Firstly, for the $n$-qubit general graph-structured states with $m$ edges, we propose an algorithm to build the preparation circuit of $O(\log n)$-depth with $O(m)$ ancillary qubits. Specifically for the $n$-qubit tree-structured and grid-structured states, the number of ancillary qubits in the corresponding preparation circuits can be optimized to zero. Next we move to the preparation for the HWP states with $k\geq 3$, and it can be solved in $O(\log{{n \choose k}})$-depth using $O\left({n \choose k}\right)$ ancillary qubits, while the size keeps $O\big( {n \choose k} \big)$. These depth and size complexities, for any $k \geq 2$, exactly coincide with the lower bounds of $\Omega (\log{{n \choose k}})$-depth and $\Omega ({n \choose k})$-size that we prove lastly, which confirms the near-optimal efficiency of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Trace-Based Reconstruction of Quantum Circuit Dataflow in Surface Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical applications of quantum computing depend on fault-tolerant devices that employ error correction. A promising quantum error-correcting code for large-scale quantum computing is the surface code. For this code, Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) can be performed via lattice surgery, i.e. merging and splitting of encoded qubit patches on a 2D grid. Lattice surgery operations result in space-time patterns of activity that are defined in this work as access traces. This work demonstrates that the access traces reveal when, where, and how logical qubits interact. Leveraging this formulation, this work further introduces TraceQ, a trace-based reconstruction framework that is able to reconstruct the quantum circuit dataflow just by observing the patch activity at each trace entry. The framework is supported by heuristics for handling inherent ambiguity in the traces, and demonstrates its effectiveness on a range of synthetic fault-tolerant quantum benchmarks. The access traces can have applications in a wide range of scenarios, enabling analysis and profiling of execution of quantum programs and the hardware they run on. As one example use of TraceQ, this work investigates whether such traces can act as a side channel through which an observer can recover the circuit's structure and identify known subroutines in a larger program or even whole programs. The findings show that indeed the minimal access traces can be used to recover subroutines or even whole quantum programs with very high accuracy. Only a single trace per program execution is needed and the processing can be done fully offline. Along with the custom heuristics, advanced subgraph matching algorithms used in this work enable a high rate of locating the subroutines while executing in minimal time.</description>

      <title>Application of resource theory based on free Clifford+kT computation to early fault-tolerant quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum hardware are bringing fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) closer to reality. In the early stage of FTQC, however, the numbers of available logical qubits and high-fidelity $T$ gates remain limited, making it crucial to optimize the quantum resource usage. In this work, we aim to study the simulation cost of general quantum states under the constraint that only $k$ $T$ gates can be used, alongside an unlimited number of Clifford gates. Inspired by the notion of robustness of magic (RoM) which quantifies the cost of quantum-circuit simulation using stabilizer states ($k = 0$), we introduce its generalization, which we call Clifford+$kT$ robustness, treating Clifford+$kT$ states as free resources. We explore theoretical properties of Clifford$+kT$ robustness and in particular derive a lower bound that reveals the (in)efficiency of quantum-circuit simulation using Clifford$+kT$ states. Through numerical computations, we also evaluate Clifford+$kT$ robustness for key resource states for universal quantum computation, such as tensor products of the magic states. Our results allow to assess the sampling-cost reduction achieved by the use of Clifford+$kT$ states instead of stabilizer states, providing practical guidance for efficient resource usage in the early-FTQC era.</description>

      <title>On spurious fixed points in iterative maximum likelihood reconstruction for quantum tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum likelihood iteration is one of the most commonly used reconstruction algorithms in quantum tomography. The main appeal of the method is that it is easy to implement and that it converges reliably to a physically meaningful density matrix in practice. Contradicting these practical observations, we will show that convergence to a true solution is not guaranteed in general by constructing examples for spurious fixed points. To deal with this newly found problem, we then provide a criterion based on first order optimality conditions to check if the result of the algorithm is indeed the desired solution. Furthermore, we generalize the algorithm and show that it is equivalent to factorized gradient descent.</description>

      <title>From Chiral Topological Dynamics to Chiral Topological Amplification: Real vs Imaginary Parameters in a Hermitian Bosonic Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Hermitian quadratic bosonic model (QBH) whose dynamical matrix exhibits distinct topological and dynamical phenomena depending on whether the hopping and pairing amplitudes are real or purely imaginary. In the real-parameter regime, the dynamical matrix is unitarily equivalent to four decoupled copies of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (nSSH2) model, thereby inheriting its topological phases and energy spectrum-including the M\"obius phase, a gapless topological phase with fractional winding number, having no Hermitian counterpart. We show that the dynamics generated by the QBH Hamiltonian naturally reproduce non-Hermitian time evolution, without invoking nonlinear Schr\"odinger dynamics or ad hoc normalization. It is demonstrated by analytically calculating the Loschmidt amplitude and computing the dynamical topological order parameter under periodic boundary conditions, which displays a distinct chiral response in the M\"obius phase. In contrast, when the hopping and pairing terms are taken to be purely imaginary, the dynamical matrix becomes unitarily equivalent to a different version of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (nSSH1) model that supports only two topological phases: trivial and non-trivial, and the M\"obius phase disappears. The latter system exhibits sublattice-dependent chiral amplification under open boundary conditions. We show that this amplification arises from the non-trivial topology of the dynamical matrix, establishing a clear link between topological phase and amplification behavior in the imaginary-parameter regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled photon sources (EPS) are essential for quantum science and technology. Despite advancements in integrated optical platforms like thin-film lithium niobate, a scalable, high-performance, chip-scale EPS has remained elusive. We address this by demonstrating an electrically pumped, post-selection-free polarization-EPS, achieved through hybrid integration of a distributed feedback laser with thin-film lithium niobate chip which integrates periodically poled lithium niobate waveguides, beam splitter, and polarization rotator combiner. By injecting current into the chip, we realize a high-performance EPS with a bandwidth of 73 nm and an entanglement pair generation rate of 4.5*10^10 pairs/s/mW. The polarization entanglement shows Bell-state fidelities above 96% across frequency-correlated modes. This compact, integrated EPS enables key applications, including high-speed quantum key distribution via wavelength division multiplexing, satellite-based quantum communication, and entanglement-based quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Dirac, Schroedinger, and Maxwell equations in scalar and vector field quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum theory of relativistic particles, based on the first quantization technique similar to that used by Schroedinger and Dirac in formulating quantum mechanics, is reconsidered on the basis of a photon-like dispersion relation corresponding to the energy conservation equation of Einstein's special relativity. First, scalar quantum mechanics of particles operating with their wave functions is discussed. Using the first quantization of the photon-like dispersion relation, very simple new derivation of the Dirac equation is given. Then, vector field quantum mechanics is introduced, which defines vector fields associated with the relativistic particle. Basic equations for the vector-field quantum mechanics, similar to the source-free Maxwell equations, are derived. Following these equations, the particle's de Broglie wave can be considered as the transversal electromagnetic wave. Therefore, the wave-particle duality can be redefined as the electromagnetic wave-particle duality. Relationships between the scalar and vector field quantum mechanics are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-enhanced imaging through scattering media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering in complex media scrambles light, obscuring images and hindering applications ranging from astronomy to microscopy. While computational algorithms and wavefront shaping can, in principle, reverse this mixing by exploiting the near-linear nature of light propagation, in practice the inversion process is highly susceptible to limitations such as the finite number of controllable modes, noise, losses, and inaccuracies in the forward model. Consequently, these approaches are only effective under tightly controlled conditions, limiting their impact on real-world imaging. Here, we present a quantum entanglement-based approach that transmits images through complex media without inverting the scattering process. This method exploits a fundamental property of quantum entanglement: the preservation of photon correlations across multiple measurement bases. By tailoring the optical disorder induced by a scattering layer to access one such basis, entanglement-encoded images of arbitrary objects hidden behind the medium can be reconstructed via coincidence detection at the output. In contrast, classical imaging under identical conditions fails, producing only speckle patterns with no object information. Our work introduces a fundamentally new approach to imaging through complex media by leveraging the unique properties of quantum entanglement beyond simple optical correlations. This opens up new avenues for quantum-enhanced imaging and communication in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum reservoir computing induced by controllable damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing has emerged as a promising machine learning paradigm for processing temporal data on near-term quantum devices, as it allows for exploiting the large computational capacity of the qubits without suffering from typical issues that occur when training a variational quantum circuit. In particular, quantum gate-based echo state networks have proven effective for learning when the evolution of the reservoir circuit is non-unital. Nonetheless, a method for ensuring a tunable and stable non-unital evolution of the circuit was still lacking. We propose an algorithm for inducing damping by applying a controlled rotation to each qubit in the reservoir. It enables tunable, circuit-level amplitude amplification of the zero state, maintaining the system away from the maximally mixed state and preventing information loss caused by repeated mid-circuit measurements. The algorithm is inherently stable over time as it can, in principle, process arbitrarily long input sequences, well beyond the coherence time of individual qubits, by inducing an arbitrary damping on each qubit. Moreover, we show that quantum correlations between qubits provide an improvement in terms of memory retention, underscoring the potential utility of employing a quantum system as a computational reservoir. We demonstrate, through typical benchmarks for reservoir computing, that such an algorithm enables robust and scalable quantum random computing on fault-tolerant quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: We investigate High-Harmonic Generation (HHG) in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with electron-phonon coupling modeled via the Holstein interaction. The system dynamics are simulated using the tight-binding approximation, with local phonons approximated as quantum harmonic oscillators. Phononic degrees of freedom significantly expand the Hilbert space dimension. This interaction modifies the eigenenergy spectrum by introducing new states within previously existing gaps, enhancing the harmonic yield through additional allowed transitions.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity realisation of CNOT gate in Majorana-based optical platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the experimental realisation of a robust CNOT quantum gate using Majorana zero modes simulated on a photonic platform. Three Kitaev chains supporting Majorana zero modes at their endpoints are used to encode two logical qubits, and both intra-chain and inter-chain braiding operations are performed to implement the CNOT gate. While the topological encoding of quantum information in Majorana fermions does not offer full topological protection in our non-interacting photonic setting, it nevertheless exhibits a natural resilience to the dominant noise and decoherence effects present in the experiment. Consequently, the fidelity of the CNOT gate is significantly enhanced, surpassing 0.992 and addressing a key limitation in the path toward scalable quantum computation. These results represent a major advancement in topological quantum computing with Majorana fermions and underscore the potential of photonic platforms for realising high-fidelity quantum gates.</description>

Abstract: The paper introduces an efficient implementation of the Deutsch-Jozsa and Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm using the single-particle discrete-time quantum walk. We also provide a detailed optical framework with specific optical components to achieve these implementations in the photonic quantum walk scheme by simultaneously exploiting both polarization and path degrees of freedom.

      <title>Analytical bounds for decoy-state quantum key distribution with discrete phase randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols that rely on discrete phase randomization (DPR). For many QKD protocols that rely on weak coherent pulses (WCPs), continuous phase randomization is assumed, which simplifies the security proofs for such protocols. However, it is challenging to achieve such a perfect phase randomization in practice. As an alternative, we can select a discrete set of global phase values for WCPs, but we need to redo the security analysis for such a source. While security proofs incorporating DPR have been established for several QKD protocols, they often rely on computationally intensive numerical optimizations. To address this issue, in this study, we derive analytical bounds on the secret key generation rate of BB84 and measurement-device-independent QKD protocols in the DPR setting. Our analytical bounds closely match the results obtained from more cumbersome numerical methods in the regions of interest.</description>

      <title>Inserting Planar-Measured Qubits into MBQC Patterns while Preserving Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the one-way model of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), computation proceeds via single-qubit measurements on a resource state. Flow conditions ensure that the overall computation is deterministic in a suitable sense, and are required for efficient translation into quantum circuits. Procedures that rewrite MBQC patterns -- e.g. for optimisation, or adapting to hardware constraints -- thus need to preserve the existence of flow. Most previous work has focused on rewrites that reduce the number of qubits in the computation, or that introduce new Pauli-measured qubits. Here, we consider the insertion of planar-measured qubits into MBQC patterns, i.e. arbitrary measurements in a plane of the Bloch sphere spanned by a pair of Pauli operators; such measurements are necessary for universal MBQC. We extend the definition of causal flow, previously restricted to XY -measurements only, to also permit YZ-measurements and derive the conditions under which a YZ-insertion preserves causal flow. Then we derive conditions for YZ-insertion into patterns with gflow or Pauli flow, in which case the argument straightforwardly extends to XZ-insertions as well. We also show that the 'vertex splitting' or 'neighbour unfusion' rule previously used in the literature can be derived from YZ-insertion and pivoting. This work contributes to understanding the broad properties of flow-preserving rewriting in MBQC and in the ZX-calculus more broadly, and it will enable more efficient optimisation, obfuscation, or routing.</description>

      <title>String Diagrams for Defect-Based Surface Code Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface codes are a popular choice for implementing fault-tolerant quantum computing. Two-qubit gates may be realised in these codes using only nearest-neighbour interactions, either by lattice surgery or by braiding defects around each other. The effect of lattice surgery operations may be simply described using the ZX-calculus: a graphical language that has proven effective for program design and optimisation. In this work, we formalise a similar description via the ZX-calculus of defect braiding, as it is conventionally described. We define a graphical calculus KNOT, denoting the logical effects (in the absence of byproduct operations) of defect braiding in surface codes: we show how these effects may be described via a fragment of ZX-calculus which we call the (0, pi)-fragment. We then use a doubling construction to define a subtheory of KNOT, more specialised to standard encoding techniques in the defect braiding literature. Within this subtheory, we encompass standard braiding techniques by families of ribbon-like and tangle-like diagrams, each with semantics distinct from KNOT, in terms of the (0, pi)-fragment of ZX diagrams (again in the absence of byproducts). These subtheories may be used interoperably, and are each sound and complete for the (0, pi)-fragment of ZX diagrams. This provides a starting point to use the formal diagrammatics to analyse the operational effects of defect braiding procedures.</description>

      <title>A Classification Program for Nonlocality Paradoxes of Three Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocality is a quintessential signature of nonclassical behaviour and a resource for quantum advantages in communication and computation. The paradoxical correlations witnessed by strong nonlocality undergird the standard probabilistic form of nonlocality and provide optimal advantages in numerous informational tasks.
  Three-qubit systems are the simplest ones that admit strong nonlocality. Abramsky et al. (TQC, 2017) established the existence of an infinite family of three-qubit paradoxes, beyond the well-known GHZ paradox, which exhibited a novel conditional structure.
  In this work, we introduce several new infinite families of three-qubit paradoxes and articulate a detailed roadmap towards the complete classification of all three-qubit nonlocality paradoxes. In particular, we prove that our paradoxes exhaust all those satisfying reasonable regularity conditions. We give an example of a highly exotic paradox and place constraints on the search for new exotic paradoxes. We conjecture that all paradoxes must involve states from a one-parameter family and provide significant evidence in support of this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Contributions to the Theory of Clifford-Cyclotomic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n$ be a positive integer divisible by 8. The Clifford-cyclotomic gate set $\mathcal{G}_n$ consists of the Clifford gates, together with a $z$-rotation of order $n$. It is easy to show that, if a circuit over $\mathcal{G}_n$ represents a unitary matrix $U$, then the entries of $U$ must lie in $\mathcal{R}_n$, the smallest subring of $\mathbb{C}$ containing $1/2$ and $\mathrm{exp}(2\pi i/n)$. The converse implication, that every unitary $U$ with entries in $\mathcal{R}_n$ can be represented by a circuit over $\mathcal{G}_n$, is harder to show, but it was recently proved to be true when $n=2^k$. In that case, $k-2$ ancillas suffice to synthesize a circuit for $U$, which is known to be minimal for $k=3$, but not for larger values of $k$. In the present paper, we make two contributions to the theory of Clifford-cyclotomic circuits. Firstly, we improve the existing synthesis algorithm by showing that, when $n=2^k$ and $k\geq 4$, only $k-3$ ancillas are needed to synthesize a circuit for $U$, which is minimal for $k=4$. Secondly, we extend the existing synthesis algorithm to the case of $n=3\cdot 2^k$ with $k\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Trapping and cooling of nanodiamonds in a Paul trap under ultra-high vacuum: Towards matter-wave interferometry with massive objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in previously unexplored regimes. It also opens the possibility of probing the interface between QM and GR, such as testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several approaches are being explored, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds with embedded spins as test particles which, in combination with Stern-Gerlach forces, enable the realization of a closed-loop matter-wave interferometer in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. In this work we detail the trapping of a nanodiamond at 10^-8 mbar, which is good enough for the realization of a short-duration Stern-Gerlach interferometer. We describe in detail the cooling we have performed to sub-Kelvin temperatures, and demonstrate that the nanodiamond remains confined within the trap even under high-intensity 1560 nm laser illumination. We would be happy to make available more details upon request.</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation over thermal microwave network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communication in the microwave regime is set to play an important role in distributed quantum computing and hybrid quantum networks. However, typical superconducting quantum circuits require millikelvin temperatures for operation, which poses a significant challenge for largescale microwave quantum networks. Here, we present a solution to this challenge by demonstrating the successful quantum teleportation of microwave coherent states between two spatially-separated dilution refrigerators over a thermal microwave channel with a temperature of $4$ K. We distribute two-mode squeezed states over the noisy channel and employ the resulting quantum entanglement for quantum teleportation of coherent states with fidelities of $72.3 \pm 0.5 ~\%$ at $1$ K and $59.9 \pm 2.5 ~\%$ at $4$ K, exceeding the no-cloning and classical communication thresholds, respectively. We successfully model the teleportation protocol using a Gaussian operator formalism that includes losses and noise. This analysis shows that the teleportation infidelity mainly stems from a parasitic heating of the cold quantum nodes due to the hot network connection. Our results prove the experimental feasibility of distributed superconducting architectures and motivate practical applications of noisy quantum networks in various frequency regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle, can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in completely new regimes, as well as the interface between QM and GR, e.g., testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several paths are being pursued, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds as our particle, and a spin embedded in the ND together with Stern-Gerlach forces, to achieve a closed loop in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. In this work, we review current methods for loading nanodiamonds into a Paul trap, and their capabilities and limitations regarding our application. We also present our experiments on loading and launching nanodiamonds using a vibrating piezoelectric element and by electrical forces. Finally, we present our design of a novel nanodiamond loading method for ultra-high-vacuum experiments. As the production of highly accurate, high-purity nanodiamonds with a single NV required for interferometric measurements is expected to be expensive, we put emphasis on achieving high loading efficiency, while loading the charged ND into a Paul trap in ultra-high vacuum.</description>

      <title>Piecemaker: a resource-efficient entanglement distribution protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce multipartite entanglement distribution protocols that use a quantum switch to deliver stabilizer states to a number of remote end users. As in existing schemes, the first step in our protocols involves Bell pair generation between the switch and each end user. However, unlike existing schemes that wait for all Bell pairs to be established before distributing the desired state -- for example, via a projective measurement -- our approach stores only a minimal subset of Bell pairs while processing every subsequent Bell pair immediately. In doing so, our protocols reduce the average Bell pair storage time compared to existing schemes, resulting in less cumulative noise as a direct consequence. On the theoretical side, our protocol design is grounded in the structure of vertex covers in graph states up to local complementation. Through a comprehensive numerical evaluation, we compare the fidelities of delivered states with those of a baseline scheme, for state sizes up to n = 50 qubits. Simulations also show that our protocols can achieve the critical fidelity threshold of 1/2 for multipartite entanglement in a wider range of depolarization rates and success probabilities of Bell-pair generation. Overall, our protocols always achieve an equal or higher fidelity of the distributed state, and can reduce infidelity by up to 45%.</description>

      <title>Efficient nonclassical state preparation via generalized parity measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonclassical states of bosonic modes, especially the large number states, are valuable resources for quantum information processing and quantum metrology. However, it is intricate to apply unitary protocols to generate a desired Fock state due to the uniform energy spectrum of bosonic system. We here propose a measurement-based protocol that leverages the resonant Jaynes-Cummings interaction of the bosonic mode with an ancillary two-level atom and sequential projective measurements on the atom. Using the generalized parity measurement constructed by several rounds of free-evolution and measurement with proper intervals, we can efficiently filter out the unwanted population and push the target mode conditionally toward the desired Fock state. In ideal situation, a Fock state $|n_t\approx2000\rangle$ can be prepared with a fidelity over $98\%$ using only $8$ rounds of measurements. With qubit dissipation and dephasing and cavity decay in the current circuit QED platforms, a Fock state $|n_t\approx100\rangle$ can be prepared with a fidelity about $80\%$ by $6$ measurements. It is found that the number of the measurement rounds for preparing a large Fock state $|n_t\rangle$ scales roughly as $\log_2\sqrt{n_t}$, similar to the number of ancillary qubits required in the state preparation via the quantum phase estimation algorithm yet costs much less gate operations. Our protocol can also be used to prepare a large Dicke state $|J&lt;1000,0\rangle$ of a spin ensemble with a sufficiently high fidelity by less than $3$ measurements, which is qualified for the quantum Fisher information approaching the Heisenberg scaling in sensing the rotation phase along the $x$ axis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity control of one- and two-qubit gates past the error correction threshold is an essential ingredient for scalable quantum computing. We present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to find entangling protocols for semiconductor-based singlet-triplet qubits in a double quantum dot. Despite the presence of realistically modelled experimental constraints, such as various noise contributions and finite rise-time effects, we demonstrate that an RL agent can yield performative protocols, while avoiding the model-biases of traditional gradient-based methods. We optimise our RL approach for different regimes and tasks, including training from simulated process tomography reconstruction of unitary gates, and investigate the nuances of RL agent design.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Interplay Between Quantum Entanglement and Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement manifests as a distinctive correlation between particles that transcends classical boundaries when their quantum states cannot be described independently. On the other hand, as quantum systems interact with their surroundings, decoherence emerges, leading to the gradual decay of quantum coherence and entanglement. In the case of entanglement, this is known as entanglement sudden death (ESD). Decoherence mechanisms are examined, focusing on how various environmental factors, such as thermal, electromagnetic, and collisional decoherence, influence the integrity of entangled states. The role of quantum noise, such as amplitude damping, phase damping, and depolarizing, is also analyzed. By integrating theoretical insights with experimental findings, this study highlights the delicate balance between maintaining entanglement and mitigating decoherence. The findings have significant implications for the development of quantum technologies, including quantum computing and quantum communication, where preserving entanglement is crucial for achieving robust and reliable performance.</description>

      <title>Operational reconstruction of Feynman rules for quantum amplitudes via composition algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits an operational model presented in "Origin of complex quantum amplitudes and Feynman's rules", Phys. Rev. A 81 (2010), 022109 (P. Goyal, K. H. Knuth, J. Skilling) as part of the Quantum Reconstruction Program, describing transition amplitudes between measurements. Our methodology establishes clarity by separating axioms from mathematics, choices from physics, and deductions therefrom. We carefully evaluate the original model in a coordinate-independent way without requiring a two-dimensional space a priori. All scalar field and vector space axioms are traced from model axioms and observer choices, including additive and multiplicative units and inverses. Known theorems in math classify allowable amplitude algebras as the real associative composition algebras, namely, the two-dimensional (split-)complex numbers and the four-dimensional (split-)quaternions. Observed probabilities are quadratic in amplitudes, akin to the Born rule in physics. We point out select ramifications of postulated model axioms and ways to rephrase observer questions; and advertise broad utility of our work towards follow-on discovery, whether as a consequence, generalization, or alternative. One seemingly minute generalization is sketched in the outlook, with algebraic consequences at the heart of current open questions in mathematics and physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum mechanics, non-locality, and the space discreteness hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space discreteness hypothesis asserts that the nature of space at short distances is radically different from that at large distances. Based on the Bronstein inequality, here, we use a totally disconnected topological space $\mathcal{X}$ as a model for the space. However, we consider the time as a real variable. In this framework, the formalism of Dirac-von Neumann can be used. This discreteness hypothesis implies that given two different points in space, there is no continuous curve (a world line) joining them. Consequently, this hypothesis is not compatible with the theory of relativity. We propose $\mathbb{R}\times(\mathbb{R}\times\mathcal{X})^{3}$ as a model of a space-time. For simplicity, we work out our models using $\mathbb{R}\times(\mathbb{R}\times\mathcal{X})$ as the configuration space. Quantum mechanics (QM), in the sense of Dirac-von Neumann, on the Hilbert space $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}\times\mathcal{X})$ is a non-local theory: the Hamiltonians are non-local operators, and thus, spooky action at a distance is allowed. The paradigm asserting that the universe is non-locally real implies that the proposed version of QM admits realism. This version of QM can be specialized to standard QM by using Hamiltonians acting on wavefunctions supported on the region $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$. We apply the developed formalism to the measurement problem. We propose a new mechanism for the collapse of the wavefunction. The mechanism resembles the one proposed by Ghirardi, Ramini, and Weber, but there are significant differences. The most important feature is that the Schr\"{o}dinger equation describes the dynamics at all times, even at the moment of measurement. We also discuss a model for the two-slit experiment, where bright and dark states of light (proposed recently) naturally occur.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interference of Distinguishable Photons Based on Spatially-Resolved Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental results demonstrating the quantum interference of two photons distinguishable in their transverse momenta, each entering the input ports of a balanced beam splitter. This counterintuitive interference effect is made possible through spatially resolved measurements in the near field, i.e., by resolving the conjugate variable in which the photons are distinguishable. Our experimental findings agree with theoretical predictions. We contrast our results with a non-spatially resolved measurement where averaging over the photons' positions washes out the quantum interference observed in spatially resolved measurements.</description>

      <title>Power-Law Interactions Stabilize Time Crystals Realizing Quantum Energy Storage and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study discrete time-crystalline (DTC) phases in one-dimensional spin-1/2 chains with power-law interactions under periodic Floquet driving. By generalizing Stark localization to power-law interaction profiles, we identify robust period-doubled dynamics across a wide range of interaction exponents, stabilized by the interplay between coherent driving and spatially varying coupling. Within the DTC phase, the energy stored in the system, interpreted as a quantum battery, increases superlinearly with system size, although no scaling advantage persists in normalized power. Beyond energy storage, we demonstrate that the DTC phase supports enhanced quantum sensing. The quantum Fisher information associated with estimating timing deviations in the drive scales superextensively with system size, surpassing the Heisenberg limit. The degree of quantum advantage can be tuned by varying the interaction exponent, though DTC behavior remains robust throughout. Our results position power-law interacting Floquet systems as robust platforms for storing quantum energy and achieving metrological enhancement.</description>

      <title>Single-click protocols for remote state preparation using weak coherent pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote state preparation (RSP) allows one party to remotely prepare a known quantum state on another party's qubit using entanglement. This can be used in quantum networks to perform applications such as blind quantum computing or long-distance quantum key distribution (QKD) with quantum repeaters. Devices to perform RSP, referred to as a client, ideally have low hardware requirements, such as only sending photonic qubits. A weak coherent pulse source offers a practical alternative to true single-photon sources and is already widely used in QKD. Here, we introduce two new protocols to the previously known protocol for RSP with a weak-coherent-pulse-based device. The known technique uses a double-click (DC) protocol, where a photon from both the server and the client needs to reach an intermediate Bell state measurement. Here, we add to that a single-click (SC) RSP protocol, which requires only one photon to reach the Bell state measurement, allowing for better performance in certain regimes. In addition, we introduce a double-single-click (DSC) protocol, where the SC protocol is repeated twice, and a CNOT gate is applied between the resulting qubits. DSC mitigates the need for phase stabilization in certain regimes, lowering technical complexity while still improving performance compared to DC in some regimes. We compare these protocols in terms of fidelity and rate, finding that SC consistently achieves higher rates than DC and, interestingly, does not suffer from an inherently lower fidelity than the DC, as is the case for entanglement generation. Although SC provides stronger performance, DSC can still show performance improvements over DC, and it may have reduced technical complexity compared to SC. Lastly, we show how these protocols can be used in long-distance QKD using quantum repeaters.</description>

      <title>Q-BEAST: A Practical Course on Experimental Evaluation and Characterization of Quantum Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) promises to be a transformative technology with impact on various application domains, such as optimization, cryptography, and material science. However, the technology has a sharp learning curve, and practical evaluation and characterization of quantum systems remains complex and challenging, particularly for students and newcomers from computer science to the field of quantum computing. To address this educational gap, we introduce Q-BEAST, a practical course designed to provide structured training in the experimental analysis of quantum computing systems. Q-BEAST offers a curriculum that combines foundational concepts in quantum computing with practical methodologies and use cases for benchmarking and performance evaluation on actual quantum systems. Through theoretical instruction and hands-on experimentation, students gain experience in assessing the advantages and limitations of real quantum technologies. With that, Q-BEAST supports the education of a future generation of quantum computing users and developers. Furthermore, it also explicitly promotes a deeper integration of High Performance Computing (HPC) and QC in research and education.</description>

      <title>Matrix Product Operator Constructions for Gauge Theories in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general method for simulating lattice gauge theories in low dimensions using infinite matrix product states (iMPS). A central challenge in Hamiltonian formulations of gauge theories is the unbounded local Hilbert space associated with gauge degrees of freedom. In one spatial dimension, Gauss's law permits these gauge fields to be integrated out, yielding an effective Hamiltonian with long-range interactions among matter fields. We construct efficient matrix product operator (MPO) representations of these Hamiltonians directly in the thermodynamic limit. Our formulation naturally includes background fields and $\theta$-terms, requiring no modifications to the standard iDMRG algorithm. This provides a broadly applicable framework for 1+1D gauge theories and can be extended to quasi-two-dimensional geometries such as infinite cylinders, where tensor-network methods remain tractable. As a benchmark, we apply our construction to the Schwinger model, reproducing expected features including confinement, string breaking, and the critical behavior at finite mass. Because the method alters only the MPO structure, it can be incorporated with little effort into a wide range of iMPS and infinite-boundary-condition algorithms, opening the way to efficient studies of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium gauge dynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetries out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through the study of the Rep($D_8$) non-invertible symmetry, we show how non-invertible symmetries manifest in dynamics. By considering the effect of symmetry preserving disorder, the non-invertible symmetry is shown to give rise to degeneracies in the spectra that can only be completely lifted at orders of perturbation that scale with system size. The eigenstates of disordered Hamiltonians, whose ground state correspond to non-trivial symmetry protected topological (SPT) states, are shown to have either trivial or non-trivial SPT order that are detected as non-zero expectation value of string order-parameters. In contrast, non-trivial SPT order is absent in the eigenstates of trivial SPT Hamiltonians with disorder. The interface between two different SPT phases host edge modes whose dynamics is studied numerically and analytically. The edge mode is shown to oscillate at frequencies related to different effective chain lengths that are weighted by the temperature, becoming an exact zero mode in the limit of zero temperature. A Floquet model with the non-invertible symmetry is constructed whose edge mode is shown to exhibit period-doubled dynamics at low effective-temperatures.</description>

      <title>New Upper Bounds on Exotic Neutron Spin-Electron Spin Interactions via Neutron Spin Rotation Measurements in a Compensated Ferrimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a search for exotic spin-spin interactions between neutrons and electrons which could signal new physics beyond the Standard Model using slow neutron polarimetric imaging through a dense medium of polarized electrons. Our dense polarized electron target is a ferrimagnet held at its magnetic compensation temperature, which realizes a polarized electron ensemble with zero net magnetization. We sought the spin rotation of transversely polarized neutrons from a neutron spin-electron spin interaction of the form $V_2=-g_A^eg_A^n\frac{\hbar c}{4\pi}\vec\sigma_e\cdot\vec\sigma_n\frac{e^{-r/\lambda_c}}{r}$, where $g_{A}^{e}$ and $g_{A}^{n}$ are the electron and neutron axial couplings, $\vec{\sigma_e}$ and $\vec{\sigma_n}$ are the electron and neutron spin, and $\lambda_c$ is the interaction range for an exotic axial vector interaction from massive spin-1 boson exchange of mass $\hbar c/\lambda_c$. The resulting average neutron spin rotation angle per unit length, $\frac{d\bar{\phi}_{F5}}{dz}=[0.41\pm6.30\ (stat.)\pm4.4\ (sys.)]\times10^{-3}$ rad/m, is consistent with zero. Our novel approach improves the previous upper limits on the coupling constant product $g_A^eg_A^n$ by several orders of magnitude in the poorly explored $10^{-8}\leq\lambda_c\leq10^{-2}$ range.</description>

      <title>Toward a Consistent Definition of Holographic Entanglement Entropy in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a new definition of holographic entanglement entropy in the framework of static patch holography for de Sitter space. Using the replica trick and twist operator formalism, we derive an entropy functional in three-dimensional de Sitter space expressed through de Sitter Green's functions. Since the naive Ryu-Takayanagi prescription in de Sitter spacetime fails to satisfy strong subadditivity, we demand that our proposed formula be consistent with the fundamental entropic inequalities. The resulting conditions place nontrivial constraints on the undetermined parameter space of static patch holography. Our results demonstrate that entanglement inequalities provide a sharp diagnostic for candidate definitions of entanglement entropy in de Sitter holography and offer quantitative evidence in support of static patch holography as a consistent framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum Petri Nets with Event Structures semantics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Petri nets provide a canonical model of concurrency, with unfolding semantics linking nets, occurrence nets, and event structures. No comparable framework exists for quantum concurrency: existing ''quantum Petri nets'' lack rigorous concurrent and sound quantum semantics, analysis tools, and unfolding theory. We introduce Quantum Petri Nets (QPNs), Petri nets equipped with a quantum valuation compatible with the quantum event structure semantics of Clairambault, De Visme, and Winskel (2019). Our contributions are: (i) a local definition of Quantum Occurrence Nets (LQONs) compatible with quantum event structures, (ii) a construction of QPNs with a well-defined unfolding semantics, (iii) a compositional framework for QPNs. This establishes a semantically well grounded model of quantum concurrency, bridging Petri net theory and quantum programming.</description>

      <title>Resurrecting Vanilla Power Law Inflation with the aid of Continuous Spontaneous Localization in the ACT era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vanilla Power Law Inflation is plagued with two severe drawbacks, the one being the issue of graceful exit, and the other being its compatibility with the existing data. There's yet another daunting problem generic to any inflationary model, and not particular to the Power Law Inflation, is the issue of classicalization of the primordial quantum perturbation. This issue is often treated as an isolated problem primarily because decoherence is often invoked to tackle such problems and decoherence, in principle, doesn't leaves any observational imprints. However, that's not the case if one invokes the collapse models of quantum mechanics to resolve such a problem, because the collapse models do modify the Schr\"{o}dinger evolution of the quantum system and the modified dynamics is bound to leave imprints. We show that collapsed modified Power Law Inflation can indeed circumvent the issue with observations and can be made compatible with all the current data coming from {\it Planck}, {\it ACT}, DESI and BAO while resolving the classicalization issue associated with the quantum primordial fluctuations. Such an inflationary model also produces a more red-tilted tensor spectrum and no running for both the scalar and tensor spectral indices, which can be a litmus test for this model.</description>

      <title>A practical route to donor binding energies: The DFT-1/2 method for shallow defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately calculating the binding energies of shallow defects requires large supercells to capture the extended nature of their wavefunctions. This makes many beyond-DFT methods, such as hybrid functionals, impractical for direct calculations, often requiring indirect or approximate approaches. However, standard DFT alone fails to provide reliable results due to the well-known band gap underestimation and delocalization errors. In this work, we employ the DFT-1/2 method to address these deficiencies while maintaining computational efficiency allowing us to reach supercells of up to 4096 atoms. We develop a practical procedure for applying DFT-1/2 to shallow defects and demonstrate its effectiveness for group V donors in silicon (P, As, Sb, Bi). By using an extrapolation scheme to infinite supercell size, we obtain accurate binding energies with minimal computational overhead. This approach offers a simple and direct method for calculating donor binding energies.</description>

      <title>On the electronic normal modes of the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss representation of non-adiabatic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of non-adiabatic dynamics is highly desirable for understanding charge and energy transfer in complex systems. A key criterion for obtaining an accurate method is conservation of the Quantum Boltzmann Distribution (QBD). For a single surface, Matsubara dynamics is known to conserve the QBD, as a consequence of truncating the dynamics in the higher normal modes of the imaginary-time path integral. Recently, a Non-Adiabatic Matsubara (NA-Mats) dynamics has been proposed (J. Chem. Phys., 2021, 154, 124124) which truncates in the normal modes of the nuclear variables but not in the electronic variables, which are described with the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss (MMST) representation. Surprisingly, this NA-Mats method does not appear to conserve the QBD for a general system. This poses the question of the effect of truncating the higher normal modes of the electronic variables in the MMST representation. In this article, we present what we believe is the first study of electronic normal modes of the MMST representation. We find that observables are not usually a function of a finite number of normal modes and that the higher normal modes are not constrained by the distribution, unlike in conventional nuclear normal modes. While for an ensemble of trajectories, truncation in MMST normal modes appears to numerically conserve the QBD, this is not the case for a single trajectory. When considering a correlation function, all MMST normal modes are required to obtain reasonable dynamics. Overall, this suggests that MMST variables are not optimal for obtaining an accurate, QBD conserving nonadiabatic dynamics method.</description>

      <title>Sideband Spectroscopy in the Strong Driving Regime: Volcano Transparency and Sideband Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the response of a spin to two crossed magnetic fields: a strong and fast transverse field, and a weak and slow longitudinal field. We characterize the sideband response at the sum and the difference of driving frequencies over a broad range of parameters. In the strong transverse driving regime, the emission spectrum has a characteristic volcano lineshape with a narrow central transparency region surrounded by asymmetric peaks. Next, we couple the spin to a nonlinear cavity that both drives and measures it. In a sufficiently slow longitudinal field, the emission spectrum exhibits anomalous behavior, where the resonances in both the right and left sidebands lie on the same side of the central resonance. The theoretical results are compared to the experimental measurement of the emission of substitutional nitrogen P1 and nitrogen-vacancy NV$^-$ defects in diamond.</description>

Abstract: We apply the Renormalization Group Procedure for Effective Particles (RGPEP) to the front form Yukawa Hamiltonian, yielding a renormalized (effective) Hamiltonian, accurate up to second order in the coupling strength. Subsequently, we examine the spectrum and parton distribution functions produced by the renormalized Hamiltonian, and show that the addition of counterterms leads to finite results. Resource estimates for quantum simulation are calculated for a single `Ladder Operator Block Encoding' (LOBE), and show that the cost to block encode the renormalized Hamiltonian is comparable to block encoding the bare Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>The Algebra of the Pseudo-Observables II: The Measurement Problem</title>

Abstract: In this second paper, we develop the full mathematical structure of the algebra of the pseudo-observables, in order to solve the quantum measurement problem. Quantum state vectors are recovered but as auxiliary pseudo-observables storing the information acquired in a set of observations. The whole process of measurement is deeply reanalyzed in the conclusive section, evidencing original aspects. The relation of the theory with some popular interpretations of Quantum Mechanics is also discussed, showing that both Relational Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Bayesianism may be regarded as compatible interpretations of the theory. A final discussion on reality, tries to bring a new insight on it.</description>

      <title>A Robust Large-Period Discrete Time Crystal and its Signature in a Digital Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11560v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are novel out-of-equilibrium quantum states of matter which break time translational symmetry. DTCs have been extensively realized in experiments, particularly their subclass that is characterized by period-doubling dynamics due to its natural occurrence in a system of periodically driven two-level, e.g., spin-1/2, particles. The realization of DTCs beyond period-doubling, including their generalizations termed discrete quasicrystals has also been made in recent years, though such experiments typically involve higher spin particles. Constructing and observing DTCs beyond period-doubling in systems of two-level particles are generally still considered an open challenge due to the latter's $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that natively only leads to period-doubling. In this work, we developed an intuitive interacting system of two-level particles (qubits) that supports the more non-trivial period-quadrupling DTCs ($4T$-DTCs). Remarkably, by utilizing a variational algorithm, we are able to observe clear signatures of such $4T$-DTCs in a quantum processor despite the presence of considerable noise and the small number of available qubits. Our findings extend the landscape of time crystalline behavior by demonstrating a distinct realization of time crystallinity beyond standard period-doubling dynamics with qubits (two-level particles) on a NISQ-era digital quantum computer, as well as the potential of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulating exotic non-equilibrium quantum states of matter.</description>

      <title>Investigating Techniques to Optimise the Layout of Turbines in a Windfarm using a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates Windfarm Layout Optimization (WFLO), where we formulate turbine placement considering wake effects as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. Wind energy plays a critical role in the transition toward sustainable power systems, but the optimal placement of turbines remains a challenging combinatorial problem due to complex wake interactions. With recent advances in quantum computing, there is growing interest in exploring whether hybrid quantum-classical methods can provide advantages for such computationally intensive tasks. We investigate solving the resulting QUBO problem using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) implemented on Qiskit's quantum computer simulator, employing a quantum noise-free, gate-based circuit model. Three classical optimizers are discussed, with a detailed analysis of the two most effective approaches: Constrained Optimization BY Linear Approximation (COBYLA) and Bayesian Optimization (BO). We compare these simulated quantum results with two established classical optimization methods: Simulated Annealing (SA) and the Gurobi solver. The study focuses on 4$\times$4 grid configurations (requiring 16 qubits), providing insights into near-term quantum algorithm applicability for renewable energy optimization.</description>

      <title>Fast Classical Simulation of Quantum Circuits via Parametric Rewriting in the ZX-Calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ZX-calculus is an algebraic formalism that allows quantum computations to be simplified via a small number of simple graphical rewrite rules. Recently, it was shown that, when combined with a family of "sum-over-Cliffords" techniques, the ZX-calculus provides a powerful tool for classical simulation of quantum circuits. However, for several important classical simulation tasks, such as computing the probabilities associated with many measurement outcomes of a single quantum circuit, this technique results in reductions over many very similar diagrams, where much of the same computational work is repeated. In this paper, we show that the majority of this work can be shared across branches, by developing reduction strategies that can be run parametrically on diagrams with boolean free parameters. As parameters only need to be fixed after the bulk of the simplification work is already done, we show that it is possible to perform the final stage of classical simulation quickly utilising a high degree of GPU parallelism. Using these methods, we demonstrate an average speedup factor of 78.3+-10.2 for certain classical simulation tasks vs. the non-parametric approach.</description>

      <title>ZX-calculus is Complete for Finite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ZX-calculus is a graphical language for reasoning about quantum computing and quantum information theory. As a complete graphical language, it incorporates a set of axioms rich enough to derive any equation of the underlying formalism. While completeness of the ZX-calculus has been established for qubits and the Clifford fragment of prime-dimensional qudits, universal completeness beyond two-level systems has remained unproven until now. In this paper, we present a proof establishing the completeness of finite-dimensional ZX-calculus, incorporating only the mixed-dimensional Z-spider and the qudit X-spider as generators. Our approach builds on the completeness of another graphical language, the finite-dimensional ZW-calculus, with direct translations between these two calculi. By proving its completeness, we lay a solid foundation for the ZX-calculus as a versatile tool not only for quantum computation but also for various fields within finite-dimensional quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Operational work fluctuation theorem for open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Jarzynski equality establishes an exact relation between the stochastic work performed on a system driven out of thermal equilibrium and the free energy difference in a corresponding quasi-static process. This fluctuation theorem bears experimental relevance, as it enables the determination of the free energy difference through the measurement of externally applied work in a nonequilibrium process. In the quantum case, the Jarzynski equality only holds if the measurement procedure of the stochastic work is drastically changed: it is replaced by a so-called two-point measurement (TPM) scheme that requires the knowledge of the initial and final Hamiltonian and therefore lacks the predictive power for the free energy difference that the classical Jarzynski equation is known for. Here, we propose a quantum fluctuation theorem that is valid for externally measurable quantum work determined during the driving protocol. In contrast to the TPM case, the theorem also applies to open quantum systems and the scenario can be realized without knowing the system Hamiltonian. Our fluctuation theorem comes in the form of an inequality and therefore only yields bounds to the true free energy difference. The inequality is saturated in the quasiclassical case of vanishing energy coherences at the beginning and at the end of the protocol. Thus, there is a clear quantum disadvantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work reveals the intrinsic connection between Dirac monopole theory and Berry geometric phases by extending Dirac's theory to the parameter space. Using the simplest two-mode Hamiltonian model, we explicitly visualize Dirac strings with endpoints in the parameter space, demonstrating that these endpoints correspond to accidental degeneracy points of energy eigenvalues in Hermitian systems. We show that non-integrable phase factors, induced by such Dirac strings, directly give rise to the well-known Berry connection and curvature, which can be derived rigorously via Dirac's monopole framework. Our results indicate that the Berry geometric phase is essentially the non-integrable phase factor induced by Dirac strings with endpoints in the parameter space. This establishes a unified and effective approach to study monopoles and geometric phases, particularly applicable when Berry's framework fails.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07029v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive Floquet theory from quantum geometry. We identify quasienergy folding as a consequence of a broken gauge group of the adiabatic gauge potential $U(1){\mapsto}\mathbb{Z}$. Fixing instead the gauge freedom using the parallel-transport gauge uniquely decomposes Floquet dynamics into a purely geometric and a purely dynamical evolution. The dynamical average-energy operator provides an unambiguous sorting of the quasienergy spectrum, identifying a Floquet ground state and suggesting a way to define the filling of Floquet-Bloch bands. We exemplify the features of geometric Floquet theory using an exactly solvable XY model and a non-integrable kicked Ising chain. We elucidate the geometric origin of inherently nonequilibrium effects, like the $\pi$-quasienergy splitting in discrete time crystals or $\pi$-edge modes in anomalous Floquet topological insulators. The spectrum of the average-energy operator is a susceptible indicator for both heating and spatiotemporal symmetry-breaking transitions. Last, we demonstrate that the periodic lab frame Hamiltonian generates transitionless counterdiabatic driving for Floquet eigenstates. This work directly bridges seemingly unrelated areas of nonequilibrium physics.</description>

      <title>Low-density parity-check codes as stable phases of quantum matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phases of matter with robust ground-state degeneracy, such as the quantum toric code, are known to be capable of robust quantum information storage. Here, we address the converse question: given a quantum error correcting code, when does it define a stable gapped quantum phase of matter, whose ground state degeneracy is robust against perturbations in the thermodynamic limit? We prove that a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code defines such a phase, robust against all few-body perturbations, if its code distance grows at least logarithmically in the number of degrees of freedom, and it exhibits "check soundness". Many constant-rate quantum LDPC expander codes have such properties, and define stable phases of matter with a constant zero-temperature entropy density, violating the third law of thermodynamics. Our results also show that quantum toric code phases are robust to spatially nonlocal few-body perturbations. Similarly, phases of matter defined by classical codes are stable against symmetric perturbations. In the classical setting, we present improved locality bounds on the quasiadiabatic evolution operator between two nearby states in the same code phase.</description>

Abstract: The modern Hopfield network, proposed by Krotov and Hopfield, is a mathematical generalization of the Hopfield network, which is a basic model of associative memory that employs higher-order interactions. This study introduces an open quantum model for discrete modern Hopfield networks that generalizes the open quantum Hopfield network. Our model integrates dissipative quantum spin systems, governed by quantum master equations, with classical hopping terms and additional quantum effects through a transverse field. We analytically examined the behavior of the stable fixed points and numerically determined the phase diagram. The results demonstrated qualitatively distinct behaviors from the open quantum Hopfield network, showing that the ferromagnetic and limit cycle phases have additional stable fixed points.</description>

Abstract: The statistics of particles and extended excitations, such as loops and membranes, are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics, high-energy physics, and quantum information science, yet a comprehensive lattice-level framework for computing them remains elusive. In this work, we develop a universal microscopic method to determine the generalized statistics of Abelian excitations on lattices of arbitrary dimension, and demonstrate it by deriving the statistics of particles, loops, and membranes in up to three spatial dimensions. Our approach constructs a sequence of local unitary operators whose many-body Berry phase encodes the desired statistical invariant. The required sequence is generated automatically from the Smith normal form of locality constraints and therefore needs no extra physical input. We prove that the resulting invariants are quantized, provide an algorithm that computes them efficiently, and show how they unify familiar braiding and fusion data of particles while also uncovering new self- and mutual-statistics of loop and membrane excitations. We further demonstrate that each statistical invariant corresponds to an 't Hooft anomaly of a generalized symmetry; we show that a non-trivial invariant both (i) obstructs gauging that symmetry and (ii) forbids any short-range-entangled (symmetry-preserving) ground state. This establishes a precise connection between microscopic lattice anomalies and many-body dynamics, providing a generalization of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem that constrains a wide class of quantum lattice systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trapped ions are among the leading platforms for quantum technologies, particularly in the field of quantum computing. Detecting states of trapped ions is essential for ensuring high-fidelity readouts of quantum states. In this work, we develop and benchmark a set of methods for ion quantum state detection using images obtained by a highly sensitive camera. By transforming the images from the camera and applying conventional and quantum machine learning methods, including convolution, support vector machine (classical and quantum), and quantum annealing, we demonstrate a possibility to detect the positions and quantum states of ytterbium ions in a Paul trap. Quantum state detection is performed with an electron shelving technique: depending on the quantum state of the ion its fluorescence under the influence of a 369.5 nm laser beam is either suppressed or not. We estimate fidelities for conventional and quantum detection techniques. In particular, conventional algorithms for detecting $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$, such as the support vector machine and photon statistics-based method,as well as our quantum annealing-based approach, have achieved perfect fidelity, which is beneficial compared to standard techniques. This result may pave the way for ultrahigh-fidelity detection of trapped ions via conventional and quantum machine learning techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dispersive readout is widely used to perform high-fidelity measurement of superconducting qubits. Much work has been focused on the qubit readout fidelity, which depends on the achievable signal-to-noise ratio and the qubit relaxation time. As groups have pushed to increase readout fidelity by increasing readout photon number, dispersive readout has been shown to strongly affect the post-measurement qubit state. Such effects hinder the effectiveness of quantum error correction, which requires measurements that both have high readout fidelity and are quantum non-demolition (QND). Here, we experimentally investigate non-QND effects in the fluxonium. We map out the state evolution of fluxonium qubits in the presence of resonator photons and observe that these photons induce transitions in the fluxonium both within and outside the qubit subspace. We numerically model our system and find that transitions to higher-excited states and coupling to an external spurious mode are necessary to explain observed non-QND effects.</description>

Abstract: We propose and theoretically analyse a superconducting electric circuit which can be used to experimentally realize an autonomous quantum heat engine. Using a quasiclassical, non-Markovian theoretical model, we demonstrate that coherent microwave power generation can emerge solely from the heat flow through the circuit determined by non-linear circuit quantum electrodynamics. The predicted energy generation rate is sufficiently high for experimental observation with contemporary techniques, rendering this work a significant step toward the first experimental realization of an autonomous quantum heat engine based on Otto cycles.</description>

      <title>Observation and mitigation of microwave echoes from dielectric defects in Josephson traveling wave amplifiers</title>

Abstract: Amplifying microwave signals with a noise close to the minimum imposed by quantum mechanics is now routinely performed with superconducting quantum devices. In particular, Josephson-based Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (JTWPA) have shown record bandwidth with added noise close to the quantum limit. In this work, we report the appearance of echo signals emitted by JTWPAs driven by trains of high-power pulses exceeding their dynamical range. we explore the case of weak signals generated through high power pulses. By sending a train of such high-power pulses, beyond the 1 dB compression point of such amplifiers, we observe the appearance of echoes, solely due to the JTWPA. These echoes have micro-second coherence and we attribute their origin to microscopic defects in the amplifier dielectric layer. By analyzing the power and the coherence of the echo signal as a function of temperature, we estimate the dielectric loss brought by these defects, and their impact on the JTWPA quantum efficiency. We introduce a mitigation technique (BLAST) to prevent the appearance of these echoes, consisting in an additional high-power tone sent concurrently with each pulse. We demonstrate that it suppresses the spurious defect signals and we recover the typical gain and noise figure within 95% of their low-power values in 300 ns. These results can help to extend the use of JTWPAs in experiments where fast high-power sequences are necessary to generate weak microwave responses from the system under study, and also provide a path towards characterizing in-situ the dielectric losses of these devices.</description>

      <title>Anyon Theory and Topological Frustration of High-Efficiency Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes offer a promising path to low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation but lack systematic strategies for exploration. In this Letter, we establish a topological framework for studying the bivariate-bicycle codes, a prominent class of QLDPC codes tailored for real-world quantum hardware. Our framework enables the investigation of these codes through universal properties of topological orders. In addition to efficient characterizations using Gr\"obner bases, we also introduce a novel algebraic-geometric approach based on the Bernstein--Khovanskii--Kushnirenko theorem. This approach allows us to analytically determine how the topological order varies with the generic choices of bivariate-bicycle codes under toric layouts. Novel phenomena are unveiled, including topological frustration, where ground-state degeneracy on a torus deviates from the total anyon number, and quasi-fractonic mobility, where anyon movement violates energy conservation. We demonstrate their intrinsic link to symmetry-enriched topological orders and derive an efficient method for generating finite-size codes. Furthermore, we extend the connection between anyons and logical operators using Koszul complex theory. Our Letter provides a rigorous theoretical basis for exploring the fault tolerance of QLDPC codes and deepens the interplay among topological order, quantum error correction, and advanced algebraic structures.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and noise in strongly driven Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In circuit quantum electrodynamical systems, the quasiparticle-related losses in Josephson junctions are suppressed due to the gap in the superconducting density of states which is much higher than the typical energy of a microwave photon. In this work, we show that a strong drive even at a frequency lower than twice the superconductor gap parameter can activate dissipation in the junctions due to photon-assisted breaking of the Cooper pairs. Both the decay rate and noise strength associated with the losses are sensitive to the dc phase bias of the junction and can be tuned in a broad range by the amplitude and the frequency of the external driving field, making the suggested mechanism potentially attractive for designing tunable dissipative elements. We also predict pronounced memory effects in the driven Josephson junctions, which are appealing for both theoretical and experimental studies of non-Markovian physics in superconducting quantum circuits. We illustrate our theoretical findings by studying the spectral properties and the steady-state population of a low-impedance resonator coupled to the driven Josephson junction: we show the emergence of non-Lorentzian spectral lines and broad tunability of effective temperature of the steady state.</description>

      <title>Matter-Wave Squeezing from Gouy Phase: Toward a New Tool for Quantum Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Gouy phase emerging from the time evolution of confined matter waves in a harmonic potential. Specifically, we analyze the quantum dynamics of a Gaussian wavepacket that exhibits position-momentum correlations. By tuning the parameters governing its evolution, we reveal intriguing effects, with a particular focus on squeezing. Notably, during the wavepacket evolution quantum spreading and squeezing processes emerge, giving rise to Gouy phase contributions of $\pi/4$, establishing a clear link between the Gouy phase and a purely quantum phenomenon. Furthermore, the interplay between wavepacket squeezing and one-dimensional spreading leads to a total Gouy phase accumulation of $\pi/2$ in an oscillation period. Both squeezing and Gouy phase have individually proven valuable in state engineering and quantum metrology. By demonstrating a direct, controllable relationship between these two fundamental processes, our findings expand the realm of quantum-enhanced technologies, including quantum sensing and precision measurement.</description>

      <title>Sensing Birefringence and Diattenuation with Undetected Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing advanced technologies for sensing and imaging biological samples is crucial for medical applications, making quantum-enhanced methods particularly valuable, as they promise significant benefits over classical techniques. An important aspect of biological imaging is the characterization of tissue, which often involves resolving complex structural information such as birefringence and diattenuation. These measures require polarization-sensitive sensing which remains largely unaddressed in quantum-imaging techniques with undetected light. However, the bicolor nature and supreme phase sensitivity of nonlinear interferometers make them particularly advantageous for biological sensing. Hence, we theoretically introduce controllable polarizations of the interrogating light in a quantum-imaging setup and show the potential of nonlinear interferometers to simultaneously sense birefringence and diattenuation with undetected light while discussing both the low- and high-gain regime.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Query Complexity of Boolean Functions under Indefinite Causal Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational models typically assume that operations are applied in a fixed sequential order. In recent years several works have looked at relaxing this assumption, considering computations without any fixed causal structure and showing that such ''causally indefinite'' computations can provide advantages in various tasks. Recently, the quantum query complexity of Boolean functions has been used as a tool to probe their computational power in a standard complexity theoretic framework, but no separation in exact query complexity has thus-far been found. In this paper, we investigate this problem starting with the simpler and fully classical notion of deterministic query complexity of Boolean functions, and using classical-deterministic processes -- which may exhibit causal indefiniteness -- as a generalised computational framework. We first show that the standard polynomial and certificate lower bounds of deterministic query complexity also hold in such generalised models. Then, we formulate a Boolean function for which causal indefiniteness permits a reduction in query complexity and show that this advantage can be amplified into a polynomial separation. Finally, with the insights gained in the classical-deterministic setting, we give a Boolean function whose quantum query complexity is reduced by causally indefinite computations.</description>

      <title>Free Electron Paths from Dirac's Wave Equation Elucidating Zitterbewegung and Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The worldline of a free electron is revealed by applying Dirac's velocity operator to its Dirac wave function whose space-time arguments are expressed in a proper time by a Lorentz transformation. This motion can be decomposed into two parts: the electron's global motion of its inertia (or spin) center and an inherent local periodic motion about this point that produces the electron's spin and has the zitterbewegung frequency found by Schr\"{o}dinger in his operator analysis of Dirac's wave equation. This zitter motion corresponds to the so-called polarization and magnetization currents in Gordon's decomposition of Dirac's current. In an inertial "rest"-frame fixed at the inertia center, Dirac's wave function for a free electron with its spin in a specified direction implies that the zitter motion is a perpetual circular motion about the inertia center in a plane orthogonal to this spin direction with a radius one half of the Compton radius and moving at the speed of light. The electron continuously accelerates about the spin center without any external force because the inertia is effective at the spin center, rather than at its charge center where the electron interacts with the electro-magnetic field. This analysis confirms the nature of zitterbewegung directly from Dirac's wave equation, agreeing with the conclusions of Barut and Zanghi, Beck, Hestenes, Rivas and Salesi from their classical Dirac particle models of the electron. Furthermore, these five classical models are equivalent and express the same free electron dynamics as Dirac's equation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Preservation and Clauser-Horne Nonlocality in Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Quantum Memories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum memories are indispensable for quantum repeater networks, deterministic generation of single- or multi-photon states, and linear optical quantum computing. Although experiments have demonstrated that electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memories can store entangled photons, a definitive theoretical framework verifying the preservation of entanglement and nonlocality has not been rigorously established. Here, we develop a comprehensive model by integrating the dark-state polariton framework with reduced-density-operator theory to derive the retrieved density operator under realistic ground-state decoherence conditions. Our analysis reveals that decoherence inevitably causes probe photon loss, converting a Bell state into a mixed state. Crucially, we predict a critical storage efficiency threshold of 89.7%. Only when this threshold is exceeded does the retrieved probe photon state violate the Clauser-Horne inequality, thereby preserving nonlocality; below this point, nonlocal correlations vanish. Moreover, our theory shows that multiple spatially separated EIT memories can cooperatively store and retrieve N-qubit entangled states encoded in photon number, path, and polarization with near-unity fidelity in the ideal limit. This work bridges a long-standing theoretical gap and lays a solid foundation for the application of EIT memories in scalable quantum networks and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>On-chip stencil lithography for superconducting qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improvements in circuit design and more recently in materials and surface cleaning have contributed to a rapid development of coherent superconducting qubits. However, organic resists commonly used for shadow evaporation of Josephson junctions (JJs) pose limitations due to residual contamination, poor thermal stability and compatibility under typical surface-cleaning conditions. To provide an alternative, we developed an inorganic SiO$_2$/Si$_3$N$_4$ on-chip stencil lithography mask for JJ fabrication. The stencil mask is resilient to aggressive cleaning agents and it withstands high temperatures up to 1200{\deg}C, thereby opening new avenues for JJ material exploration and interface optimization. To validate the concept, we performed shadow evaporation of Al-based transmon qubits followed by stencil mask lift-off using vapor hydrofluoric acid, which selectively etches SiO$_2$. We demonstrate average $T_1 \approx 75 \pm 11 \mu$s over a 200 MHz frequency range in multiple cool-downs for one device, and $T_1 \approx 44\pm 8 \mu$s for a second device. These results confirm the compatibility of stencil lithography with state-of-the-art superconducting quantum devices and motivate further investigations into materials engineering, film deposition and surface cleaning techniques.</description>

      <title>Learning to Restore Heisenberg Limit in Noisy Quantum Sensing via Quantum Digital Twin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum sensors leverage nonclassical resources to achieve sensing precision at the Heisenberg limit, surpassing the standard quantum limit attainable through classical strategies. However, a critical issue is that the environmental noise induces rapid decoherence, fundamentally limiting the realizability of the Heisenberg limit. In this Letter, we propose a quantum digital twin protocol to overcome this issue. The protocol first establishes observable-constrained state reconstruction to infer random errors in the decoherence process, and then utilizes reinforcement learning to derive adaptive compensatory control strategies. Demonstrated across discrete, continuous variable and multi-qubit circuit systems, our approach bypasses quantum state tomography's exponential overhead and discovers optimal control schemes to restore the Heisenberg limit. Unlike quantum error correction or mitigation schemes requiring precise noise characterization and ancillary qubits, our autonomous protocol achieves noise-resilient sensing through environment-adaptive control sequencing. This work establishes quantum digital twin as a generic methodology for quantum control, proposing a noise-immune paradigm for next-generation quantum sensors compatible with NISQ-era experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Multiclass Portfolio Optimization via Variational Quantum Eigensolver with Dicke State Ansatz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization is a fundamental challenge in various domains, with portfolio optimization standing out as a key application in finance. Despite numerous quantum algorithmic approaches proposed for this problem, most overlook a critical feature of realistic portfolios: diversification. In this work, we introduce a novel quantum framework for multiclass portfolio optimization that explicitly incorporates diversification by leveraging multiple parametrized Dicke states, simultaneously initialized to encode the diversification constraints , as an ansatz of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver. A key strength of this ansatz is that it initializes the quantum system in a superposition of only feasible states, inherently satisfying the constraints. This significantly reduces the search space and eliminates the need for penalty terms. In addition, we also analyze the impact of different classical optimizers in this hybrid quantum-classical approach. Our findings demonstrate that, when combined with the CMA-ES optimizer, the Dicke state ansatz achieves superior performance in terms of convergence rate, approximation ratio, and measurement probability. These results underscore the potential of this method to solve practical, diversification-aware portfolio optimization problems relevant to the financial sector.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure prediction of medium and high entropy alloys across composition space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose machine learning (ML) models to predict the electron density -- the fundamental unknown of a material's ground state -- across the composition space of concentrated alloys. From this, other physical properties can be inferred, enabling accelerated exploration. A significant challenge is that the number of sampled compositions and descriptors required to accurately predict fields like the electron density increases rapidly with species. To address this, we employ Bayesian Active Learning (AL), which minimizes training data requirements by leveraging uncertainty quantification capabilities of Bayesian Neural Networks. Compared to strategic tessellation of the composition space, Bayesian-AL reduces the number of training data points by a factor of 2.5 for ternary (SiGeSn) and 1.7 for quaternary (CrFeCoNi) systems. We also introduce easy-to-optimize, body-attached-frame descriptors, which respect physical symmetries and maintain approximately the same descriptor-vector size as alloy elements increase. Our ML models demonstrate high accuracy and generalizability in predicting both electron density and energy across composition space.</description>

      <title>Proto-Quipper with Reversing and Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum programming language Quipper supports circuit operations such as reversing and controlling certain quantum circuits. Additionally, Quipper provides a function called with-computed, which can be used to program circuits of the form g; f; g-dagger. The latter is a common pattern in quantum circuit design.  One benefit of using with-computed, as opposed to constructing the circuit g ; f; g-dagger directly from g, f, and g-dagger, is that it facilitates an important optimization. Namely, if the resulting circuit is later controlled, only f needs to be controlled; the circuits g and g-dagger need not even be controllable.
  In this paper, we formalize a semantics for reversible and controllable circuits, using a dagger symmetric monoidal category R to interpret reversible circuits, and a new notion we call a controllable category N, which encompasses the control and with-computed operations in Quipper. We extend the language Proto-Quipper with reversing, control and the with-computed operation.  Since not all circuits are reversible and/or controllable, we use a type system with modalities to track reversibility and controllability. This generalizes the modality of Fu-Kishida-Ross-Selinger 2023.  We give an abstract categorical semantics, and show that the type system and operational semantics are sound with respect to this semantics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optical clock states of alkaline earth and alkaline earth-like atoms are the fundament of state-of-the-art optical atomic clocks. An important prerequisite for the operation of optical clocks are magic trapping conditions, where electronic and motional dynamics decouple. Here, we identify and experimentally demonstrate simultaneous magic trapping for two clock transitions in strontium-88, realizing so-called triple-magic conditions at a specially chosen magic angle. Under these conditions, we operate an all-optical qutrit comprising the ground state $^1S_0$, and the two metastable clock states $^3P_0$ and $^3P_2$. We demonstrate fast optical control in an atom array using two- and three-photon couplings to realize high-fidelity manipulation between all qutrit states. At the magic angle, we probe the coherence achievable in magic-angle-tuned traps and find atom-atom coherence times between the metastable states as long as 715(30) ms. Our work opens several new directions, including qutrit-based quantum metrology on optical transitions and high-fidelity and high-coherence manipulation on the strontium-88 fine-structure qubit.</description>

      <title>$2$-R\'enyi CCNR Negativity of Compact Boson for multiple disjoint intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate mixed-state bipartite entanglement between multiple disjoint intervals using the computable cross-norm criterion (CCNR). We consider entanglement between a single interval and the union of remaining disjoint intervals, and compute $2$-R\'enyi CCNR negativity for $2$d massless compact boson. The expression for $2$-R\'enyi CCNR negativity is given in terms of cross-ratios and Riemann period matrices of Riemann surfaces involved in the calculation. In general, the Riemann surfaces involved in the calculation of $n$-R\'enyi CCNR negativity do not possess a $Z_n$ symmetry. We also evaluate the Reflected R\'enyi entropy related to the $2$-R\'enyi CCNR negativity. This Reflected R\'enyi entropy is a universal quantity. We extend these calculations to the $2$d massless Dirac fermions as well. Finally, the analytical results are checked against the numerical evaluations in the tight-binding model and are found to be in good agreement.</description>

      <title>Versatile photonic frequency synthetic dimensions using a single Mach-Zehnder-interferometer-assisted device on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating physical models with photonic synthetic dimensions has been generating great interest in vast fields of science. The rapid developing thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform, for its numerous advantages including high electro-optic coefficient and scalability, is well compatible with the realization of synthetic dimensions in the frequency together with spatial domain. While coupling resonators with fixed beam splitters is a common experimental approach, it often lacks tunability and limits coupling between adjacent lattices to sites occupying the same frequency domain positions. Here, on the contrary, we conceive the resonator arrays connected by electro-optic tunable Mach-Zehnder interferometers in our configuration instead of fixed beam splitters. By applying bias voltage and RF modulation on the interferometers, our design extends such coupling to long-range scenario and allows for continuous tuning on each coupling strength and synthetic effective magnetic flux. Therefore, our design enriches controllable coupling types that are essential for building programmable lattice networks and significantly increases versatility. As the example, we experimentally fabricate a two-resonator prototype on the TFLN platform, and on this single chip we realize well-known models including tight-binding lattices, topological Hall ladder and Creutz ladder. We directly observe the band structures in the quasi-momentum space and important phenomena such as spin-momentum locking and the Aharonov-Bohm cage effect. These results demonstrate the potential for convenient simulations of more complex models in our configuration.</description>

      <title>Soliton resuscitations: asymmetric revivals of the breathing mode of an atomic bright soliton in a harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An atomic bright soliton realised in a quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate can be considered as an open quantum system. The soliton's breathing mode, for example, is damped by emission of atoms from the soliton to spatial infinity, which thus acts as a Markovian environment for the soliton. If the soliton is held in a shallow harmonic trap, however, the environment becomes non-Markovian: emitted atoms oscillate in the trap and eventually return to the soliton, interfering with it, producing periodic revivals of the breathing mode (``resuscitations''). The amplitude envelopes of these breathing revivals shows a curious asymmetry, with a gradual increase in breathing amplitude followed by sudden drop in amplitude that becomes more and more pronounced in later revivals. We explain this asymmetrical revival pattern in the non-Markovian revivals by deriving a close analytical approximation to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes frequency spectrum for the weakly trapped soliton.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Probing of Topological Supersolids in Spin-Orbit-Coupled Dipolar Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A chiral supersolid is a quantum phase that simultaneously exhibits crystalline order, superfluidity, and topological spin texture, with spontaneously broken translational, U(1) gauge, and chiral symmetries. Here, we demonstrate a chiral supersolid with tunable non-equilibrium dynamics in a spin-orbit coupled dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate. By adjusting dipolar interaction and spin-orbit coupling, we uncover two distinct quantum phase transitions: (i) a first-order transition from a single skyrmion superfluid to a triangular meron supersolid, and (ii) a second-order transition from this superfluid to a square skyrmion supersolid. These phases are characterized by their lattice symmetries, nonclassical rotational inertia, and spin textures. Under parity-time symmetric dissipation, we predict phase-dependent damping of the current oscillations, directly linked to the superfluid fraction. The predicted chiral supersolid phase can be experimentally observed in ultracold magnetic atoms with spin-orbit coupling. Our results establish dipolar quantum gases as a platform for designing topological matter with spintronic functionality.</description>

      <title>Precision measurement of Cs($nF_J$) quantum defects and calculations of scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the $nS_{1/2}$, $nP_J$ ,$nD_J$ , and $nF_J$ series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend our recent work on cesium S and D states [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 233005 (2024)] to the F states. We present absolute frequency measurements of the $|6S_{1/2}, F = 3\rangle \rightarrow nF_{5/2,7/2}(n = 28-68)$ Rydberg series to measure the spectrum of $^{133}$Cs. Atomic spectra are obtained using a three-photon excitation scheme referenced to an optical frequency comb in a sample of ultracold $^{133}$Cs. By globally fitting the absolute-frequency measurements to the modified Ritz formula, we determine the quantum defects of the $nF_{5/2}$ and $nF_{7/2}$ series. The ionization potential extracted for both series from the modified Ritz formula agrees with our measurements based on the S and D series. Fine-structure intervals are calculated and parameterized. The wave functions computed for the energies from the quantum defects are used to calculate transition dipole moments. We compare the reduced electric-dipole matrix elements with available benchmarks and find agreement within the precision of those works. The scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the $nS_{1/2}$, $nP_J$ , $nD_J$ and $nF_J$ series are calculated based on the now more accurate set of wave functions. Moreover, we report the polarizability as a series in powers of the effective principal quantum number and find the main coefficients of the expansion. The results will be useful for calculating properties of $^{133}$Cs such as collision and decay rates, polarizabilities, and magic wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Probing the spatial distribution of k-vectors in situ with Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for mapping in situ the spatial distribution of photon momentum across a laser beam using a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) as a moving probe. By displacing the BEC, we measure the photon recoil by atom interferometry at different positions in the laser beam and thus reconstruct a two-dimensional map of the local intensity and effective dispersion of the $k$ wave vector. Applied to a beam diffracted by a diaphragm, this method reveals a local extra recoil effect, which exceeds the magnitude $h\nu/c$ of the individual plane-waves over which the beam can be decomposed. This method offers a new way to precisely characterize wavefront distortions and to evaluate one of the major systematic bias sources in quantum sensors based on atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>Entropy Measures for Transition Matrices in Random Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A transition matrix can be constructed through the partial contraction of two given quantum states. We analyze and compare four different definitions of entropy for transition matrices, including (modified) pseudo entropy, SVD entropy, and ABB entropy. We examine the probabilistic interpretation of each entropy measure and show that only the distillation interpretation of ABB entropy corresponds to the joint success probability of distilling entanglement between the two quantum states used to construct the transition matrix. Combining the transition matrix with preceding measurements and subsequent non-unitary operations, the ABB entropy either decreases or remains unchanged, whereas the pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy may increase or decrease. We further apply these entropy measures to transition matrices constructed from several ensembles: (i) pairs of independent Haar-random states; (ii) bi-orthogonal eigenstates of non-Hermitian random systems; and (iii) bi-orthogonal states in $PT$-symmetric systems near their exceptional points. Across all cases considered, the SVD and ABB entropies of the transition matrix closely mirror the behavior of the subsystem entanglement entropy of a single random state, in contrast to the (modified) pseudo entropy, which can exceed the bound of subsystem size, fail to scale with system size, or even take complex values.</description>

      <title>Properties of the temporal transfer matrix in integrable Floquet circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One possible approach to studying non-equilibrium dynamics is the so-called influence matrix (IM) formalism. The influence matrix can be viewed as a quantum state that encodes complete information about the non-equilibrium dynamics of a boundary degree of freedom. It has been shown that the IM is the unique stationary point of the temporal transfer matrix. This transfer matrix, however, is non-diagonalizable and exhibits a non-trivial Jordan block structure. In this article, we demonstrate that, in the case of an integrable XXZ spin chain, the temporal transfer matrix itself is integrable and can be embedded into a family of commuting operators. We further provide the exact expression for the IM as a particular limit of a Bethe wavefunction, with the corresponding Bethe roots given explicitly. We also focus on the special case of the free-fermionic XX chain. In this setting, we uncover additional local integrals of motion, which enable us to analyze the dimensions and structure of the Jordan blocks, as well as the locality properties of the IM. Moreover, we construct a basis of quasi-local creation operators that generate the IM from the vacuum state.</description>
