      <title>Transit Spectroscopy of K2-33b with Subaru/IRD: Spin-Orbit Alignment and Tentative Atmospheric Helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanets in their infancy are ideal targets to probe the formation and evolution history of planetary systems, including the planet migration and atmospheric evolution and dissipation. In this paper, we present spectroscopic observations and analyses of two planetary transits of K2-33b, which is known to be one of the youngest transiting planets (age $\approx 8-11$ Myr) around a pre-main-sequence M-type star. Analysing K2-33's near-infrared spectra obtained by the IRD instrument on Subaru, we investigate the spin-orbit angle and transit-induced excess absorption for K2-33b. We attempt both classical modelling of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect and Doppler-shadow analyses for the measurements of the projected stellar obliquity, finding a low angle of $\lambda=-6_{-58}^{+61}$ deg (for RM analysis) and $\lambda=-10_{-24}^{+22}$ deg (for Doppler-shadow analysis). In the modelling of the RM effect, we allow the planet-to-star radius ratio to float freely to take into account the possible smaller radius in the near infrared, but the constraint we obtain ($R_p/R_s=0.037_{-0.017}^{+0.013}$) is inconclusive due to the low radial-velocity precision. Comparison spectra of K2-33 of the 1083 nm triplet of metastable ortho-He I obtained in and out of the 2021 transit reveal excess absorption that could be due to an escaping He-rich atmosphere. Under certain conditions on planet mass and stellar XUV emission, the implied escape rate is sufficient to remove an Earth-mass H/He in $\sim$1 Gyr, transforming this object from a Neptune to a super-Earth.</description>

      <title>Dynamical and Secular Stability of Mutually Inclined Planetary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple analytical and empirical stability criteria have been derived in the literature for two planet systems. But, the dependence of the stability limit on the initial mutual inclination between the inner and outer orbits is not well modeled by previous stability criteria. Here, we derive a semi-analytical stability criteria for two planet systems, at arbitrary inclinations, in which the inner planet is a test particle. Using perturbation theory we calculate the characteristic fractional change in the semi-major axis of the inner binary $\beta=\delta a_1/a_1$ caused by perturbations from the companion. A stability criteria can be derived by setting a threshold on $\beta$ Focusing initially on circular orbits, we derive an analytical expression for $\beta$ for co-planar prograde and retrograde orbits. For non-coplanar configurations, we evaluate a semi-analytical expression. We then generalize to orbits with arbitrary eccentricities and account for the secular effects. Our analytical and semi-analytical results are in excellent agreement with direct N-body simulations. In addition, we show that contours of $\beta\sim0.01$ can serve as criteria for stability. More specifically, we show that (1) retrograde orbits are generally more stable than prograde ones; (2) systems with intermediate mutual inclination are less stable due to vZLK dynamics; and (3) mean-motion resonances (MMRs) can stabilize intermediate inclination secularly unstable regions in phase space, by quenching vZLK secular processes (4) MMRs can destabilize some of the dynamically stable regions. We also point out that these stability criteria can be used to constrain the orbital properties of observed systems and their age. We also point out that these stability criteria can be used to constrain the orbital properties of observed systems (in particular inclination) and their age.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Driven Turbulence in the Inner Regions of Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the important role turbulence plays in the settling and growth of dust grains in protoplanetary disks, it is crucial that we determine whether these disks are turbulent and to what extent. Protoplanetary disks are weakly ionized near the mid-plane, which has led to a paradigm in which largely laminar magnetic field structures prevail deeper in the disk, with angular momentum being transported via magnetically launched winds. Yet, there has been little exploration on the precise behavior of the gas within the bulk of the disk. We carry out 3D, local shearing box simulations that include all three low-ionization effects (Ohmic diffusion, ambipolar diffusion, and the Hall effect) to probe the nature of magnetically driven gas dynamics 1-30 AU from the central star. We find that gas turbulence can persist with a generous yet physically motivated ionization prescription (order unity Elsasser numbers). The gas velocity fluctuations range from 0.03-0.09 of the sound speed $c_s$ at the disk mid-plane to $\sim c_s$ near the disk surface, and are dependent on the initial magnetic field strength. However, the turbulent velocities do not appear to be strongly dependent on the field polarity, and thus appear to be insensitive to the Hall effect. The mid-plane turbulence has the potential to drive dust grains to collision velocities exceeding their fragmentation limit, and likely reduces the efficacy of particle clumping in the mid-plane, though it remains to be seen if this level of turbulence persists in disks with lower ionization levels.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Bulk Density of Southern Delta Aquariid Meteoroids: Insights from the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical properties of ten millimeter-sized meteoroids from the Southern Delta Aquariids (SDA) shower are derived using optical observations from the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory between 2020 and 2023. The meteors are found to ablate in two distinct erosion stages, the second stage showing a single, bright leading fragment. Our modelling interprets these observations as evidence for equal masses of compact grains embedded in a porous, low density matrix. The average bulk density of SDA meteors is found to be 1,420 $\pm$ 100 $\rm{kg \ m^{-3}}$, with the compact component having a density of 2,310 $\pm$ 160 $\rm{kg \ m^{-3}}$ and the porous component a density of $700\pm110$ $\rm{kg \ m^{-3}}$. The high bulk density of SDA meteors is comparable to densities found for the Quadrantid and Geminid showers, both of which also have low perihelion distances. This suggests that thermal desorption may play a significant role in the processing of meteoroids.</description>

      <title>Doomed Worlds I: No new evidence for orbital decay in a long-term survey of 43 ultra-hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-hot Jupiters are likely doomed by tidal forces to undergo orbital decay and eventual disruption by their stars, but the timescale over which this process unfolds is unknown. We present results from a long-term project to monitor ultra-hot Jupiters transits. We recovered WASP-12 b's orbital decay rate of dP/dt = -29.8 +/- 1.6 ms yr-1, in agreement with prior work. Five other systems initially had promising non-linear transit ephemerides. However, a closer examination of two -- WASP-19 b and CoRoT-2 b, both with prior tentative detections -- revealed several independent errors with the literature timing data; after correction neither planet shows signs of orbital decay. Meanwhile, a potential decreasing period for TrES-1 b, dP/dt = -16 +/- 5 ms yr-1, corresponds to a tidal quality factor Q*' = 160 and likely does not result from orbital decay, if driven by dissipation within the host star. Nominal period increases in two systems, WASP-121 b and WASP-46 b, rest on a small handful of points. Only 1/43 planets (WASP-12 b) in our sample is experiencing detectable orbital decay. For nearly half (20/42) we can rule out dP/dt as high as observed for WASP-12 b. Thus while many ultra-hot Jupiters could still be experiencing rapid decay that we cannot yet detect, a sizeable sub-population of UHJs are decaying at least an order of magnitude more slowly than WASP-12 b. Our reanalysis of Kepler-1658 b with no new data finds that it remains a promising orbital decay candidate. Finally, we recommend that the scientific community take steps to avoid spurious detections through better management of the multi-decade-spanning datasets needed to search for and study planetary orbital decay.</description>

      <title>Recovering the gas properties of protoplanetary disks through parametric visibility modeling: MHO 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The composition and distribution of the gas in a protoplanetary disk plays a key role in shaping the outcome of the planet formation process. Observationally, the recovery of information such as the emission height and brightness temperature from interferometric data is often limited by the imaging processes. To overcome the limitations of image-reconstruction when analyzing gas emission from interferometric observations, we have introduced a parametric model to fit the main observable properties of the gaseous disk component in the visibility plane. This approach is also known as parametric visibility modeling. We applied our parametric visibility modeling to the gas brightness distribution of the molecular line emission from 12CO J=3-2 and 13CO J=3-2 in the disk around MHO 6, a very-low-mass star in the Taurus star-forming Region. To improve the flux fidelity of our parametric models, we combined models with different pixel resolution before the computation of their visibilities, referred to as ``nesting images.'' When we apply our parametric visibility modeling to MHO 6, with independent fits to the emission from its CO isopotologues, the models return the same consistent results for the stellar mass, disk geometry, and central velocity. The surface height and brightness temperature distribution are also recovered. When compared to other disks, MHO 6 surface height is among the most elevated surfaces, consistent with the predictions for disks around very-low-mass stars. This work demonstrates the feasibility of running rapidly iterable parametric visibility models in moderate resolution and sensitivity interferometric observations. More importantly, this methodology opens the analysis of disk's gas morphology to observations where image-based techniques are unable to robustly operate, as in the case of the compact disk around MHO 6.</description>

      <title>Orbital dynamics in the GG Tau A system: investigating its enigmatic disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GG Tau is one of the most studied multiple young stellar systems: GG Tau A is a hierarchical triple surrounded by a massive disc and its companion, GG Tau B, is also a binary. Despite numerous observational attempts, an understanding of the geometry of the GG Tau A system is still elusive. We provide new astrometric measures of the system and we run a set of hydrodynamical simulations with two representative orbits to test how they impact a disc composed of dust and gas. We test the dynamical evolution of the two scenarios on short and long timescales. We obtain synthetic flux emission from our simulations and we compare them with 1300 $\mu$m ALMA dust continuum emission and 1.67 $\mu$m SPHERE dust scattering images to infer the most likely orbital arrangement. We extend the analysis of the binary orbital parameters using six new epochs from archival data, showing that the current measurements alone are not capable of breaking the degeneracy between families of coplanar and misaligned orbits. We found that the time-scale for the onset of the disc eccentricity growth, $\tau_{ecc}$, is a fundamental time-scale for the morphology of the system. Results from numerical simulations show that the best match between is obtained with the misaligned configuration ($\Delta\theta= 30^\circ$) on timescales shorter than $\tau_{ecc}$. The results exhibit an almost circular cavity and dust ring. However, for both scenarios, the cavity size and its eccentricity quickly grow for timescales longer than $\tau_{ecc}$ and the models do not reproduce the observed morphology anymore. This implies that either the age of the system is shorter than $\tau_{ecc}$ or that the disc eccentricity growth is not triggered or dissipated. This finding raises questions on the future evolution of the GG Tau A system and, more in general, on the time evolution of eccentric binaries and their circumbinary discs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After decades of relative neglect, interest in Venus surges anew in the planetary science community and the public. New missions are planned and selected, and will pave the way to the decade of Venus, as new observations allow us to uncover some of the many mysteries our closest Solar System neighbor still harbors. Building on the legacy of past works, here, we discuss the state of our understanding of Venus, from both observation and modeling. We describe each of the envelopes of the planet, from its atmosphere to its interior with an eye for the most recent advances and current topics of interest. We then briefly discuss coupled modelling efforts to better constrain the evolution of the planet. Finally, we describe how the upcoming missions and concepts will further lift the veil on Venus' secrets.</description>

      <title>BeyonCE -- Light Curve Modelling Beyond Circular Eclipsers I. Shallot Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Time-series photometry has given astronomers the tools to study time-dependent astrophysical phenomena, from stellar activity to fast radio bursts and exoplanet transits. Transit events in particular are focused primarily on planetary transits, and eclipsing binaries with eclipse geometries that are parameterised with a few variables, while more complex light curves caused by substructure within the transiting object require customized analysis code.
  Aims. We present Beyond Circular Eclipsers (BeyonCE), which reduces the parameter space encompassed by the transit of circum-secondary disc (CSD) systems with azimuthally symmetric non-uniform optical depth profiles. By rejecting disc geometries that cannot reproduce the measured gradients within their light curves, we can constrain the size and orientation of discs with complex sub-structure.
  Methods. We map out all the possible geometries of a disc, calculate the gradients for rings crossing the star, then reject those configurations where the measured gradient of the light curve is greater than the theoretical gradient from the given disc orientation.
  Results. We present the fitting code BeyonCE and demonstrate its effectiveness in considerably reducing the parameter space of discs that contain azimuthally symmetric structure by analyzing the light curves seen towards J1407 and PDS 110 which are attributed to CSD transits.</description>

      <title>Topology of shallow-water waves on the rotating sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological properties of the spectrum of shallow-water waves on a rotating spherical body are established. Particular attention is paid to its spectral flow, i.e. the modes whose frequencies transit between the Rossby and inertia-gravity wavebands as the zonal wave number is varied. Organising the modes according to the number of zeros of their meridional velocity, we conclude that the net number of modes transiting between the shallow-water wavebands on the sphere is null, in contrast with the Matsuno spectrum. This difference can be explained by a miscount of zeros under the $\beta$-plane approximation. We corroborate this result with the analysis of Delplace et al (2017) by showing that the curved metric discloses a pair of degeneracy points in the Weyl symbol of the wave operator, non-existent under the $\beta$-plane approximation, each of them bearing a Chern number $-1$.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of temporal variability of long-duration bursts of high-energy radiation associated with thunderclouds on the Tibetan plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From 1998 to 2017, neutron monitors located at an altitude of 4300 m on the Tibetan plateau detected 127 long-duration bursts of high-energy radiation in association with thunderclouds. These bursts typically lasted for 10 to 40 minutes, and 89\% of them occurred between 10:00 and 24:00 local time. They were also found to be more likely to occur at night, especially during 18:00$-$06:00 local time period. The observed diurnal and seasonal variations in burst frequency were consistent with the frequencies of lightning and precipitation on the Tibetan plateau. Based on 19 years of data, the present study suggests that an annual variation in burst frequency has a periodicity of $\sim$16 years and a lag of $\sim$3 years relative to solar activity.</description>

      <title>Orbital and Atmospheric Characterization of the 1RXS J034231.8+121622 System Using High-Resolution Spectroscopy Confirms That The Companion is a Low-Mass Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 1RXS J034231.8+121622 system consists of an M dwarf primary and a directly imaged low-mass stellar companion. We use high resolution spectroscopic data from Keck/KPIC to estimate the objects' atmospheric parameters and radial velocities (RVs). Using PHOENIX stellar models, we find that the primary has a temperature of 3460 $\pm$ 50 K a metallicity of 0.16 $\pm$ 0.04, while the secondary has a temperature of 2510 $\pm$ 50 K and a metallicity of $0.13\substack{+0.12 \\ -0.11}$. Recent work suggests this system is associated with the Hyades, placing it an older age than previous estimates. Both metallicities agree with current $[Fe/H]$ Hyades measurements (0.11 -- 0.21). Using stellar evolutionary models, we obtain significantly higher masses for the objects, of 0.30 $\pm$ 0.15 $M_\odot$ and 0.08 $\pm$ 0.01 $M_\odot$ (84 $\pm$ 11 $M_{Jup}$) respectively. Using the RVs and a new astrometry point from Keck/NIRC2, we find that the system is likely an edge-on, moderately eccentric ($0.41\substack{+0.27 \\ -0.08}$) configuration. We also estimate the C/O ratio of both objects using custom grid models, obtaining 0.42 $\pm$ 0.10 (primary) and 0.55 $\pm$ 0.10 (companion). From these results, we confirm that this system most likely went through a binary star formation process in the Hyades. The significant changes in this system's parameters since its discovery highlight the importance of high resolution spectroscopy for both orbital and atmospheric characterization of directly imaged companions.</description>

      <title>M-dwarf flares in the Zwicky Transient Facility data and what we can learn from them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the possibility of detecting M-dwarf flares using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility data releases (ZTF DRs). We employ two different approaches: the traditional method of parametric fit search and a machine learning algorithm originally developed for anomaly detection. We analyzed over 35 million ZTF light curves and visually scrutinized 1168 candidates suggested by the algorithms to filter out artifacts, occultations of a star by an asteroid, and known variable objects of other types. Our final sample comprises 134 flares with amplitude ranging from 0.2 to 4.6 magnitudes, including repeated flares and complex flares with multiple components. Using Pan-STARRS DR2 colors, we also assigned a corresponding spectral subclass to each object in the sample. For 13 flares with well-sampled light curves, we estimated the bolometric energy. Our results show that the ZTF's cadence strategy is suitable for identifying M-dwarf flares and other fast transients, allowing for the extraction of significant astrophysical information from their light curves.</description>

      <title>DIAmante TESS AutoRegressive Planet Search (DTARPS): I. Analysis of 0.9 Million Light Curves</title>

Abstract: Nearly one million light curves from the TESS Year 1 southern hemisphere extracted from Full Frame Images with the DIAmante pipeline are processed through the AutoRegressive Planet Search statistical procedure. ARIMA models remove trends and lingering autocorrelated noise, the Transit Comb Filter identifies the strongest periodic signal in the light curve, and a Random Forest machine learning classifier is trained and applied to identify the best potential candidates. Classifier training sets include injections of both planetary transit signals and contaminating eclipsing binaries. The optimized classifier has a True Positive Rate of 92.8% and a False Positive Rate of 0.37% from the labeled training set. The result of this DIAmante TESS autoregressive planet search (DTARPS) analysis is a list of 7,377 potential exoplanet candidates. The classifier has a False Positive Rate of 0.3%, a 64% recall rate for previously confirmed exoplanets, and a 78% negative recall rate for known False Positives. The completeness map of the injected planetary signals shows high recall rates for planets with 8 - 30 R(Earth) radii and periods 0.6-13 days and poor completeness for planets with radii &lt; 2 R(Earth) or periods &lt; 1 day. The list has many False Alarms and False Positives that need to be culled with multifaceted vetting operations (Paper II).</description>

      <title>DIAmante TESS AutoRegressive Planet Search (DTARPS): II. Hundreds of New TESS Candidate Exoplanets</title>

Abstract: The DIAmante TESS AutoRegressive Planet Search (DTARPS) project seeks to identify photometric transiting planets from 976,814 southern hemisphere stars observed in Year 1 of the TESS mission. This paper follows the methodology developed by Melton et al. (Paper I) using light curves extracted and pre-processed by the DIAmante project (Montalto et al. 2020). Paper I emerged with a list of 7,377 light curves with statistical properties characteristic of transiting planets but dominated by False Alarms and False Positives. Here a multistage vetting procedure is applied including: centroid motion and crowding metrics, False Alarm and False Positive reduction, photometric binary elimination, and ephemeris match removal. The vetting produces a catalog of 462 DTARPS Candidates across the southern ecliptic hemisphere and 310 objects in a spatially incomplete Galactic Plane list. Fifty-eight percent were not previously identified as transiting systems. Candidates are flagged for possible blending from nearby stars based on Zwicky Transient Facility data and for possible radial velocity variations based on Gaia satellite data. Orbital periods and planetary radii are refined using astrophysical modeling; the resulting parameters closely match published values for Confirmed Planets. Their properties are discussed in Paper III.</description>

      <title>The occurrence of small, short-period planets younger than 200 Myr with TESS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the first few hundreds of millions of years, many physical processes sculpt the eventual properties of young planets. NASA's TESS mission has surveyed young stellar associations across the entire sky for transiting planets providing glimpses into the various stages of planetary evolution. Using our own detection pipeline, we search a magnitude-limited sample of 7219 young stars ($\leq$200 Myr) observed in the first four years of TESS for small (2-8 R$_\oplus$), short period (1.6-20 days) transiting planets. The completeness of our survey is characterized by a series of injection and recovery simulations. Our analysis of TESS 2-minute cadence and Full Frame Image (FFI) light curves recover all known TOIs, as well as four new planet candidates not previously identified as TOIs. We derive an occurrence rate of $35^{+13}_{-10}$% for mini-Neptunes and $27^{+10}_{-8}$% for super-Neptunes from the 2-minute cadence data, and $22^{+8.6}_{-6.8}$% for mini-Neptunes and $13^{+3.9}_{-4.9}$% for super-Neptunes from FFI data. To independently validate our results, we compare our survey yield with the predicted planet yield assuming Kepler planet statistics. We consistently find a mild increase in the occurrence of super-Neptunes and a significant increase in the occurrence of Neptune-sized planets with orbital periods of 6.2-12 days when compared to their mature counterparts. The young planet distribution from our study is most consistent with evolution models describing the early contraction of hydrogen-dominated atmospheres undergoing atmospheric escape and inconsistent with heavier atmosphere models offering only mild radial contraction early on.</description>

      <title>Sites of Planet Formation in Binary Systems. I. Evidence for Disk-Orbit Alignment in the Close Binary FO Tau</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Close binary systems present challenges to planet formation. As binary separations decrease, so too do the occurrence rates of protoplanetary disks in young systems and planets in mature systems. For systems that do retain disks, their disk masses and sizes are altered by the presence of the binary companion. Through the study of protoplanetary disks in binary systems with known orbital parameters, we seek to determine the properties that promote disk retention and, therefore, planet formation. In this work, we characterize the young binary-disk system, FO Tau. We determine the first full orbital solution for the system, finding masses of $0.35^{+0.06}_{-0.05}\ M_\odot$ and $0.34\pm0.05\ M_\odot$ for the stellar components, a semi-major axis of $22(^{+2}_{-1})$ AU, and an eccentricity of $0.21(^{+0.04}_{-0.03})$. With long-baseline ALMA interferometry, we detect 1.3mm continuum and $^{12}{\mathrm{CO}} \ (J=2-1)$ line emission toward each of the binary components; no circumbinary emission is detected. The protoplanetary disks are compact, consistent with being truncated by the binary orbit. The dust disks are unresolved in the image plane and the more extended gas disks are only marginally resolved. Fitting the continuum and CO visibilities, we determine the inclination of each disk, finding evidence for alignment of the disk and binary orbital planes. This study is the first of its kind linking the properties of circumstellar protoplanetary disks to a precisely known binary orbit. In the case of FO Tau, we find a dynamically placid environment (coplanar, low eccentricity), which may foster its potential for planet formation.</description>

      <title>Thermal Structure Determines Kinematics: Vertical Shear Instability in Stellar Irradiated Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence is crucial for protoplanetary disk dynamics, and Vertical Shear Instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism in outer disk regions to generate turbulence. We use Athena++ radiation module to study VSI in full and transition disks, accounting for radiation transport and stellar irradiation. We find that the thermal structure and cooling timescale significantly influence VSI behavior. The inner rim location and radial optical depth affect disk kinematics. Compared with previous vertically-isothermal simulations, our full disk and transition disks with small cavities have a superheated atmosphere and cool midplane with long cooling timescales, which suppresses the corrugation mode and the associated meridional circulation. This temperature structure also produces a strong vertical shear at $\mathrm{\tau_*}$ = 1, producing an outgoing flow layer at $\tau_* &lt; 1$ on top of an ingoing flow layer at $\tau_* \sim 1$. The midplane becomes less turbulent, while the surface becomes more turbulent with effective $\alpha$ reaching $\sim10^{-2}$ at $\tau_* \lesssim$1. This large surface stress drives significant surface accretion, producing substructures. Using temperature and cooling time measured/estimated from radiation-hydro simulations, we demonstrate that less computationally-intensive simulations incorporating simple orbital cooling can almost reproduce radiation-hydro results. By generating synthetic images, we find that substructures are more pronounced in disks with larger cavities. The higher velocity dispersion at the gap edge could also slow particle settling. Both properties are consistent with recent Near-IR and ALMA observations. Our simulations predict that regions with significant temperature changes are accompanied by significant velocity changes, which can be tested by ALMA kinematics/chemistry observations.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Atmospheric Dispersion Correction of the Gemini Planet Imager: residual dispersion above design requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector (ADC) of the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) corrects the chromatic dispersion caused by differential atmospheric refraction (DAR), making it an important optic for exoplanet observation. Despite requiring less than 5 mas of residual DAR to avoid potentially affecting the coronagraph, the GPI ADC averages $\sim7$ and $\sim11$ mas of residual DAR in $H$ and $J$ band respectively. We analyzed GPI data in those bands to find explanations for the underperformance. We found the model GPI uses to predict DAR underestimates humidity's impact on incident DAR, causing on average a 0.54 mas increase in $H$ band residual DAR. Additionally, the GPI ADC consistently undercorrects in $H$ band by about 7 mas, causing almost all the $H$ band residual DAR. $J$ band does not have such an offset. Perpendicular dispersion induced by the GPI ADC, potentially from a misalignment in the prisms' relative orientation, causes 86% of the residual DAR in $J$ band. Correcting these issues could reduce residual DAR, thereby improving exoplanet detection. We also made a new approximation for the index of refraction of air from 0.7 microns to 1.36 microns that more accurately accounts for the effects of humidity.</description>

      <title>Tianyu: search for the second solar system and explore the dynamic universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn, play important roles in the formation and habitability of Earth-like planets. The detection of solar system analogs that have multiple cold giant planets is essential for our understanding of planet habitability and planet formation. Although transit surveys such as Kepler and TESS have discovered thousands of exoplanets, these missions are not sensitive to long period planets due to their limited observation baseline. The Tianyu project, comprising two 1-meter telescopes (Tianyu-I and II), is designed to detect transiting cold giant planets in order to find solar system analogs. Featuring a large field of view and equipped with a high-speed CMOS camera, Tianyu-I will perform a high-precision photometric survey of about 100 million stars, measuring light curves at hour-long cadence. The candidates found by Tianyu-I will be confirmed by Tianyu-II and other surveys and follow-up facilities through multi-band photometry, spectroscopy, and high resolution imaging. Tianyu telescopes will be situated at an elevation about 4000 meters in Lenghu, China. With a photometric precision of 1% for stars with V &lt; 18 mag, Tianyu is expected to find more than 300 transiting exoplanets, including about 12 cold giant planets, over five years. A five-year survey of Tianyu would discover 1-2 solar system analogs. Moreover, Tianyu is also designed for non-exoplanetary exploration, incorporating multiple survey modes covering timescales from sub-seconds to months, with a particular emphasis on events occurring within the sub-second to hour range. It excels in observing areas such as infant supernovae, rare variable stars and binaries, tidal disruption events, Be stars, cometary activities, and interstellar objects. These discoveries not only enhance our comprehension of the universe but also offer compelling opportunities for public engagement in scientific exploration.</description>
