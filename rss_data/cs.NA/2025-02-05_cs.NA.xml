      <title>Strictly equivalent a~posteriori error estimators for quasi-optimal nonconforming methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise a posteriori error estimators for quasi-optimal nonconforming finite element methods approximating symmetric elliptic problems of second and fourth order. These estimators are defined for all source terms that are admissible to the underlying weak formulations. More importantly, they are equivalent to the error in a strict sense. In particular, their data oscillation part is bounded by the error and, furthermore, can be designed to be bounded by classical data oscillations. The estimators are computable, except for the data oscillation part. Since even the computation of some bound of the oscillation part is not possible in general, we advocate to handle it on a case-by-case basis. We illustrate the practical use of two estimators obtained for the Crouzeix-Raviart method applied to the Poisson problem with a source term that is not a function and its singular part with respect to the Lebesgues measure is not aligned with the mesh.</description>

      <title>Robust virtual element methods for 3D stress-assisted diffusion problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an initial exploration of stress-assisted diffusion problems in three dimensions within the framework of the virtual element method (VEM). Hilbert spaces enriched with parameter-weighted norms, the extended Babu\v{s}ka-Brezzi-Braess theory for perturbed saddle-point problems, and Banach fixed-point theory play a crucial role in performing a robust analysis of the fully coupled non-linear system. The proposed virtual element formulations are provided with appropriate projection, interpolation, and stabilisation operators that ensures the well-posedness of the discrete problem. Numerical simulations are conducted to show the accuracy, performance, and applicability of the method.</description>

      <title>Fully discrete analysis of the Galerkin POD neural network approximation with application to 3D acoustic wave scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the approximation of parametric maps using the so-called Galerkin POD-NN method. This technique combines the computation of a reduced basis via proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and artificial neural networks (NNs) for the construction of fast surrogates of said parametric maps. We provide a fully discrete error analysis of this method that accounts for different discretization errors, including the number of reduced basis in the approximation of the solution manifold, truncation in the parameter space, and, most importantly, the number of samples in the computation of the reduced space, together with the effect of the use of NNs in the approximation of the reduced coefficients. Following this error analysis we provide a-priori bounds on the required POD tolerance, the resulting POD ranks, and NN-parameters to maintain the order of convergence of quasi Monte Carlo sampling techniques. The main advantage of Galerkin POD-NN over existing traditional techniques is that the online and offline phases of the projection-based reduced basis method are completely decoupled, making the evaluation of the constructed surrogate in run-time considerably faster without the need for an hyper-reduction technique. We conclude this work by showcasing the applicability of this method through a practical industrial application: the sound-soft acoustic scattering problem by a parametrically defined scatterer in three physical dimensions.</description>

      <title>Randomized block-Krylov subspace methods for low-rank approximation of matrix functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The randomized SVD is a method to compute an inexpensive, yet accurate, low-rank approximation of a matrix. The algorithm assumes access to the matrix through matrix-vector products (matvecs). Therefore, when we would like to apply the randomized SVD to a matrix function, $f(A)$, one needs to approximate matvecs with $f(A)$ using some other algorithm, which is typically treated as a black-box. Chen and Hallman (SIMAX 2023) argued that, in the common setting where matvecs with $f(A)$ are approximated using Krylov subspace methods (KSMs), more efficient low-rank approximation is possible if we open this black-box. They present an alternative approach that significantly outperforms the naive combination of KSMs with the randomized SVD, although the method lacked theoretical justification. In this work, we take a closer look at the method, and provide strong and intuitive error bounds that justify its excellent performance for low-rank approximation of matrix functions.</description>

      <title>A Kolmogorov High Order Deep Neural Network for High Frequency Partial Differential Equations in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Kolmogorov high order deep neural network (K-HOrderDNN) for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), which improves the high order deep neural networks (HOrderDNNs). HOrderDNNs have been demonstrated to outperform conventional DNNs for high frequency problems by introducing a nonlinear transformation layer consisting of $(p+1)^d$ basis functions. However, the number of basis functions grows exponentially with the dimension $d$, which results in the curse of dimensionality (CoD). Inspired by the Kolmogorov superposition theorem (KST), which expresses a multivariate function as superpositions of univariate functions and addition, K-HOrderDNN utilizes a HOrderDNN to efficiently approximate univariate inner functions instead of directly approximating the multivariate function, reducing the number of introduced basis functions to $d(p+1)$. We theoretically demonstrate that CoD is mitigated when target functions belong to a dense subset of continuous multivariate functions. Extensive numerical experiments show that: for high-dimensional problems ($d$=10, 20, 50) where HOrderDNNs($p&gt;1$) are intractable, K-HOrderDNNs($p&gt;1$) exhibit remarkable performance. Specifically, when $d=10$, K-HOrderDNN($p=7$) achieves an error of 4.40E-03, two orders of magnitude lower than that of HOrderDNN($p=1$) (see Table 10); for high frequency problems, K-HOrderDNNs($p&gt;1$) can achieve higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence rates compared to HOrderDNNs (see Table 8).</description>

      <title>Cyclic behavior of masonry barrel vaults strengthened through Composite Reinforced Mortar, considering the role of the connection with the abutments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The original results of experimental investigations concerning the reduction of the seismic vulnerability of masonry vaults through Composite Reinforced Mortar CRM are presented in the paper. The transversal performances of full scale, masonry barrel vault samples, i.e. running bond pattern vaults and brick in folio vaults, carrying their own weight and reinforced at the extrados or at the intrados are investigated through cyclic tests. The connection of the reinforced vaults with the masonry abutment is particularly considered and discussed, due to the importance of this detail to avoid uplift and slip at the skewback sections and better exploit the CRM benefits. The experimental behavior of the vault samples is described and analyzed in terms of global behavior, crack pattern and load displacement curves, also in comparison with the unreinforced configurations. The CRM allowed significant improvements in both vaults strength and displacement capacities, as contrasted the cracks opening and foster the spreading of cracks all along the vault. Considerable performances emerged also in terms of dissipative capacities, with a mean damping value of about 0.13 in the post cracking configuration. The vault-to-wall connection, based on embedded steel and composite bars, resulted essential for avoiding dangerous vault sliding at skewback sections, that may reduce the vault performances and also cause the fall from the support.</description>

      <title>Implicit integration factor method coupled with Pad\'{e} approximation strategy for nonlocal Allen-Cahn equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space nonlocal Allen-Cahn equation is a famous example of fractional reaction-diffusion equations. It is also an extension of the classical Allen-Cahn equation, which is widely used in physics to describe the phenomenon of two-phase fluid flows.Due to the nonlocality of the nonlocal operator, numerical solutions to these equations face considerable challenges.It is worth noting that whether we use low-order or high-order numerical differential formulas to approximate the operator, the corresponding matrix is always dense, which implies that the storage space and computational cost required for the former and the latter are the same. However, the higher-order formula can significantly improve the accuracy of the numerical scheme.Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to construct a high-order numerical formula that approximates the nonlocal operator.To reduce the time step limitation in existing numerical algorithms, we employed a technique combining the compact integration factor method with the Pad\'{e} approximation strategy to discretize the time derivative.A novel high-order numerical scheme, which satisfies both the maximum principle and energy stability for the space nonlocal Allen-Cahn equation, is proposed.Furthermore, we provide a detailed error analysis of the differential scheme, which shows that its convergence order is $\mathcal{O}\left(\tau^2+h^6\right)$.Especially, it is worth mentioning that the fully implicit scheme with sixth-order accuracy in spatial has never been proven to maintain the maximum principle and energy stability before.Finally, some numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Mathematical analysis and numerical simulation of coupled nonlinear space-fractional Ginzburg-Landau equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupled nonlinear space fractional Ginzburg-Landau (CNLSFGL) equations with the fractional Laplacian have been widely used to model the dynamical processes in
  a fractal media with fractional dispersion. Due to the existence of fractional power derivatives and strong nonlinearity, it is extremely difficult to mathematically analyze the CNLSFGL equations and construct efficient numerical algorithms. For this reason, this paper aims to investigate the theoretical results about the considered system and construct a novel high-order numerical scheme for this coupled system. We prove
  rigorously an a priori estimate of the solution to the coupled system and the well-posedness of its weak solution. Then, to develop the efficient numerical algorithm, we construct a fourth-order numerical differential formula to approximate the fractional Laplacian. Based on this formula, we
  construct a high-order implicit difference scheme for the coupled system. Furthermore,
  the unique solvability and convergence of the established algorithm are proved in detail.
  To implement the implicit algorithm efficiently, an iterative algorithm is designed in
  the numerical simulation. Extensive numerical examples are reported to further
  demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the efficiency of the proposed numerical algorithm.</description>

      <title>Integrability of weak mixed first-order derivatives and convergence rates of scrambled digital nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $L^p$ integrability of weak mixed first-order derivatives of the integrand and study convergence rates of scrambled digital nets. We show that the generalized Vitali variation with parameter $\alpha \in [\frac{1}{2}, 1]$ from [Dick and Pillichshammer, 2010] is bounded above by the $L^p$ norm of the weak mixed first-order derivative, where $p = \frac{2}{3-2\alpha}$. Consequently, when the weak mixed first-order derivative belongs to $L^p$ for $1 \leq p \leq 2$, the variance of the scrambled digital nets estimator convergences at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(N^{-4+\frac{2}{p}} \log^{s-1} N)$. Numerical experiments further validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Iterative Refinement and Flexible Iteratively Reweighed Solvers for Linear Inverse Problems with Sparse Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new algorithmic framework for computing sparse solutions to large-scale linear discrete ill-posed problems. The approach is motivated by recent perspectives on iteratively reweighted norm schemes, viewed through the lens of iterative refinement. This framework leverages the efficiency and fast convergence of flexible Krylov methods while achieving higher accuracy through suitable restarts. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform other flexible Krylov approaches in memory-limited scenarios. Relevant convergence theory is discussed, and the performance of the proposed algorithms is illustrated through a range of numerical examples, including image deblurring and computed tomography.</description>

      <title>Parareal Algorithms for Stochastic Maxwell Equations Driven by Multiplicative Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the parareal algorithms for solving the stochastic Maxwell equations driven by multiplicative noise, focusing on their convergence, computational efficiency and numerical performance. The algorithms use the stochastic exponential integrator as the coarse propagator, while both the exact integrator and the stochastic exponential integrator are used as fine propagators. Theoretical analysis shows that the mean square convergence rates of the two algorithms selected above are proportional to $k/2$, depending on the iteration number of the algorithms. Numerical experiments validate these theoretical findings, demonstrating that larger iteration numbers $k$ improve convergence rates, while larger damping coefficients $\sigma$ accelerate the convergence of the algorithms. Furthermore, the algorithms maintain high accuracy and computational efficiency, highlighting their significant advantages over traditional exponential methods in long-term simulations.</description>

      <title>Inf-sup condition for Stokes with outflow condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inf-sup condition is one of the essential tools in the analysis of the Stokes equations and especially in numerical analysis. In its usual form, the condition states that for every pressure $p\in L^2(\Omega)\setminus \mathbb{R}$, (i.e. with mean value zero) a velocity $u\in H^1_0(\Omega)^d$ can be found, so that $(div\,u,p)=\|p\|^2$ and $\|\nabla u\|\le c \|p\|$ applies, where $c&gt;0$ does not depend on $u$ and $p$. However, if we consider domains that have a Neumann-type outflow condition on part of the boundary $\Gamma_N\subset\partial\Omega$, the inf-sup condition cannot be used in this form, since the pressure here comes from $L^2(\Omega)$ and does not necessarily have zero mean value. In this note, we derive the inf-sup condition for the case of outflow boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the dynamics of moving fronts in three-dimensional spaces, which form as a result of in-situ combustion during oil production. This phenomenon is also observed in other contexts, such as various autowave models and the propagation of acoustic waves. Our analysis involves a singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion-advection type initial-boundary value problem of a general form. We employ methods from asymptotic theory to develop an approximate smooth solution with an internal layer. Using local coordinates, we focus on the transition layer, where the solution undergoes rapid changes. Once the location of the transition layer is established, we can describe the solution across the full domain of the problem. Numerical examples are provided, demonstrating the high accuracy of the asymptotic method in predicting the behaviors of moving fronts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of Discontinuous Galerkin methods, we study approximations of nonlinear variational problems associated with convex energies. We propose element-wise nonconforming finite element methods to discretize the continuous minimisation problem. Using $\Gamma$-convergence arguments we show that the discrete minimisers converge to the unique minimiser of the continuous problem as the mesh parameter tends to zero, under the additional contribution of appropriately defined penalty terms at the level of the discrete energies. We finally substantiate the feasibility of our methods by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Local Reduced-Order Modeling for Electrostatic Plasmas by Physics-Informed Solution Manifold Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18493v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite advancements in high-performance computing and modern numerical algorithms, computational cost remains prohibitive for multi-query kinetic plasma simulations. In this work, we develop data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) for collisionless electrostatic plasma dynamics, based on the kinetic Vlasov-Poisson equation. Our ROM approach projects the equation onto a linear subspace defined by the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes. We introduce an efficient tensorial method to update the nonlinear term using a precomputed third-order tensor. We capture multiscale behavior with a minimal number of POD modes by decomposing the solution manifold into multiple time windows and creating temporally local ROMs. We consider two strategies for decomposition: one based on the physical time and the other based on the electric field energy. Applied to the 1D1V Vlasov-Poisson simulations, that is, prescribed E-field, Landau damping, and two-stream instability, we demonstrate that our ROMs accurately capture the total energy of the system both for parametric and time extrapolation cases. The temporally local ROMs are more efficient and accurate than the single ROM. In addition, in the two-stream instability case, we show that the energy-windowing reduced-order model (EW-ROM) is more efficient and accurate than the time-windowing reduced-order model (TW-ROM). With the tensorial approach, EW-ROM solves the equation approximately 90 times faster than Eulerian simulations while maintaining a maximum relative error of 7.5% for the training data and 11% for the testing data.</description>

      <title>A new numerical technique based on Chelyshkov polynomials for solving two-dimensional stochastic It\^o-Volterra Fredholm integral equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a two-dimensional operational matrix method based on Chelyshkov polynomials is implemented to numerically solve the two-dimensional stochastic It\^o-Volterra Fredholm integral equations. These equations arise in several problems such as an exponential population growth model with several independent white noise sources. In this paper a new stochastic operational matrix has been derived first time ever by using Chelyshkov polynomials. After that, the operational matrices are used to transform the It\^o-Volterra Fredholm integral equation into a system of linear algebraic equations by using Newton cotes nodes as collocation point that can be easily solved. Furthermore, the convergence and error bound of the suggested method are well established. In order to illustrate the effectiveness, plausibility, reliability, and applicability of the existing technique, two typical examples have been presented.</description>

Abstract: In this study, two reliable approaches to solving the nonlinear stochastic It\^o-Volterra integral equation are provided. These equations have been evaluated using the orthonormal Chelyshkov spectral collocation technique and the orthonormal Chelyshkov spectral Galerkin method. The techniques presented here transform this problem into a collection of nonlinear algebraic equations that have been numerically solved using the Newton method. Also, the convergence analysis has been studied for both approaches. Two illustrative examples have been provided to show the efficacy, plausibility, proficiency, and applicability of the current approaches.</description>

      <title>Fast Algorithm for Quasi-2D Coulomb Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-2D Coulomb systems are of fundamental importance and have attracted much attention in many areas nowadays. Their reduced symmetry gives rise to interesting collective behaviors, but also brings great challenges for particle-based simulations. Here, we propose a novel algorithm framework to address the $O(N^2)$ simulation complexity associated with the long-range nature of Coulomb interactions. First, we introduce an efficient Sum-of-Exponentials (SOE) approximation for the long-range kernel associated with Ewald splitting, achieving uniform convergence in terms of inter-particle distance, which reduces the complexity to $O(N^{7/5})$. We then introduce a random batch sampling method in the periodic dimensions, the stochastic approximation is proven to be both unbiased and with reduced variance via a tailored importance sampling strategy, further reducing the computational cost to $O(N)$. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated via various numerical examples. Notably, it achieves a speedup of $2\sim 3$ orders of magnitude comparing with Ewald2D method, enabling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with up to $10^6$ particles on a single core. The present approach is therefore well-suited for large-scale particle-based simulations of Coulomb systems under confinement, making it possible to investigate the role of Coulomb interaction in many practical situations.</description>

      <title>Graph $p$-Laplacian eigenpairs as saddle points of a family of spectral energy functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of computing the graph $p$-Laplacian eigenpairs for $p\in (2,\infty)$. We propose a reformulation of the graph $p$-Laplacian eigenvalue problem in terms of a constrained weighted Laplacian eigenvalue problem and discuss theoretical and computational advantages. We provide a correspondence between $p$-Laplacian eigenpairs and linear eigenpair of a constrained generalized weighted Laplacian eigenvalue problem. As a result, we can assign an index to any $p$-Laplacian eigenpair that matches the Morse index of the $p$-Rayleigh quotient evaluated at the eigenfunction. In the second part of the paper we introduce a class of spectral energy functions that depend on edge and node weights. We prove that differentiable saddle points of the $k$-th energy function correspond to $p$-Laplacian eigenpairs having index equal to $k$. Moreover, the first energy function is proved to possess a unique saddle point which corresponds to the unique first $p$-Laplacian eigenpair. Finally we develop novel gradient-based numerical methods suited to compute $p$-Laplacian eigenpairs for any $p\in(2,\infty)$ and present some experiments.</description>

      <title>Block structured matrix-sequences and their spectral and singular value canonical distributions: a general theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years more and more involved block structures appeared in the literature in the context of numerical approximations of complex infinite dimensional operators modeling real-world applications. In various settings, thanks the theory of generalized locally Toeplitz matrix-sequences, the asymptotic distributional analysis is well understood, but a general theory is missing when general block structures are involved. The central part of the current work deals with such a delicate generalization when blocks are of (block) unilevel Toeplitz type, starting from a problem of recovery with missing data. Visualizations, numerical tests, and few open problems are presented and critically discussed.</description>

      <title>Bound Preserving Lax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction Method for Special Relativistic Hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lax-Wendroff flux reconstruction (LWFR) schemes have high order of accuracy in both space and time despite having a single internal time step. Here, we design a Jacobian-free LWFR type scheme to solve the special relativistic hydrodynamics equations on Cartesian grids. We then blend the scheme with a first-order finite volume scheme to control the oscillations near discontinuities. We also use a scaling limiter to preserve the physical admissibility of the solution after ensuring the scheme is admissible in means. A particular focus is given to designing a discontinuity indicator model to detect the local non-smoothness in the solution of the highly non-linear relativistic hydrodynamics equations. Finally, we present numerical results for a wide range of test cases to show the robustness and efficiency of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Implicit Time-Marching for Lagrange Multiplier Formulation for Couple Stress Elastodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of metamaterials and architected materials has intensified interest in continuum mechanics models that capture size-dependent microstructure interactions. Among these, Consistent Couple-Stress Theory (C-CST) incorporates microscale mechanical interactions by introducing higher-order derivatives in the strain energy. While previous studies have relied on convolutional principles or inverse Laplace transforms to obtain time-dependent solutions, this work demonstrates that implicit time integration applied to a mixed finite element method with a Lagrange multiplier provides stable, direct time-domain solutions for dynamic C-CST modeling. The proposed finite element scheme is tested through the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) for static cases and dynamic simulations of simple mechanical scenarios.
  Our computational experiments revealed energy dissipation, emphasizing the importance of exploring symplectic integrators in future work to impose energy conservation. Additionally, further research is required to verify temporal stability through time-domain MMS and to investigate complex mechanical scenarios, including those previously restrictive, challenging to simulate, or unfeasible with existing dynamic methods. This work lays the groundwork for studying size-dependent material behavior and provides the foundation for advanced applications in material design and wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Scalability of Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary Matrices for Ground State Preparation through Adaptive Finer Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09091v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a domain where quantum computers have the potential to outperform their classical counterparts. One of the main challenges of such quantum algorithms is increasing the system size, which is necessary to achieve meaningful quantum advantage. In this work, we present an approach to improve the scalability of eigenspace filtering for the ground state preparation of a given Hamiltonian. Our method aims to tackle limitations introduced by a small spectral gap and high degeneracy of low energy states. It is based on an adaptive sequence of eigenspace filtering through Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary Matrices (QETU) combined with spectrum profiling. By combining our proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art phase estimation methods, we achieved good approximations for the ground state energy with local, two-qubit gate depolarizing probability up to $10^{-4}$. To demonstrate the key results in this work, we ran simulations with the transverse-field Ising Model on classical computers using Qiskit. We compare the performance of our approach with the static implementation of QETU and show that we can consistently achieve three to four orders of magnitude improvement in the absolute error rate.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Rao Gradient Flows of Linear Programs and State-Action Natural Policy Gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kakade's natural policy gradient method has been studied extensively in recent years, showing linear convergence with and without regularization. We study another natural gradient method based on the Fisher information matrix of the state-action distributions which has received little attention from the theoretical side. Here, the state-action distributions follow the Fisher-Rao gradient flow inside the state-action polytope with respect to a linear potential. Therefore, we study Fisher-Rao gradient flows of linear programs more generally and show linear convergence with a rate that depends on the geometry of the linear program. Equivalently, this yields an estimate on the error induced by entropic regularization of the linear program which improves existing results. We extend these results and show sublinear convergence for perturbed Fisher-Rao gradient flows and natural gradient flows up to an approximation error. In particular, these general results cover the case of state-action natural policy gradients.</description>

      <title>BiLO: Bilevel Local Operator Learning for PDE inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17789v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new neural network based method for solving inverse problems for partial differential equations (PDEs) by formulating the PDE inverse problem as a bilevel optimization problem. At the upper level, we minimize the data loss with respect to the PDE parameters. At the lower level, we train a neural network to locally approximate the PDE solution operator in the neighborhood of a given set of PDE parameters, which enables an accurate approximation of the descent direction for the upper level optimization problem. The lower level loss function includes the L2 norms of both the residual and its derivative with respect to the PDE parameters. We apply gradient descent simultaneously on both the upper and lower level optimization problems, leading to an effective and fast algorithm. The method, which we refer to as BiLO (Bilevel Local Operator learning), is also able to efficiently infer unknown functions in the PDEs through the introduction of an auxiliary variable. Through extensive experiments over multiple PDE systems, we demonstrate that our method enforces strong PDE constraints, is robust to sparse and noisy data, and eliminates the need to balance the residual and the data loss, which is inherent to the soft PDE constraints in many existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate both forward and backward problems for coupled systems of time-fractional diffusion equations, encompassing scenarios of strong coupling. For the forward problem, we establish the well-posedness of the system, leveraging the eigensystem of the corresponding elliptic system as the foundation. When considering the backward problem, specifically the determination of initial values through final time observations, we demonstrate a Lipschitz stability estimate, which is consistent with the stability observed in the case of a single equation. To numerically address this backward problem, we refer to the explicit formulation of Tikhonov regularization to devise a multi-channel neural network architecture. This innovative architecture offers a versatile approach, exhibiting its efficacy in multidimensional settings through numerical examples and its robustness in handling initial values that have not been trained.</description>

      <title>An Implementation of the Finite Element Method in Hybrid Classical/Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript presents the Quantum Finite Element Method (Q-FEM) developed for use in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers and employs the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) algorithm. The proposed method leverages the classical FEM procedure to perform the unitary decomposition of the stiffness matrix and employs generator functions to design explicit quantum circuits corresponding to the unitaries. Q-FEM keeps the structure of the finite element discretization intact allowing for the use of variable element lengths and material coefficients in FEM discretization. The proposed method is tested on a steady-state heat equation discretized using linear and quadratic shape functions. Numerical verification studies are performed on the IBM QISKIT simulator and it is demonstrated that Q-FEM is effective in converging to the correct solution for a variety of problems and model discretizations, including with different element lengths, variable coefficients, and different boundary conditions. The formalism developed herein is general and can be extended to problems with higher dimensions. However, numerical examples also demonstrate that the number of parameters for the variational ansatz scale exponentially with the number of qubits to increase the odds of convergence. Moreover, the deterioration of system conditioning with problem size results in barren plateaus and convergence difficulties.</description>

      <title>An accelerated gradient method with adaptive restart for convex multiobjective optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07863v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, based on the continuous time approach, we propose an accelerated gradient method with adaptive residual restart for convex multiobjective optimization problems. For the first, we derive rigorously the continuous limit of the multiobjective accelerated proximal gradient method by Tanabe et al. [Comput. Optim. Appl., 2023]. It is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that involves a special projection operator and can be viewed as an extension of the ODE by Su et al. [J. Mach. Learn. Res., 2016] for Nesterov acceleration. Then, we introduce a novel accelerated multiobjective gradient (AMG) flow with tailored time scaling that adapts automatically to the convex case and the strongly convex case, and the exponential decay rate of a merit function along with the solution trajectory of AMG flow is established via the Lyapunov analysis. After that, we consider an implicit-explicit time discretization and obtain an accelerated multiobjective gradient method with a convex quadratic programming subproblem. The fast sublinear rate and linear rate are proved respectively for convex and strongly convex problems. In addition, we present an efficient residual based adaptive restart technique to overcome the oscillation issue and improve the convergence significantly. Numerical results are provided to validate the practical performance of the proposed method.</description>
