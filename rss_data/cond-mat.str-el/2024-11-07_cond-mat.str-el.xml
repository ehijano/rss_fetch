      <title>Geometric fractionalized Fermi liquids: Hidden antiferromagnetism and pseudogap from fluctuating stripes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key features of hole-doped cuprates is the presence of an extended pseudogap phase, whose microscopic origin has been the subject of intense investigation since its discovery and is believed to be crucial for understanding high-temperature superconductivity. Various explanations have been proposed for the pseudogap, including links to symmetry-breaking orders such as stripes or pairing, and the emergence of novel fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) phases. The topological nature of the FL* phase has been identified as a scenario compatible with a small Fermi surface without symmetry breaking, as suggested experimentally. With recent experimental and numerical studies supporting an intricate relationship between stripe order and the pseudogap phase, we here propose an alternative FL* scenario: a fractionalized Fermi liquid with a geometric origin (GFL*) driven by fluctuating domain walls. The essential mechanism behind our proposal is hidden order, where the proliferation of domain walls stabilized by charge fluctuations obscures the underlying long-range antiferromagnetic order in real-space, but order is preserved in the reference frame of the background spins. As a result, well-defined fermionic quasiparticles in the form of magnetic polarons exist, which couple to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological excitations of the domain wall string-net condensate in the ground state and constitute a small Fermi surface. At a critical doping value, we argue that hidden order is lost, driving a transition to a regular Fermi liquid at a hidden quantum critical point (hQCP) featuring quantum critical transport properties. Our GFL* framework provides a compelling connection between the antiferromagnetic, stripe, and pseudogap phases, and suggests a possible unification of superconductivity in (electron and hole) doped cuprates and heavy fermion compounds.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Phase Diagram of a Frustrated Magnet: Degeneracies, Flat Bands, and Canting Cycles on the Pyrochlore Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We map the complete classical phase diagram of the spin Hamiltonian describing pyrochlore rare-earth magnets with all symmetry-allowed nearest-neighbor bond-dependent anisotropic two-spin interactions. We provide a simple derivation of the organization of spins into tensor degrees of freedom describing the multipole moments of a tetrahedron, whose components correspond to irreducible representations (irreps) of the tetrahedral symmetry group $T_d$. By parameterizing the Hamiltonian directly in terms of the energies of the individual irreps, we perform an exhaustive search of all possible irrep degeneracies which may host stable classical spin liquids. Doing so reveals four one-parameter families of models along which three phases are degenerate, all four of which merge at the Heisenberg antiferromagnet and its dual, and we give a complete three-dimensional picture of the phase diagram showing all of the phases and their intersections. The appearance of two copies of a single irrep implies an extra degenerate locus which pierces the phase boundaries at special points, yielding two additional isolated triple points. We demonstrate that one-parameter families of Hamiltonians are characterized by a topological invariant describing how the ground state spin configuration winds when adiabatically transported around this degenerate locus, analogous to a "diabolical locus". We provide a comprehensive catalog of all flat band degeneracies in the phase diagram and discuss the mechanisms that may allow for or impede the realization of a variety of classical spin liquids described by tensor gauge fields exhibiting pinch line singularities and concomitant four-fold pinch points. Lastly, we provide a list of all cases where three irreps are degenerate above the ground state, which may lead to interesting features in the spin wave spectrum within each ordered phase.</description>

      <title>Structure factor and topological bound of twisted bilayer semiconductors at fractional fillings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure factor is a useful observable for probing charge density correlations in real materials, and its long-wavelength behavior encapsulated by ``quantum weight'' has recently gained prominence in the study of quantum geometry and topological phases of matter. Here we employ the static structure factor, S(q), to explore the phase diagram of twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), specifically tMoTe2, at a filling factors n=1/3, 2/3 under varying displacement fields. Our results reveal a topological phase transition between a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) and a generalized Wigner crystal (GWC). This transition is marked by the appearance of Bragg peaks at charge-density-wave vectors, and simultaneously, large decrease of S(q) at small q which lowers the interaction energy. We further calculate the quantum weight of various FCI states, verifying the universal topological bound. Our findings provide new insights into the phase diagram of twisted TMDs and establish a general framework for characterizing topological phases through structure factor analysis.</description>

      <title>An Atlas of Classical Pyrochlore Spin Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pyrochlore lattice magnet has been one of the most fruitful platforms for the experimental and theoretical search for spin liquids. Besides the canonical case of spin ice, works in recent years have identified a variety of new quantum and classical spin liquids from the generic nearest-neighbor anisotropic spin Hamiltonian on the pyrochlore lattice. However, a general framework for the thorough classification and characterization of these exotic states of matter has been lacking, and so is an exhaustive list of all possible spin liquids that this model can support and what is the corresponding structure of their emergent field theory. In this work, we develop such a theoretical framework to allocate interaction parameters stabilizing different classical spin liquids and derive their corresponding effective generalized emerging Gauss's laws at low temperatures. Combining this with Monte Carlo simulations, we systematically identify all classical spin liquids for the general nearest-neighbor anisotropic spin Hamiltonian on the pyrochlore lattice. We uncover new spin liquid models with exotic forms of generalized Gauss's law and multipole conservation laws. Furthermore, we present an atlas of all spin liquid regimes in the phase diagram, which illuminates the global picture of how different classical spin liquids are connected in parameter space and transition into each other. Our work serves as a treasure map for the theoretical study of classical and quantum spin liquids, as well as for the experimental search and rationalization of exotic pyrochlore lattice magnets.</description>

      <title>Theory of unconventional magnetism in a Cu-based kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome metals have established a new arena for correlated electron physics. To date, the predominant experimental evidence centers around unconventional charge order, nematicity, and superconductivity, while magnetic fluctuations due to electronic interactions, i.e., beyond local atomic magnetism, have largely been elusive. From ab initio design and many-body analysis, we develop a model framework of Cu-based kagome materials the simulations of which reveal unconventional magnetic order in a kagome metal. We find the challenge of locating the appropriate parameter regime for such exotic order to center around two aspects. First, the correlations implied by low-energy orbitals have to be sufficiently large to yield a dominance of magnetic fluctuations and weak to retain an itinerant parent state. Second, the kinematic kagome profile at the Fermi level demands an efficient mitigation of sublattice interference causing the suppression of magnetic fluctuations descending from electronic onsite repulsion. We elucidate our methodology by analyzing the proposed compound CsCu$_3$Cl$_5$, assessing its feasibility for future material synthesis.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Combinatorial Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the principle of combinatorial gauge symmetry, lattice gauge theories can be formulated with only one- and two-body interactions that ensure the exact realization of the symmetry rather than its approximate emergence in a perturbative regime. This paper extends the framework to encompass generic non-Abelian finite gauge groups by expanding on previous work that developed the theory for finite Abelian gauge groups and presented one non-Abelian example.</description>

      <title>First order Quantum Hall to Wigner crystal phase transition on a triangular lattice: an iDMRG study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study a system of interacting fermions on a triangular lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field. We neglect spin and fix a density of one third, with one unit of magnetic flux per particle. The infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) algorithm is used to compute the ground state of this generalized Fermi-Hubbard model. Increasing the strength of the nearest-neighbor repulsion, we find a first order transition between an Integer Quantum Hall phase and a crystalline, generalized Wigner crystal state. The first-order nature of the phase transition is consistent with a Ginzburg-Landau argument. We expect our results to be relevant for moir\'e heterostructures of two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Evidence for valence-bond pairing in a low-dimensional two-orbital system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Valence bond (VB) states as the formation mechanism of Cooper pairs, eventually leading to high-temperature superconductivity, remain a controversial topic. Although various VB-like states find variational relevance in the description of specific spin models and quantum spin liquids, in the realm of many-body fermionic Hamiltonians, the evidence for such states as ground states wave functions remains elusive, challenging the valence-bond pairing mechanism. Here, we present evidence of a VB ground state with pairing tendencies, particularly at finite doping. We achieved this for the generic two-orbital Hubbard model in low dimension, where the VB states can be associated with the presence of the topological order manifested by edge states. Utilizing density-matrix renormalization group calculations, the study reveals key properties akin to those observed in superconductors' phase diagrams, such as pairing restricted to the regime of small but nonzero doping, presence of coherent pairs, and density oscillations in the charge sector.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent photoemission measurements on the La$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$, we carry out a systematic study of the infinite-layer nickelate using both dynamical mean-field theory and density matrix embedding theory. The renormalized electronic structure and Fermi surface of correlated La$_{0.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ are studied in an effective two-band model through the dynamical mean-field calculation. We find the correlation effects reflect mainly on the Ni $d$ band, which is consistent with the experimental findings. We further study the ground state including magnetism and superconductivity through the density matrix embedding theory. Within the experimental doping range and rigid-band approximation, we show that the $d$-wave superconductivity is the lowest energy state, while the static magnetism is absent except very close to zero doping. These findings provide a new understanding of infinite-layer nickelate superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Electron correlation effects and spin-liquid state in the Herbertsmithite Kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ real-space variational quantum Monte Carlo methods with resonating valence bond many-body wave functions to investigate electron correlation effects in the Kagome system $Zn_xCu_{4-x}O_6$. Using three trial wave functions of the Slater-Jastrow type, where (i) only the Jastrow correlation factor is optimized and the orbitals obtained by density functional theory, (ii) both the Jastrow factor and the Slater determinant are optimized, and (iii) additionally the Slater determinant is substituted by an antisymmetrized-geminal power wave function, we analyze static and dynamic correlation energies across concentrations $x=0, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}, 1$. Our results show that the correlation energy increases with the concentration of $Zn_x$. Optimizing the Slater determinant significantly enhances the correlation energy by approximately $\sim -73(4) mHa$ per electron. Eventually, the emergence of a quantum spin liquid state driven by a long-range correlation energy is discussed.</description>

      <title>Explicit demonstration of the equivalence between DFT+U and the Hartree-Fock limit of DFT+DMFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several methods have been developed to improve the predictions of density functional theory (DFT) in the case of strongly correlated electron systems. Out of these approaches, DFT+$U$, which corresponds to a static treatment of the local interaction, and DFT combined with dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT), which considers local fluctuations, have both proven incredibly valuable in tackling the description of materials with strong local electron-electron interactions. While it is in principle known that the Hartree-Fock (HF) limit of the DFT+DMFT approach should recover DFT+$U$, demonstrating this equivalence in practice is challenging, due to the very different ways in which the two approaches are generally implemented. In this work, we introduce a way to perform DFT+$U$ calculations in Quantum ESPRESSO using Wannier functions as calculated by Wannier90, which allows us to use the same Hubbard projector functions both in DFT+$U$ and in DFT+DMFT. We benchmark these DFT+$U$ calculations against DFT+DMFT calculations where the DMFT impurity problem is solved within the HF approximation. Considering a number of prototypical materials including NiO, MnO, LaMnO$_3$, and LuNiO$_3$, we establish the sameness of the two approaches. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our approach by going beyond the commonly used atomic orbital-like projectors by performing DFT+$U$ calculations for VO$_2$ using a special set of bond-centered Wannier functions.</description>

      <title>Octupolar vortex crystal and toroidal moment in twisted bilayer MnPSe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental detection of antiferromagnetic order in two-dimensional materials is a challenging task due to the absence of net dipole moments. Identifying multi-domain antiferromagnetic textures via the current techniques is even more difficult. In order to address this challenge, we investigate the higher order multipole moments in twisted bilayer MnPSe$_3$. While the monolayers of MnPSe$_3$ exhibit in-plane N\'eel antiferromagnetic order, our atomistic simulations indicate that the moir\'e superlattices display a two-domain phase on each layer. We show that the octupolar moments $M_{33}^+$ and $M_{33}^-$ are significant in this multi-domain phase at the domain walls. In addition, when $[M_{33}^+,M_{33}^-]$ are represented by the $x$ and $y$ components of a vector, the resultant pattern of these octupole moments winds around the antiferromagnetic domains and forms to vortex crystals which leads to octupolar toroidal moments, $T_{xyz}$ and $T_{z}^{\beta}$. $T_{xyz}$ and $T_{z}^{\beta}$ can give rise to a magnetoelectric effect and gyrotropic birefringence that may provide indirect ways of detecting multi-domain antiferromagnetic order. Our results highlight the importance of higher-order multipole moments for identification of complex spin textures in moir\'e magnets.</description>

      <title>Robustness of near-thermal dynamics on digital quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10794v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of gate errors on quantum circuits is crucial to determining the potential applications of quantum computers, especially in the absence of large-scale error-corrected hardware. We put forward analytical arguments, corroborated by extensive numerical and experimental evidence, that Trotterized quantum circuits simulating the time-evolution of systems near thermal equilibrium are substantially more robust to both quantum gate errors and Trotter (discretization) errors than is widely assumed. In Quantinuum's trapped-ion computers, the weakly entangling gates that appear in Trotterized circuits can be implemented natively, and their error rate is smaller when they generate less entanglement; from benchmarking, we know that the error for a gate $\exp[-i (Z\otimes Z) \tau]$ decreases roughly linearly with $\tau$, up to a small offset at $\tau = 0$. We provide extensive evidence that this scaling, together with the robustness of near-thermal dynamics to both gate and discretization errors, facilitates substantial improvements in the achievable accuracy of Trotterized dynamics on near-term quantum computers. We make heavy use of a new theoretical tool -- a statistical ensemble of random product states that approximates a thermal state, which can be efficiently prepared with low noise on quantum computers. We outline how the random product state ensemble can be used to predict, optimize, and design Hamiltonian simulation experiments on near-thermal quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Mixed-State Topological Order under Coherent Noises</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-state phases of matter under local decoherence have recently garnered significant attention due to the ubiquitous presence of noise in current quantum processors. One of the key issues is understanding how topological quantum memory is affected by realistic coherent noises, such as random rotation noise and amplitude damping noise. In this work, we investigate the intrinsic error threshold of the two-dimensional toric code, a paradigmatic topological quantum memory, under these coherent noises by employing both analytical and numerical methods based on the doubled Hilbert space formalism. A connection between the mixed-state phase of the decohered toric code and a non-Hermitian Ashkin-Teller-type statistical mechanics model is established, and the mixed-state phase diagrams under the coherent noises are obtained. We find remarkable stability of mixed-state topological order under random rotation noise with axes near the $Y$-axis of qubits. We also identify intriguing extended critical regions at the phase boundaries, highlighting a connection with non-Hermitian physics. The upper bounds for the intrinsic error threshold are determined by these phase boundaries, beyond which quantum error correction becomes impossible.</description>

      <title>Infinitely fast critical dynamics: Teleportation through temporal rare regions in monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits with a measurement rate that fluctuates in time. The spatially correlated fluctuations in the measurement rate disrupt the volume-law phase for low measurement rates; at a critical measurement rate, they give rise to an entanglement phase transition with "ultrafast" dynamics, i.e., spacetime ($x,t$) scaling $\log x \sim t^{\psi_\tau}$. The ultrafast dynamics at the critical point can be viewed as a spacetime-rotated version of an infinite-randomness critical point; despite the spatial locality of the dynamics, ultrafast information propagation is possible because of measurement-induced quantum teleportation. We identify temporal Griffiths phases on either side of this critical point. We provide a physical interpretation of these phases, and support it with extensive numerical simulations of information propagation and entanglement dynamics in stabilizer circuits.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the matching decoder for the Chamon code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different choices of quantum error-correcting codes can reduce the demands on the physical hardware needed to build a quantum computer. To achieve the full potential of a code, we must develop practical decoding algorithms that can correct errors that have occurred with high likelihood. Matching decoders are very good at correcting local errors while also demonstrating fast run times that can keep pace with physical quantum devices. We implement variations of a matching decoder for a three-dimensional, non-CSS, low-density parity check code known as the Chamon code, which has a non-trivial structure that does not lend itself readily to this type of decoding. The non-trivial structure of the syndrome of this code means that we can supplement the decoder with additional steps to improve the threshold error rate, below which the logical failure rate decreases with increasing code distance. We find that a generalized matching decoder that is augmented by a belief-propagation step prior to matching gives a threshold of 10.5% for depolarising noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare earth intermetallic compounds crystallized in AlB$_2$-type and its low-symmetry derivative CeCu$_2$-type structures potentially host diverse frustrated magnetic structures and rich magnetotransport phenomena. We report the film growth of CeCu$_2$-type EuZn$_2$ by molecular beam epitaxy and the observation of topological Hall responses highly contrastive to isostructural EuCd$_2$. While their magnetization curves are rather similar, the topological Hall effect observed in EuZn$_2$ is simpler, with the only one component enhanced at the magnetic transition field. EuZn$_2$ may be a unique system for studying the magnetic domain boundary effect on topological Hall responses among the CeCu$_2$-type rare-earth intermetallic compounds.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of high electron-mobility, unpaired spins, and superconductivity at high carrier density SrTiO$_3$-based interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $t_{2g}$ band-structure of SrTiO$_3$-based two-dimensional electron gasses (2DEGs), have been found to play a role in features such as the superconducting dome, high-mobility transport, and the magnitude of spin-orbit coupling. This adds to the already very diverse range of phenomena, including magnetism and extreme magnetoresistance, exhibited by this particular material platform. Tuning and/or combining these intriguing attributes could yield significant progress within quantum and spintronics technologies. Doing so demands precise control of the parameters, which requires a better understanding of the factors that affect them. Here we present effects of the $t_{2g}$ band-order inversion, stemming from the growth of spinel-structured $\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ onto perovskite SrTiO$_3$. Electronic transport measurements show that with LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ as the reference, the carrier density and electron mobility are enhanced, and the sample displays a reshaping of the superconducting dome. Additionally, unpaired spins are evidenced by increasing Anomalous Hall Effect with decreasing temperature, entering the same temperature range as the superconducting transition, and a Kondo-like upturn in the sheet resistance. Finally, it is argued that the high-mobility $d_{xz/yz}$-band is more likely than the $d_{xy}$-band to host the supercurrent.</description>

      <title>Many body theory beyond GW : towards a complete description of 2-body correlated propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting with Hedins equations, simple expressions for the irreducible self-energy are derived. The derivation with vertex effects included in the self-energy results in a number of terms beyond GW such as second-order screened exchange (the term that also gives rise to vertex/excitonic effects in the polarisation) and an infinite series describing correlations between the added-particle(removed-hole) and the excited electrons and holes: the screened T-matrix channels. Two-body correlated propagation is considered, with the third propagating freely, however, 3-body correlations are discussed and these can be added hierarchically to the method. For electron-hole propagation the reducible polarisation is calculated, which results in an expression for the self-energy that can be solved analytically without the need for widely used expensive numerical methods for frequency integration or having to adopt the plasmon-pole approximation. The method requires diagonalisation of the usual particle-hole matrix - derived from the Bethe-Salpter equation - and also a particle-particle and hole-hole matrix that has a similar structure; with the second-order exchange present in all channels. The method goes beyond current widely used methods that adopt the GW approximation, whilst being abinitio in nature and requiring relatively modest extensions to existing functionality, e.g., it could be implemented in the sophisticated quasiparticle self-consistent framework. It is anticipated the method will significantly improve on the accuracy of current state-of-the-art calculations, improving our understanding of processes in simple and strongly-correlated systems, with the additional contributions demanding a similar cost to methods that include vertex effects in the polarisation only.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Negative Magnetoresistance in Layered AFM Semimetals: the Case of EuSn$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, by applying a comprehensive approach including magnetic, transport measurements, ARPES band structure measurements, DFT calculations, and analytical theory consideration, we unveil the puzzling origin of the negative isotropic magnetoresistance in the highly anisotropic semimetals, particularly, Eu$_2$Sn$_2$As$_2$ with AFM ordering of Eu atoms. The isotropic magnetoresistance developing along with the magnetization changes up to the complete spin polarization field was reported previously in several experimental studies, though its theoretical explanation was missing up to date. Recently, we proposed a novel theoretical mechanism to describe the observed magnetoresistance in layered AFM compounds by exchange splitting of the electron energy levels and by confining the electron wave functions with different spin projection in the vicinity of the respective magnetic layer. In this paper, we present more detailed experimental studies of the negative magnetoresistance with several samples of EuSn$_2$As$_2$ in order to identify its sample-independent features including temperature dependence. We also substantiate the proposed theory by comparing it with magnetotransport data, with ARPES measurements of the energy band structure, and DFT energy spectrum calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum resources like entanglement and magic are essential for characterizing the complexity of quantum states. However, when the number of copies of quantum states and the computational time are limited by numbers polynomial in the system size $n$, accurate estimation of the amount of these resources becomes difficult. This makes it impossible to distinguish between ensembles of states with relatively small resources and one that has nearly maximal resources. Such ensembles with small resources are referred to as "pseudo-quantum" ensembles. Recent studies have introduced an ensemble known as the random subset phase state ensemble, which is pseudo-entangled, pseudo-magical, and pseudorandom. While the current state-of-the-art implementation of this ensemble is conjectured to be realized by a circuit with $O(nt)$ depth, it is still too deep for near-term quantum devices to execute for small $t$. In addition, the strict linear dependence on $t$ has only been established as a lower bound on the circuit depth. In this work, we present significantly improved implementations that only require $\omega(\log n)\cdot O(t[\log t]^2)$ depth circuits, which almost saturates the theoretical lower bound. This is also the fastest known for generating pseudorandom states to the best of our knowledge. We believe that our findings will facilitate the implementation of pseudo-ensembles on near-term devices, allowing executions of tasks that would otherwise require ensembles with maximal quantum resources, by generating pseudo-ensembles at a super-polynomially fewer number of entangling and non-Clifford gates.</description>

Abstract: We study point impurities in non-relativistic quantum field theories, with a focus on scale-invariant fixed points. We establish the framework of conformal defects in Schr\"{o}dinger field theories and their correspondence to many-body states in a harmonic trap. We discuss a multi-critical quantization of the one-body wave function induced by an impurity, with examples of free and unitary Fermi gases. Our results can potentially be tested in experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Order Interface Propagating over the Ferromagnetic Ground State in the Transverse Field Ising Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider time evolution of order parameters and entanglement asymmetries in the ferromagnetic phase of the transverse-field Ising chain. One side of the system is prepared in a ferromagnetic ground state and the other side either in equilibrium at higher temperature or out of equilibrium. We focus on the disorder-order interface in which the order parameter attains a nonzero value, different from the ground state one. In that region, correlations follow a universal behaviour. We analytically compute the asymptotic scaling functions of the one- and two-point equal time correlations of the order parameter and provide numerical evidence that also the non-equal time correlations are universal. We analyze the R\'enyi entanglement asymmetries of subsystems and obtain a prediction that is expected to hold also in the von Neumann limit. Finally, we show that the Wigner-Yanase skew information of the order paramerter in subsystems within the interfacial region scales as their length squared. We propose a semiclassical approximation that is particularly effective close to the edge of the lightcone.</description>

Abstract: Simulating strongly correlated systems with incommensurate order poses significant challenges for traditional finite-size-based approaches. Confining such a phase to a finite-size geometry can induce spurious frustration, with spin spirals in frustrated magnets being a typical example. Here, we introduce an Ansatz based on infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) which overcomes these limitations and enables the direct search for the optimal spiral in the thermodynamic limit, with a computational cost that is independent of the spiral's wavelength. Leveraging this method, we simulate the Heisenberg model on the anisotropic triangular lattice, which interpolates between the square and isotropic triangular lattice limits. Besides accurately reproducing the magnetically ordered phases with arbitrary wavelength, the simulations reveal a quantum spin liquid phase emerging between the N\'eel and spin spiral phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological characteristics of quantum systems are typically determined by the closing of a gap, while the dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) during quantum real-time evolution has emerged as a nonequilibrium analog to the quantum phase transition (QPT). In this paper, we illustrate that the system dynamics can be elucidated by considering the precession of a collection of free-pseudo spins under a magnetic field based on the exact results of extended Kitaev chains. The topology of the driven Hamiltonian is determined by the average winding number of the nonequilibrium state. Furthermore, we establish that the singularity of the DQPT arises from two perpendicular pseudo-spin vectors associated with the pre- and post-quenched Hamiltonians. Moreover, we investigate the distinct behaviors of the dynamic pairing order parameter in both topological and non-topological regions. These findings offer valuable insights into the non-equilibrium behavior of topological superconductors, contributing to the understanding of the resilience of topological properties in driven quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Precision reconstruction of rational CFT from exact fixed point tensor network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18005v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The novel concept of entanglement renormalization and its corresponding tensor network renormalization technique have been highly successful in developing a controlled real space renormalization group (RG) scheme. Numerically approximate fixed-point (FP) tensors are widely used to extract the conformal data of the underlying conformal field theory (CFT) describing critical phenomena. In this paper, we present an explicit analytical construction of the FP tensor for 2D rational CFT. We define it as a correlation function between the "boundary-changing operators" on triangles. Our construction fully captures all the real-space RG conditions. We also provide concrete examples, such as Ising, Yang-Lee and Tri-critical Ising models to compute the scaling dimensions explicitly based on the corresponding FP tensor. Interestingly, our construction of FP tensors is closely related to a strange correlator, where the holographic picture naturally emerges. Our results also open a new door towards understanding CFT in higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The origin of the "hidden" quadrupolar and unconventional magnetic low-temperature orders observed in the spin-orbit double perovskite Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ defies explanation through standard experimental and theoretical techniques. Here we address this problem by deriving and solving an ab initio low-temperature effective Hamiltonian including inter-site electronic exchange and vibronic (electron-lattice) couplings between $J_{eff}=3/2$ Jahn-Teller-active Rhenium states. Our findings disclose the nature of these elusive states, attributing it to intertwined exchange and electron-lattice couplings, thus diverging from the conventional dichotomy of purely electronic or lattice driving mechanisms. Our results indicate the resilience of the quadrupolar hidden order under pressure, yet its rapid suppression under uniaxial strain suggests that external or lattice-induced distortions play a pivotal role in determining the relative stability of competing phases in Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ and similar $d^1$ double perovskites.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the real-time evolution of many-electron quantum systems is essential for studying dynamical properties in condensed matter, quantum chemistry, and complex materials, yet it poses a significant theoretical and computational challenge. Our work introduces a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing mean-field approximations by accurately capturing many-body correlations. Therefore, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow transformations, which are enhanced through neural networks parameterizations. To compute the optimal time-dependent parameters, we utilize the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo technique and a new method based on Taylor-root expansions of the propagator, enhancing the accuracy of our simulations. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems. In all cases, we show clear signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to accurately capture the time evolution, providing insight into the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities of mean-field.</description>

      <title>Tunable Giant Anomalous Hall in a Kondo Lattice Ferromagnet UBiTe</title>

Abstract: Kondo lattice systems are recognized for potentially hosting a variety of rich topological phases. Several pioneering studies have demonstrated significant anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst effects in these systems, attributed to the Berry curvature of the hybridization bands. In this study, we investigate UBiTe, a ferromagnetic Kondo lattice system. Our findings reveal that the intrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall conductivity is closely tied to the Kondo coherence temperature. Moreover, we demonstrate that slight shifts in the Fermi level across three different samples significantly influence this intrinsic contribution, in alignment with the Berry curvature localized within the narrow hybridization bands. This provides a stark contrast to the less pronounced sensitivity observed in weakly correlated Weyl semimetals, underscoring the distinctive electronic properties of Kondo lattice systems. The anomalous Hall conductivity of one samples ranks among the highest reported for topological magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Electron phonon coupling in the topological heavy fermion model of twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On flat bands of the magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, exotic correlation physics unfolds. Phonons, through mediating an effective electron-electron interaction, can play a crucial role in selecting various electronic phases. In this study, we derive the full electron-phonon coupling (EPC) vertex from the microscopic tight-binding lattice, and identify the significance of each phonon mode. We then project the EPC vertices onto the topological heavy fermion (THF) basis [Song and Bernevig, Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 047601 (2022)], and show that an anti-Hund's interaction $\hat{H}_{\rm A}$ is induced on each moir\'e-scale local $f$-orbital, with strengths 1 to 4 meV. We analyze the phonon-induced multiplet splittings, which can significantly affect the local correlation. As an example, we elaborate on the phonon-favored symmetry-breaking orders at even-integer fillings. Through systematic self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we uncover a tight competition between $\Gamma$-phonon-favored orbital orders, $K$-phonon-favored inter-valley coherent orders, and the kinetic and Coulomb-favored orders. Contrary to EPC, the carbon atom Hubbard repulsion induces an on-$f$-site Hund's interaction $\hat{H}_{\rm H}$ with strengths 1 to 3 meV that partly counteracts the effect of $\hat{H}_{\rm A}$. The combined influence of $\hat{H}_{\rm A,H}$ on the multiplet splitting and symmetry-breaking states is discussed. In the end, we explore the possibility of finding an exotic Dirac semi-metal formed solely by $c$-electrons at the charge-neutrality point, while $f$-impurities exhibit a symmetric Mott gap by forming non-degenerate singlets under $\hat{H}_{\rm A,H}$. Experimental features that distinguish such a state are discussed.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuations and Many-Body Quantum Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many-body systems with U(1) global symmetry, the charge fluctuations in a subregion reveal important insights into entanglement and other global properties. For subregions with sharp corners, bipartite fluctuations have been predicted to exhibit a universal shape dependence on the corner angle in certain quantum phases and transitions, characterized by a "universal angle function" and a "universal coefficient." However, we demonstrate that this simple formula is insufficient for charge insulators, including composite fermi liquids. In these systems, the corner contribution may depend on the corner angle, subregion orientation, and other microscopic details. We provide an infinite series representation of the corner term, introducing orientation-resolved universal angle functions with their non-universal coefficients. In the small-angle limit or under orientation averaging, the remaining terms' coefficients are fully determined by the many-body quantum metric, which, while not universal, adheres to both a universal topological lower bound and an energetic upper bound. We also clarify the conditions for bound saturation in (anisotropic) Landau levels, leveraging the generalized Kohn theorem and holomorphic properties of many-body wavefunctions. We find that a broad class of fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions, including unprojected parton states and composite-fermion Fermi sea wavefunctions, saturates the bounds.</description>

Abstract: We have studied the tight-binding model for the \alpha-type layered organic conductors, \alpha-(ET)2I3 and \alpha-(BETS)2I3, with a uniform interlayer coupling accompanied by spin-orbit interaction originating from the I3- anion potential. The model preserves the time reversal and inversion symmetries. In \alpha-(ET)2I3, the interlayer spin-orbit coupling realizes the experimentally suggested Dirac semimetal state with inversion symmetry. In contrast, the inversion breaking in interlayer hoppings realizes the Weyl semimetal state without spin-orbit coupling. In \alpha-(BETS)2I3, the proposed strong topological insulator is hardly realized with inversion symmetry.</description>

      <title>Developing fractional quantum Hall states at $\nu$ = $\dfrac{1}{7}$ and $\dfrac{2}{11}$ in the presence of significant Landau level mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Termination of the fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) and the emergence of Wigner crystal phases at very small Landau level filling factors ($\nu$) have been of continued interest for decades. Recently, in ultra-high-quality, dilute GaAs 2D electron systems (2DESs), strong evidence was reported for FQHSs at $\nu=1/7, 2/13$ and 2/11 which fall in the $\nu = p/(6p\pm1)$ Jain series of FQHSs, interpreted as integer ($p = 1$, 2) QHSs of 6-flux composite fermions ($^6$CFs). These states are surrounded by strongly-insulating phases which are generally believed to be Wigner crystals. Here, we study an ultra-high-quality 2DES confined to an AlAs quantum well where the 2D electrons have a much larger effective mass ($m^*\simeq 0.45 m_e$) and a smaller dielectric constant ($\epsilon\simeq10\epsilon_0$) compared to GaAs 2D electrons ($m^*\simeq 0.067 m_e$ and $\epsilon\simeq13\epsilon_0$). This combination of $m^*$ and $\epsilon$ renders the Landau level mixing parameter $\kappa$, defined as the ratio of the Coulomb and cyclotron energies, $\simeq 9$ times larger in AlAs 2DESs ($\kappa\propto m^*/\epsilon$). Qualitatively similar to the GaAs 2DESs, we observe an insulating behavior reentrant around a strong $\nu=1/5$ FQHS, and extending to $\nu&lt;1/5$. Additionally, we observe a clear minimum in magnetoresistance at $\nu=2/11$, and an inflection point at $\nu=1/7$ which is very reminiscent of the first report of an emerging FQHS at $\nu=1/7$ in GaAs 2DESs. The data provide evidence for developing QHSs of $^6$CFs at very small fillings. This is very surprising because $\kappa$ near $\nu \simeq 1/6$ in our sample is very large ($\simeq4$), and larger $\kappa$ has the tendency to favor Wigner crystal states over FQHSs at small fillings. Our data should inspire calculations that accurately incorporate $\kappa$ in competing many-body phases of $^6$CFs at extremely small fillings near $\nu=1/6$.</description>

Abstract: The temporal finite volume induces significant effects in Monte Carlo simulations of systems in low dimensions, such as graphene, a 2-D hexagonal system known for its unique electronic properties and numerous potential applications. In this work, we explore the behavior of fermions on a hexagonal sheet with a Hubbard-type interaction characterized by coupling $U$. This system exhibits zero or near zero-energy excitations that are highly sensitive to finite temperature effects. We compute corrections to the self-energy and the effective mass of low-energy excitations, arriving at a quantization condition that includes the temporal finite volume. These analyses are then conducted for both zero and finite temperatures. Our findings reveal that the first-order $\mathcal{O}(U)$ contributions are absent, leading to non-trivial corrections starting at $\mathcal{O}(U^2)$. We validate our calculations against exact and numerical results obtained from Hybrid Monte Carlo simulations on small lattices.</description>

      <title>Laminar flow of charged quantum fluids of the Calogero-Sutherland universality class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model represents a universality class of quantum hydrodynamic fluids in one spatial dimension. It describes quantum compressible fluids involving both chiralities in which the chiral density field obeys the quantum Benjamin-Ono equation. An extension of this theory to describe a laminar flow of the Calogero-Sutherland fluids in a rectangular geometry with small transverse width and the topology of a ribbon, is considered here. The physical picture is based on the edge states in the hierarchical quantum Hall effect, which may be seen as a collection of parallel one-dimensional quantum incompressible fluids moving along but confined within the transverse microscopic width of the edge of the sample. The effective theory is thus defined as the direct product of two one-dimensional theories of the Calogero-Sutherland class so that one involves motion while the other is confining. Charge transport may be induced by coupling the system to an external electromagnetic field that yields a global translation of the ground state. The effective theory describes quantum solitonic excitations along the direction of the flow and possesses a two-dimensional electric current density which shows a Wigner semicircle law profile in the transverse direction, suggesting a Poiseuille-like behavior but without dissipative viscous effects since the velocity of the fluid is not a well-defined quantum field. This simple physical picture predicts interesting phenomena with distinctive signatures that may be tested in real samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose the electric field induced thermal Hall effect of triplons in the quantum dimer magnets $X$CuCl$_{3}$ ($X =$ Tl, K), which exhibit ferroelectricity in the Bose-Einstein condensation phase of triplons. The interplay between ferroelectricity and magnetism in these materials leads to the magnetoelectric effect, i.e., an electric-field induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction between spins on the same dimer. We argue that this intradimer DM interaction breaks the symmetry of the system in the absence of an electric field and gives rise to the thermal Hall effect, which can be detected in experimentally accessible electric and magnetic fields. We also show that the thermal Hall effect can be controlled by changing the strength or direction of the electric field.</description>

Abstract: We investigate collective excitations in magnetic topological insulators (TIs) and their impact on particle axion detection. In the three-dimensional TI model with the Hubbard term, the effective action of magnons and amplitude modes is formulated by dynamical susceptibility under the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states. One of the amplitude modes is identified as ``axionic'' quasi-particle and its effective coupling to the electromagnetic fields turns out to be enhanced by about four orders of magnitude larger than the previous estimate, which may drastically change the sensitivity of the particle axion search using ``axion'' in magnetic TIs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the thermal one point function of higher spin currents in the critical model of $U(N)$ complex scalars interacting with a quartic potential and the $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model of Dirac fermions at large $N$ and strong coupling using the Euclidean inversion formula. These models are considered in odd space time dimensions $d$ and held at finite temperature and finite real chemical potential $\mu$ measured in units of the temperature. We show that these one point functions simplify both at large spin and large $d$. At large spin, the one point functions behave as though the theory is free, the chemical potential appears through a simple pre-factor which is either $\cosh\mu$ or $\sinh\mu$ depending on whether the spin is even or odd. At large $d$, but at finite spin and chemical potential, the 1-point functions are suppressed exponentially in $d$ compared to the free theory. We study a fixed point of the critical Gross-Neveu model in $d=3$ with 1-point functions exhibiting a branch cut in the chemical potential plane. The critical exponent for the free energy or the pressure at the branch point is $3/2$ which coincides with the mean field exponent of the Lee-Yang edge singularity for repulsive core interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, robust superconductivity has been independently observed in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers by two separate groups [Y. Xia et al., arXiv:2405.14784; Y. Guo et al., arXiv:2406.03418.]. In light of this, we explore the possibility of a universal superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers. Using a continuum band structure model and a phenomenological boson-mediated effective electron-electron attraction, we find that intervalley intralayer pairing predominates over interlayer pairing. Notably, despite different experimental conditions, both twisted WSe$_2$ samples exhibit a comparable effective attraction strength. This consistency suggests that the dominant pairing glue is likely independent of the twist angle and layer polarization, pointing to a universal underlying boson-induced pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Fermionic logarithmic negativity in the Krawtchouk chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement of non-complementary regions is investigated in an inhomogeneous free-fermion chain through the lens of the fermionic logarithmic negativity. Focus is on the Krawtchouk chain, whose relation to the eponymous orthogonal polynomials allows for exact diagonalization and analytical calculations of certain correlation functions. For adjacent regions, the negativity scaling corresponds to that of a conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$, in agreement with previous studies on bipartite entanglement in the Krawtchouk chain. For disjoint regions, we focus on the skeletal regime where each region reduces to a single site. This regime is sufficient to extract the leading behaviour at large distances. In the bulk, the negativity decays as $d^{-4 \Delta_f}$ with $\Delta_f=1/2$, where $d$ is the separation between the regions. This is in agreement with the homogeneous result of free Dirac fermions in one dimension. Surprisingly, when one site is close to the boundary, this exponent changes and depends on the parity of the boundary site $m=0,1,2,\dots$, with $\Delta_f^{\textrm{even}}=3/8$ and $\Delta_f^{\textrm{odd}}=5/8$. The results are supported by numerics and analytical calculations.</description>

      <title>The dual Ginzburg-Landau theory for a holographic superconductor: Finite coupling corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The holographic superconductor is the holographic dual of superconductors. We recently identified the dual Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory for a class of bulk 5-dimensional holographic superconductors (arXiv:2207.07182 [hep-th]). However, the result is the strong coupling limit or the large-$N_c$ limit. A natural question is how the dual GL theory changes at finite coupling. We identify the dual GL theory for a minimal holographic superconductor at finite coupling (Gauss-Bonnet holographic superconductor), where numerical coefficients are obtained exactly. The GL parameter $\kappa$ increases at finite coupling, namely the system approaches a more Type-II superconductor like material. We also point out two potential problems in previous works: (1) the "naive" AdS/CFT dictionary, and (2) the condensate determined only from the GL potential terms. As a result, the condensate increases at finite coupling unlike common folklore.</description>

      <title>A Gapless Phase with Haagerup Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)d gapless theory which has Haagerup $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry. The construction relies on the recent exploration of the categorical Landau paradigm applied to fusion category symmetries. First, using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory, we construct all gapped phases with Haagerup symmetry. Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically an Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory. This is given in terms of two copies of the three-state Potts model, on which we realise the full $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry action and determine the relevant deformations to the $\mathcal{H}_3$-symmetric gapped phases. This continuum analysis is corroborated by a lattice model construction of the gapped and gapless phases, using the anyon chain.</description>

      <title>Efficient Detection of Strong-To-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking via the R\'enyi-1 Correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) has recently emerged as a universal feature of quantum mixed-state phases of matter. While various information-theoretic diagnostics have been proposed to define and characterize SWSSB phases, relating these diagnostics to observables which can be efficiently and scalably probed on modern quantum devices remains challenging. Here we propose a new observable for SWSSB in mixed states, called the R\'enyi-1 correlator, which naturally suggests a potential route towards scalably detecting SWSSB phases in experiment. Specifically, if the canonical purification (CP) of a given mixed state can be reliably prepared, then SWSSB in the mixed state can be detected via ordinary two-point correlation functions in the CP state. We discuss several simple examples of CP states which can be efficiently prepared on quantum devices, and whose reduced density matrices exhibit SWSSB. The R\'enyi-1 correlator also satisfies several useful theoretical properties: it naturally inherits a stability theorem recently proven for the closely-related fidelity correlator, and it directly defines SWSSB as a particular pattern of ordinary spontaneous symmetry breaking in the CP state.</description>

      <title>Topological incommensurate Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductor and Bogoliubov Fermi surface in rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We performed a random phase approximation (RPA) calculation for a spin-valley polarized model of the rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene to study the possibility of chiral superconductor from the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. We included the realistic band structure and form factor in our calculation and solved the self-consistent equation numerically by sampling 20,000 points in the momentum space at a given temperature. Around the Van-Hove singularity (VHS), we find p-ip pairing with Chern number switching from $C=-1$ to $C=0$ through a gap closing at $\mathbf k=(0,0)$ (defined relative to $\mathbf K$). Although the superconductor is generically fully gapped at low temperature, we find Bogoliubov Fermi surface at temperature just below mean field $T_c$. Besides, through calculation of the free energy, we conclude that the optimal Cooper pair momentum $\mathbf Q$ is generically finite and can be as large as $0.1 k_F$. We dub the $\mathbf Q\neq 0$ phase as an incommensurate Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov(FFLO) superconductor to distinguish it from the $\mathbf Q=0$ phase. Compared to the $\mathbf Q=0$ phase, our incommensurate $\mathbf Q$ phase is a nematic superconductor if it is in the Fulde-Ferrell(FF) phase or exhibts charge density wave (CDW) if it is in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO) phase. Our work demonstrates the rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene as a wonderful platform to explore Majorana zero-mode, FFLO physics and Bogoliubov fermi surface within one single platform.</description>
