      <title>Data-driven Bayesian State Estimation with Compressed Measurement of Model-free Process using Semi-supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research topic is: data-driven Bayesian state estimation with compressed measurement (BSCM) of model-free process, say for a (causal) tracking application. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than the dimension of the temporal state vector to be estimated. Hence the state estimation problem is an underdetermined inverse problem. The state-space-model (SSM) of the underlying dynamical process is assumed to be unknown and hence, we use the terminology 'model-free process'. In absence of the SSM, we can not employ traditional model-driven methods like Kalman Filter (KF) and Particle Filter (PF) and instead require data-driven methods. We first experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem for model-free process; they are data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) method and deep Markov model (DMM) method. The unsupervised learning uses unlabelled data comprised of only noisy measurements. While DANSE provides a good predictive performance to model the temporal measurement data as time-series, its unsupervised learning lacks a regularization for state estimation. We then investigate use of a semi-supervised learning approach, and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In the semi-supervised learning, we use a limited amount of labelled data along-with a large amount of unlabelled data, and that helps to bring the desired regularization for BSCM problem in the absence of SSM. The labelled data means pairwise measurement-and-state data. Using three chaotic dynamical systems (or processes) with nonlinear SSMs as benchmark, we show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive performance for BSCM against three SSM-informed methods - a hybrid method called KalmanNet, and two traditional model-driven methods called extended KF and unscented KF.</description>

      <title>Accurate Radar-Based Heartbeat Measurement Using Higher Harmonic Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a radar-based heartbeat measurement method that uses the absolute value of the second derivative of the complex radar signal, rather than its phase, and the variational mode extraction method, which is a type of mode decomposition algorithm. We show that the proposed second-derivative-based approach can amplify the heartbeat component in radar signals effectively and also confirm that use of the variational mode extraction method represents an efficient way to emphasize the heartbeat component amplified via the second-derivative-based approach. We demonstrate estimation of the heart interbeat intervals using the proposed approach in combination with the topology method, which is an accurate interbeat interval estimation method. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated quantitatively using data obtained from eleven participants that were measured using a millimeter-wave radar system. When compared with conventional methods based on the phase of the complex radar signal, our proposed method can achieve higher accuracy when estimating the heart interbeat intervals; the correlation coefficient for the proposed method was increased by 0.20 and the root-mean-square error decreased by 23%.</description>

      <title>Timing Recovery for Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access with Asynchronous Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A passive optical network (PON) based on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) meets low latency and high capacity. In the NOMA-PON, the asynchronous clock between the strong and weak optical network units (ONUs) causes the timing error and phase noise on the signal of the weak ONU. The theoretical derivation shows that the timing error and phase noise can be independently compensated. In this Letter, we propose a timing recovery (TR) algorithm based on an absolute timing error detector (Abs TED) and a pilot-based carrier phase recovery (CPR) to eliminate the timing error and phase noise separately. An experiment for 25G NOMA-PON is set up to verify the feasibility of the proposed algorithms. The weak ONU can achieve the 20% soft-decision forward error correction limit after compensating for timing error and phase noise. In conclusion, the proposed TR and the pilot-based CPR show great potential for the NOMA-PON.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the lateral mis-registrations of the GRAVITY + adaptive optics system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The GRAVITY+ upgrade implies a complete renewal of its adaptive optics (AO) systems. Its complex design, featuring moving components between the deformable mirrors and the wavefront sensors, requires the monitoring and auto-calibrating of the lateral mis-registrations of the system while in operation. Aims. For preset and target acquisition, large lateral registration errors must be assessed in open loop to bring the system to a state where the AO loop closes. In closed loop, these errors must be monitored and corrected, without impacting the science. Methods. With respect to the first requirement, our method is perturbative, with two-dimensional modes intentionally applied to the system and correlated to a reference interaction matrix. For the second requirement, we applied a non-perturbative approach that searches for specific patterns in temporal correlations in the closed loop telemetry. This signal is produced by the noise propagation through the AO loop. Results. Our methods were validated through simulations and on the GRAVITY+ development bench. The first method robustly estimates the lateral mis-registrations, in a single fit and with a sub-subaperture resolution while in an open loop. The second method is not absolute, but it does successfully bring the system towards a negligible mis-registration error, with a limited turbulence bias. Both methods proved to robustly work on a system still under development and not fully characterised. Conclusions. Tested with Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors, the proposed methods are versatile and easily adaptable to other AO instruments, such as the pyramid, which stands as a baseline for all future AO systems. The non-perturbative method, not relying on an interaction matrix model and being sparse in the Fourier domain, is particularly suitable to the next generation of AO systems for extremely large telescopes that will present an unprecedented level of complexity and numbers of actuators.</description>

      <title>The Roles of Spatial Frequencies and Degrees-of-Freedom in Near-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As wireless technology begins to utilize physically larger arrays and/or higher frequencies, the transmitter and receiver will reside in each other's radiative near field. This fact gives rise to unusual propagation phenomena such as spherical wavefronts and beamfocusing, creating the impression that new spatial dimensions -- called degrees-of-freedom (DoF) -- can be exploited in the near field. However, this is a fallacy because the theoretically maximum DoF are already achievable in the far field. This paper sheds light on these issues by providing a tutorial on spatial frequencies, which are the fundamental components of wireless channels, and by explaining their role in characterizing the DoF in the near and far fields. In particular, we demonstrate how a single propagation path utilizes one spatial frequency in the far field and an interval of spatial frequencies in the near field. We explain how the array geometry determines the number of distinguishable spatial frequency bins and, thereby, the spatial DoF. We also describe how to model near-field multipath channels and their spatial correlation matrices. Finally, we discuss the research challenges and future directions in this field.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for RF Sensing in IoT systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of wireless sensing technologies, using signals such as Wi-Fi, infrared, and RF to gather environmental data, has significantly advanced within Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Among these, Radio Frequency (RF) sensing stands out for its cost-effective and non-intrusive monitoring of human activities and environmental changes. However, traditional RF sensing methods face significant challenges, including noise, interference, incomplete data, and high deployment costs, which limit their effectiveness and scalability. This paper investigates the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) to overcome these limitations within the IoT ecosystem. We provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art GenAI techniques, focusing on their application to RF sensing problems. By generating high-quality synthetic data, enhancing signal quality, and integrating multi-modal data, GenAI offers robust solutions for RF environment reconstruction, localization, and imaging. Additionally, GenAI's ability to generalize enables IoT devices to adapt to new environments and unseen tasks, improving their efficiency and performance. The main contributions of this article include a detailed analysis of the challenges in RF sensing, the presentation of innovative GenAI-based solutions, and the proposal of a unified framework for diverse RF sensing tasks. Through case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating GenAI models, leading to advanced, scalable, and intelligent IoT systems.</description>

      <title>Pilot-Based SFO Estimation for Bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling bistatic radar sensing within the context of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) for future sixth generation mobile networks demands strict synchronization accuracy, which is particularly challenging to be achieved with over-the-air synchronization. Existing algorithms handle time and frequency offsets adequately, but provide insufficiently accurate sampling frequency offset (SFO) estimates that result in degradation of obtained radar images in the form of signal-to-noise ratio loss and migration of range and Doppler shift. This article introduces an SFO estimation algorithm named tilt inference of time offset (TITO) for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC. Using available pilot subcarriers, TITO obtains channel impulse response estimates and extracts information on the SFO-induced delay migration to a dominant reference path with constant range, Doppler shift, and angle between transmit and receive ISAC nodes. TITO then adaptively selects the delay estimates that are only negligibly impaired by SFO-induced intersymbol interference, ultimately employing them to estimate the SFO. Assuming a scenario without a direct line-of-sight (LoS) between the aforementioned transmitting and receiving ISAC nodes, a system concept with a relay reflective intelligent surface (RIS) is used to create the aforementioned reference path is proposed. Besides a mathematical derivation of accuracy bounds, simulation and measurements at 26.2 GHz are presented to demonstrate TITO's superiority over existing methods in terms of SFO estimation accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>Jump Plus AM-FM Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel method for decomposing a nonstationary signal into amplitude- and frequency-modulated (AM-FM) oscillations and discontinuous (jump) components is proposed. Current nonstationary signal decomposition methods are designed to either obtain constituent AM-FM oscillatory modes or the discontinuous and residual components from the data, separately. Yet, many real-world signals of interest simultaneously exhibit both behaviors i.e., jumps and oscillations. Currently, no available method can extract jumps and AM-FM oscillatory components directly from the data. In our novel approach, we design and solve a variational optimization problem to accomplish this task. The optimization formulation includes a regularization term to minimize the bandwidth of all signal modes for effective oscillation modeling, and a prior for extracting the jump component. Our method addresses the limitations of conventional AM-FM signal decomposition methods in extracting jumps, as well as the limitations of existing jump extraction methods in decomposing multiscale oscillations. By employing an optimization framework that accounts for both multiscale oscillatory components and discontinuities, our methods show superior performance compared to existing decomposition techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on synthetic, real-world, single-channel, and multivariate data, highlighting their utility in three specific applications: Earth's electric field signals, electrocardiograms (ECG), and electroencephalograms (EEG).</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for Electrocardiograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models, enhanced by self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques, represent a cutting-edge frontier in biomedical signal analysis, particularly for electrocardiograms (ECGs), crucial for cardiac health monitoring and diagnosis. This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of foundation models for ECGs by employing and refining innovative SSL methodologies - namely, generative and contrastive learning - on a vast dataset of over 1.1 million ECG samples. By customizing these methods to align with the intricate characteristics of ECG signals, our research has successfully developed foundation models that significantly elevate the precision and reliability of cardiac diagnostics. These models are adept at representing the complex, subtle nuances of ECG data, thus markedly enhancing diagnostic capabilities. The results underscore the substantial potential of SSL-enhanced foundation models in clinical settings and pave the way for extensive future investigations into their scalable applications across a broader spectrum of medical diagnostics. This work sets a benchmark in the ECG field, demonstrating the profound impact of tailored, data-driven model training on the efficacy and accuracy of medical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Mobile Edge Generation (MEG) by Constrained Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel accelerated mobile edge generation (MEG) framework is proposed for generating high-resolution images on mobile devices. Exploiting a large-scale latent diffusion model (LDM) distributed across edge server (ES) and user equipment (UE), cost-efficient artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) is achieved by transmitting low-dimensional features between ES and UE. To reduce overheads of both distributed computations and transmissions, a dynamic diffusion and feature merging scheme is conceived. By jointly optimizing the denoising steps and feature merging ratio, the image generation quality is maximized subject to latency and energy consumption constraints. To address this problem and tailor LDM sub-models, a low-complexity MEG acceleration protocol is developed. Particularly, a backbone meta-architecture is trained via offline distillation. Then, dynamic diffusion and feature merging are determined in online channel environment, which can be viewed as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP). A constrained variational policy optimization (CVPO) based MEG algorithm is further proposed for constraint-guaranteed learning, namely MEG-CVPO. Numerical results verify that: 1) The proposed framework can generate 1024$\times$1024 high-quality images over noisy channels while reducing over $40\%$ latency compared to conventional generation schemes. 2) The developed MEG-CVPO effectively mitigates constraint violations, thus flexibly controlling the trade-off between image distortion and generation costs.</description>

      <title>In-Orbit Processing or Not? Sunlight-Aware Task Scheduling for Energy-Efficient Space Edge Computing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid evolution of space-borne capabilities, space edge computing (SEC) is becoming a new computation paradigm for future integrated space and terrestrial networks. Satellite edges adopt advanced on-board hardware, which not only enables new opportunities to perform complex intelligent tasks in orbit, but also involves new challenges due to the additional energy consumption in power-constrained space environment. In this paper, we present PHOENIX, an energy-efficient task scheduling framework for emerging SEC networks. PHOENIX exploits a key insight that in the SEC network, there always exist a number of sunlit edges which are illuminated during the entire orbital period and have sufficient energy supplement from the sun. PHOENIX accomplishes energy-efficient in-orbit computing by judiciously offloading space tasks to "sunlight-sufficient" edges or to the ground. Specifically, PHOENIX first formulates the SEC battery energy optimizing (SBEO) problem which aims at minimizing the average battery energy consumption while satisfying various task completion constraints. Then PHOENIX incorporates a sunlight-aware scheduling mechanism to solve the SBEO problem and schedule SEC tasks efficiently. Finally, we implement a PHOENIX prototype and build an SEC testbed. Extensive data-driven evaluations demonstrate that as compared to other state-of-the-art solutions, PHOENIX can effectively reduce up to 54.8% SEC battery energy consumption and prolong battery lifetime to 2.9$\times$ while still completing tasks on time.</description>

      <title>Aging-Resistant Wideband Precoding in 5G and Beyond Using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To meet the ever-increasing demand for higher data rates, 5G and 6G technologies are shifting transceivers to higher carrier frequencies, to support wider bandwidths and more antenna elements. Nevertheless, this solution poses several key challenges: i) increasing the carrier frequency and bandwidth leads to greater channel frequency selectivity in time and frequency domains, and ii) the greater the number of antennas the greater the the pilot overhead for channel estimation and the more prohibitively complex it becomes to determine the optimal precoding matrix. This paper presents two deep-learning frameworks to solve these issues. Firstly, we propose a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) that is based on image super-resolution and captures the correlations between the transmitting and receiving antennas and the frequency domains to combat frequency selectivity. Secondly, we devise a deep learning-based framework to combat the time selectivity of the channel that treats channel aging as a distortion that can be mitigated through deep learning-based image restoration techniques. Simulation results show that combining both frameworks leads to a significant improvement in performance compared to existing techniques with little increase in complexity.</description>

      <title>Waveguide Superlattices with Artificial Gauge Field Towards Colorless and Crosstalkless Ultrahigh-Density Photonic Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense waveguide arrays with low crosstalk and ultra-broadband remain a vital issue for chip-scale integrated photonics. However, the sub-wavelength regime of such devices has not been adequately explored in practice. Herein, we propose the advanced waveguide superlattices leveraging the artificial gauge field mechanism. This approach achieves remarkable -24 dB crosstalk suppression with an ultra-broadband bandwidth, experimentally demonstrated over 500 nm, in silicon nitride waveguides. Moreover, the 112 Gbit/s signal encoded per channel of ultra-compact circuits with a bit error rate below the 7% forward error correction limit verified the capability for high-speed on-chip transmission. This design is compatible with metal back end-of-the-line (BEOL) processes and can be readily transferred to other platforms. Thus it holds great promise for significant reduction in on-chip footprint and cost in large-scale integrated photonics, and salient enhancement in the performance of a wide range of active and passive photonic devices and systems.</description>

Abstract: Hyperspherical Prototypical Learning (HPL) is a supervised approach to representation learning that designs class prototypes on the unit hypersphere. The prototypes bias the representations to class separation in a scale invariant and known geometry. Previous approaches to HPL have either of the following shortcomings: (i) they follow an unprincipled optimisation procedure; or (ii) they are theoretically sound, but are constrained to only one possible latent dimension. In this paper, we address both shortcomings. To address (i), we present a principled optimisation procedure whose solution we show is optimal. To address (ii), we construct well-separated prototypes in a wide range of dimensions using linear block codes. Additionally, we give a full characterisation of the optimal prototype placement in terms of achievable and converse bounds, showing that our proposed methods are near-optimal.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Self-Supervised Learning for MIMO-OFDM Channel Representation and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In communications theory, the capacity of multiple input multiple output-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems is fundamentally determined by wireless channels, which exhibit both diversity and correlation in spatial, frequency and temporal domains. It is further envisioned to exploit the inherent nature of channels, namely representation, to achieve geolocation-based MIMO transmission for 6G, exemplified by the fully-decoupled radio access network (FD-RAN). Accordingly, this paper first employs self-supervised learning to obtain channel representation from unlabeled channel, then proposes a channel generation assisted approach for determining MIMO precoding matrix solely based on geolocation. Specifically, we exploit the small-scale temporal domain variations of channels at a fixed geolocation, and design an ingenious pretext task tailored for contrastive learning. Then, a Transformer-based encoder is trained to output channel representations. We further develop a conditional diffusion generator to generate channel representations from geolocation. Finally, a Transformer-encoder-based decoder is utilized to reconstruct channels from generated representations, where the optimal channel is selected for calculating the precoding matrix for both single and dual BS transmission. We conduct experiments on a public ray-tracing channel dataset, and the extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our channel representation method, and also showcase the performance improvement in geolocation-based MIMO transmission.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel MIMO-WDM Volterra-based nonlinear-equalisation scheme with adaptive time-domain nonlinear stages enhanced by filtering in both the power and optical signal waveforms.

Abstract: Radio Environment Maps (REMs) are crucial for numerous applications in Telecom. The construction of accurate Radio Environment Maps (REMs) has become an important and challenging topic in recent decades. In this paper, we present a method to estimate REMs using Graph Neural Networks. This approach utilizes both physical cell information and sparse geo-located signal strength measurements to estimate REMs. The method first divides and encodes mobile network coverage areas into a graph. Then, it inputs sparse geo-located signal strength measurements, characterized by Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) metrics, into a Graph Neural Network Model to estimate REMs. The proposed architecture inherits the advantages of a Graph Neural Network to capture the spatial dependencies of network-wide coverage in contrast with network Radio Access Network node locations and spatial proximity of known measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a promising technique, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) exhibit its tremendous potential for high accuracy positioning. In this paper, we investigates multi-user localization and tracking problem in multi-RISs-assisted system. In particular, we incorporate statistical spatiotemporal correlation of multi-user locations and develop a general spatiotemporal Markov random field model (ST-+MRF) to capture multi-user dynamic motion states. To achieve superior performance, a novel multi-user tracking algorithm is proposed based on Bayesian inference to effectively utilize the correlation among users. Besides that, considering the necessity of RISs configuration for tracking performance, we further propose a predictive RISs beamforming optimization scheme via semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Compared to other pioneering work, finally, we confirm that the proposed strategy by alternating tracking algorithm and RISs optimization, can achieve significant performance gains over benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Model-based learning for multi-antenna multi-frequency location-to-channel mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Years of study of the propagation channel showed a close relation between a location and the associated communication channel response. The use of a neural network to learn the location-to-channel mapping can therefore be envisioned. The Implicit Neural Representation (INR) literature showed that classical neural architecture are biased towards learning low-frequency content, making the location-to-channel mapping learning a non-trivial problem. Indeed, it is well known that this mapping is a function rapidly varying with the location, on the order of the wavelength. This paper leverages the model-based machine learning paradigm to derive a problem-specific neural architecture from a propagation channel model. The resulting architecture efficiently overcomes the spectral-bias issue. It only learns low-frequency sparse correction terms activating a dictionary of high-frequency components. The proposed architecture is evaluated against classical INR architectures on realistic synthetic data, showing much better accuracy. Its mapping learning performance is explained based on the approximated channel model, highlighting the explainability of the model-based machine learning paradigm.</description>

      <title>Belief Information based Deep Channel Estimation for Massive MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the next generation wireless communication system, transmission rates should continue to rise to support emerging scenarios, e.g., the immersive communications. From the perspective of communication system evolution, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology remains pivotal for enhancing transmission rates. However, current MIMO systems rely on inserting pilot signals to achieve accurate channel estimation. As the increase of transmit stream, the pilots consume a significant portion of transmission resources, severely reducing the spectral efficiency. In this correspondence, we propose a belief information based mechanism. By introducing a plug-and-play belief information module, existing single-antenna channel estimation networks could be seamlessly adapted to multi-antenna channel estimation and fully exploit the spatial correlation among multiple antennas. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can either improve 1 ~ 2 dB channel estimation performance or reduce 1/3 ~ 1/2 pilot overhead, particularly in bad channel conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A promising way to mitigate the expensive process of obtaining a high-dimensional signal is to acquire a limited number of low-dimensional measurements and solve an under-determined inverse problem by utilizing the structural prior about the signal. In this paper, we focus on adaptive acquisition schemes to save further the number of measurements. To this end, we propose a reinforcement learning-based approach that sequentially collects measurements to better recover the underlying signal by acquiring fewer measurements. Our approach applies to general inverse problems with continuous action spaces and jointly learns the recovery algorithm. Using insights obtained from theoretical analysis, we also provide a probabilistic design for our methods using variational formulation. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets and with two measurement spaces (Gaussian, Radon). Our results confirm the benefits of adaptive strategies in low-acquisition horizon settings.</description>

      <title>Joint Time-Vertex Fractional Fourier Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.07655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph signal processing (GSP) facilitates the analysis of high-dimensional data on non-Euclidean domains by utilizing graph signals defined on graph vertices. In addition to static data, each vertex can provide continuous time-series signals, transforming graph signals into time-series signals on each vertex. The joint time-vertex Fourier transform (JFT) framework offers spectral analysis capabilities to analyze these joint time-vertex signals. Analogous to the fractional Fourier transform (FRT) extending the ordinary Fourier transform (FT), we introduce the joint time-vertex fractional Fourier transform (JFRT) as a generalization of JFT. The JFRT enables fractional analysis for joint time-vertex processing by extending Fourier analysis to fractional orders in both temporal and vertex domains. We theoretically demonstrate that JFRT generalizes JFT and maintains properties such as index additivity, reversibility, reduction to identity, and unitarity for specific graph topologies. Additionally, we derive Tikhonov regularization-based denoising in the JFRT domain, ensuring robust and well-behaved solutions. Comprehensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets highlight the effectiveness of JFRT in denoising and clustering tasks that outperform state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Non-Coherent Over-the-Air Decentralized Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implementing Decentralized Gradient Descent (DGD) in wireless systems is challenging due to noise, fading, and limited bandwidth, necessitating topology awareness, transmission scheduling, and the acquisition of channel state information (CSI) to mitigate interference and maintain reliable communications. These operations may result in substantial signaling overhead and scalability challenges in large networks lacking central coordination. This paper introduces a scalable DGD algorithm that eliminates the need for scheduling, topology information, or CSI (both average and instantaneous). At its core is a Non-Coherent Over-The-Air (NCOTA) consensus scheme that exploits a noisy energy superposition property of wireless channels. Nodes encode their local optimization signals into energy levels within an OFDM frame and transmit simultaneously, without coordination. The key insight is that the received energy equals, on average, the sum of the energies of the transmitted signals, scaled by their respective average channel gains, akin to a consensus step. This property enables unbiased consensus estimation, utilizing average channel gains as mixing weights, thereby removing the need for their explicit design or for CSI. Introducing a consensus stepsize mitigates consensus estimation errors due to energy fluctuations around their expected values. For strongly-convex problems, it is shown that the expected squared distance between the local and globally optimum models vanishes at a rate of $\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{k})$ after $k$ iterations, with suitable decreasing learning and consensus stepsizes. Extensions accommodate a broad class of fading models and frequency-selective channels. Numerical experiments on image classification demonstrate faster convergence in terms of running time compared to state-of-the-art schemes, especially in dense network scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS), which consists of numerous passive elements, has recently emerged in wireless communication systems as a promising technology providing 360$^\circ$ coverage and better performance. In our research, we introduce an active STAR-RIS (ASTARS)-aided integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system designed to optimize the radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), enhancing detection and signal transmission efficiency. The introduction of an ISAC system aims to improve both communication efficiency and sensing capabilities. Also, we employ orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to address the frequency-selective fading problem. Furthermore, we evaluate the radar sensing capabilities by examining the range and velocity, and assess the performance through the mean-squared error (MSE) of their estimations. Our simulation results demonstrate that ASTARS outperforms STAR-RIS in our system configurations, and that the proposed optimization approach further enhances the system performance. Additionally, we confirm that an increase in the subcarrier spacing can reduce the transmission bit error rate (BER) under high-velocity conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the theoretical impedance equations for several near-field antenna positions. In the standard model one computes the currents at the antennas for given voltages using the impedance matrix of the antennas, which is only possible if the determinant of the impedance matrix is non-zero. We consider Hertzian group antennas, its relative corresponding impedance and two approximations (mid and far) of it. For the approximations we show that for many situations the determinant is zero.
  We find three antenna configurations for three antennas, i.e., on a line, on a right triangle, and an isosceles triangle, which result in a zero determinant of the impedance for the far-field approximation. This means that with existing methods, one cannot determine the behavior of this antenna system. For the better mid approximation, we find a configuration of 15 triangular-positioned antennas resulting in a singular impedance matrix.
  Furthermore, we investigate $n\times n$ grid placed antennas in the more accurate Hertzian impedance model and find that for $d \approx 0.65$ wavelengths of grid distance for n = 2, ..., 8 the absolute value of the determinant of the corresponding impedance matrix decreases by an order of magnitude with each increased grid size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a workhorse of modern data science. While PCA assumes the data conforms to Euclidean geometry, for specific data types, such as hierarchical and cyclic data structures, other spaces are more appropriate. We study PCA in space forms; that is, those with constant curvatures. At a point on a Riemannian manifold, we can define a Riemannian affine subspace based on a set of tangent vectors. Finding the optimal low-dimensional affine subspace for given points in a space form amounts to dimensionality reduction. Our Space Form PCA (SFPCA) seeks the affine subspace that best represents a set of manifold-valued points with the minimum projection cost. We propose proper cost functions that enjoy two properties: (1) their optimal affine subspace is the solution to an eigenequation, and (2) optimal affine subspaces of different dimensions form a nested set. These properties provide advances over existing methods, which are mostly iterative algorithms with slow convergence and weaker theoretical guarantees. We evaluate the proposed SFPCA on real and simulated data in spherical and hyperbolic spaces. We show that it outperforms alternative methods in estimating true subspaces (in simulated data) with respect to convergence speed or accuracy, often both.</description>

      <title>Hashing Beam Training for Integrated Ground-Air-Space Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In integrated ground-air-space (IGAS) wireless networks, numerous services require sensing knowledge including location, angle, distance information, etc., which usually can be acquired during the beam training stage. On the other hand, IGAS networks employ large-scale antenna arrays to mitigate obstacle occlusion and path loss. However, large-scale arrays generate pencil-shaped beams, which necessitate a higher number of training beams to cover the desired space. These factors motivate our investigation into the IGAS beam training problem to achieve effective sensing services. To address the high complexity and low identification accuracy of existing beam training techniques, we propose an efficient hashing multi-arm beam (HMB) training scheme. Specifically, we first construct an IGAS single-beam training codebook for the uniform planar arrays. Then, the hash functions are chosen independently to construct the multi-arm beam training codebooks for each AP. All APs traverse the predefined multi-arm beam training codeword simultaneously and the multi-AP superimposed signals at the user are recorded. Finally, the soft decision and voting methods are applied to obtain the correctly aligned beams only based on the signal powers. In addition, we logically prove that the traversal complexity is at the logarithmic level. Simulation results show that our proposed IGAS HMB training method can achieve 96.4% identification accuracy of the exhaustive beam training method and greatly reduce the training overhead.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Representation for Numbers in Clinical Narratives Using CamemBERT-bio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research aims to classify numerical values extracted from medical documents across seven distinct physiological categories, employing CamemBERT-bio. Previous studies suggested that transformer-based models might not perform as well as traditional NLP models in such tasks. To enhance CamemBERT-bio's performances, we introduce two main innovations: integrating keyword embeddings into the model and adopting a number-agnostic strategy by excluding all numerical data from the text. The implementation of label embedding techniques refines the attention mechanisms, while the technique of using a `numerical-blind' dataset aims to bolster context-centric learning. Another key component of our research is determining the criticality of extracted numerical data. To achieve this, we utilized a simple approach that involves verifying if the value falls within the established standard ranges. Our findings are encouraging, showing substantial improvements in the effectiveness of CamemBERT-bio, surpassing conventional methods with an F1 score of 0.89. This represents an over 20\% increase over the 0.73 $F_1$ score of traditional approaches and an over 9\% increase over the 0.82 $F_1$ score of state-of-the-art approaches. All this was achieved despite using small and imbalanced training datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose efficient minimum-distance decoding and list-decoding algorithms for a certain class of analog subspace codes, referred to as character-polynomial (CP) codes, recently introduced by Soleymani and the second author. In particular, a CP code without its character can be viewed as a subcode of a Reed-Solomon (RS) code, where a certain subset of the coefficients of the message polynomial is set to zeros. We then demonstrate how classical decoding methods, including list decoders, for RS codes can be leveraged for decoding CP codes. For instance, it is shown that, in almost all cases, the list decoder behaves as a unique decoder. We also present a probabilistic analysis of the improvements in list decoding of CP codes when leveraging their certain structure as subcodes of RS codes.</description>

Abstract: Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have emerged as a crucial tool for high-resolution 3D imaging, particularly in autonomous vehicles, remote sensing, and augmented reality. However, the increasing demand for faster acquisition speed and higher resolution in LiDAR systems has highlighted the limitations of traditional mechanical scanning methods. This study introduces a novel wavelength-multiplexed code-division multiple access (CDMA) parallel laser ranging approach with a single-pixel receiver to address these challenges. By leveraging the unique properties of Gold-sequences in a direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) framework, our design enables comprehensive parallelization in detection and ranging activities to significantly enhance system efficiency and user capacity. The proposed coaxial architecture simplifies hardware requirements using a single avalanche photodiode (APD) for multi-reception, reducing susceptibility to ambient noise and external interferences. We demonstrate 3D imaging at 5 m and 10 m, and the experimental results highlight the capability of our CDMA LiDAR system to achieve 40 parallel ranging channels with centimeter-level depth resolution and an angular resolution of 0.03 degree. Furthermore, our system allows for user identification modulation, enabling identity-based ranging among different users. The robustness of our proposed system against interference and speckle noise and near-far signal problems, combined with its potential for miniaturization and integration into chip-scale optics, presents a promising avenue to develop high-performance, compact LiDAR systems suitable for commercial applications.</description>
