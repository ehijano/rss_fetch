      <title>Dynamical freezing and enhanced magnetometry in an interacting spin ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems is a fundamental challenge in modern physics, with profound implications for advancing quantum technologies. Typically, periodically driven systems in the absence of conservation laws thermalize to a featureless "infinite-temperature" state, erasing all memory of their initial conditions. However, this paradigm can break down through mechanisms such as integrability, many-body localization, quantum many-body scars, and Hilbert space fragmentation. Here, we report the experimental observation of dynamical freezing, a distinct mechanism of thermalization breakdown in driven systems, and demonstrate its application in quantum sensing using an ensemble of approximately $10^4$ interacting nitrogen-vacancy spins in diamond. By precisely controlling the driving frequency and detuning, we observe emergent long-lived spin magnetization and coherent oscillatory micromotions, persisting over timescales exceeding the interaction-limited coherence time ($T_2$) by more than an order of magnitude. Leveraging these unconventional dynamics, we develop a dynamical-freezing-enhanced ac magnetometry that extends optimal sensing times far beyond $T_2$, outperforming conventional dynamical decoupling magnetometry with a 4.3 dB sensitivity enhancement. Our results not only provide clear experimental observation of dynamical freezing -- a peculiar mechanism defying thermalization through emergent conservation laws -- but also establish a robust control method generally applicable to diverse physical platforms, with broad implications in quantum metrology and beyond.</description>

      <title>Field digitization scaling in a $\mathbb{Z}_N \subset U(1)$ symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of quantum field theories, both classical and quantum, requires regularization of infinitely many degrees of freedom. However, in the context of field digitization (FD) -- a truncation of the local fields to $N$ discrete values -- a comprehensive framework to obtain continuum results is currently missing. Here, we propose to analyze FD by interpreting the parameter $N$ as a coupling in the renormalization group (RG) sense. As a first example, we investigate the two-dimensional classical $N$-state clock model as a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ FD of the $U(1)$-symmetric $XY$-model. Using effective field theory, we employ the RG to derive generalized scaling hypotheses involving the FD parameter $N$, which allows us to relate data obtained for different $N$-regularized models in a procedure that we term $\textit{field digitization scaling}$ (FDS). Using numerical tensor-network calculations at finite bond dimension $\chi$, we further uncover an unconventional universal crossover around a low-temperature phase transition induced by finite $N$, demonstrating that FDS can be extended to describe the interplay of $\chi$ and $N$. Finally, we analytically prove that our calculations for the 2D classical-statistical $\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model are directly related to the quantum physics in the ground state of a (2+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory which serves as a FD of compact quantum electrodynamics. Our study thus paves the way for applications of FDS to quantum simulations of more complex models in higher spatial dimensions, where it could serve as a tool to analyze the continuum limit of digitized quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Majorization theory for quasiprobabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorization theory is a powerful mathematical tool to compare the disorder in distributions, with wide-ranging applications in many fields including mathematics, physics, information theory, and economics. While majorization theory typically focuses on probability distributions, quasiprobability distributions provide a pivotal framework for advancing our understanding of quantum mechanics, quantum information, and signal processing. Here, we introduce a notion of majorization for continuous quasiprobability distributions over infinite measure spaces. Generalizing a seminal theorem by Hardy, Littlewood, and P\'olya, we prove the equivalence of four definitions for both majorization and relative majorization in this setting. We give several applications of our results in the context of quantum resource theories, obtaining new families of resource monotones and no-goes for quantum state conversions. A prominent example we explore is the Wigner function in quantum optics. More generally, our results provide an extensive majorization framework for assessing the disorder of integrable functions over infinite measure spaces.</description>

      <title>Probing Bound State Relaxation Dynamics in Systems Out-of-Equilibrium on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pump-probe spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing response dynamics of quantum many-body systems in and out-of-equilibrium. Quantum computers have proved useful in simulating such experiments by exciting the system, evolving, and then measuring observables to first order, all in one setting. Here, we use this approach to investigate the mixed-field Ising model, where the longitudinal field plays the role of a confining potential that prohibits the spread of the excitations, spinons, or domain walls into space. We study the discrete bound states that arise from such a setting and their evolution under different quench dynamics by initially pumping the chain out of equilibrium and then probing various non-equal time correlation functions. Finally, we study false vacuum decay, where initially one expects unhindered propagation of the ground state, or true vacuum, bubbles into the lattice, but instead sees the emergence of Bloch oscillations that are directly the reason for the long-lived oscillations in this finite-size model. Our work sets the stage for simulating systems out-of-equilibrium on classical and quantum computers using pump-probe experiments without needing ancillary qubits.</description>

      <title>Improved Simulation of Asynchronous Entanglement Distribution in Noisy Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a lightweight simulation framework for evaluating asynchronous entanglement distribution protocols under realistic error models. We focus on two contemporary protocols: sequential, where entanglement is established one node at a time, and parallel, where all nodes attempt to generate entanglement simultaneously. We evaluate the performance of each protocol using two key metrics: the fidelity of distributed entangled states, and the hashing rate, a measure of entanglement efficiency. These metrics are compared between both protocols across a range of network sizes and noise parameters. We demonstrate that the parallel protocol consistently outperforms the sequential, particularly in the hashing rate metric due to reduced runtime, suggesting that parallel protocols are a strong candidate for a realizable quantum Internet. Our framework offers an accessible and scalable tool for evaluating entanglement distribution strategies, by reducing the simulation of complex quantum processes to simple memory time calculations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically optimal joint phase and dephasing strength estimation using spin-squeezed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show an explicit $N$-qubit protocol involving one-axis-twisted spin squeezed states, that allows for simultaneous phase and dephasing strength estimation with precision that asymptotically matches fundamental quantum metrological bounds. The relevance of the protocol goes beyond this particular model, since any uncorrelated noise quantum metrological model, that allows for at most constant asymptotic quantum enhancement, can be reduced to this problem via an appropriately tailored quantum error-correction procedure.</description>

      <title>Detecting quantum non-Gaussianity with a single quadrature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full reconstruction of quantum states from measurement samples is often a prohibitively complex task, both in terms of the experimental setup and the scaling of the sample size with the system. This motivates the relatively easier task of certifying application-specific quantities using measurements that are not tomographically complete, i.e. that provide only partial information about the state related to the application of interest. Here, we focus on simplifying the measurements needed to certify non-Gaussianity in bosonic systems, a resource related to quantum advantage in various information processing tasks. We show that the statistics of a single quadrature measurement, corresponding to standard homodyne detection in quantum optics, can witness arbitrary degrees of non-Gaussianity as quantified by stellar rank. Our results are based on a version of Hudson's theorem for wavefunctions, proved in a companion paper [1], revealing that the zeros in a homodyne distribution are signatures of quantum non-Gaussianity and higher stellar ranks. The validity of our witnesses is supported by a technical result showing that sets of states with bounded energy and finite stellar rank are compact. We provide an analysis of sample complexity, noise robustness, and experimental prospects. Our work drastically simplifies the setup required to detect quantum non-Gaussianity in bosonic quantum states. and experimental prospects. Our work drastically simplifies the setup required to detect quantum non-Gaussianity in bosonic quantum states.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Architectures for Scalable Quantum State Tomography: Benchmarking and Memristor-Based Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum State Tomography (QST) is essential for characterizing and validating quantum systems, but its practical use is severely limited by the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the number of measurements required for informational completeness. Many prior claims of performance have relied on architectural assumptions rather than systematic validation. We benchmark several neural network architectures to determine which scale effectively with qubit number and which fail to maintain high fidelity as system size increases.To address this, we perform a comprehensive benchmarking of diverse neural architectures across two quantum measurement strategies to evaluate their effectiveness in reconstructing both pure and mixed quantum states. Our results reveal that CNN and CGAN scale more robustly and achieve the highest fidelities, while Spiking Variational Autoencoder (SVAE) demonstrates moderate fidelity performance, making it a strong candidate for embedded, low-power hardware implementations.Recognizing that practical quantum diagnostics will require embedded, energy-efficient computation, we also discuss how memristor-based Computation-in-Memory (CiM) platforms can accelerate these models in hardware, mitigating memory bottlenecks and reducing energy consumption to enable scalable in-situ QST. This work identifies which architectures scale favorably for future quantum systems and lays the groundwork for quantum-classical co-design that is both computationally and physically scalable.</description>

      <title>Placing and Routing Non-Local Quantum Error Correcting Codes in Multi-Layer Superconducting Qubit Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) with asymptotically lower overheads than the surface code require non-local connectivity. Leveraging multi-layer routing and long-range coupling capabilities in superconducting qubit hardware, we develop Hardware-Aware Layout, HAL: a robust, runtime-efficient heuristic algorithm that automates and optimizes the placement and routing of arbitrary QECCs. Using HAL, we perform a comparative study of hardware cost across various families of QECCs, including the bivariate bicycle codes, the open-boundary tile codes, and the constant-depth-decodable radial codes. The layouts produced by HAL confirm that open boundaries significantly reduce the hardware cost, while incurring reductions in logical efficiency. Among the best-performing codes were low-weight radial codes, despite lacking topological structure. Overall, HAL provides a valuable framework for evaluating the hardware feasibility of existing QECCs and guiding the discovery of new codes compatible with realistic hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>Context-Dependent Time-Energy Uncertainty Relations from Projective Quantum Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for defining context-dependent time distributions in quantum systems using projective measurements. The time-of-flow (TF) distribution, derived from population transfer rates into a measurement subspace, yields a time--energy uncertainty relation of the form $\Delta \mathcal{T} \cdot \Delta H \geq \hbar / (6\sqrt{3}) \cdot \delta\theta$, where $\delta\theta$ quantifies net population transfer. This bound applies to arbitrary projectors under unitary dynamics and reveals that time uncertainty is inherently measurement-dependent. We demonstrate the framework with two applications: a general time-of-arrival (TOA)-energy uncertainty relation and a driven three-level system under detuned coherent driving. The TF framework unifies timing observables across spin, atomic, and matter-wave systems, and offers an experimentally accessible route to probing quantum timing in controlled measurements.</description>

      <title>Scalable Ion Fluorescence Collection Using a Trap-Integrated Metalens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scaled trapped-ion quantum computer will require efficient fluorescence collection across a large area. Here we propose and demonstrate a compact monolithically integrated system featuring a metalens fabricated on the backside of a surface ion trap. A 40$\times$100 $\mu$m aperture enables a simulated point-source collection efficiency of 0.91% and a measured point-source detection efficiency of 0.58%. Increasing the aperture area to 40$\times$600 $\mu$m boosts the simulated collection efficiency to 3.17%$-$comparable to that of a conventional objective with a numerical aperture of 0.35. Further improvements are possible by co-optimizing the electrode and aperture geometry. An undercut of the electrode substrate at the aperture ensures a large distance between the ion and dielectric substrate without compromising collection efficiency. The metalens directly collimates the collected fluorescence, eliminating the need for a high numerical aperture objective. An array of such readout zones will offer a compact, scalable solution for high-fidelity parallel readout in next-generation trapped-ion quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Bayesian Statistics to Accelerate Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a unified statistical framework that underscores the crucial role statistical inference plays in Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE), a task essential to fields ranging from chemistry to finance and machine learning. We use this framework to harness Bayesian statistics for improved measurement efficiency with rigorous interval estimates at all iterations of Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation. We demonstrate the resulting method, Bayesian Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation (BIQAE), accurately and efficiently estimates both quantum amplitudes and molecular ground-state energies to high accuracy, and show in analytic and numerical sample complexity analyses that BIQAE outperforms all other QAE approaches considered. Both rigorous mathematical proofs and numerical simulations conclusively indicate Bayesian statistics is the source of this advantage, a finding that invites further inquiry into the power of statistics to expedite the search for quantum utility.</description>

      <title>A Classical-Quantum Adder with Constant Workspace and Linear Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2004, Cuccaro et al found a quantum-quantum adder with $O(n)$ gate cost and $O(1)$ ancilla qubits. Since then, it's been an open question whether classical-quantum adders can achieve the same asymptotic complexity. These costs are particularly relevant to modular arithmetic circuits, which often offset by the classically known modulus.
  In this paper, I construct an adder that uses 3 clean ancillae and $4n \pm O(1)$ Toffoli gates to add a classical offset into a quantum register. I also present an adder with a Toffoli cost of $3n \pm O(1)$ that uses 2 clean ancillae and $n-2$ dirty ancillae. I further show that applying the presented adders conditioned on a control qubit requires no additional workspace or Toffolis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximity measurements probe whether pairs of particles are close to one another. We consider the impact of post-selected random proximity measurements on a quantum fluid of many distinguishable particles. We show that such measurements induce random spatial localization of a fraction of the particles, and yet preserve homogeneity macroscopically. Eventually, all particles localize, with a distribution of localization lengths that saturates at a scale controlled by the typical measurement rate. The steady-state distribution of these lengths is governed by a familiar scaling form.</description>

      <title>Quantification of the energy consumption of entanglement distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by environmental sciences, we develop a framework to quantify the energy needed to generate quantum entanglement via noisy quantum channels, focusing on the hardware-independent, i.e. fundamental cost. Within this framework, we define a measure of the minimal fundamental energy consumption rate per distributed entanglement (expressed in Joule per ebit). We then derive a lower bound on the energy cost of distributing a maximally entangled state via a quantum channel, which yields a quantitative estimate of energy investment per entangled bit for future quantum networks. We thereby show that irreversibility in entanglement theory implies a non-zero energy cost in standard entanglement distribution protocols. We further establish an upper bound on the fundamental energy consumption rate of entanglement distribution by determining the minimal energy required to implement quantum operations via classical control. To this end, we formulate the axioms for an energy cost measure and introduce a Hamiltonian model for classically-controlled quantum operations. The fundamental cost is then defined as the infimum energy over all such Hamiltonian protocols, with or without specific hardware constraints. The study of the energy cost of a quantum operation is general enough to be naturally applicable to quantum computing and is of independent interest. Finally, we evaluate the energy demands of three entanglement distillation protocols for photonic polarization qubits, finding that, due to entanglement irreversibility, their required energy exceeds the fundamental lower bound by many orders of magnitude. The introduced paradigm can be applied to other quantum resources, with appropriate changes depending on their nature.</description>

      <title>Neural network for excess noise estimation in continuous-variable quantum key distribution under composable finite-size security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter estimation is a critical step in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), especially in the finite-size regime where worst-case confidence intervals can significantly reduce the achievable secret-key rate. We provide a finite-size security analysis demonstrating that neural networks can be reliably employed for parameter estimation in CV-QKD with quantifiable failure probabilities $\epsilon_{PE}$, endowed with an operational interpretation and composable security guarantees. Using a protocol that is operationally equivalent to standard approaches, our method produces significantly tighter confidence intervals, unlocking higher key rates even under collective Gaussian attacks. The proposed approach yields tighter confidence intervals, leading to a quantifiable increase in the secret-key rate under collective Gaussian attacks. These results open up new perspectives for integrating modern machine learning techniques into quantum cryptographic protocols, particularly in practical resource-constrained scenarios.</description>

      <title>A multi-dimensional quantum estimation and model learning framework based on variational Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement and scaling of quantum technology has made the learning and identification of quantum systems and devices in highly-multidimensional parameter spaces a pressing task for a variety of applications. In many cases, the integration of real-time feedback control and adaptive choice of measurement settings places strict demands on the speed of this task. Here we present a joint model selection and parameter estimation algorithm that is fast and operable on a large number of model parameters. The algorithm is based on variational Bayesian inference (VBI), which approximates the target posterior distribution by optimizing a tractable family of distributions, making it more scalable than exact inference methods relying on sampling and that generally suffer from high variance and computational cost in high-dimensional spaces. We show how a regularizing prior can be used to select between competing models, each comprising a different number of parameters, identifying the simplest model that explains the experimental data. The regularization can further separate the degrees of freedom, e.g. quantum systems in the environment or processes, which contribute to major features in the observed dynamics, with respect to others featuring small coupling, which only contribute to a background. As an application of the introduced framework, we consider the problem of the identification of multiple individual nuclear spins with a single electron spin quantum sensor, relevant for nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance. With the number of environmental spins unknown a priori, our Bayesian approach is able to correctly identify the model, i.e. the number of spins and their couplings. We benchmark the algorithm on both simulated and experimental data, using standard figures of merit, and demonstrating that we can estimate dozens of parameters within minutes.</description>

      <title>Reformulating Chemical Equilibrium in Reacting Quantum Gas Mixtures: Particle Number Conservation, Correlations and Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical-ensemble description of reactive quantum gas mixtures is reformulated by incorporating a single global particle-number-conservation constraint over the combined spectra of inter-converting species. This constraint replaces the conventional equality of chemical potentials. Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein correlations naturally emerge across one-particle energy eigenstates of species sharing identical spin-statistics, which in ergodic single-systems manifest as intrinsic features of the equilibrium state. By embedding all microstates linked by conversion pathways, the framework incorporates concentration fluctuations in the statistical description. The formalism offers fresh insights into quantum chemical equilibrium in reactive mixtures with composition fluctuations and smoothly reduces to the classical ideal gas limit via an extended partition function that generalizes classical chemical-equilibrium treatments.</description>

      <title>Local-available quantum correlation swapping in one-parameter X states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although introduced originally for entanglement, quantum repeaters and swapping protocols have been analyzed for other quantum correlations (QC), such as quantum discord. Introduced by Mundarain and Ladr\'on de Guevara, local-available quantum correlations (LAQC) are a promising yet understudied quantum correlation. Recently, Bellor\'{\i}n et al. obtained exact analytical results for the LAQC quantifier of general 2-qubit X states. Starting from those previous results, we analyzed the LAQC swapping for five families of one-parameter 2-qubit X states. As expected, we find that if the initial state and the one used for the projective measurement are correlated, the final state will have non-zero LAQC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict a gyroscopic effect that can be demonstrated with Rydberg atoms following the dynamics of a Kepler Hamiltonian with an additional uniaxial anisotropy induced by optical ponderomotive force. This effect is analogous to the rotation of the Foucault pendulum in response to the Earth's rotation. We argue that in Rydberg states a similar geometric angle can be generated by mechanical rotations of an atomic-optical setup on time scales between $1~\mu$s and $1~$ms.</description>

      <title>A Practical Open-Source Software Stack for a Cloud-Based Quantum Computing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the late 2010s, quantum computers have become commercially available, and the number of services that users can run remotely via cloud servers is increasing. In Japan, several domestic superconducting quantum computing systems, including our own, began operation in 2023. However, the design of quantum computing systems, especially in the most critical areas near quantum computers, remains largely undisclosed, creating a significant barrier to entry into the quantum computing field. If this situation continues, progress toward standardization, which is essential for guiding quantum computer development, will stall, and it will be difficult to develop a practical quantum computing system that can perform calculations on a supercomputer scale. To address this issue, we propose Open Quantum Toolchain for OPerators and USers (OQTOPUS), a full-stack quantum computing system developed from research with real quantum computers. OQTOPUS is one of the world's largest open-source software projects, covering operational software from cloud-based execution environment construction to system operation. Furthermore, to perform quantum computing effectively and efficiently, it implements key features, such as transpilers, multiprogramming, and error mitigation, in an area as close as possible to a quantum computer, an area that system vendors rarely disclose. Finally, this study presents experimental results of applying OQTOPUS to a real quantum computer. OQTOPUS is publicly available on GitHub and will notably lower the barrier to entry into the quantum computing field, contributing to the formation of a quantum computing developer community through open discussion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a technology that ensures secure communication by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, such as the no-cloning theorem and quantum uncertainty. This chapter provides an overview of this quantum technology's maturity and trends. It highlights significant advancements in single-photon sources and detection technologies that have brought QKD closer to widespread adoption, including real-world deployments by industry leaders. While addressing challenges such as cost, integration, standardization, and the need for quantum repeaters, the chapter emphasizes the growing importance of QKD in securing mission-critical communications against future quantum threats. Through its unique ability to achieve information-theoretic security, QKD is poised to play a vital role in quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms and protocols.</description>

      <title>Long-range photonic device-independent quantum key distribution using SPDC sources and linear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI QKD) offers unparalleled cryptographic security by eliminating trust requirements for quantum devices, yet has remained impractical for long-distance implementation due to fundamental rate limitations. Here, we propose the first experimentally viable schemes for long-distance DI QKD using two fully photonic approaches with heralded entanglement distribution using spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) sources. Both schemes achieve key rate scaling with the square root of channel transmissivity $\eta_t$, matching the twin-field protocol advantage rather than the prohibitive linear decay of conventional QKD. We demonstrate positive key rates at detector efficiencies as low as 83\%, bringing DI QKD within reach of the current superconducting detector technology. Our security analysis employs the Entropy Accumulation Theorem to establish rigorous finite-size bounds, while numerical optimization yields custom Bell certificates that surpass standard approaches by 2--3 times at maximum transmission distances. This work represents a critical milestone toward device-independent security in quantum communication networks, providing experimentalists with practical implementation pathways while maintaining the strongest possible security guarantees against quantum adversaries.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and Scalable Coupling of Single 4H-SiC Spin Defects into Bullseye Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) has attracted significant attention as a promising quantum material due to its ability to host long-lived, optically addressable color centers with solid-state photonic interfaces. The CMOS compatibility of 4H-SiCOI (silicon-carbide-on-insulator) makes it an ideal platform for integrated quantum photonic devices and circuits. However, the deterministic integration of single spin defects into high-performance photonic cavities on this platform has remained a key challenge. In this work, we demonstrate the deterministic and scalable coupling of both ensemble (PL4) and single PL6 spin defects into monolithic bullseye cavities on the 4H-SiCOI platform. By tuning the cavity resonance, we achieve a 40-fold enhancement of the zero-phonon line (ZPL) intensity from ensemble PL4 defects, corresponding to a Purcell factor of approximately 5.0. For deterministically coupled single PL6 defects, we observe a threefold increase in the saturated photon count rate, confirm single-photon emission, and demonstrate coherent control of the spin state through optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), resonant excitation, and Rabi oscillations. These advancements establish a viable pathway for developing scalable, high-performance SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Environment-assisted and weak measurement strategies for robust bidirectional quantum teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents strategies for enhancing the robustness of bidirectional quantum teleportation (BQT) through environment-assisted and weak measurement techniques. BQT is a crucial component of distributed quantum networks, allowing for the bilateral transfer of quantum information between two nodes. While perfect teleportation necessitates maximally entangled states, these are vulnerable to degradation due to inherent decoherence. We propose a BQT scheme that enables the bilateral transfer of arbitrary qubits between nodes via amplitude damping channels (ADC), aiming to optimize fidelity using weak measurements in the final step of the process. Environment-assisted measurements (EAM) are used to establish a four-qubit channel composed of two Bell states. We explore two situations: (I) where only the recovery qubits pass through amplitude damping channels and (II) where the entire four-qubit channel is subjected to ADC. Our findings demonstrate a balance between average fidelity and success probability when the weak measurement strength ($q_w$) is constrained by the decay rate ($p$), specifically $q_w \in {[0,p]}$. Perfect BQT is achieved when $q_w = p$, indicating complete suppression of ADC effects. On the other hand, a decline in both average fidelity and success probability is noted when the weak measurement strength surpasses the ADC strength, marking the prohibited domain as $q_w \in {(p,1]}$. Additionally, our secured BQT protocol consistently outperforms the unprotected scheme in both scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed protection strategies.</description>

      <title>Novel Quantum Circuit Designs of Random Injection and Payoff Computation for Financial Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement enables exponential computational states, while superposition provides inherent parallelism. Consequently, quantum circuits are theoretically capable of supporting large scale parallel computation. However, applying them to financial analysis particularly in the areas of random number generation and payoff computation remains a significant challenge. Experts generally believe that quantum computing relies on matrix operations, which are deterministic in nature without randomness. This inherent determinism makes it particularly challenging to design quantum circuits that require random number injection. JP Morgan[1] introduced the piecewise linear (PWL) approach for modeling payoff computations but did not disclose a quantum circuit capable of identifying values exceeding the strike price, suggesting a possible reliance on classical pre processing for interval classification. This paper presents an integrated quantum circuit with two key components: one for random number injection, applicable to risk assessment, and the other for direct payoff computation, relevant to financial pricing. These components are compatible with a scalable framework that leverages large scale parallelism and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) to achieve quadratic speedup. The circuit was implemented on IBM Qiskit and evaluated using 8 parallel threads and 1600 measurement shots. Results confirmed both the presence of randomness and the correctness of payoff computation. While the current implementation uses 8 threads, the design scales to 2 to the power of n threads, for arbitrarily large n, offering a potential path toward demonstrating quantum supremacy.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Extrapolation-Based Quantum Error Mitigation Using Repetitive Structure in Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation is a crucial technique for suppressing errors especially in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, enabling more reliable quantum computation without the overhead of full error correction. Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE), which we mainly consider in this work, is one of prominent quantum error mitigation methods. For algorithms with deep circuits - such as iterative quantum algorithms involving multiple oracle calls - ZNE's effectiveness is significantly degraded under high noise. Extrapolation based on such low-fidelity data often yields inaccurate estimates and requires substantial overhead. In this study, we propose a lightweight, extrapolation-based error mitigation framework tailored for structured quantum algorithms composed of repeating operational blocks. The proposed method characterizes the error of the repeated core operational block, rather than the full algorithm, using shallow circuits. Extrapolation is used to estimate the block fidelity, followed by a reconstruction of the mitigated success probability. We validate our method via simulations of the 6-qubit Grover's algorithm on IBM's Aer simulator, then further evaluating it on the real 127-qubit IBM Quantum system based on Eagle r3 under a physical noise environment. Our results, particularly those from Aer simulator, demonstrate that the core block's error follows a highly consistent exponential decay. This allows our technique to achieve robust error mitigation, overcoming the limitations of conventional ZNE which is often compromised by statistically unreliable data from near-random behavior under heavy noise. In low-noise conditions, our method approaches theoretical success probability, outperforms ZNE. In high-noise conditions, ZNE fails to mitigate errors due to overfitting of its extrapolation data, whereas our method achieves over a 20% higher success probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously analyze the non-equilibrium thermodynamic behavior of various formulations of quantum Brownian motion (QBM) using the framework of stochastic thermodynamics. While the widely used Caldeira-Leggett master equation exhibits desirable thermodynamic features, such as the fulfilment of a detailed balance, it fails to ensure complete positivity. In contrast, several completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) extensions turn out to be thermodynamically controversial. We show that such extensions introduce anomalous phase-space structures that violate detailed balance at the steady state, leading to non-vanishing entropy production and effective non-equilibrium current of unclear physical origins. Our results highlight a fundamental tension between quantum consistency and thermodynamic equilibration in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Fully Passive Discrete-State Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution With Local Local Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a fully passive discrete-state continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), which can eliminate all modulator side channels on the source side, using a local local oscillator (LLO). The CV-QKD system achieves a maximum transmission length of 100 km with a repetition rate of 1 GHz using specially designed phase rotation and discretization methods, and the corresponding secret key bit rate is 127 kbps, as estimated based on the amplitude of prepared states at the transmitter, as well as the first- and second-order moments of quadratures at the receiver by employing the convex optimization without imposing any assumptions on the quantum channel. The performance of the protocol is similar to that of modulated CV LLO protocols and better than those of passive discrete-variable and CV protocols. Our protocol is expected to play an important role in the quantum metropolitan area networks and quantum access networks with high realistic security.</description>

      <title>Transfer entropy and O-information to detect grokking in tensor network multi-class classification problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-enhanced machine learning, encompassing both quantum algorithms and quantum-inspired classical methods such as tensor networks, offers promising tools for extracting structure from complex, high-dimensional data. In this work, we study the training dynamics of Matrix Product State (MPS) classifiers applied to three-class problems, using both fashion MNIST and hyper-spectral satellite imagery as representative datasets. We investigate the phenomenon of grokking, where generalization emerges suddenly after memorization, by tracking entanglement entropy, local magnetization, and model performance across training sweeps. Additionally, we employ information theory tools to gain deeper insights: transfer entropy is used to reveal causal dependencies between label-specific quantum masks, while O-information captures the shift from synergistic to redundant correlations among class outputs. Our results show that grokking in the fashion MNIST task coincides with a sharp entanglement transition and a peak in redundant information, whereas the overfitted hyper-spectral model retains synergistic, disordered behavior. These findings highlight the relevance of high-order information dynamics in quantum-inspired learning and emphasize the distinct learning behaviors that emerge in multi-class classification, offering a principled framework to interpret generalization in quantum machine learning architectures.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Parameters in Quantum Systems: Revisiting Berry Phase, Curvature and Gauge Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reformulation of quantum adiabatic theory in terms of an emergent electromagnetic framework, emphasizing the physical consequences of geometric structures in parameter space. Contrary to conventional approaches, we demonstrate that a Berry electric field naturally arises in systems with dynamic Hamiltonian, when the full time-dependent wavefunction is used to define the gauge potentials. This surprising result bridges the gap between static and dynamical formulations and leads to a deeper understanding of how gauge structures manifest in quantum systems. Building on this, we construct Berry Maxwell equations by analogy with classical electrodynamics, defining Berry electric and magnetic fields as derivatives of scalar and vector potentials obtained from the full quantum state. We verify these equations explicitly and derive field-theoretic identities such as generalized continuity and vorticity relations. This field-based formulation reveals the topological charges, monopole structures, and gauge currents that underlie parameter space, and clarifies how Berry curvature corrections enter dynamical quantities like expectation values and particle velocities. Our results establish a new regime of emergent electromagnetism in parameter space, unifying time-independent and time-dependent geometric phases within a covariant formalism. The implications extend to quantum transport, polarization, and topological classification of phases, providing a robust and generalizable framework for quantum systems driven by adiabatic or nonadiabatic evolution.</description>

      <title>Measure of entanglement production by quantum operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A measure of entanglement production by quantum operations is suggested. This measure is general, being valid for operations over pure states as well as over mixed states, for equilibrium as well as for nonequilibrium processes. The measure of entanglement production satisfies all properties typical of such a characteristic. Systems of arbitrary nature can be treated, described by field operators, spin operators, or any other operators, which is realized by defining generalized correlation matrices. Particular cases of entanglement production are considered.</description>

      <title>Analysis of untrusted-node quantum key distribution from a geostationary satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pursuit of a global quantum key distribution (QKD) network, a service based on untrusted nodes on geostationary satellites could offer wide coverage, continuous operation, and enhanced security compared to the trusted node alternative. Although this scenario has been studied for entanglement-based protocols, such an approach would require large-area telescopes both on the ground and in space. In this work, we analyze the performance of two QKD protocols well adapted to this scenario, namely twin-field (TF) and mode-pairing (MP) QKD, which exhibit high resilience to high-loss channels. Leveraging an in-depth simulation of communication channels corrected with adaptive optics, we assess the expected secret key rates for both protocols in a configuration involving two 50 cm telescopes on board the satellite and ground-based telescopes ranging from 20 cm to 1 m in aperture. Our results show that, in the best case and considering realistic detectors, it is possible to achieve secret key rates on the order of a few hundred bit/s for both TF and MP-QKD. We show, notably, that secret key generation is potentially feasible even with 20 cm ground telescopes, highlighting the high scalability potential of such a configuration.</description>

      <title>On the complex zeros of the wavefunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger wavefunction is ubiquitous in quantum mechanics, quantum chemistry, and bosonic quantum information theory. Its zero-set for fermionic systems is well-studied and central for determining chemical properties, yet for bosonic systems the zero-set is less understood, especially in the context of characterizing non-classicality. Here we study the zeros of such wavefunctions and give them a novel information-theoretic interpretation. Our main technical result is showing that the wavefunction of most bosonic quantum systems can be extended to a holomorphic function over the complex plane, allowing the application of powerful techniques from complex analysis. As a consequence, we prove a version of Hudson's theorem for the wavefunction and characterize Gaussian dynamics as classical motion of the wavefunction zeros. Our findings suggest that the non-Gaussianity of quantum optical states can be detected by measuring a single quadrature of the electromagnetic field, which we demonstrate in a companion paper [1]. More generally, our results show that the non-Gaussian features of bosonic quantum systems are encoded in the zeros of their wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Classification of coined quantum walks on the line and comparison to correlated classical random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive classification of one-dimensional coined quantum walks on the infinite line, focusing on the spatial probability distributions they induce. Building on prior results, we identify all initial coin states that lead to symmetric quantum walks for arbitrary coins, and provide a bijective parametrisation of all symmetric quantum walks modulo distributional equivalence. Extending beyond the symmetric case, we also give a surjective parametrisation of all coined quantum walks under the same equivalence relation and a bijective parametrisation modulo equivalence of the walks' limiting distributions.
  Furthermore, we derive corrected closed-form expressions for the walk amplitudes, resolving inaccuracies in previous literature, and generalise the approach to the correlated classical random walk. This unified framework enables a direct comparison between quantum and classical dynamics. Additionally, we discuss the asymptotic scaling of variances for both models, identifying quadratic spreading as a hallmark of non-trivial quantum walks and contrasting it with the linear behaviour of classical walks, except at the extremal points of maximal correlation. Finally, we compare the limiting distributions arising from quantum walks with the ones in the classical case.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced dark matter detection using Schr\"odinger cat states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology enables sensitive dark matter detection, particularly using nonclassical states, such as Schr\"odinger cat states featuring sub-Planck interference structures in microwave cavities. Here, we report the first experimental application of four-component Schr\"odinger cat states within a high-quality superconducting microwave cavity to detect dark photons, a potential dark matter candidate. We demonstrate an 8.1-fold enhancement in the signal photon rate and constrain the dark photon kinetic mixing angle to an unprecedented $\epsilon &lt; 7.32 \times 10^{-16}$ near 6.44~GHz (26.6~$\mu$eV). By employing a parametric sideband drive to actively tune the cavity frequency, we achieve dark photon searches and background subtraction across multiple frequency bins, yielding a sensitivity at the $10^{-16}$ level within a 100~kHz bandwidth. Our Schr\"odinger's cat-assisted detection (SCaD) scheme demonstrates a substantial improvement over previous results, promising potential implications in quantum-enhanced searches for new physics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quasi-Bound State in the Continuum at Topological Quantum Optics Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological manipulation of light provides a versatile toolbox for photonic technologies. Here, we show that a topological atom array can induce photon localization in a waveguide via symmetry-protected light-matter interaction. Long-lived photon-atom entanglement reveals the existence of a novel topological quasi-bound state in the continuum (quasi-BIC). This hybrid light-matter quasi-BIC is formed at a critical coupling condition via collectively induced absorption, which is produced by quantum interference between edge and bulk states. We uncover the time-reversed relation between topological quasi-BIC and light amplification. Interestingly, one can realize a directional ultranarrow amplifier by means of critical coupling. Our work demonstrates an unconventional quasi-BIC at a topological quantum optics interface with potential applications in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Kirkwood-Dirac positivity on second countable LCA groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability representation of quantum mechanics associated with the Fourier transform over second countable locally compact abelian groups. We discuss its link with the Kohn-Nirenberg quantization of the phase space $G\times \widehat{G}$. We use it to argue that in this abstract setting the Wigner-Weyl quantization, when it exists, can still be interpreted as a symmetric ordering. Then, we identify all generalized (non-normalizable) pure states having a positive Kirkwood-Dirac distribution. They are, up to the natural action of the Weyl-Heisenberg group, Haar measures on closed subgroups. This generalizes a result known for finite abelian groups. We then show that the classical fragment of quantum mechanics associated with the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution is non-trivial if and only if the group has a compact connected component. Finally, we provide for connected compact abelian groups a complete geometric description of this classical fragment.</description>

      <title>Probing electronic state-dependent conformational changes in a trapped Rydberg ion Wigner crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-dependent conformational changes play a central role in molecular dynamics, yet they are often difficult to observe or simulate due to their complexity and ultrafast nature. One alternative approach is to emulate such phenomena using quantum simulations with cold, trapped ions. In their electronic ground state, these ions form long-lived Wigner crystals. When excited to high-lying electronic Rydberg states, the ions experience a modified trapping potential, resulting in a strong coupling between their electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. In an ion crystal, this vibronic coupling creates electronic state-dependent potential energy surfaces that can support distinct crystal structures -- closely resembling the conformational changes of molecules driven by electronic excitations. Here, we present the first experimental observation of this effect, by laser-coupling a single ion at the centre of a three-ion crystal to a Rydberg state. By tuning the system close to a structural phase transition, the excitation induces a state-dependent conformational change, transforming the Wigner crystal from a linear to a zigzag configuration. This structural change leads to a strong hybridisation between vibrational and electronic states, producing a clear spectroscopic signature in the Rydberg excitation. Our findings mark the first experimental step towards using Rydberg ions to create and study artificial molecular systems. change leads to a strong hybridisation between vibrational and electronic states, producing a clear spectroscopic signature in the Rydberg excitation.

      <title>Charge acceleration without radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of electromagnetic radiation - radio-waves, microwaves, light, x-rays and so on - is one of the most important physical phenomena, and our ability to manipulate them is one of the most significant technological achievement of humankind. Underlying this ability is our understanding of how radiation is produced: whenever an electric charge is accelerated, it radiates. Or, at least, this is how it has been hitherto universally thought. Here we prove that quantum mechanically electric charges can be accelerated without radiating. The physical setup leading to this behavior is relatively simple (once one knows what to do) but its reasons are deep: it relies on the fact that quantum mechanically particles can be accelerated even when no forces act on them, via the Aharonov-Bohm effect. As we argue, the effect presented here is just them tip of an iceberg - it implies the need to reconsider the basic understanding of radiation. Finally, it seems clear that the effect goes far beyond electromagnetism and applies to any kind of radiation.</description>

      <title>Swap Network Augmented Ans\"atze on Arbitrary Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient parametrizations of quantum states are essential for trainable hybrid classical-quantum algorithms. A key challenge in their design consists in adapting to the available qubit connectivity of the quantum processor, which limits the capacity to generate correlations between distant qubits in a resource-efficient and trainable manner. In this work we first introduce an algorithm that optimizes qubit routing for arbitrary connectivity graphs, resulting in a swap network that enables direct interactions between any pair of qubits. We then propose a co-design of circuit layers and qubit routing by embedding the derived swap networks within layered, connectivity-aware ans\"atze. This construction significantly improves the trainability of the ansatz, leading to enhanced performance with reduced resources. We showcase these improvements through ground-state simulations of strongly correlated systems, including spin-glass and molecular electronic structure models. Across exemplified connectivities, the swap-enhanced ansatz consistently achieves lower energy errors using fewer entangling gates, shallower circuits, and fewer parameters than standard layered-structured baselines. Our results indicate that swap network augmented ans\"atze provide enhanced trainability and resource-efficient design to capture complex correlations on devices with constrained qubit connectivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that global properties of an unknown quantum network, such as the average degree, hub density, and the number of closed paths of fixed length, can be inferred from strictly local quantum measurements. In particular, we demonstrate that a malicious agent with access to only a small subset of nodes can initialize quantum states locally and, through repeated short-time measurements, extract sensitive structural information about the entire network. The intrusion strategy is inspired by extreme learning and quantum reservoir computing and combines short-time quantum evolution with a non-iterative linear readout with trainable weights. These results suggest new strategies for intrusion detection and structural diagnostics in future quantum Internet infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Sandwich test for Quantum Phase Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) has potential for a scientific revolution through numerous practical applications like finding better medicines, batteries, materials, catalysts etc. Many QPE algorithms use the Hadamard test to estimate $\langle \psi|U^{k}|\psi\rangle$ for a large integer $k$ for an efficiently preparable initial state $|\psi\rangle$ and an efficiently implementable unitary operator $U$. The Hadamard test is hard to implement because it requires controlled applications of $U^{k}$. Recently, a Sequential Hadamard test (SHT) was proposed (arXiv:2506.18765) which requires controlled application of $U$ only but its total run time $T_{\rm tot}$ scales as $\mathcal{O}(k^{3}/\epsilon^{2}r_{\rm min}^{2})$ where $r_{\rm min}$ is the minimum value of $|\langle \psi|U^{k'}|\psi\rangle|$ among all integers $k' \leq k$. Typically $r_{\rm min}$ is exponentially low and SHT becomes too slow. We present a new algorithm, the SANDWICH test to address this bottleneck. Our algorithm uses efficient preparation of the initial state $|\psi\rangle$ to efficiently implement the SPROTIS operator $R_{\psi}^{\phi}$ where SPROTIS stands for the Selective Phase Rotation of the Initial State. It sandwiches the SPROTIS operator between $U^{a}$ and $U^{b}$ for integers $\{a,b\} \leq k$ to estimate $\langle \psi|U^{k}|\psi\rangle$. The total run time $T_{\rm tot}$ is $\mathcal{O}(k^{2}\ln k/ \epsilon^{2} s_{\rm min}^{6})$. Here $s_{\rm min}$ is the minimum value of $|\langle \psi|U^{\hat{k}}|\psi\rangle$ among all integers $\hat{k}$ which are values of the nodes of a random binary sum tree whose root node value is $k$ and leaf nodes' values are $1$ or $0$. It can be reasonably expected that $s_{\rm min} \not\ll 1$ in typical cases because there is wide freedom in choosing the random binary sum tree.</description>

      <title>Quantum scarring enhances non-Markovianity of subsystem dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given that any subsystem of a closed out-of-equilibrium quantum system is an open quantum system, its dynamics (reduced from the full system's unitary evolution) can be either Markovian (memory-less) or non-Markovian, with the latter necessarily impeding the process of relaxation and thermalization. Seemingly independently, such non-ergodic dynamics occurs when an initial state has spectral weight on the so-called quantum scar states, which are non-thermalizing states embedded deep in the spectrum of otherwise thermal states. In this article, we present numerical evidence that the presence of quantum scars is a microscopic ingredient that enables and enhances non-Markovianity of the dynamics of subsystems. We exemplify this with the PXP model and its deformations which either enhance or erase the signatures of scarred dynamics when quenched from a simple product state that is known to have significant overlaps with the scarred subspace in the spectrum. By probing information backflows with the dynamical behaviour of the distances between temporally-separated states of small subsystems, systematic signatures of subsystem non-Markovianity in these models are presented, and it is seen that scarring-enhancing (erasing) deformations also exhibit enhanced (diminished) subsystem non-Markovianity. This sheds new light on the dynamical memories associated with quantum scarring, and opens interesting new questions at the interface of quantum scarring and an open quantum systems approach to investigating far-from-equilibrium and non-thermalizing isolated quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum technologies offer exceptional -- sometimes almost magical -- speed and performance, yet every quantum process costs physical resources. Designing next-generation quantum devices, therefore, depends on solving the following question: which resources, and in what amount, are required to implement a desired quantum process? Casting the problem in the language of quantum resource theories, we prove a universal cost-irreversibility tradeoff: the lower the irreversibility of a quantum process, the greater the required resource cost for its realization. The trade-off law holds for a broad range of resources -- energy, magic, asymmetry, coherence, athermality, and others -- yielding lower bounds on resource cost of any quantum channel. Its broad scope positions this result as a foundation for deriving the following key results: (1) we show a universal relation between the energetic cost and the irreversibility for arbitrary channels, encompassing the energy-error tradeoff for any measurement or unitary gate; (2) we extend the energy-error tradeoff to free energy and work costs; (3) we extend the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem, which is the universal limitation on measurements under conservation laws, to a wide class of resource theories: the probability of failure in distinguishing resourceful states via a measurement is inversely proportional to its resource cost; (4) we prove that infinitely many resource-non-increasing operations in fact require an infinite implementation cost. These findings reveal a universal relationship between quantumness and irreversibility, providing a first step toward a general theory that explains when -- and how -- quantumness can suppress irreversibility.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Heralding and Optimal Decoders for Non-Abelian Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological order (TO) provides a natural platform for storing and manipulating quantum information. However, its stability to noise has only been systematically understood for Abelian TOs. In this work, we exploit the non-deterministic fusion of non-Abelian anyons to inform active error correction and design decoders where the fusion products, instead of flag qubits, herald the noise. This intrinsic heralding enhances thresholds over those of Abelian counterparts when noise is dominated by a single non-Abelian anyon type. Furthermore, we present an approach for determining the optimal threshold for non-Abelian TOs with perfect anyon syndromes for any noise model, formulated as a statistical mechanics model using Bayesian inference. We numerically illustrate these results for $D_4 \cong \mathbb Z_4 \rtimes \mathbb Z_2$ TO. In particular, for non-Abelian charge noise and perfect syndrome measurement, we find an optimal threshold $p_c=0.218(1)$, whereas an intrinsically heralded minimal-weight perfect-matching (MWPM) decoder already gives $p_c=0.20842(2)$, outperforming standard MWPM with $p_c = 0.15860(1)$. Our work highlights how non-Abelian properties can enhance stability, rather than reduce it, and discusses potential generalizations for achieving fault tolerance.</description>

      <title>Transport-Induced Decoherence of the Entangled Triplet Exciton Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoherence effects for entangled triplet pairs in organic molecular crystals are analyzed for the case when excitons can hop between inequivalent lattice sites. The fluorescence quantum beats caused by quantum interference upon triplet-triplet recombination into an emissive singlet state are predicted as a function of hopping time and magnetic field based on a Monte Carlo analysis. Depending on exciton hopping rates, it is possible to have complete global decoherence and suppression of fluorescence quantum beats in the limit of zero magnetic field, and to have quantum beats that decay at different rates depending on magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>Amplitude amplification and estimation require inverses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the generic quantum speedups for brute-force search and counting only hold when the process we apply them to can be efficiently inverted. The algorithms speeding up these problems, amplitude amplification and amplitude estimation, assume the ability to apply a state preparation unitary $U$ and its inverse $U^\dagger$; we give problem instances based on trace estimation where no algorithm which uses only $U$ beats the naive, quadratically slower approach. Our proof of this is simple and goes through the compressed oracle method introduced by Zhandry. Since these two subroutines are responsible for the ubiquity of the quadratic "Grover" speedup in quantum algorithms, our result explains why such speedups are far harder to come by in the settings of quantum learning, metrology, and sensing. In these settings, $U$ models the evolution of an experimental system, so implementing $U^\dagger$ can be much harder -- tantamount to reversing time within the system. Our result suggests a dichotomy: without inverse access, quantum speedups are scarce; with it, quantum speedups abound.</description>

      <title>The persistence of spin coherence in a crystalline environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze quantum interference in the triplet-exciton pair generated by singlet exciton fission in a molecular crystal, and introduce transport-induced dephasing (TID) as a key effect that can suppress the expected fluorescence quantum beats when the triplet-exciton wavefunction can localize on inequivalent sites. TID depends on the triplet-exciton hopping rate between inequivalent sites and on the energy-shifts among the stationary states of the entangled triplet pair in different spatial configurations. The theoretical model is confirmed by experiments in rubrene single crystals, where triplet pairs remain entangled for more than 50 ns but quantum beats are suppressed by TID within a few nanoseconds when the magnetic field is misaligned by just a few degrees from specific symmetric directions. Our experiments deliver the zero-field parameters for the rubrene molecule in its orthorhombic lattice and information on triplet-exciton transport, in particular the triplet-exciton hopping rate between inequivalent sites, which we evaluate to be of the order of 150 ps in rubrene.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Axionic Black-Hole Clouds as Seeds for Graviton Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that both, standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons, induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is effective.</description>

      <title>Clock Pulling Enables Maximum-Efficiency Wireless Power Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear parity-time (PT) symmetry in non-Hermitian wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, while attracting significant attention from both physics and engineering communities, have posed formidable theoretical and practical challenges due to their complex dynamical mechanisms. Here, we revisit multistability in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems and find that the PT-symmetry state is not always stable even in PT-symmetry phase. We report a discovery on a nonlinear clock-pulling mechanism, which can forcibly break the PT symmetry. Proper implementation of this mechanism can switch the system stability, particularly in stabilizing the conventional unstable state which has the maximum transfer efficiency for WPT. Our work offers new tools for non-Hermitian physics and is expected to drive technological progress.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Representations for Intrinsically Mixed-State Topological Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks are an efficient platform to represent interesting quantum states of matter as well as to compute physical observables and information-theoretic quantities. We present a general protocol to construct fixed-point tensor network representations for intrinsically mixed-state topological phases, which exhibit nontrivial topological phenomena and do not have pure-state counterparts. The method exploits the power of anyon condensation in Choi states and is applicable to the cases where the target states arise from pure-state topological phases subject to strong decoherence/disorders in the Abelian sectors. Representative examples include $m^a e^b$ decoherence of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, decohered non-Abelian $S_3$ quantum double as well as pure $Z$/$X$ decoherence of arbitrary CSS codes. An example of chiral topological phases which cannot arise from local commuting projector models are also presented.</description>

      <title>From confinement to chaos in AdS/CFT correspondence via non-equilibrium local states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study excited states in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space prepared by local operator insertions of a massive scalar field, corresponding to operator quenches for free fields in AdS. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the time evolution of boundary observables in the dual states. We then introduce a hard wall in AdS Poincare coordinates to impose an infrared cutoff, creating a confining deformation of the dual conformal field theory, and analyze the dynamics of excited states in this confining background. By comparing the evolution of boundary two-point correlation functions in the deformed theory to the statistics of Gaussian random matrix ensembles, we show that for sufficiently heavy operators the fluctuations approach quite close those of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). Finally, we extend our analysis to the compact BTZ black hole and its hard wall deformation, finding qualitatively similar behavior.</description>

      <title>Exploring Many-Body Quantum Geometry Beyond the Quantum Metric with Correlation Functions: A Time-Dependent Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor and quantum Fisher information have recently been shown to provide a unified geometric description of the linear response of many-body systems. However, a similar geometric description of higher-order perturbative phenomena including nonlinear response in generic quantum systems is lacking. In this work, we develop a general framework for the time-dependent quantum geometry of many-body systems by treating external perturbing fields as coordinates on the space of density matrices. We use the Bures distance between the initial and time-evolved density matrix to define geometric quantities through a perturbative expansion. To lowest order, we derive a time-dependent generalization of the Bures metric related to the spectral density of linear response functions, unifying previous results for the quantum metric in various limits and providing a geometric interpretation of Fermi's golden rule. At next order in the expansion, we define a time-dependent Bures-Levi-Civita connection for general many-body systems. We show that the connection is the sum of one contribution that is related to a second-order nonlinear response function, and a second contribution that captures the higher geometric structure of first-order perturbation theory. We show that in the quasistatic, zero-temperature limit for noninteracting fermions, this Bures connection reduces to the known expression for band-theoretic Christoffel symbols. Our work provides a systematic framework to explore many-body quantum geometry beyond the quantum metric and highlights how higher-order correlation functions can probe this geometry.</description>

      <title>Path integral analysis of Schr\"odinger-type eigenvalue problems in the complex plane: Establishing the relation between instantons and resonant states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger-type eigenvalue problems are ubiquitous in theoretical physics, with quantum-mechanical applications typically confined to cases for which the eigenfunctions are required to be normalizable on the real axis. However, seeking the spectrum of resonant states for metastable potentials or comprehending $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric scenarios requires the broader study of eigenvalue problems for which the boundary conditions are provided in specific angular sectors of the complex plane. We generalize the conventional path integral treatment to such nonstandard boundary value problems, allowing the extraction of spectral information using functional methods. We find that the arising functional integrals are naturally defined on a complexified integration contour, encapsulating the demanded sectorial boundary conditions of the associated eigenvalue problem. The attained results are applied to the analysis of resonant ground-state energies, through which we identify the previously elusive one-to-one correspondence between decay rates derived from real-time quantum tunneling dynamics and those obtained via the Euclidean instanton method.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Hamiltonian formulation of a spherically symmetric spacetime that corresponds to the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole. The resulting phase space involves two independent dynamical variables along with their conjugate momenta. We quantize the associated minisuperspace using the affine quantization method, which is particularly suited for systems with positive-definite configuration variables. We then explore whether the quantum effects encoded in this wave function can lead to the avoidance of classical singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trapping of ultracold atoms using two-colour evanescent light waves formed by propagating modes of suspended optical rib waveguides is modelled in different configurations. Reducing the anisotropy of the two-colour evanescent optical dipole potential requires two laser light components with a large frequency difference. The upper frequency is guided in the two lowest transverse waveguide modes and the lower frequency propagates in a single-mode regime. This increases the dipole potential depth in the lateral direction. An additional increase in the optical dipole potential can be achieved by tuning the frequencies of the two modes to two different atomic transitions. When applied to rubidium, the total depth of the corresponding surface optical dipole traps can reach 0.3 mK or above under reasonable conditions.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a quantum typicality approach to examine systems composed of two subsystems at different temperatures. While dynamical quantum typicality is usually used to simulate high-temperature dynamics, we also investigate low-temperature dynamics using the method. To test our method, we investigate the energy current between subsystems at different temperatures in various paradigmatic spin-1/2 chains, specifically the XX chain, the critical transverse-field Ising chain, and the XXZ chain. We compare our numerics to existing analytical results and find a convincing agreement for the energy current in the steady state for all considered models and temperatures.</description>

      <title>Squeezed gravitons from superradiant axion fields around rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose, in (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, a novel astrophysical source of squeezed graviton states, due to superradiant axionic clouds surrounding rotating (Kerr-type) black holes (BH). The microscopic origin of these axions is diverse, ranging from the Kalb-Ramond (model-independent) axions and compactification axions in string theory, to \cm contorted geometries exemplified by a totally antisymmetric component of torsion in Einstein-Cartan theory. The axion fields couple to chiral gauge and gravitational Chern-Simons (CS) anomaly terms in the effective gravitational actions. In the presence of a Kerr BH background, such axions lead, upon acquiring a mass, to superradiance and the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a squeezed state. The specific microscopic origin of the axions is not important, provided they are massive. This multimode squeezed-graviton state is examined through a Takagi-like decomposition, used in quantum optics. In the effective action it is shown that squeezing effects associated with conventional general relativity (GR) dominate, by many orders of magnitude, the corresponding effects due to the CS gravitational anomaly terms. For a sufficiently long lifetime of the axionic cloud of the BH, we find that significant squeezing (quantified through the average number of gravitons with respect to the appropriate vacuum) can be produced from the GR effects. It is also demonstrated explicitly that the structure of the entangled states (when the latter are expressed in a left-right polarization basis) depends highly on whether the GR or the anomalous CS effects produce the entanglement.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Region Decoupling through Structured Absorbing Potentials: A Framework for Scalable Time-Dependent Quantum Dynamics Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate quantum mechanical treatment of molecular reactions remains a longstanding challenge, especially for reactions involving deep potential wells and long-lived intermediate complexes. Here, we introduce an interaction region decoupling (IRD) strategy that incorporates structured absorbing potentials to dynamically partition the interaction region into reactant and product subspaces. The IRD framework integrates naturally with standard TDWP propagation schemes and enables the construction of region-specific basis sets, dramatically enhancing computational efficiency. Benchmark applications to the F + HD and O + OH reactions demonstrate that this approach achieves state-resolved accuracy while reducing computational cost by over two orders of magnitude. This strategy paves the way for routine quantum mechanical treatment of complex-forming four-atom reactions previously considered intractable.</description>

      <title>Graph-based block-diagonalization of full configuration interaction Hamiltonian: H$_2$ chains study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a graph-based block-diagonalization (GBBD) method for the full configuration interaction Hamiltonian of molecular systems to efficiently calculate the exact eigenvalues of low-energy states. In this approach, the non-zero matrix elements of the Hamiltonian are represented as edges on a graph, which naturally decomposes into disconnected clusters. Each cluster corresponds to an independent block in the block-diagonalized form of the Hamiltonian. The eigenvalues in the low-energy sector were obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem for each block matrix and by solving a modified Hamiltonian subject to orthonormality constraints with respect to previously computed lower-energy eigenstates. We applied the GBBD method to linear hydrogen H chains ranging from H$_2$ to H$_{12}$. The results showed excellent agreement with exact ones, confirming both the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. Finally, we discussed several physical properties with respect to the number of H$_2$ molecules.</description>

      <title>SOME: Symmetric One-Hot Matching Elector -- A Lightweight Microsecond Decoder for Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional quantum error correction (QEC) decoders such as Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) and Union-Find (UF) offer high thresholds and fast decoding, respectively, but both suffer from high topological complexity. In contrast, Ising model-based decoders reduce topological complexity but demand considerable decoding time. We propose the Symmetric One-Hot Matching Elector (SOME), a novel decoder that reformulates the QEC decoding task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem -- termed the One-Hot QUBO (OHQ). Each variable in the QUBO represents whether a given pair of flipped syndromes is matched, while the error probabilities between the pair are encoded as interaction coefficients (weight). Constraints ensure that each flipped syndrome is matched exactly once. Valid solutions of OHQ correspond to self-inverse permutation matrices, characterized by symmetric one-hot encoding. To solve the OHQ efficiently, SOME reformulates the decoding task as the construction of permutation matrices that minimize the total weight. It initializes each candidate matrix from one of the minimum-weight syndrome pairs, then iteratively appends additional pairs in ascending order of weight, and finally selects the permutation matrix with the lowest total energy. SOME achieves up to a 99.9x reduction in variable count and reduces decoding times from milliseconds to microseconds on a single-threaded commodity CPU. OHQ also maintains performance up to a 10.5% physical error rate, surpassing the highest known threshold of MWPM@.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Suppression Due to Black Hole Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the concept of Krylov complexity to include general unitary evolutions involving multiple generators. This generalization enables us to formulate a framework for generalized Krylov complexity, which serves as a measure of the complexity of states associated with continuous symmetries within a model. Furthermore, we investigate scenarios where different directions of transformation lead to varying degrees of complexity, which can be compared to geometric approaches to understanding complexity, such as Nielsen complexity. In this context, we introduce a generalized orthogonalization algorithm and delineate its computational framework, which is structured as a network of orthogonal blocks rather than a simple linear chain. Additionally, we provide explicit evaluations of specific illustrative examples to demonstrate the practical application of this framework.</description>

      <title>Floquet Non-Bloch Formalism for a Non-Hermitian Ladder: From Theoretical Framework to Topolectrical Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems intertwined with non-Hermiticity opens a rich arena for topological phases that transcend conventional Hermitian limits. The physical significance of these phases hinges on obtaining the topological invariants that restore the bulk-boundary correspondence, a task well explored for static non-Hermitian (NH) systems, while it remains elusive for the driven scenario. Here, we address this problem by constructing a generalized Floquet non-Bloch framework that analytically captures the spectral and topological properties of time-periodic NH systems. Em- ploying a high-frequency Magnus expansion, we analytically derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian and formulate the generalized Brillouin zone for a periodically driven quasi-one-dimensional system, namely, the Creutz ladder with a staggered complex potential. Our study demonstrates that the skin effect remains robust (despite the absence of non-reciprocal hopping) across a broad range of driving parameters, and is notably amplified in the low-frequency regime due to emergent longer- range couplings. We further employ a symmetric time frame approach that generates chiral-partner Hamiltonians, whose invariants, when appropriately combined, account for the full edge-state struc- ture. To substantiate the theoretical framework, we propose a topolectrical circuit (TEC) that serves as a viable experimental setting. Apart from capturing the skin modes, the proposed TEC design faithfully reproduces the presence of distinct Floquet edge states, as revealed through the voltage and impedance profiles, respectively. Thus, our work not only offers a theoretical framework for exploring NH-driven systems, but also provides an experimentally feasible TEC architecture for realizing these phenomena stated above in a laboratory.</description>

      <title>Particle localization on helical nanoribbons: Quantum analog of the Coriolis effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the Schr\"odinger equation for a particle confined to the surface of a normal and a binormal helical nanoribbon, obtain the quantum potentials induced by their respective curved surface geometries, and study the localized states of the particle for each ribbon. When the particle momentum satisfies a certain geometric condition, the particle localizes near the inner edge for a normal ribbon, and on the central helix for a binormal ribbon. This result suggests the presence of a pseudo-force that pushes the particle transversely along the width of the ribbon. We show that this phenomenon can be interpreted as a quantum analog of the Coriolis effect, which causes a transverse deflection of a classical particle moving in a rotating frame. We invoke Ehrenfest's theorem applicable to localized states and identify the quantized angular velocities of the rotating frames for the two ribbons. If the particle is an electron, its localization at a specific width gives rise to a Hall-like voltage difference across the ribbon's width. However, unlike in the Hall effect, its origin is not an applied magnetic field, but the ribbon's curved surface geometry. When a normal helical ribbon is mechanically flipped to a binormal configuration in a periodic fashion, it results in a periodic electron transport from the inner edge to the center, giving rise to a quantum AC voltage. This can be used for designing nanoscale electromechanical devices. Quantum transport on a helical nanoribbon can be controlled by tuning the bends and twists of its surface, suggesting diverse applications in biopolymers and nanotechnology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14622v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a resource-efficient shadow-tomography scheme using equatorial-stabilizer measurements generated from subsets of Clifford unitaries. For $n$-qubit systems, equatorial-stabilizer-based shadow-tomography schemes can estimate $M$ observables (up to an additive error $\varepsilon$) using $\mathcal{O}(\log(M),\mathrm{poly}(n),1/\varepsilon^2)$ sampling copies for a large class of observables, including those with traceless parts possessing polynomially-bounded Frobenius norms. For arbitrary quantum-state observables with a constant Frobenius norm, sampling complexity becomes $n$-independent. Our scheme only requires an $n$-depth controlled-$Z$~(CZ) circuit [$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ CZ~gates] and Pauli measurements per sampling copy. Alternatively, our scheme is realizable with $2n$-depth circuits comprising $n^2$ nearest-neighboring CNOT gates, exhibiting a smaller maximal gate count relative to previously-known randomized-Clifford-based proposals. We numerically confirm our theoretically-derived shadow-tomographic sampling complexities with random pure states and multiqubit graph states. Finally, we demonstrate that equatorial-stabilizer-based shadow~tomography is more noise-tolerant than randomized-Clifford-based schemes in terms of fidelity estimation for Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger (GHZ) state and W~state.</description>

Abstract: We present numerical investigations demonstrating the result that the distribution of the lowest eigenvalue of finite many-boson systems (say we have $m$ number of bosons) with $k$-body interactions, modeled by Bosonic Embedded Gaussian Orthogonal [BEGOE($k$)] and Unitary [BEGUE($k$)] random matrix Ensembles of $k$-body interactions, exhibits a smooth transition from Gaussian like (for $k = 1$) to a modified Gumbel like (for intermediate values of $k$) to the well-known Tracy-Widom distribution (for $k = m$) form. We also provide ansatz for centroids and variances of the lowest eigenvalue distributions. In addition, we show that the distribution of normalized spacing between the lowest and the next lowest eigenvalues exhibits a transition from Wigner's surmise (for $k = 1$) to Poisson (for intermediate $k$ values with $k \le m/2$) to Wigner's surmise (starting from $k = m/2$ to $k = m$) form. We analyze these transitions as a function of $q$ parameter defining $q$-normal distribution for eigenvalue densities.</description>

      <title>A Genetic Approach to Minimising Gate and Qubit Teleportations for Multi-Processor Quantum Circuit Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) provides a means for scaling available quantum computation by interconnecting multiple quantum processor units (QPUs). A key challenge in this domain is efficiently allocating logical qubits from quantum circuits to the physical qubits within QPUs, a task known to be NP-hard. Traditional approaches, primarily focused on graph partitioning strategies, have sought to reduce the number of required Bell pairs for executing non-local CNOT operations, a form of gate teleportation. However, these methods have limitations in terms of efficiency and scalability. Addressing this, our work jointly considers gate and qubit teleportations introducing a novel meta-heuristic algorithm to minimise the network cost of executing a quantum circuit. By allowing dynamic reallocation of qubits along with gate teleportations during circuit execution, our method significantly enhances the overall efficacy and potential scalability of DQC frameworks. In our numerical analysis, we demonstrate that integrating qubit teleportations into our genetic algorithm for optimising circuit blocking reduces the required resources, specifically the number of EPR pairs, compared to traditional graph partitioning methods. Our results, derived from both benchmark and randomly generated circuits, show that as circuit complexity increases - demanding more qubit teleportations - our approach effectively optimises these teleportations throughout the execution, thereby enhancing performance through strategic circuit partitioning. This is a step forward in the pursuit of a global quantum compiler which will ultimately enable the efficient use of a 'quantum data center' in the future.</description>

      <title>Operational Interpretation of the Choi Rank Through k-State Exclusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Choi-state is an indispensable tool in the study and analysis of quantum channels. Considering a channel in terms of its associated Choi-state can greatly simplify problems. It also offers an alternative approach to the characterisation of a channel, with properties of the Choi-state providing novel insight into a channel's behaviour. The rank of a Choi-state, termed the Choi-rank, has proven to be an important characterising property, and here, its significance is further elucidated through an operational interpretation. The Choi-rank is shown to provide a universal bound on how successfully two agents, Alice and Bob, can perform an entanglement-assisted exclusion task. The task can be considered an extension of super-dense coding, where Bob can only output information about Alice's encoded bit-string with certainty. Conclusive state exclusion, in place of state discrimination, is therefore considered at the culmination of the super-dense coding protocol. In order to prove this result, a necessary condition for conclusive k-state exclusion of a set of states is presented in order to achieve this result, and the notions of weak and strong exclusion are introduced.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel authenticated Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol employing maximally entangled qubit pairs. In the absence of noise, we securely authenticate the well-known BB84 QKD scheme under two assumptions: first, adversaries cannot simultaneously access pre- shared and non-pre-shared secret classical information, and sec- ond, adversaries cannot simultaneously access pre-shared secret classical information and quantum memories held by legitimate parties. The main strength of this noiseless result is that access to all secretly pre-shared classical information is insufficient for breaching our scheme. Additionally, our protocol desirably allows for pre-shared secrecy reusage, leading to secret key growing. In order to address noise, we simulate a photonic imple- mentation of our scheme, together with a storage model that aims to replicate the performance of cavity-enhanced Atomic- Frequency Comb (AFC) memories. Two methods are used to distinguish authentic entities from forgery attempts: on the one hand, a statistical approach is used after calibration of its defining parameter {\mu}. Alternatively, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is designed and trained to learn the underlying different structure of that input data coming from adversaries in comparison to that one coming from legitimate parties. Both methods achieve a correct classification rate larger than 0.80 for memory storage time of 150 {\mu}s and a 1 km distance between parties.</description>

Abstract: A seminal task in quantum information theory is to realize a device able to produce copies of a generic input state with the highest possible output fidelity, thus realizing an \textit{optimal} quantum cloning machine. Recently, the concept of variational quantum cloning was introduced: a quantum machine learning algorithm through which, by exploiting a classical feedback loop informed by the output of a quantum processing unit, the system can self-learn the programming required for an optimal quantum cloning strategy. In this work, we experimentally implement a $1 \rightarrow 2$ variational cloning machine of dual-rail encoded photonic qubits, both for phase-covariant and state-dependent cloning. We exploit a fully programmable 6-mode universal integrated device and classical feedback to reach near-optimal cloning performances. Our results demonstrate the potential of programmable integrated photonic platforms for variational self-learning of quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transfer Learning for MNIST Classification Using a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement a hybrid quantum-classical model for image classification that compresses MNIST digit images into a low-dimensional feature space and then maps these features onto a 5-qubit quantum state. First, an autoencoder compresses each $28\times28$ image (784 pixels) into a 64-dimensional latent vector, preserving salient features of the digit with minimal reconstruction error. We further reduce the latent representation to 5 principal components using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to match the 5 available qubits. These 5 features are encoded as rotation angles in a quantum circuit with 5 qubits. The quantum feature map applies single-qubit rotations ($R_y$ gates) proportional to the feature values, followed by a Hadamard gate and a cascade of entangling CNOT gates to produce a non-product entangled state. Measuring the 5-qubit state yields a 32-dimensional probability distribution over basis outcomes, which serves as a quantum-enhanced feature vector for classification. A classical neural network with a softmax output is then trained on these 32-dimensional quantum feature vectors to predict the digit class. We evaluate the hybrid model on the MNIST dataset and compare it to a purely classical baseline that uses the 64-dimensional autoencoder latent features for classification. The results show that the hybrid model can successfully classify digits, demonstrating the feasibility of integrating quantum computing in the classification pipeline, although its accuracy (about 75\% on test data) currently falls below the classical baseline (about 98\% on the same compressed data).</description>

      <title>The detection power of real entanglement witnesses under local unitary equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The imaginary unit $i$ has recently been experimentally proven to be indispensable for quantum mechanics. We study the differences in detection power between real and complex entanglement witnesses (EWs) distinguished by whether their matrix expressions incorporate imaginary parts. We show that a real EW (REW), denoted by a real Hermitian matrix, must detect one entangled state of a real density matrix, and conversely an entangled state of a real density matrix must be detected by one REW. We present a necessary and sufficient condition for the entangled states detected by REWs, and give a specific example implying the detection limitations of REWs. From an operational perspective, we investigate whether all entangled states are detected by the EWs locally equivalent to some REWs. We prove the validity for all NPT (non-positive partial transpose) states. We also derive a necessary and sufficient condition of the validity for the PPT (positive partial transpose) entangled states of complex density matrices. By this condition we show the validity for a family of two-qutrit PPT entangled states of rank four. Another way to figure out the problem is to check whether a counterexample exists. We propose a method to examine the existence from a set-theoretic perspective, and provide some supporting evidence of non-existence. Finally, we derive some results on local projections of EWs with product projectors.</description>

      <title>Genuine quantum advantage in non-linear bosonic quantum batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding a quantum battery model that displays a genuine quantum advantage, while being prone to experimental fabrication, is an extremely challenging task. In this Letter we propose a deceptively simple quantum battery model that displays a genuine quantum advantage, saturating the quantum speed limit. It consists of two harmonic oscillators (the charger and the battery), coupled during the non-equilibrium charging dynamics by a non-linear interaction. We first present the model, then certify the genuine quantum advantage, and finally briefly discuss how the battery can be fabricated through the use of superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-induced provable and robust quantum learning advantages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds unparalleled potentials to enhance machine learning. However, a demonstration of quantum learning advantage has not been achieved so far. We make a step forward by rigorously establishing a noise-robust, unconditional quantum learning advantage in expressivity, inference speed, and training efficiency, compared to commonly-used classical models. Our proof is information-theoretic and pinpoints the origin of this advantage: entanglement can be used to reduce the communication required by non-local tasks. In particular, we design a task that can be solved with certainty by quantum models with a constant number of parameters using entanglement, whereas commonly-used classical models must scale linearly to achieve a larger-than-exponentially-small accuracy. We show that the quantum model is trainable with constant resources and robust against constant noise. Through numerical and trapped-ion experiments on IonQ Aria, we demonstrate the desired advantage. Our results provide valuable guidance for demonstrating quantum learning advantages with current noisy intermediate-scale devices.</description>

      <title>Families of $d=2$ 2D subsystem stabilizer codes for universal Hamiltonian quantum computation with two-body interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the absence of fault tolerant quantum error correction for analog, Hamiltonian quantum computation, error suppression via energy penalties is an effective alternative. We construct families of distance-$2$ stabilizer subsystem codes we call ``trapezoid codes'', that are tailored for energy-penalty schemes. We identify a family of codes achieving the maximum code rate, and by slightly relaxing this constraint, uncover a broader range of codes with enhanced physical locality, thus increasing their practical applicability. Additionally, we provide an algorithm to map the required qubit connectivity graph into graphs compatible with the locality constraints of quantum hardware. Finally, we provide a systematic framework to evaluate the performance of these codes in terms of code rate, physical locality, graph properties, and penalty gap, enabling an informed selection of error-suppression codes for specific quantum computing applications. We identify the $[[4k+2,2k,g,2]]$ family of subsystem codes as optimal in terms of code rate and penalty gap scaling.</description>

      <title>Surpassing the loss-noise robustness trade-off in quantum key distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers a theoretically secure method to share secret keys, yet practical implementations face challenges due to noise and loss over long-distance channels. Traditional QKD protocols require extensive noise compensation, hindering their industrial scalability and lowering the achievable key rates. Alternative protocols encode logical qubits in noise-resilient states, but at the cost of using many physical qubits, increasing susceptibility to loss and limiting transmission distance. In this work, we introduce a logical qubit encoding that uses antisymmetric Bell-states in the continuous photonic degrees of freedom, frequency and time. By leveraging the continuous space, we overcome this noise-loss robustness trade-off by minimising the number of photons per logical qubit, whilst optimising the encoding resilience over noise fluctuations. We analyse the security of our encoding and demonstrate its robustness compared to existing state-of-the-art protocols. This approach provides a path towards scalable, efficient QKD implementations under realistic noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Generalized Li\'enard systems and isochronous connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore some classical and quantum aspects of the nonlinear Li\'enard equation $\ddot{x} + k x \dot{x} + \omega^2 x + (k^2/9) x^3 = 0$, where $x=x(t)$ is a real variable and $k, \omega \in \mathbb{R}$. We demonstrate that such an equation could be derived from an equation of the Levinson-Smith kind which is of the form $\ddot{z} + J(z) \dot{z}^2 + F(z) \dot{z} + G(z) = 0$, where $z=z(t)$ is a real variable and $\{J(z), F(z), G(z)\}$ are suitable functions to be specified. It can further be mapped to the harmonic oscillator by making use of a nonlocal transformation, establishing its isochronicity. Computations employing the Jacobi last multiplier reveal that the system exhibits a bi-Hamiltonian character, i.e., there are two distinct types of Hamiltonians describing the system. For each of these, we perform a canonical quantization in the momentum representation and explore the possibility of bound states. While one of the Hamiltonians is seen to exhibit an equispaced spectrum with an infinite tower of states, the other one exhibits branching but can be solved exactly in closed form for certain choices of the parameters.</description>

      <title>Turning qubit noise into an advantage: Automatic state preparation and long-time dynamics for impurity models on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noise is often regarded as a limitation of quantum computers. In this work, we show that in the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) approach to strongly-correlated systems, it can actually be harnessed to our advantage. Indeed, DMFT maps a lattice model onto an impurity model, namely a finite system coupled to a dissipative bath. While standard approaches require a large number of high-quality qubits in a unitary context, we propose a circuit that harvests amplitude damping to reproduce the dynamics of this model with a blend of noisy and noiseless qubits. We find compelling advantages with this approach: a substantial reduction in the number of qubits, the ability to reach longer time dynamics, and no need for ground state search and preparation. This method would naturally fit in a partial quantum error correction framework.</description>

      <title>Isochronous oscillator with a singular position-dependent mass and its quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of the equation $\ddot{x} - (1/2x) \dot{x}^2 + 2 \omega^2 x - 1/8x = 0$, where $\omega &gt; 0$ and $x = x(t)$ is a real-valued variable. We first discuss the appearance of this equation from a position-dependent-mass scenario in which the mass profile goes inversely with $x$, admitting a singularity at $x = 0$. The associated potential is also singular at $x = 0$, splitting the real axis into two halves, i.e., $x &gt; 0$ and $x &lt; 0$. The dynamics is exactly solvable for both the branches and so for definiteness, we stick to the $x &gt; 0$ branch. Performing a canonical quantization in the position representation and upon employing the ordering strategy of the kinetic-energy operator due to von Roos, we show that the problem is isospectral to the isotonic oscillator. Thus, the quantum spectrum consists of an infinite number of equispaced levels. The spacing between the energy levels is found to be insensitive to the specific choices of the ambiguity parameters that are employed for ordering the kinetic-energy operator \`a la von Roos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-stabilizerness or quantum magic of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev ($\rm SYK$) model, a prototype example of maximally chaotic quantum matter. We show that the Majorana spectrum of its ground state, encoding the spreading of the state in the Majorana basis, displays a Gaussian distribution as expected for chaotic quantum many-body systems. We compare our results with the case of the $\rm SYK_2$ model, describing non-chaotic random free fermions, and show that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively different in the two cases, featuring an exponential Laplace distribution for the $\rm SYK_2$ model rather than a Gaussian. From the spectrum we extract the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) and show that for both models it displays a linear scaling with system size, with a prefactor that is larger for the SYK model, which has therefore higher magic. Finally, we discuss the spreading of quantun magic under unitary dynamics, as described by the evolution of the Majorana spectrum and the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy starting from a stabilizer state. We show that the SRE for the $\rm SYK_2$ model equilibrates rapidly, but that in the steady-state the interacting chaotic SYK model has more magic than the simple $\rm SYK_2$. Our results suggest that the Majorana spectrum is qualitatively distinct in chaotic and non-chaotic many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is of paramount importance for the understanding of both strange metals and a microscopic theory of two-dimensional gravity. We study the interplay between Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE) and entanglement entropy in both the ground state and highly excited states of the SYK4+SYK2 model interpolating the highly chaotic four-body interactions model with the integrable two-body interactions one. The interplay between these quantities is assessed also through universal statistics of the entanglement spectrum and its anti-flatness. We find that SYK4 is indeed characterized by a complex pattern of both entanglement and non-stabilizer resources while SYK2 is non-universal and not complex. We discuss the fragility and robustness of these features depending on the interpolation parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ordered search is the task of finding an item in an ordered list using comparison queries. The best exact classical algorithm for this fundamental problem uses $\lceil \log_{2}{n}\rceil$ queries for a list of length $n$. Quantum computers can achieve a constant-factor speedup, but the best possible coefficient of $\log_{2}{n}$ for exact quantum algorithms is only known to lie between $(\ln{2})/\pi \approx 0.221$ and $4/\log_{2}{605} \approx 0.433$. We consider a special class of translation-invariant algorithms with no workspace, introduced by Farhi, Goldstone, Gutmann, and Sipser, that has been used to find the best known upper bounds. First, we show that any bounded-error, $k$-query quantum algorithm for ordered search can be implemented by a $k$-query algorithm in this special class. Second, we use linear programming to show that the best exact $5$-query quantum algorithm can search a list of length $7265$, giving an ordered search algorithm that asymptotically uses $5 \log_{7265}{n} \approx 0.390 \log_{2}{n}$ quantum queries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD), which eliminates all the attacks from the eavesdropper to the measurement party, has been one of the most promising technology for the implementation of end-to-end quantum networks. In practice, the asymmetry of both sources and channels is generally inevitable. Therefore, we propose a theory to analyze the performance when any two MDI users in networks communicates using asymmetric sources in distinct single or multiple temporal modes. As a specific application, we model to obtain the key rate of MDI-QKD with weak coherent pulse source and spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, and compare the performance to the cases with symmetric (i.e. identical) sources. The result demonstrates that the actual performance does not degrade due to the asymmetry of sources. In contrary, it maintains at a good level over the entire distance we study. This work provides a theoretical basis for analyzing and optimizing MDI-QKD networks with asymmetric sources, and thus paving the way for the practical deployment of completely asymmetric MDI-QKD networks.</description>

      <title>On spontaneous irreversibility and objective thermalization in stochastic modifications of quantum theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deterministic and time-reversal symmetric dynamics of isolated quantum systems is at odds with irreversible equilibration observed in generic thermodynamic systems. Standard approaches at a reconciliation employ subjective restrictions on the space of observables or states and do not explain how a single macroscopic quantum system achieves equilibrium dynamically. We instead argue that quantum theory is an effective theory and requires corrections to accurately describe systems approaching the thermodynamic limit. We construct a stochastic extension of quantum theory which is practically identical to quantum mechanics for microscopic systems, yet allows single, isolated macroscopic systems to objectively thermalize, generically. A fluctuation-dissipation relation guarantees physical consistency including norm preservation, energy conservation, no superluminal signalling and the emergence of microcanonical equilibrium. We further discuss the inclusion of objective collapse, thereby realizing a falsifiable theory of spontaneous universal irreversibility which describes the quantum-to-classical crossover dynamics of macroscopic quantum systems. This model admits spontaneous symmetry breaking, quantum state reduction and objective quantum thermalization for individual systems while realizing an emergent hybrid, Born-Maxwell-Boltzmann-Gibbs-microcanonical distribution for ensembles.</description>

      <title>Superradiance in dense atomic samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we present an approach to the problem of superradiance in dense atomic samples, when dipolar interactions arise between atoms. Our treatment consists of the sequential use of the Holstein-Primakoff and mean-field approximations, from which we derive master equations for the strong and weak couplings of the sample with the reservoir. We find, in both cases, that the radiation emission presents remarkable features, with characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance. In particular, for strong sample-reservoir coupling, a whole comb of superpulses occurs within an envelope with the above-mentioned characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Microwave Whispering Gallery Mode Spectroscopy of Paramagnetic Impurities in High-Purity Crystalline LiF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A low-noise cryogenic microwave spectroscopy experiment was performed on a high-purity lithium fluoride (LiF) crystal. The spectroscopy data revealed avoided level crossing interactions in whispering gallery modes, indicative of electron spin resonance (ESR) coupling with paramagnetic impurities. Analysis of the interaction spectra identified distinct spin systems corresponding to $(S = 3/2, I = 7/2)$, $(S = 1, I = 7/2)$, and $(S = 3/2, I = 0)$. The number of hyperfine splittings observed, together with the natural abundance of ions possessing the appropriate nuclear spin values, suggest that V$^{2+}$ and V$^{3+}$ impurities, exhibiting orthorhombic distortion, are the most likely sources of the narrow interaction features. This interpretation is supported by earlier ESR studies and established manufacturing records for LiF crystal growth. Additionally, a separate set of broader interaction points is consistent with an orthorhombic model involving a $(S = 3/2, I = 0)$ spin system, although the specific impurity responsible for this interaction remains unidentified.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of photonic spin Hall effect in the Rydberg atomic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study demonstrating enhanced tunability of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) using a strongly interacting Rydberg atomic medium under electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions. In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on static refractiveindex profiles or metamaterials, here the PSHE is controlled via a nonlocal third-order nonlinear susceptibility arising from long range Rydberg-Rydberg interactions. We show that this nonlocal nonlinearity enables dynamic modulation of spin-dependent light trajectories, amplifying the normally weak PSHE into a readily observable and adjustable effect. These results pave the way for new capabilities in photonic information processing and sensing. In particular, an adjustable PSHE may enable beam steering based on photon spin, improve the sensitivity of precision measurements, and support photonic devices whose functionality can be reconfigured in real time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With a measure of dimensionally restricted nonlocality in the bipartite Bell scenario with two inputs and two outputs, a different decomposition of any nonsignaling box that is a convex mixture of a single Popescu-Rohrlich box and a Bell-local box, with the measure being zero, is introduced. It is shown that any nonsignaling box shared by Alice and Bob that has dimensionally restricted nonlocality contains secret correlations against any third party, Eve, who is also dimensionally restricted. In this context, for the specific Bell scenario considered, it is demonstrated that the Popescu-Rohrlich box fraction can be used as a resource for secure quantum key distribution even if entanglement is not certified.</description>

      <title>On the commutator scaling in Hamiltonian simulation with multi-product formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multi-product formula (MPF) is a promising approach for Hamiltonian simulation efficiently both in the system size $N$ and the inverse allowable error $1/\varepsilon$ by combining Trotterization and the linear combination of unitaries (LCU). It achieves poly-logarithmic cost in $1/\varepsilon$ like LCU [G. H. Low, V. Kliuchnikov, N. Wiebe, arXiv:1907.11679 (2019)]. The efficiency in $N$ is expected to come from the commutator scaling in Trotterization, and this appears to be confirmed by the error bound of MPF expressed by nested commutators [J. Aftab, D. An, K. Trivisa, arXiv:2403.08922 (2024)]. However, we point out that the efficiency of MPF in the system size $N$ is not exactly resolved yet in that the present error bound expressed by nested commutators is incompatible with the size-efficient complexity reflecting the commutator scaling. The problem is that $q$-fold nested commutators with arbitrarily large $q$ are involved in their requirement and error bound. The benefit of commutator scaling by locality is absent, and the cost efficient in $N$ becomes prohibited in general. In this paper, we show an alternative commutator-scaling error of MPF and derive its size-efficient cost properly inheriting the advantage in Trotterization. The requirement and the error bound in our analysis, derived by techniques from the Floquet-Magnus expansion, have a certain truncation order in the nested commutators and can fully exploit the locality. We prove that Hamiltonian simulation by MPF certainly achieves the cost whose system-size dependence is as large as Trotterization while keeping the $\mathrm{polylog}(1/\varepsilon)$-scaling like the LCU. Our results will provide improved or accurate error and cost also for various algorithms using interpolation or extrapolation of Trotterization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the unitary variational quantum-neural hybrid eigensolver (U-VQNHE), which improves upon the original VQNHE by enforcing unitary neural transformations. The non-unitary nature of VQNHE causes normalization issues and divergence of the loss function during training, leading to exponential scaling of measurement overhead with qubit number. U-VQNHE resolves these issues, significantly reduces required measurements, and retains improved accuracy and stability over standard variational quantum eigensolvers.</description>

      <title>Analysis of RF Surface Loss in a Planar 2D Qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Josephson junction and shunt capacitor form a transmon qubit, which is the cornerstone of modern quantum computing platforms. For reliable quantum computing, it is important how long a qubit can remain in a superposition of quantum states, which is determined by the coherence time (T1). The coherence time of a qubit effectively sets the "lifetime" of usable quantum information, determining how long quantum computations can be performed before errors occur and information is lost. There are several sources of decoherence in transmon qubits, but the predominant one is generally considered to be dielectric losses in the natural oxide layer formed on the surface of the superconductor. In this paper, we present a numerical study of microwave surface losses in planar superconducting antennas of different transmon qubit designs. An asymptotic method for estimating the energy participation ratio in ultrathin films of nanometer scales is proposed, and estimates are given for the limits of achievable minimum RF losses depending on the electrical properties of the surface oxide and the interface of the qubit with the substrate material.</description>

      <title>Polarized Houston State Framework for Nonequilibrium Driven Open Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework -- the polarized Houston basis -- to model nonequilibrium dynamics in driven open quantum systems, formulated for use within the quantum master equation. This basis extends conventional Houston states by incorporating field-induced polarization effects, enabling a more accurate description of excitation dynamics under external driving. Using a one-dimensional dimer-chain model, we examine band population dynamics through projections onto polarized Houston states, original Houston states, and naive Bloch states. We find that the polarized Houston basis significantly suppresses spurious Bloch-state excitations and virtual transitions present in standard Houston approaches, allowing for a cleaner extraction of real excitations. When implemented in the relaxation time approximation of the quantum master equation, this formalism also yields a substantial reduction of unphysical DC currents in insulating systems. Our results highlight the polarized Houston basis as a powerful tool for simulating nonequilibrium phenomena in light-driven open quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is demonstrated that identifying information-theoretic limitations of quantum Bell nonlocality alone cannot completely distinguish quantum theory from generalized nonsignaling theories. To this end, an information-theoretic concept of certifying nonobjective information by the Popescu-Rohrlich box fraction is employed. Furthermore, in the aforementioned demonstration, a partial answer to the question of what distinguishes quantum theory from generalized nonsignaling theories emerges beyond the one provided by the principle of information causality alone. This is accomplished by demonstrating that postquantum models identified by the information causality are isolated by the emergence of the Popescu-Rohrlich box fraction of nonobjective information in Bell-local boxes of a generalized nonsignaling theory, over the other generalized nonsignaling theories.</description>

      <title>Dissipation in the Broadband and Ultrastrong Coupling Regimes of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics: An Ab Initio Quantized Quasinormal Mode Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phenomenological approaches to photon loss have long been the workhorse of cavity-QED, but prove inadequate in the presence of sufficiently broadband light-matter interactions. We present a rigorous and ab initio derivation of a quantum master equation for a quantized optical cavity mode coupled to a dipole, using a quasinormal mode (QNM) quantization procedure for plasmonic and dielectric open-system cavity-QED, which is valid in broadband light-matter interaction regimes, including ultrastrong coupling (USC). The theory supports general three-dimensional resonators with arbitrary dispersion and loss, and thus can be applied to a wide range of open cavities. Our ab initio and gauge-invariant approach fully recovers the recent result of Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 123601 (2025) for the spectral density of a quantized cavity with a single dipole, exhibits a dissipative classical-quantum correspondence for bosonic Hopfield model systems, and reveals important departures from previous heuristic assumptions about system-bath coupling. We identify a new criterion for what we term the "broadband" dissipative regime of cavity-QED, where phenomenological models require corrections in accordance with the intrinsic and spatially-dependent complex phase of the QNM, and also shed light on fundamental limits to single-mode models in extreme coupling regimes. Using plasmonic and dielectric cavity examples, we show validity ranges of our QNM master equation and spectral USC calculations, and discuss prospects for near-term experimental observation of broadband dissipative effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scaling of local quantum entropies is of utmost interest for characterizing quantum fields, many-body systems, and gravity. Despite their importance, theoretically and experimentally accessing quantum entropies is challenging as they are nonlinear functionals of the underlying quantum state. Here, we show that suitably chosen classical entropies capture many features of their quantum analogs for an experimentally relevant setting. We describe the post-quench dynamics of a multi-well spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate from an initial product state via measurement distributions of spin observables and estimate the corresponding entropies using the asymptotically unbiased $k$-nearest neighbor method. We observe the dynamical build-up of quantum correlations signaled by an area law, as well as local thermalization revealed by a transition to a volume law, both in regimes characterized by non-Gaussian distributions. We emphasize that all relevant features can be observed at small sample numbers without reconstructing the underlying state or measurement distributions, rendering our method directly applicable to a large variety of models and experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative signatures of fractons in the twisted multiflavor Schwinger Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge-field configurations with nontrivial topology have profound consequences for the physics of Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. Over time, arguments have been gathering for the existence of gauge-field configurations with fractional topological charge, called fractons. Ground-state properties of gauge theories can drastically change in presence of fractons in the path integral. However, understanding the origin of such fractons is usually restricted to semiclassical argumentation. Here, we show that fractons persist in strongly correlated many-body systems, using the multiflavor Schwinger model of quantum electrodynamics as a paradigm example. Through detailed numerical tensor-network analysis, we find strong fracton signatures even in highly discretized lattice models, at sizes that are implementable on already existing quantum-simulation devices. Our work sheds light on how the nontrivial topology of gauge theories persists in challenging nonperturbative regimes, and it shows a path forward to probing it in tabletop experiments.</description>

      <title>Full counting statistics after quantum quenches as hydrodynamic fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The statistics of fluctuations on large regions of space encodes universal properties of many-body systems. At equilibrium, it is described by thermodynamics. However, away from equilibrium such as after quantum quenches, the fundamental principles are more nebulous. In particular, although exact results have been conjectured in integrable models, a correct understanding of the physics is largely missing. In this letter, we explain these principles, taking the example of the number of particles lying on a large interval in one-dimensional interacting systems. These are based on simple hydrodynamic arguments from the theory of ballistically transported fluctuations, and in particular the Euler-scale transport of long-range correlations. Using these principles, we obtain the full counting statistics (FCS) in terms of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities, whose validity depends on the structure of hydrodynamic modes and on the fluctuations in the initial state. In fermionic-statistics interacting integrable models with a continuum of hydrodynamic modes, such as the Lieb-Liniger model for cold atomic gases, the formula reproduces previous conjectures, but is in fact not exact: it gives the correct cumulants up to, including, order 5, while long-range correlations modify higher cumulants. In integrable and non-integrable models with two or less hydrodynamic modes, the formula is expected to give all cumulants.</description>

      <title>Dominant end-tunneling effect in two distinct Luttinger liquids coexisting in one quantum wire</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Luttinger liquids occupy a special place in physics as the most understood case of essentially quantum many-body systems. The experimental mission of measuring its main prediction, power laws in observable quantities, has already produced a body of exponents in different semiconductor and metallic structures. Here, we combine tunneling spectroscopy with density-dependent transport measurements in the same quantum wires over more than two orders of magnitude in temperature to very low electron temperatures down to $\sim$40 mK. This reveals that, when the second 1D subband becomes populated, the temperature dependence splits into two ranges with different exponents in the power-law dependence of the conductance, both dominated by the finite-size effect of the end-tunneling process. This result demonstrates the importance of measuring the Luttinger parameters as well as the number of modes independently through spectroscopy in addition to the transport exponent in the characterization of Luttinger liquids. This opens a new pathway to unambiguous interpretation of the exponents observed in quantum wires.</description>

      <title>Two Channel Kondo behavior in the quantum XX chain with a boundary defect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a boundary defect in the single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum $XX$ chain exhibits two-channel Kondo physics. Due to the presence of the defect, the edge spin fractionalizes into two Majorana fermions, out of which one decouples, and one is overscreened by the free fermion in bulk, leading to non-trivial boundary behavior characteristic of the two-channel Kondo model. When the ratio of boundary to bulk coupling exceeds a critical value of $\sqrt{2}$, a massive boundary-bound mode is exponentially localized near the impurity site for strong impurity coupling. This leads to unusual behavior in physical quantities, such as the $g$-function not being monotonic. We compute the $g-$function of the impurity from both thermodynamic and entanglement entropy calculations and show that it takes a non-integer value of $\sqrt{2}$ just as in the two-channel Kondo problem.</description>

      <title>Lindblad dynamics in holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop, in the AdS/CFT correspondence, a method to compute correlation functions when the CFT is governed by the Lindblad equation for open quantum systems, via the AdS theory. Using a simple example in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, we demonstrate that the predictions of the AdS theory based on our method match the direct computations in the dual CFT. We also briefly discuss the relaxation problem and the holographic entropy in this example.</description>

      <title>A critical appraisal of tests of locality and of entanglement versus non-entanglement at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been argued more than 30 years ago that it is not possible to test locality at colliders, due to the inability to directly measure non-commutating observables such as spin components in current collider experiments. Recently, there has been a lot of phenomenological and experimental activity around testing locality via Bell-type experiments or entanglement versus non-entanglement in a collider environment. These results seem to evade the earlier no-go theorem by indirectly measuring spin correlations via their relation to angular correlations between momenta. We perform a careful study of the feasibility of such an approach. We scrutinize the relationship between spin and angular correlations in both quantum mechanics and local hidden variable theories. Our conclusion is that it is currently not possible to perform a logically coherent set of experimental measurements at colliders that would allow one to test locality or entanglement versus non-entanglement. This reaffirms the earlier no-go theorem. We stress that the no-go theorem does not apply to measurements of observables inspired from entanglement and Quantum Information Theory to test the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Advancing Quantum State Preparation Using Decision Diagram with Local Invertible Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation (QSP) is a fundamental task in quantum computing and quantum information processing. It is critical to the execution of many quantum algorithms, including those in quantum machine learning. In this paper, we propose a family of efficient QSP algorithms tailored to different numbers of available ancilla qubits - ranging from no ancilla qubits, to a single ancilla qubit, to a sufficiently large number of ancilla qubits. Our approach exploits the power of Local Invertible Map Tensor Decision Diagrams (LimTDDs) - a highly compact representation of quantum states that combines tensor networks and decision diagrams to reduce quantum circuit complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform existing approaches and exhibit better scalability for large-scale quantum states, both in terms of runtime and gate complexity. Furthermore, our method shows exponential improvement in best-case scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multi-Gap superconductivity in HgS under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mercury chalcogenides is a class of materials that exhibit diverse structural phases under pressure, hosting exotic physical properties, including topological phases and chiral phonons. In particular, recent experimental results on HgS reports a new superconducting phase at 21 GPa, whose origin is unknown. In this letter we theoretically investigate the pressure-induced structural phase transition in HgS and the emergence of superconductivity in the rock salt phase. Remarkably, we discover that the rock salt phase hosts a two-gap superconducting phase originating from distinct Fermi surfaces. The unusually high critical temperature of 11 K emerges naturally within this multiband scenario, highlighting the role of interband coupling beyond isotropic approximation. These results place HgS among the few systems where multiband superconductivity is observed.</description>
