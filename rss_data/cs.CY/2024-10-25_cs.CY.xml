      <title>Gamification of virtual museum curation: a case study of Chinese bronze wares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Museums, which are among the most popular science institutions outside schools, are usually used to display and introduce historical culture and cultural relics to tourists. Text and audio explanations are used by traditional museums to popularize historical knowledge and science for tourists, and general interactive systems are based on desktops. This learning method is relatively boring in terms of experience. As a result, tourists have no desire or interest in actively exploring and learning about bronze ware, so they only have a basic understanding about bronze ware. Since most tourists are familiar with games, they are more likely to be attracted by game content and will actively explore and interact with it. In addition, a certain degree of reality is created by virtual reality technology and an immersive experience through head-mounted devices is provided to users. In this paper, we take Chinese bronzes as the research objects. We first use laser scanners to obtain bronze models ; then, we build a virtual museum environment, and we finally design a virtual reality curation game based on this bronze digital museum. This game offers visitors an immersive museum roaming and bronze ware interactive experience. Through a combination of text, video learning, and games, visitors' curiosity and desire to explore bronze ware are stimulated, and their understanding and ability to remember bronze ware knowledge can be deepened. In terms of cultural heritage, this game is also conducive to the spread of traditional Chinese bronze culture throughout the world.</description>

      <title>Empowering Cognitive Digital Twins with Generative Foundation Models: Developing a Low-Carbon Integrated Freight Transportation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective monitoring of freight transportation is essential for advancing sustainable, low-carbon economies. Traditional methods relying on single-modal data and discrete simulations fall short in optimizing intermodal systems holistically. These systems involve interconnected processes that affect shipping time, costs, emissions, and socio-economic factors. Developing digital twins for real-time awareness, predictive analytics, and urban logistics optimization requires extensive efforts in knowledge discovery, data integration, and multi-domain simulation. Recent advancements in generative AI offer new opportunities to streamline digital twin development by automating knowledge discovery and data integration, generating innovative simulation and optimization solutions. These models extend digital twins' capabilities by promoting autonomous workflows for data engineering, analytics, and software development. This paper proposes an innovative paradigm that leverages generative AI to enhance digital twins for urban research and operations. Using freight decarbonization as a case study, we propose a conceptual framework employing transformer-based language models to enhance an urban digital twin through foundation models. We share preliminary results and our vision for more intelligent, autonomous, and general-purpose digital twins for optimizing integrated freight systems from multimodal to synchromodal paradigms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in AI safety. However, as this field thrives, a critical question emerges: Are our current efforts aligned with the broader perspective of history and human civilization? This paper presents a blueprint for an advanced human society and leverages this vision to guide contemporary AI safety efforts. We outline a future where the Internet of Everything becomes reality, and create a roadmap that represents significant technological advancements towards this envisioned future. For each stage of advancement, we forecast potential AI safety issues that humanity may face. By projecting current efforts against this blueprint, we examine the alignment between the present motivations and long-term needs. We identify gaps in current approaches and highlight unique challenges and missions that demand increasing attention from AI safety practitioners in the 2020s, addressing critical areas that must not be overlooked in shaping a safe and responsible future for AI development. This vision paper aims to offer a broader perspective on AI safety, emphasizing that our efforts should not only address immediate concerns but also anticipate potential risks in the expanding AI landscape, thereby fostering AI's role in promoting a more secure and sustainable future for human civilization.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Ideation and the performance of Innovation Teams (Preprint)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) on the dynam-ics and performance of innovation teams during the idea generation phase of the innovation process. Utilizing a custom AI-augmented ideation tool, the study applies the Knowledge Spill-over Theory of Entrepreneurship to understand the effects of AI on knowledge spillover, gen-eration and application. Through a framed field experiment with participants divided into exper-imental and control groups, findings indicate that AI-augmented teams generated higher quali-ty ideas in less time. GenAI application led to improved efficiency, knowledge exchange, in-creased satisfaction and engagement as well as enhanced idea diversity. These results high-light the transformative role of the field of AI within the innovation management domain and shows that GenAI has a positive impact on important elements of the Knowledge Spillover Theory of Entrepeneurship, emphasizing its potential impact on innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth. Future research should further explore the dynamic interaction be-tween GenAI and creative processes.</description>

      <title>Data Publishing in Mechanics and Dynamics: Challenges, Guidelines, and Examples from Engineering Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-based methods have gained increasing importance in engineering, especially but not only driven by successes with deep artificial neural networks. Success stories are prevalent, e.g., in areas such as data-driven modeling, control and automation, as well as surrogate modeling for accelerated simulation. Beyond engineering, generative and large-language models are increasingly performing and helping with tasks that, previously, were solely associated with creative human processes. Thus, it seems timely to seek artificial-intelligence-support for engineering design tasks to automate, help with, or accelerate purpose-built designs of engineering systems, e.g., in mechanics and dynamics, where design so far requires a lot of specialized knowledge. However, research-wise, compared to established, predominantly first-principles-based methods, the datasets used for training, validation, and test become an almost inherent part of the overall methodology. Thus, data publishing becomes just as important in (data-driven) engineering science as appropriate descriptions of conventional methodology in publications in the past. This article analyzes the value and challenges of data publishing in mechanics and dynamics, in particular regarding engineering design tasks, showing that the latter raise also challenges and considerations not typical in fields where data-driven methods have been booming originally. Possible ways to deal with these challenges are discussed and a set of examples from across different design problems shows how data publishing can be put into practice. The analysis, discussions, and examples are based on the research experience made in a priority program of the German research foundation focusing on research on artificially intelligent design assistants in mechanics and dynamics.</description>

      <title>An LLM Agent for Automatic Geospatial Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being used in data science code generation tasks, but they often struggle with complex sequential tasks, leading to logical errors. Their application to geospatial data processing is particularly challenging due to difficulties in incorporating complex data structures and spatial constraints, effectively utilizing diverse function calls, and the tendency to hallucinate less-used geospatial libraries. To tackle these problems, we introduce GeoAgent, a new interactive framework designed to help LLMs handle geospatial data processing more effectively. GeoAgent pioneers the integration of a code interpreter, static analysis, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques within a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, offering a novel approach to geospatial data processing. In addition, we contribute a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the LLM-based approach in geospatial tasks. This benchmark leverages a variety of Python libraries and includes both single-turn and multi-turn tasks such as data acquisition, data analysis, and visualization. By offering a comprehensive evaluation among diverse geospatial contexts, this benchmark sets a new standard for developing LLM-based approaches in geospatial data analysis tasks. Our findings suggest that relying solely on knowledge of LLM is insufficient for accurate geospatial task programming, which requires coherent multi-step processes and multiple function calls. Compared to the baseline LLMs, the proposed GeoAgent has demonstrated superior performance, yielding notable improvements in function calls and task completion. In addition, these results offer valuable insights for the future development of LLM agents in automatic geospatial data analysis task programming.</description>

      <title>Characterising Open Source Co-opetition in Company-hosted Open Source Software Projects: The Cases of PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Companies, including market rivals, have long collaborated on the development of open source software (OSS), resulting in a tangle of co-operation and competition known as "open source co-opetition". While prior work investigates open source co-opetition in OSS projects that are hosted by vendor-neutral foundations, we have a limited understanding thereof in OSS projects that are hosted and governed by one company. Given their prevalence, it is timely to investigate open source co-opetition in such contexts. Towards this end, we conduct a mixed-methods analysis of three company-hosted OSS projects in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry: Meta's PyTorch (prior to its donation to the Linux Foundation), Google's TensorFlow, and Hugging Face's Transformers. We contribute three key findings. First, while the projects exhibit similar code authorship patterns between host and external companies (80%/20% of commits), collaborations are structured differently (e.g., decentralised vs. hub-and-spoke networks). Second, host and external companies engage in strategic, non-strategic, and contractual collaborations, with varying incentives and collaboration practices. Some of the observed collaborations are specific to the AI industry (e.g., hardware-software optimizations or AI model integrations), while others are typical of the broader software industry (e.g., bug fixing or task outsourcing). Third, single-vendor governance creates a power imbalance that influences open source co-opetition practices and possibilities, from the host company's singular decision-making power (e.g., the risk of license change) to their community involvement strategy (e.g., from over-control to over-delegation). We conclude with recommendations for future research.</description>

      <title>Countering Autonomous Cyber Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the capability to write convincing and fluent natural language and generate code, Foundation Models present dual-use concerns broadly and within the cyber domain specifically. Generative AI has already begun to impact cyberspace through a broad illicit marketplace for assisting malware development and social engineering attacks through hundreds of malicious-AI-as-a-services tools. More alarming is that recent research has shown the potential for these advanced models to inform or independently execute offensive cyberspace operations. However, these previous investigations primarily focused on the threats posed by proprietary models due to the until recent lack of strong open-weight model and additionally leave the impacts of network defenses or potential countermeasures unexplored. Critically, understanding the aptitude of downloadable models to function as offensive cyber agents is vital given that they are far more difficult to govern and prevent their misuse. As such, this work evaluates several state-of-the-art FMs on their ability to compromise machines in an isolated network and investigates defensive mechanisms to defeat such AI-powered attacks. Using target machines from a commercial provider, the most recently released downloadable models are found to be on par with a leading proprietary model at conducting simple cyber attacks with common hacking tools against known vulnerabilities. To mitigate such LLM-powered threats, defensive prompt injection (DPI) payloads for disrupting the malicious cyber agent's workflow are demonstrated to be effective. From these results, the implications for AI safety and governance with respect to cybersecurity is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Identifying Factors Contributing to Bad Days for Software Developers: A Mixed Methods Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software development is a dynamic activity that requires engineers to work effectively with tools, processes, and collaborative teams. As a result, the presence of friction can significantly hinder productivity, increase frustration, and contribute to low morale among developers. By contrast, higher satisfaction levels are positively correlated with higher levels of perceived productivity. Hence, understanding the factors that cause bad experiences for developers is critical for fostering a positive and productive engineering environment. In this research, we employed a mixed-method approach, including interviews, surveys, diary studies, and analysis of developer telemetry data to uncover and triangulate common factors that cause "bad days" for developers. The interviews involved 22 developers across different levels and roles. The survey captured the perception of 214 developers about factors that cause them to have "bad days," their frequency, and their impact on job satisfaction. The daily diary study engaged 79 developers for 30 days to document factors that caused "bad days" in the moment. We examined the telemetry signals of 131 consenting participants to validate the impact of bad developer experience using system data. Findings from our research revealed factors that cause "bad days" for developers and significantly impact their work and well-being. We discuss the implications of these findings and suggest future work.</description>

      <title>From Imitation to Introspection: Probing Self-Consciousness in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-consciousness, the introspection of one's existence and thoughts, represents a high-level cognitive process. As language models advance at an unprecedented pace, a critical question arises: Are these models becoming self-conscious? Drawing upon insights from psychological and neural science, this work presents a practical definition of self-consciousness for language models and refines ten core concepts. Our work pioneers an investigation into self-consciousness in language models by, for the first time, leveraging causal structural games to establish the functional definitions of the ten core concepts. Based on our definitions, we conduct a comprehensive four-stage experiment: quantification (evaluation of ten leading models), representation (visualization of self-consciousness within the models), manipulation (modification of the models' representation), and acquisition (fine-tuning the models on core concepts). Our findings indicate that although models are in the early stages of developing self-consciousness, there is a discernible representation of certain concepts within their internal mechanisms. However, these representations of self-consciousness are hard to manipulate positively at the current stage, yet they can be acquired through targeted fine-tuning. Our datasets and code are at https://github.com/OpenCausaLab/SelfConsciousness.</description>

      <title>Expanding AI Awareness Through Everyday Interactions with AI: A Reflective Journal Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the application of AI continues to expand, students in technology programs are poised to be both producers and users of the technologies. They are also positioned to engage with AI applications within and outside the classroom. While focusing on the curriculum when examining students' AI knowledge is common, extending this connection to students' everyday interactions with AI provides a more complete picture of their learning. In this paper, we explore student's awareness and engagement with AI in the context of school and their daily lives. Over six weeks, 22 undergraduate students participated in a reflective journal study and submitted a weekly journal entry about their interactions with AI. The participants were recruited from a technology and society course that focuses on the implications of technology on people, communities, and processes. In their weekly journal entries, participants reflected on interactions with AI on campus (coursework, advertises campus events, or seminars) and beyond (social media, news, or conversations with friends and family). The journal prompts were designed to help them think through what they had read, watched, or been told and reflect on the development of their own perspectives, knowledge, and literacy on the topic. Overall, students described nine categories of interactions: coursework, news and current events, using software and applications, university events, social media related to their work, personal discussions with friends and family, interacting with content, and gaming. Students reported that completing the diaries allowed them time for reflection and made them more aware of the presence of AI in their daily lives and of its potential benefits and drawbacks. This research contributes to the ongoing work on AI awareness and literacy by bringing in perspectives from beyond a formal educational context.</description>

      <title>PRISM: A Methodology for Auditing Biases in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auditing Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover their biases and preferences is an emerging challenge in creating Responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI). While various methods have been proposed to elicit the preferences of such models, countermeasures have been taken by LLM trainers, such that LLMs hide, obfuscate or point blank refuse to disclosure their positions on certain subjects. This paper presents PRISM, a flexible, inquiry-based methodology for auditing LLMs - that seeks to illicit such positions indirectly through task-based inquiry prompting rather than direct inquiry of said preferences. To demonstrate the utility of the methodology, we applied PRISM on the Political Compass Test, where we assessed the political leanings of twenty-one LLMs from seven providers. We show LLMs, by default, espouse positions that are economically left and socially liberal (consistent with prior work). We also show the space of positions that these models are willing to espouse - where some models are more constrained and less compliant than others - while others are more neutral and objective. In sum, PRISM can more reliably probe and audit LLMs to understand their preferences, biases and constraints.</description>

      <title>CAMEL-Bench: A Comprehensive Arabic LMM Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18976</link>

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a significant interest in developing large multimodal models (LMMs) capable of performing various visual reasoning and understanding tasks. This has led to the introduction of multiple LMM benchmarks to evaluate LMMs on different tasks. However, most existing LMM evaluation benchmarks are predominantly English-centric. In this work, we develop a comprehensive LMM evaluation benchmark for the Arabic language to represent a large population of over 400 million speakers. The proposed benchmark, named CAMEL-Bench, comprises eight diverse domains and 38 sub-domains including, multi-image understanding, complex visual perception, handwritten document understanding, video understanding, medical imaging, plant diseases, and remote sensing-based land use understanding to evaluate broad scenario generalizability. Our CAMEL-Bench comprises around 29,036 questions that are filtered from a larger pool of samples, where the quality is manually verified by native speakers to ensure reliable model assessment. We conduct evaluations of both closed-source, including GPT-4 series, and open-source LMMs. Our analysis reveals the need for substantial improvement, especially among the best open-source models, with even the closed-source GPT-4o achieving an overall score of 62%. Our benchmark and evaluation scripts are open-sourced.</description>

      <title>System 2 thinking in OpenAI's o1-preview model: Near-perfect performance on a mathematics exam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07114</link>

Abstract: The processes underlying human cognition are often divided into System 1, which involves fast, intuitive thinking, and System 2, which involves slow, deliberate reasoning. Previously, large language models were criticized for lacking the deeper, more analytical capabilities of System 2. In September 2024, OpenAI introduced the o1 model series, designed to handle System 2-like reasoning. While OpenAI's benchmarks are promising, independent validation is still needed. In this study, we tested the o1-preview model twice on the Dutch 'Mathematics B' final exam. It scored a near-perfect 76 and 74 out of 76 points. For context, only 24 out of 16,414 students in the Netherlands achieved a perfect score. By comparison, the GPT-4o model scored 66 and 62 out of 76, well above the Dutch students' average of 40.63 points. Neither model had access to the exam figures. Since there was a risk of model contami-nation (i.e., the knowledge cutoff for o1-preview and GPT-4o was after the exam was published online), we repeated the procedure with a new Mathematics B exam that was published after the cutoff date. The results again indicated that o1-preview performed strongly (97.8th percentile), which suggests that contamination was not a factor. We also show that there is some variability in the output of o1-preview, which means that sometimes there is 'luck' (the answer is correct) or 'bad luck' (the output has diverged into something that is incorrect). We demonstrate that the self-consistency approach, where repeated prompts are given and the most common answer is selected, is a useful strategy for identifying the correct answer. It is concluded that while OpenAI's new model series holds great potential, certain risks must be considered.</description>

      <title>Improving Adversarial Robust Fairness via Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) has been widely proved to be an effective method to improve the adversarial robustness against adversarial examples for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). As a variant of AT, Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has demonstrated its superior performance in improving the robustness of small student models with the guidance of large teacher models. However, both AT and ARD encounter the robust fairness problem: these models exhibit strong robustness when facing part of classes (easy class), but weak robustness when facing others (hard class). In this paper, we give an in-depth analysis of the potential factors and argue that the smoothness degree of samples' soft labels for different classes (i.e., hard class or easy class) will affect the robust fairness of DNNs from both empirical observation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above finding, we propose an Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) method to mitigate the adversarial robust fairness problem within the framework of Knowledge Distillation (KD). Specifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between different classes to achieve fairness by adjusting the class-wise smoothness degree of samples' soft labels during the training process, and the smoothness degree of soft labels is controlled by assigning different temperatures in KD to different classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art AT, ARD, and robust fairness methods in the comprehensive metric (Normalized Standard Deviation) of robustness and fairness.</description>

      <title>The Male CEO and the Female Assistant: Evaluation and Mitigation of Gender Biases in Text-To-Image Generation of Dual Subjects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent large-scale T2I models like DALLE-3 have made progress in reducing gender stereotypes when generating single-person images. However, significant biases remain when generating images with more than one person. To systematically evaluate this, we propose the Paired Stereotype Test (PST) framework, which queries T2I models to depict two individuals assigned with male-stereotyped and female-stereotyped social identities, respectively (e.g. "a CEO" and "an Assistant"). This contrastive setting often triggers T2I models to generate gender-stereotyped images. Using PST, we evaluate two aspects of gender biases -- the well-known bias in gendered occupation and a novel aspect: bias in organizational power. Experiments show that over 74% images generated by DALLE-3 display gender-occupational biases. Additionally, compared to single-person settings, DALLE-3 is more likely to perpetuate male-associated stereotypes under PST. We further propose FairCritic, a novel and interpretable framework that leverages an LLM-based critic model to i) detect bias in generated images, and ii) adaptively provide feedback to T2I models for improving fairness. FairCritic achieves near-perfect fairness on PST, overcoming the limitations of previous prompt-based intervention approaches.</description>

      <title>White Men Lead, Black Women Help? Benchmarking Language Agency Social Biases in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10508v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social biases can manifest in language agency. While several studies approached agency-related bias in human-written language, very limited research has investigated such biases in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated content. In addition, previous works often rely on string-matching techniques to identify agentic and communal words within texts, which fall short of accurately classifying language agency. We introduce the novel Language Agency Bias Evaluation (LABE) benchmark, which comprehensively evaluates biases in LLMs by analyzing agency levels attributed to different demographic groups in model generations. LABE leverages 5,400 template-based prompts, an accurate agency classifier, and corresponding bias metrics to test for gender, racial, and intersectional language agency biases in LLMs on 3 text generation tasks: biographies, professor reviews, and reference letters. We also contribute the Language Agency Classification (LAC) dataset, consisting of 3,724 agentic and communal sentences. Using LABE, we unveil language agency social biases in 3 recent LLMs: ChatGPT, Llama3, and Mistral. We observe that: (1) LLM generations tend to demonstrate greater gender bias than human-written texts; (2) Models demonstrate remarkably higher levels of intersectional bias than the other bias aspects. Those who are at the intersection of gender and racial minority groups--such as Black females--are consistently described by texts with lower levels of agency, aligning with real-world social inequalities; (3) Among the 3 LLMs investigated, Llama3 demonstrates the greatest overall bias; (4) Not only does prompt-based mitigation fail to resolve language agency bias in LLMs, but it frequently leads to the exacerbation of biases in generated texts.</description>

      <title>A Unified View of Group Fairness Tradeoffs Using Partial Information Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel information-theoretic perspective on the relationship between prominent group fairness notions in machine learning, namely statistical parity, equalized odds, and predictive parity. It is well known that simultaneous satisfiability of these three fairness notions is usually impossible, motivating practitioners to resort to approximate fairness solutions rather than stringent satisfiability of these definitions. However, a comprehensive analysis of their interrelations, particularly when they are not exactly satisfied, remains largely unexplored. Our main contribution lies in elucidating an exact relationship between these three measures of (un)fairness by leveraging a body of work in information theory called partial information decomposition (PID). In this work, we leverage PID to identify the granular regions where these three measures of (un)fairness overlap and where they disagree with each other leading to potential tradeoffs. We also include numerical simulations to complement our results.</description>

      <title>The Factuality Tax of Diversity-Intervened Text-to-Image Generation: Benchmark and Fact-Augmented Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prompt-based "diversity interventions" are commonly adopted to improve the diversity of Text-to-Image (T2I) models depicting individuals with various racial or gender traits. However, will this strategy result in nonfactual demographic distribution, especially when generating real historical figures. In this work, we propose DemOgraphic FActualIty Representation (DoFaiR), a benchmark to systematically quantify the trade-off between using diversity interventions and preserving demographic factuality in T2I models. DoFaiR consists of 756 meticulously fact-checked test instances to reveal the factuality tax of various diversity prompts through an automated evidence-supported evaluation pipeline. Experiments on DoFaiR unveil that diversity-oriented instructions increase the number of different gender and racial groups in DALLE-3's generations at the cost of historically inaccurate demographic distributions. To resolve this issue, we propose Fact-Augmented Intervention (FAI), which instructs a Large Language Model (LLM) to reflect on verbalized or retrieved factual information about gender and racial compositions of generation subjects in history, and incorporate it into the generation context of T2I models. By orienting model generations using the reflected historical truths, FAI significantly improves the demographic factuality under diversity interventions while preserving diversity.</description>
