      <title>The beta decay of Tz=-2 64Se and its descendants: the T=2 isobaric multiplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present our results on the decay of 64Se. It is the heaviest Tz=-2 nucleus that both beta decays and has a stable mirror partner Tz=+2, thus allowing comparison with charge exchange reaction studies. The beta decays of 64Se and its descendants were studied at the RIKEN Nishina Center (Tokyo, Japan) following their production in the fragmentation of 78Kr on a beryllium target. Beta-delayed gamma-ray and particle radiation was identified for each of the nuclei in the decay chain allowing us to obtain decay schemes for 64Se, 64As, and 63Ge. Thus new excited states could be found for the descendant nuclei, including the interesting case of the N=Z nucleus 64Ge. Furthermore we observed for the first time the beta-delayed proton emission of 64Se and 64As. Based on these results we obtained proton branching ratios of 48.0(9)% in 64Se decay and 4.4(1)% in 64As decay. We obtained a half-life value of 22.5(6) ms for 64Se decay and half-lives slightly more precise than those in the literature for each nucleus involved in the decay chain. Using our results on the excited levels of 64As and the mass excess in the literature for 63Ge we obtained -39588(50) keV for the mass excess of 64As. Then based on the IMME we obtained the mass excess of -27429(88) keV for 64Se by extrapolation. The mirror process of 64Se beta decay, the charge exchange reaction 64Zn(3He,t)64Ga, has already been measured allowing us to study the mirror symmetry through the comparison of the weak force (beta decay) and strong force (charge exchange reaction). An interpretation of the decay schemes based on the idea of the Anti Analogue State is proposed.</description>

      <title>Observation of long-range collective flow in OO and NeNe collisions and implications for nuclear structure studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-range collective flow of particles produced in oxygen-oxygen (OO) and neon-neon (NeNe) collisions is measured with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The data samples were collected at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.36 TeV, with integrated luminosities of 7 nb$^{-1}$ and 0.8 nb$^{-1}$ for OO and NeNe collisions, respectively. Two- and four-particle azimuthal correlations are measured over nearly five units of pseudorapidity. Significant elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) flow harmonics are observed in both systems. The ratios of $v_n$ coefficients between NeNe and OO collisions reveal sensitivity to quadrupole correlations in the nuclear wave functions. Hydrodynamic models with $\textit{ab initio}$ nuclear structure inputs qualitatively reproduce the collision-overlap dependence of both the $v_n$ values and the NeNe to OO ratios. These measurements provide new constraints on hydrodynamic models for small collision systems and offer valuable input on the nuclear structure of $^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne.</description>

      <title>Imaging shapes of ground-state uranium-238 nuclei in high-energy nuclear collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape and orientation of colliding nuclei play a crucial role in determining the initial conditions of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), which influence key observables such as anisotropic and radial flow. In these proceedings, we present the measurements of $v_2$, $p_{\rm T}$ fluctuations and $v_2-p_{\rm T}$ correlations in $^{238}$U + $^{238}$U and $^{197}$Au + $^{197}$Au collisions at center of mass energies $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 193 and 200 GeV, respectively. Our results reveal significant differences in these observables between the two systems, particularly in the most central collisions. Comparisons with hydrodynamic model calculations indicate a large deformation in the ground states of $^{238}$U nuclei, consistent with previous low-energy experiments. However, data also imply a small deviation from axial symmetry of $^{238}$U [1]. Our work introduces a novel approach for imaging nuclear shapes, enhances the modeling of QGP initial conditions, and sheds light on nuclear structure evolution across different energy scales. The potential applications of this method for other nuclear species are discussed.</description>

      <title>Role of universal function of the nuclear proximity potential: A systematic study on the alpha-decay of heavy/super-heavy nuclei and {\alpha}-induced reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea of the universal function is fundamental advantage of proximity potential model. We present a systematic study of the role of universal function of the proximity potential model on alpha decay process for 250 ground state to ground state transitions using WKB approximation. In order to realize this goal, five universal functions proposed in the proximity models gp 77, Guo 2013, Ngo 80, Zhang 2013 and Prox. 2010 have been incorporated into the formalism of Prox. 77. The obtained results show that the radial behavior of universal function affects the penetration probability of the {\alpha} particle. The theoretical {\alpha} decay half lives are calculated and compared with the corresponding experimental data. It is shown that the Prox. 77 with Guo 2013 universal function provides the best fit to the available data. The role of the different universal functions in the {\alpha} decay half lives of super heavy nuclei (SHN) with Z from 104 to 118 are also studied. It is shown that the experimental half lives in the super heavy mass region are described well using the Prox. 77 with Zhang 2013 universal function. In this paper, the validity of the original and modified forms of the proximity 77 potential is also examined for complete fusion reactions between {\alpha} particle and 10 different target nuclei. Our results show that the measured {\alpha} induced fusion reaction cross sections can be well reproduced using the Prox. 77 with Zhang 2013 universal function for the reactions involving light and medium nuclei. Whereas, the Prox. 77 with Guo 2013 universal function model demonstrates a reliable agreement with the experimental data at sub-barrier energies for heavier systems.</description>

      <title>Principal Components of Nuclear Mass Model Residuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the residuals of six widely used nuclear mass models to uncover systematic deviations and identify missing physical effects in theoretical nuclear mass predictions. By analyzing the principal components of nuclear mass model residuals, this study reveals that no single dominant pattern governs the discrepancies across models. Instead, the residual structures are largely uncorrelated, indicating that current nuclear mass models fail to capture underlying nuclear residual effects in distinct and model-specific ways. These findings suggest that improvements to nuclear mass models should be guided by model-specific residual analyses rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.</description>

      <title>Statistical framework for nuclear parameter uncertainties in nucleosynthesis modeling of r- and i-process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Propagating nuclear uncertainties to nucleosynthesis simulations is key to understand the impact of theoretical uncertainties on the predictions, especially for processes far from the stability region, where nuclear properties are scarcely known. While systematic (model) uncertainties have been thoroughly studied, the statistical (parameter) ones have been more rarely explored, as constraining them is more challenging. We present here a methodology to determine coherently parameter uncertainties by anchoring the theoretical uncertainties to the experimentally known nuclear properties through the use of the Backward Forward Monte Carlo method. We use this methodology for two nucleosynthesis processes: the intermediate neutron capture process (i-process) and the rapid neutron capture process (r-process). We determine coherently for the i-process the uncertainties from the (n,$\gamma$) rates while we explore the impact of nuclear mass uncertainties for the r-process. The effect of parameter uncertainties on the final nucleosynthesis is in the same order as model uncertainties, suggesting the crucial need for more experimental constraints on key nuclei of interest. We show how key nuclear properties, such as relevant (n,$\gamma$) rates impacting the i-process tracers, could enhance tremendously the prediction of stellar evolution models by experimentally constraining them.</description>

      <title>Compton Edge Convolutional Model and Algorithm for Energy-channel Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scintillation detectors are essential tools for radiation measurement, but calibrating them accurately can be challenging, especially when full-energy peaks are not prominent. This is common in detectors like plastic scintillators. Current methods for calibrating these detectors often require manual adjustments. To address this, we propose a new method called the convolution model. This model accurately calibrates the energy-channel relationship of the Compton edge in various detectors. We tested it with plastic scintillator BC408, NaI crystal, and LaBr$_3$ crystal. Using ${}^{137}$Cs radioactive sources, we calibrated NaI and LaBr$_3$ detectors using full-energy peaks, then applied the convolution model to fit the Compton edge. Our results show errors within 1\% when compared to full-energy peak calibration.</description>

      <title>Imaging nuclei by smashing them at high energies: how are their shapes revealed after destruction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16071v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions have recently emerged as a promising ``imaging-by-smashing'' approach that may reveal the intrinsic shapes of atomic nuclei. Here, I outline a conceptual framework for this technique, explaining how nuclear shapes are encoded during quark-gluon plasma formation and evolution, and how they can be decoded from final-state particle distributions. I highlight the method's potential to advance our understanding of both nuclear structure and quark-gluon plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Physical Thickness Characterization of the FRIB Production Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The FRIB heavy-ion accelerator, commissioned in 2022, is a leading facility
  for producing rare isotope beams (RIBs) and exploring nuclei beyond the limits of stability.
  These RIBs are produced via reactions between stable primary beams and a graphite target.
  Approximately 20-40 \% of the primary beam power is deposited in the target,
  requiring efficient thermal dissipation.
  Currently, FRIB operates with a primary beam power of up to 20 kW. To enhance thermal dissipation efficiency,
  a single-slice rotating graphite target with a diameter of approximately 30 cm is employed.
  The effective target region is a 1 cm-wide outer rim of the graphite disc.
  To achieve high RIB production rates, the areal thickness variation must be constrained within 2 \%.
  This paper presents physical thickness characterizations of FRIB production targets with various nominal thicknesses,
  measured using a custom-built non-contact thickness measurement apparatus.</description>
