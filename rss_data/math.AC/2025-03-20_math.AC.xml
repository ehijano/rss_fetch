      <title>Sken and cluster algebras of punctured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the full Fock-Goncharov conjecture for $\mathcal{A}_{SL_2,\Sigma_{g,p}}$--the $\mathcal{A}$-cluster variety associated to representation of $SL_2$ local systems on most punctured surfaces with at least 2 punctures in the classical $q\to 1$ setting, that is, the tagged skein algebra coincides with the upper cluster algebra (namely $Sk^{ta}=U(\Sigma)$ or $mid(\mathcal{A})=up(\mathcal{A})$), with methods being potentially useful to tackle the quantum case. We deduce similar results for the Roger Yang skein algebra via a birational geometric description, obtaining $Sk^{RY}=U(\Sigma)[v_i^{\pm1}]$ as conjectured by Shen, Sun and Weng, proving important algebraic properties of $Sk^{RY}$ including normality and Cohen-Macaulayness. Our result is complementary to what and Mandel and Qin have shown in arXiv:2301.11101 for surface with marked points, based on arXiv:1411.1394 . The once-punctured case where cluster structures are significantly different is also discussed in the paper, and relevant conjectures are proposed (and proved in the once-punctured torus case).
  By contrast, we define the ordinary cluster algebra with potentials added $A(\Sigma)[v_i^{\pm1}]$, introduced by Shen, Sun and Weng, which is shown to be usually smaller than $Sk^{RY}$ and $U(\Sigma)[v_i^{\pm1}]$. This strengthen the result of arXiv:2201.08833 that the classical $A=U$ fails for $\Sigma_{g,p}$ with $g\geq 1, p\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Exploring the unleaved tree of numerical semigroups up to a given genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm to explore or count the numerical semigroups of a given genus which uses the unleaved version of the tree of numerical semigroups. In the unleaved tree there are no leaves rather than the ones at depth equal to the genus in consideration. For exloring the unleaved tree we present a new encoding system of a numerical semigroup given by the gcd of its left elements and its shrinking, that is, the semigroup generated by its left elements divided by their gcd. We show a method to determine the right generators and strong generators of a semigroup by means of the gcd and the shrinking encoding, as well as a method to encode a semigroup from the encoding of its parent or of its predecessor sibling. With the new algorithm we obtained $n_{76}=29028294421710227$.</description>

      <title>Some NP Complete Problems Based on Algebra and Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes several new problems and ideas concerning algebraic geometry and complexity theory. It first uses the idea of coloring graphs with elements of finite fields. This procedure then shows that graph coloring problems can be converted into membership problems for a new family of algebraic varieties, coloring varieties, which are closely related to determinantal varieties. This in turn shows that the problem of NP vs P can be converted into questions of if certain polynomials of large degree over finite fields have low multiplicative complexity.</description>

      <title>Cohen--Macaulay ideals of codimension two and the geometry of plane points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider classes of codimension two Cohen--Macaulay ideals over a standard graded polynomial ring over a field. We revisit Vasconcelos' problem on $3\times 2$ matrices with homogeneous entries and describe the homological details of Geramita's work on plane points. An additional topic is the homological discussion of minors fixing a submatrix in the context of a perfect codimension two ideal. A combinatorial outcome of the results is a proof of the conjecture on the Jacobian ideal of a hyperplane arrangement stated by Burity, Simis and Toh\v{a}neanu. The basic drive behind the present landscapes is a thorough analysis of the related Hilbert--Burch matrix, often without assuming equigeneration, linear presentation or even the popular $G_d$ condition of Artin--Nagata.</description>

      <title>Geometric interpretation of valuated term (pre)orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Valuated term orders are studied for the purposes of Gr\"{o}bner theory over fields with valuation. The points of a usual tropical variety correspond to certain valuated terms preorders. Generalizing both of these, the set of all ``well-behaved'' valuated term preorders is canonically in bijection with the points of a space introduced in our previous work on tropical adic geometry. In this paper we interpret these points geometrically by explicitly characterizing them in terms of classical polyhedral geometry. This characterization gives a bijection with equivalence classes of flags of polyhedra as well as a bijection with a class of prime filters on a lattice of polyhedral sets. The first of these also classifies valuated term orders. The second bijection is of the same flavor as the bijections from [van der Put and Schneider, 1995] in non-archimedean analytic geometry and indicates that the results of that paper may have analogues in tropical adic geometry.</description>
