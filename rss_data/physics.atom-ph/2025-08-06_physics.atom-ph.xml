      <title>Probing autoionization decay lifetimes of the $\mathbf{4d^{-1}6\boldsymbol{\ell}}$ core-excited states in xenon using attosecond noncollinear four-wave-mixing spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay of core-excited states is a sensitive probe of autoionization dynamics and correlation effects in many-electron systems, occurring on the fastest timescales. Xenon, with its dense manifold of autoionizing resonances that can be coupled with near-infrared light, provides a platform to investigate these processes. In this work, the autoionization decay lifetimes of $4d^{-1}6\ell$ $(\ell = s, p, d, ...)$ core-excited states in xenon atoms are probed with extreme ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond noncollinear four-wave-mixing (FWM) spectroscopy. The $4d^{-1}_{\{5/2,\, 3/2\}}6p$ XUV-bright states (optically dipole allowed) exhibit decay lifetimes of $\sim$6 fs, which is consistent with spectator-type decay. In contrast, the $4d^{-1}_{\{5/2,\, 3/2\}}6s$ and $4d^{-1}_{\{5/2,\, 3/2\}}6d$ XUV-dark states (optically dipole forbidden) show longer decay lifetimes of $\sim$20 fs. Photoionization calculations confirm that all core-hole states with $4d$ character should decay via spectator channels in $\leq$ 6 fs, suggesting that the apparent longer dark state decay times arise from an alternative mechanism. A few-level simulation of the FWM process shows that the inclusion of a nearby, longer-lived dark state can mimic the experimental FWM signal, suggesting population cycling with a second electronic state with non-$4d$ character. Ab-initio calculations support the presence of such multi-electron excited states in the 60$-$70 eV range. These results demonstrate that FWM signals can encode coupled-state dynamics when probing complex systems, highlighting the importance of combining theoretical and experimental approaches to disentangle accurate core-level decay pathways and lifetimes.</description>

      <title>AION-10: Technical Design Report for a 10m Atom Interferometer in Oxford</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Technical Design Report presents AION-10, a 10-meter atom interferometer to be located at Oxford University using ultracold strontium atoms to make precision measurements of fundamental physics. AION-10 serves as both a prototype for future larger-scale experiments and a versatile scientific instrument capable of conducting its own diverse physics programme.
  The design features a 10-meter vertical tower housing two atom interferometer sources in an ultra-high vacuum environment. Key engineering challenges include achieving nanometer-level vibrational stability and precise magnetic field control. Solutions include active vibration isolation, specialized magnetic shielding, and a modular assembly approach using professional lifting equipment.
  Detailed analysis confirms the design meets all performance requirements, with critical optical components remaining within our specifications 97% of the time under realistic operating conditions. Vacuum and vibration measurements in the host building validate that the instrument will achieve the precision needed for quantum sensing applications.
  This work establishes the technical foundation for scaling atom interferometry to longer baselines while creating a cutting-edge facility for precision measurements that could advance our understanding of fundamental physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By measuring a small circularly polarized component in the scattered light, we report the first observation of Rayleigh optical activity (RayOA) for typical chiral molecules, namely the two enantiomers of $\alpha$-pinene. Our work validates fundamental theoretical predictions made over fifty years ago and expands the chiroptical toolkit.</description>

      <title>Pulse Shape Discrimination Algorithms: Survey and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive survey and benchmark of pulse shape discrimination (PSD) algorithms for radiation detection, classifying nearly sixty methods into statistical (time-domain, frequency-domain, neural network-based) and prior-knowledge (machine learning, deep learning) paradigms. We implement and evaluate all algorithms on two standardized datasets: an unlabeled set from a 241Am-9Be source and a time-of-flight labeled set from a 238Pu-9Be source, using metrics including Figure of Merit (FOM), F1-score, ROC-AUC, and inter-method correlations. Our analysis reveals that deep learning models, particularly Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and hybrid approaches combining statistical features with neural regression, often outperform traditional methods. We discuss architectural suitabilities, the limitations of FOM, alternative evaluation metrics, and performance across energy thresholds. Accompanying this work, we release an open-source toolbox in Python and MATLAB, along with the datasets, to promote reproducibility and advance PSD research.</description>

      <title>Below threshold nonsequential double ionization with linearly polarized two-color fields I: symmetry and dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate laser-induced nonsequential double ionization with linearly polarized bichromatic fields, focusing on the recollision-excitation with subsequent ionization (RESI) mechanism. Using the strong-field approximation, we assess how the symmetries of the field influence the dominant events. Furthermore, we show that, by manipulating the field parameters such as the field frequencies and relative phase between the two driving waves, one can influence the correlated electron-momentum distributions. Specific features of a linearly polarized bichromatic field are that the momentum distributions of the second electron are no longer centered around vanishing momenta and that there may be more than one ionization event per half cycle. This can be used to confine the RESI distributions to specific momentum regions and to determine a hierarchy of parameters that make an event dominant.</description>

      <title>Below threshold nonsequential double ionization with linearly polarized two-color fields II: Quantum interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a systematic analysis of intra-channel quantum interference in laser-induced nonsequential double ionization with linearly polarized bichromatic fields, focusing on the recollision-excitation with subsequent ionization (RESI) mechanism, and employing the strong-field approximation. We generalize and elaborate several analytic interference conditions for RESI in arbitrary driving fields, with a focus on the interference arising from the specific symmetries of bichromatic fields. For example, for waves of comparable strengths, multiple events per half cycle for the direct electron must be considered. Furthermore, interference breaks some of the symmetries arising from the field. We detangle the superimposed interference fringes originating from phase differences related to symmetrization due to electron exchange, temporal shifts and a combination of exchange and event interference. We show that the hierarchy between exchange-only and exchange-temporal interference is fluid and can be manipulated by an appropriate choice of driving-field parameters. This is enabled by different types of interference occupying specific regions of the plane spanned by the electron momentum components parallel to the driving-field polarization.</description>

      <title>Quartet correlations near the surface of $ N = Z $ nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate Cooper quartet correlations in $ N = Z $ doubly-magic nuclei ($ {}^{40} \mathrm{Ca} $, $ {}^{100} \mathrm{Sn} $, and $ {}^{164} \mathrm{Pb} $). We first examine the quartet condensation fraction in infinite symmetric nuclear matter by using the quartet Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. Together with the total nucleon density profiles of doubly-magic nuclei obtained from the Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculation, we discuss the spatial distribution of quartet correlations in finite nuclei within the local density approximation. Large quartet condensate fractions are found at the surface region of an atomic nucleus due to the strong neutron-proton attractive interaction responsible for the deuteron formation in vacuum. Moreover, we discuss a possible microscopic origin of the Wigner term in the context of nucleon-quartet scattering in dilute symmetric nuclear matter. The nucleon-quartet scattering effect on the Wigner term is numerically estimated to be about one order of magnitude of the total empirical strength, indicating the importance of multinucleon clusters in the symmetry energy and mass formula in addition to the neutron-proton pairing.</description>

      <title>Fast Magnetic Coil Controller for Cold Atom Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold atoms experiments employ magnetic fields, commonly generated by coils, as an essential tool to control and manipulate atomic samples. In these experiments, it is often necessary to rapidly switch the magnetic field between two values. However, typical power supplies have a limited switching time for the current flowing through the coil. We present a control scheme implemented as an electronic circuit that overcomes this limitation. A faster control is achieved by momentarily applying an on-demand high voltage when the control signal variation surpasses the limits that the conventional power supply can follow, allowing a faster current flow into the magnetic coil. In our specific application, a coil with inductance of 491 ${\mu}H$ and resistance of 0.26 ${\Omega}$, corresponding to a time constant of ~1.9 ms, is driven so that its current faithfully follows the control signals from -1A to +1A. Capable of completing a full-scale transition in just ~31 ${\mu}s$, with an effective bandwidth of 15.2 kHz. This corresponds to an improvement by a factor of more than 20 in both bandwidth and switching speed over a conventional power supply. By appropriately selecting the components of the circuit, both the bandwidth and the switching time can be tuned to match specific needs within a wide range of inductive and power requirements.</description>
