      <title>Causal PDE-Control Models: A Structural Framework for Dynamic Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical portfolio models collapse under structural breaks, while modern machine-learning allocators adapt flexibly but often at the cost of transparency and interpretability. This paper introduces Causal PDE-Control Models (CPCMs), a unifying framework that integrates causal inference, nonlinear filtering, and forward-backward partial differential equations for dynamic portfolio optimization. The framework delivers three theoretical advances: (i) the existence of conditional risk-neutral measures under evolving information sets; (ii) a projection-divergence duality that quantifies the stability cost of departing from the causal driver manifold; and (iii) causal completeness, establishing that a finite driver span can capture all systematic premia. Classical methods such as Markowitz, CAPM, and Black-Litterman appear as degenerate cases, while reinforcement learning and deep-hedging policies emerge as unconstrained, symmetry-breaking approximations. Empirically, CPCM solvers implemented with physics-informed neural networks achieve higher Sharpe ratios, lower turnover, and more persistent premia than both econometric and machine-learning benchmarks, using a global equity panel with more than 300 candidate drivers. By reframing portfolio optimization around structural causality and PDE control, CPCMs provide a rigorous, interpretable, and computationally tractable foundation for robust asset allocation under nonstationary conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Investment and Consumption in a Stochastic Factor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study optimal investment and consumption in an incomplete stochastic factor model for a power utility investor on the infinite horizon. When the state space of the stochastic factor is finite, we give a complete characterisation of the well-posedness of the problem, and provide an efficient numerical algorithm for computing the value function. When the state space is a (possibly infinite) open interval and the stochastic factor is represented by an It\^o diffusion, we develop a general theory of sub- and supersolutions for second-order ordinary differential equations on open domains without boundary values to prove existence of the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation along with explicit bounds for the solution. By characterising the asymptotic behaviour of the solution, we are also able to provide rigorous verification arguments for various models, including -- for the first time -- the Heston model. Finally, we link the discrete and continuous setting and show that that the value function in the diffusion setting can be approximated very efficiently through a fast discretisation scheme.</description>

      <title>Optimal investment with insider information using Skorokhod &amp; Russo-Vallois integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the maximization of the logarithmic utility for an insider with different anticipating techniques. Our aim is to compare the utilization of Russo-Vallois forward and Skorokhod integrals in this context. Theoretical analysis and illustrative numerical examples showcase that the Skorokhod insider outperforms the forward insider. This remarkable observation stands in contrast to the scenario involving risk-neutral traders. Furthermore, an ordinary trader could surpass both insiders if a significant negative fluctuation in the driving stochastic process leads to a sufficiently negative final value. These findings underline the intricate interplay between anticipating stochastic calculus and nonlinear utilities, which may yield non-intuitive results from the financial viewpoint.</description>
