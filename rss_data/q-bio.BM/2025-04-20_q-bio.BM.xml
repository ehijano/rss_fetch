      <title>RiboGen: RNA Sequence and Structure Co-Generation with Equivariant MultiFlow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02058v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays fundamental roles in biological systems, from carrying genetic information to performing enzymatic function. Understanding and designing RNA can enable novel therapeutic application and biotechnological innovation. To enhance RNA design, in this paper we introduce RiboGen, the first deep learning model to simultaneously generate RNA sequence and all-atom 3D structure. RiboGen leverages the standard Flow Matching with Discrete Flow Matching in a multimodal data representation. RiboGen is based on Euclidean Equivariant neural networks for efficiently processing and learning three-dimensional geometry. Our experiments show that RiboGen can efficiently generate chemically plausible and self-consistent RNA samples, suggesting that co-generation of sequence and structure is a competitive approach for modeling RNA.</description>

      <title>E(3)-equivariant models cannot learn chirality: Field-based molecular generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obtaining the desired effect of drugs is highly dependent on their molecular geometries. Thus, the current prevailing paradigm focuses on 3D point-cloud atom representations, utilizing graph neural network (GNN) parametrizations, with rotational symmetries baked in via E(3) invariant layers. We prove that such models must necessarily disregard chirality, a geometric property of the molecules that cannot be superimposed on their mirror image by rotation and translation. Chirality plays a key role in determining drug safety and potency. To address this glaring issue, we introduce a novel field-based representation, proposing reference rotations that replace rotational symmetry constraints. The proposed model captures all molecular geometries including chirality, while still achieving highly competitive performance with E(3)-based methods across standard benchmarking metrics.</description>

      <title>ProteinGPT: Multimodal LLM for Protein Property Prediction and Structure Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding biological processes, drug development, and biotechnological advancements requires a detailed analysis of protein structures and functions, a task that is inherently complex and time-consuming in traditional protein research. To streamline this process, we introduce ProteinGPT, a state-of-the-art multimodal large language model for proteins that enables users to upload protein sequences and/or structures for comprehensive analysis and responsive inquiries. ProteinGPT integrates protein sequence and structure encoders with linear projection layers to ensure precise representation adaptation and leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate, contextually relevant responses. To train ProteinGPT, we constructed a large-scale dataset of 132,092 proteins, each annotated with 20-30 property tags and 5-10 QA pairs per protein, and optimized the instruction-tuning process using GPT-4o. Experiments demonstrate that ProteinGPT effectively generates informative responses to protein-related questions, achieving high performance on both semantic and lexical metrics and significantly outperforming baseline models and general-purpose LLMs in understanding and responding to protein-related queries. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/ProteinGPT/ProteinGPT.</description>
