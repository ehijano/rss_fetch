      <title>Toward a Realistic Encoding Model of Auditory Affective Understanding in the Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In affective neuroscience and emotion-aware AI, understanding how complex auditory stimuli drive emotion arousal dynamics remains unresolved. This study introduces a computational framework to model the brain's encoding of naturalistic auditory inputs into dynamic behavioral/neural responses across three datasets (SEED, LIRIS, self-collected BAVE). Guided by neurobiological principles of parallel auditory hierarchy, we decompose audio into multilevel auditory features (through classical algorithms and wav2vec 2.0/Hubert) from the original and isolated human voice/background soundtrack elements, mapping them to emotion-related responses via cross-dataset analyses. Our analysis reveals that high-level semantic representations (derived from the final layer of wav2vec 2.0/Hubert) exert a dominant role in emotion encoding, outperforming low-level acoustic features with significantly stronger mappings to behavioral annotations and dynamic neural synchrony across most brain regions ($p &lt; 0.05$). Notably, middle layers of wav2vec 2.0/hubert (balancing acoustic-semantic information) surpass the final layers in emotion induction across datasets. Moreover, human voices and soundtracks show dataset-dependent emotion-evoking biases aligned with stimulus energy distribution (e.g., LIRIS favors soundtracks due to higher background energy), with neural analyses indicating voices dominate prefrontal/temporal activity while soundtracks excel in limbic regions. By integrating affective computing and neuroscience, this work uncovers hierarchical mechanisms of auditory-emotion encoding, providing a foundation for adaptive emotion-aware systems and cross-disciplinary explorations of audio-affective interactions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Speaker DOA Estimation in Binaural Hearing Aids using Deep Learning and Speaker Count Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For extracting a target speaker voice, direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation is crucial for binaural hearing aids operating in noisy, multi-speaker environments. Among the solutions developed for this task, a deep learning convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) model leveraging spectral phase differences and magnitude ratios between microphone signals is a popular option. In this paper, we explore adding source-count information for multi-sources DOA estimation. The use of dual-task training with joint multi-sources DOA estimation and source counting is first considered. We then consider using the source count as an auxiliary feature in a standalone DOA estimation system, where the number of active sources (0, 1, or 2+) is integrated into the CRNN architecture through early, mid, and late fusion strategies. Experiments using real binaural recordings are performed. Results show that the dual-task training does not improve DOA estimation performance, although it benefits source-count prediction. However, a ground-truth (oracle) source count used as an auxiliary feature significantly enhances standalone DOA estimation performance, with late fusion yielding up to 14% higher average F1-scores over the baseline CRNN. This highlights the potential of using source-count estimation for robust DOA estimation in binaural hearing aids.</description>

      <title>ARTI-6: Towards Six-dimensional Articulatory Speech Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose ARTI-6, a compact six-dimensional articulatory speech encoding framework derived from real-time MRI data that captures crucial vocal tract regions including the velum, tongue root, and larynx. ARTI-6 consists of three components: (1) a six-dimensional articulatory feature set representing key regions of the vocal tract; (2) an articulatory inversion model, which predicts articulatory features from speech acoustics leveraging speech foundation models, achieving a prediction correlation of 0.87; and (3) an articulatory synthesis model, which reconstructs intelligible speech directly from articulatory features, showing that even a low-dimensional representation can generate natural-sounding speech. Together, ARTI-6 provides an interpretable, computationally efficient, and physiologically grounded framework for advancing articulatory inversion, synthesis, and broader speech technology applications. The source code and speech samples are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Generative Machine Listener</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GMLv2, a reference-based model designed for the prediction of subjective audio quality as measured by MUSHRA scores. GMLv2 introduces a Beta distribution-based loss to model the listener ratings and incorporates additional neural audio coding (NAC) subjective datasets to extend its generalization and applicability. Extensive evaluations on diverse testset demonstrate that proposed GMLv2 consistently outperforms widely used metrics, such as PEAQ and ViSQOL, both in terms of correlation with subjective scores and in reliably predicting these scores across diverse content types and codec configurations. Consequently, GMLv2 offers a scalable and automated framework for perceptual audio quality evaluation, poised to accelerate research and development in modern audio coding technologies.</description>

      <title>AUDDT: Audio Unified Deepfake Detection Benchmark Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content, such as audio deepfakes, a large body of recent work has focused on developing deepfake detection techniques. However, most models are evaluated on a narrow set of datasets, leaving their generalization to real-world conditions uncertain. In this paper, we systematically review 28 existing audio deepfake datasets and present an open-source benchmarking toolkit called AUDDT (https://github.com/MuSAELab/AUDDT). The goal of this toolkit is to automate the evaluation of pretrained detectors across these 28 datasets, giving users direct feedback on the advantages and shortcomings of their deepfake detectors. We start by showcasing the usage of the developed toolkit, the composition of our benchmark, and the breakdown of different deepfake subgroups. Next, using a widely adopted pretrained deepfake detector, we present in- and out-of-domain detection results, revealing notable differences across conditions and audio manipulation types. Lastly, we also analyze the limitations of these existing datasets and their gap relative to practical deployment scenarios.</description>

      <title>HuLA: Prosody-Aware Anti-Spoofing with Multi-Task Learning for Expressive and Emotional Synthetic Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current anti-spoofing systems remain vulnerable to expressive and emotional synthetic speech, since they rarely leverage prosody as a discriminative cue. Prosody is central to human expressiveness and emotion, and humans instinctively use prosodic cues such as F0 patterns and voiced/unvoiced structure to distinguish natural from synthetic speech. In this paper, we propose HuLA, a two-stage prosody-aware multi-task learning framework for spoof detection. In Stage 1, a self-supervised learning (SSL) backbone is trained on real speech with auxiliary tasks of F0 prediction and voiced/unvoiced classification, enhancing its ability to capture natural prosodic variation similar to human perceptual learning. In Stage 2, the model is jointly optimized for spoof detection and prosody tasks on both real and synthetic data, leveraging prosodic awareness to detect mismatches between natural and expressive synthetic speech. Experiments show that HuLA consistently outperforms strong baselines on challenging out-of-domain dataset, including expressive, emotional, and cross-lingual attacks. These results demonstrate that explicit prosodic supervision, combined with SSL embeddings, substantially improves robustness against advanced synthetic speech attacks.</description>

      <title>FastEnhancer: Speed-Optimized Streaming Neural Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streaming speech enhancement is a crucial task for real-time applications such as online meetings, smart home appliances, and hearing aids. Deep neural network-based approaches achieve exceptional performance while demanding substantial computational resources. Although recent neural speech enhancement models have succeeded in reducing the number of parameters and multiply-accumulate operations, their sophisticated architectures often introduce significant processing latency on common hardware. In this work, we propose FastEnhancer, a streaming neural speech enhancement model designed explicitly to minimize real-world latency. It features a simple encoder-decoder structure with efficient RNNFormer blocks. Evaluations on various objective metrics show that FastEnhancer achieves state-of-the-art speech quality and intelligibility while simultaneously demonstrating the fastest processing speed on a single CPU thread. Code and pre-trained weights are publicly available (https://github.com/aask1357/fastenhancer).</description>

      <title>IPDnet2: an efficient and improved inter-channel phase difference estimation network for sound source localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IPDnet is our recently proposed real-time sound source localization network. It employs alternating full-band and narrow-band (B)LSTMs to learn the full-band correlation and narrow-band extraction of DP-IPD, respectively, which achieves superior performance. However, processing narrow-band independently incurs high computational complexity and the limited scalability of LSTM layers constrains the localization accuracy. In this work, we extend IPDnet to IPDnet2, improving both localization accuracy and efficiency. IPDnet2 adapts the oSpatialNet as the backbone to enhance spatial cues extraction and provide superior scalability. Additionally, a simple yet effective frequency-time pooling mechanism is proposed to compress frequency and time resolutions and thus reduce computational cost, and meanwhile not losing localization capability. Experimental results show that IPDnet2 achieves comparable localization performance with IPDnet while only requiring less than 2\% of its computation cost. Moreover, the proposed network achieves state-of-the-art SSL performance by scaling up the model size while still maintaining relatively low complexity.</description>

      <title>AUV: Teaching Audio Universal Vector Quantization with Single Nested Codebook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose AUV, a unified neural audio codec with a single codebook, which enables a favourable reconstruction of speech and further extends to general audio, including vocal, music, and sound. AUV is capable of tackling any 16 kHz mixed-domain audio segment at bit rates around 700 bps. To accomplish this, we guide the matryoshka codebook with nested domain-specific partitions, assigned with corresponding teacher models to perform distillation, all in a single-stage training. A conformer-style encoder-decoder architecture with STFT features as audio representation is employed, yielding better audio quality. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AUV exhibits comparable audio reconstruction ability to state-of-the-art domain-specific single-layer quantizer codecs, showcasing the potential of audio universal vector quantization with a single codebook. The pre-trained model and demo samples are available at https://swivid.github.io/AUV/.</description>

      <title>Speak Your Mind: The Speech Continuation Task as a Probe of Voice-Based Model Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech Continuation (SC) is the task of generating a coherent extension of a spoken prompt while preserving both semantic context and speaker identity. Because SC is constrained to a single audio stream, it offers a more direct setting for probing biases in speech foundation models than dialogue does. In this work we present the first systematic evaluation of bias in SC, investigating how gender and phonation type (breathy, creaky, end-creak) affect continuation behaviour. We evaluate three recent models: SpiritLM (base and expressive), VAE-GSLM, and SpeechGPT across speaker similarity, voice quality preservation, and text-based bias metrics. Results show that while both speaker similarity and coherence remain a challenge, textual evaluations reveal significant model and gender interactions: once coherence is sufficiently high (for VAE-GSLM), gender effects emerge on text-metrics such as agency and sentence polarity. In addition, continuations revert toward modal phonation more strongly for female prompts than for male ones, revealing a systematic voice-quality bias. These findings highlight SC as a controlled probe of socially relevant representational biases in speech foundation models, and suggest that it will become an increasingly informative diagnostic as continuation quality improves.</description>

      <title>Speaker Anonymisation for Speech-based Suicide Risk Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adolescent suicide is a critical global health issue, and speech provides a cost-effective modality for automatic suicide risk detection. Given the vulnerable population, protecting speaker identity is particularly important, as speech itself can reveal personally identifiable information if the data is leaked or maliciously exploited. This work presents the first systematic study of speaker anonymisation for speech-based suicide risk detection. A broad range of anonymisation methods are investigated, including techniques based on traditional signal processing, neural voice conversion, and speech synthesis. A comprehensive evaluation framework is built to assess the trade-off between protecting speaker identity and preserving information essential for suicide risk detection. Results show that combining anonymisation methods that retain complementary information yields detection performance comparable to that of original speech, while achieving protection of speaker identity for vulnerable populations.</description>

      <title>Towards Cross-Task Suicide Risk Detection via Speech LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suicide risk among adolescents remains a critical public health concern, and speech provides a non-invasive and scalable approach for its detection. Existing approaches, however, typically focus on one single speech assessment task at a time. This paper, for the first time, investigates cross-task approaches that unify diverse speech suicide risk assessment tasks within a single model. Specifically, we leverage a speech large language model as the backbone and incorporate a mixture of DoRA experts (MoDE) approach to capture complementary cues across diverse assessments dynamically. The proposed approach was tested on 1,223 participants across ten spontaneous speech tasks. Results demonstrate that MoDE not only achieves higher detection accuracy than both single-task specialised models and conventional joint-tuning approaches, but also provides better confidence calibration, which is especially important for medical detection tasks.</description>

      <title>Semantic-VAE: Semantic-Alignment Latent Representation for Better Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While mel-spectrograms have been widely utilized as intermediate representations in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS), their inherent redundancy leads to inefficiency in learning text-speech alignment. Compact VAE-based latent representations have recently emerged as a stronger alternative, but they also face a fundamental optimization dilemma: higher-dimensional latent spaces improve reconstruction quality and speaker similarity, but degrade intelligibility, while lower-dimensional spaces improve intelligibility at the expense of reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this dilemma, we propose Semantic-VAE, a novel VAE framework that utilizes semantic alignment regularization in the latent space. This design alleviates the reconstruction-generation trade-off by capturing semantic structure in high-dimensional latent representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Semantic-VAE significantly improves synthesis quality and training efficiency. When integrated into F5-TTS, our method achieves 2.10% WER and 0.64 speaker similarity on LibriSpeech-PC, outperforming mel-based systems (2.23%, 0.60) and vanilla acoustic VAE baselines (2.65%, 0.59). We also release the code and models to facilitate further research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Musical concepts have been represented by geometry with tones. For example, in the chromatic circle, the twelve tones are represented by twelve points on a circle, and in Tonnetz, the relationships among harmonies are represented by a triangular lattice. Recently, we have shown that several arrangements of tones on the regular icosahedron can be associated with chromatic scales, whole-tone scales, major tones, and minor tones through the golden ratio. Here, we investigate another type of connection between music and the golden ratio. We show that there exists an arrangement of 7 tones on a golden triangle that can represent a given major/minor scale and its tonic, dominant, and subdominant chords by golden triangles. By applying this finding, we propose "golden Tonnetz" which represents all the major/minor scales and triads by the golden triangles or gnomons and also represents relative, parallel, and leading-tone exchange transformations in Neo-Riemannian theory by transformations among the golden triangles and gnomons.</description>

      <title>Real-time implementation of vibrato transfer as an audio effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An algorithm for deriving delay functions based on real examples of vibrato was recently introduced and can be used to perform a vibrato transfer, in which the vibrato pattern of a target signal is imparted onto an incoming sound using a delay line. The algorithm contains methods that computationally restrict a real-time implementation. Here, a real-time approximation is presented that incorporates an efficient fundamental frequency estimation algorithm and time-domain polyphase IIR filters that approximate an analytic signal. The vibrato transfer algorithm is further supplemented with a proposed method to transfer the amplitude modulation of the target sound, moving this method beyond the capabilities of typical delay-based vibrato effects. Modifications to the original algorithm for real-time use are detailed here and available as source code for an implementation as a VST plugin. This algorithm has applications as an audio effect in sound design, sound morphing, and real-time vibrato control of synthesized sounds.</description>

      <title>Guiding Audio Editing with Audio Language Model</title>

Abstract: Audio editing plays a central role in VR/AR immersion, virtual conferencing, sound design, and other interactive media. However, recent generative audio editing models depend on template-like instruction formats and are restricted to mono-channel audio. These models fail to deal with declarative audio editing, where the user declares what the desired outcome should be, while leaving the details of editing operations to the system. We introduce SmartDJ, a novel framework for stereo audio editing that combines the reasoning capability of audio language models with the generative power of latent diffusion. Given a high-level instruction, SmartDJ decomposes it into a sequence of atomic edit operations, such as adding, removing, or spatially relocating events. These operations are then executed by a diffusion model trained to manipulate stereo audio. To support this, we design a data synthesis pipeline that produces paired examples of high-level instructions, atomic edit operations, and audios before and after each edit operation. Experiments demonstrate that SmartDJ achieves superior perceptual quality, spatial realism, and semantic alignment compared to prior audio editing methods. Demos are available at https://zitonglan.github.io/project/smartdj/smartdj.html.</description>

      <title>Align2Speak: Improving TTS for Low Resource Languages via ASR-Guided Online Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts. We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens. Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages, substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.</description>

      <title>Noise-to-Notes: Diffusion-based Generation and Refinement for Automatic Drum Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic drum transcription (ADT) is traditionally formulated as a discriminative task to predict drum events from audio spectrograms. In this work, we redefine ADT as a conditional generative task and introduce Noise-to-Notes (N2N), a framework leveraging diffusion modeling to transform audio-conditioned Gaussian noise into drum events with associated velocities. This generative diffusion approach offers distinct advantages, including a flexible speed-accuracy trade-off and strong inpainting capabilities. However, the generation of binary onset and continuous velocity values presents a challenge for diffusion models, and to overcome this, we introduce an Annealed Pseudo-Huber loss to facilitate effective joint optimization. Finally, to augment low-level spectrogram features, we propose incorporating features extracted from music foundation models (MFMs), which capture high-level semantic information and enhance robustness to out-of-domain drum audio. Experimental results demonstrate that including MFM features significantly improves robustness and N2N establishes a new state-of-the-art performance across multiple ADT benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Text2Move: Text-to-moving sound generation via trajectory prediction and temporal alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human auditory perception is shaped by moving sound sources in 3D space, yet prior work in generative sound modelling has largely been restricted to mono signals or static spatial audio. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating moving sounds given text prompts in a controllable fashion. To enable training, we construct a synthetic dataset that records moving sounds in binaural format, their spatial trajectories, and text captions about the sound event and spatial motion. Using this dataset, we train a text-to-trajectory prediction model that outputs the three-dimensional trajectory of a moving sound source given text prompts. To generate spatial audio, we first fine-tune a pre-trained text-to-audio generative model to output temporally aligned mono sound with the trajectory. The spatial audio is then simulated using the predicted temporally-aligned trajectory. Experimental evaluation demonstrates reasonable spatial understanding of the text-to-trajectory model. This approach could be easily integrated into existing text-to-audio generative workflow and extended to moving sound generation in other spatial audio formats.</description>

      <title>A Parallel Ultra-Low Power Silent Speech Interface based on a Wearable, Fully-dry EMG Neckband</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a wearable, fully-dry, and ultra-low power EMG system for silent speech recognition, integrated into a textile neckband to enable comfortable, non-intrusive use. The system features 14 fully-differential EMG channels and is based on the BioGAP-Ultra platform for ultra-low power (22 mW) biosignal acquisition and wireless transmission. We evaluate its performance on eight speech commands under both vocalized and silent articulation, achieving average classification accuracies of 87$\pm$3% and 68$\pm$3% respectively, with a 5-fold CV approach. To mimic everyday-life conditions, we introduce session-to-session variability by repositioning the neckband between sessions, achieving leave-one-session-out accuracies of 64$\pm$18% and 54$\pm$7% for the vocalized and silent experiments, respectively. These results highlight the robustness of the proposed approach and the promise of energy-efficient silent-speech decoding.</description>

      <title>Comprehend and Talk: Text to Speech Synthesis via Dual Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) based autoregressive (AR) text-to-speech (TTS) systems, while achieving state-of-the-art quality, still face critical challenges. The foundation of this LLM-based paradigm is the discretization of the continuous speech waveform into a sequence of discrete tokens by neural audio codec. However, single codebook modeling is well suited to text LLMs, but suffers from significant information loss; hierarchical acoustic tokens, typically generated via Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ), often lack explicit semantic structure, placing a heavy learning burden on the model. Furthermore, the autoregressive process is inherently susceptible to error accumulation, which can degrade generation stability. To address these limitations, we propose CaT-TTS, a novel framework for robust and semantically-grounded zero-shot synthesis. First, we introduce S3Codec, a split RVQ codec that injects explicit linguistic features into its primary codebook via semantic distillation from a state-of-the-art ASR model, providing a structured representation that simplifies the learning task. Second, we propose an ``Understand-then-Generate'' dual-Transformer architecture that decouples comprehension from rendering. An initial ``Understanding'' Transformer models the cross-modal relationship between text and the audio's semantic tokens to form a high-level utterance plan. A subsequent ``Generation'' Transformer then executes this plan, autoregressively synthesizing hierarchical acoustic tokens. Finally, to enhance generation stability, we introduce Masked Audio Parallel Inference (MAPI), a nearly parameter-free inference strategy that dynamically guides the decoding process to mitigate local errors.</description>

      <title>Cross-Dialect Bird Species Recognition with Dialect-Calibrated Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dialect variation hampers automatic recognition of bird calls collected by passive acoustic monitoring. We address the problem on DB3V, a three-region, ten-species corpus of 8-s clips, and propose a deployable framework built on Time-Delay Neural Networks (TDNNs). Frequency-sensitive normalisation (Instance Frequency Normalisation and a gated Relaxed-IFN) is paired with gradient-reversal adversarial training to learn region-invariant embeddings. A multi-level augmentation scheme combines waveform perturbations, Mixup for rare classes, and CycleGAN transfer that synthesises Region 2 (Interior Plains)-style audio, , with Dialect-Calibrated Augmentation (DCA) softly down-weighting synthetic samples to limit artifacts. The complete system lifts cross-dialect accuracy by up to twenty percentage points over baseline TDNNs while preserving in-region performance. Grad-CAM and LIME analyses show that robust models concentrate on stable harmonic bands, providing ecologically meaningful explanations. The study demonstrates that lightweight, transparent, and dialect-resilient bird-sound recognition is attainable.</description>

      <title>Investigating Faithfulness in Large Audio Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Faithfulness measures whether chain-of-thought (CoT) representations accurately reflect a model's decision process and can be used as reliable explanations. Prior work has shown that CoTs from text-based LLMs are often unfaithful. This question has not been explored for large audio-language models (LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications. Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets: SAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across several datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally produce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes.</description>

      <title>Zero-Effort Image-to-Music Generation: An Interpretable RAG-based VLM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Image-to-Music (I2M) generation has garnered significant attention, with potential applications in fields such as gaming, advertising, and multi-modal art creation. However, due to the ambiguous and subjective nature of I2M tasks, most end-to-end methods lack interpretability, leaving users puzzled about the generation results. Even methods based on emotion mapping face controversy, as emotion represents only a singular aspect of art. Additionally, most learning-based methods require substantial computational resources and large datasets for training, hindering accessibility for common users. To address these challenges, we propose the first Vision Language Model (VLM)-based I2M framework that offers high interpretability and low computational cost. Specifically, we utilize ABC notation to bridge the text and music modalities, enabling the VLM to generate music using natural language. We then apply multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and self-refinement techniques to allow the VLM to produce high-quality music without external training. Furthermore, we leverage the generated motivations in text and the attention maps from the VLM to provide explanations for the generated results in both text and image modalities. To validate our method, we conduct both human studies and machine evaluations, where our method outperforms others in terms of music quality and music-image consistency, indicating promising results.

      <title>MDAR: A Multi-scene Dynamic Audio Reasoning Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to reason from audio, including speech, paralinguistic cues, environmental sounds, and music, is essential for AI agents to interact effectively in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on static or single-scene settings and do not fully capture scenarios where multiple speakers, unfolding events, and heterogeneous audio sources interact. To address these challenges, we introduce MDAR, a benchmark for evaluating models on complex, multi-scene, and dynamically evolving audio reasoning tasks. MDAR comprises 3,000 carefully curated question-answer pairs linked to diverse audio clips, covering five categories of complex reasoning and spanning three question types. We benchmark 26 state-of-the-art audio language models on MDAR and observe that they exhibit limitations in complex reasoning tasks. On single-choice questions, Qwen2.5-Omni (open-source) achieves 76.67% accuracy, whereas GPT-4o Audio (closed-source) reaches 68.47%; however, GPT-4o Audio substantially outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni on the more challenging multiple-choice and open-ended tasks. Across all three question types, no model achieves 80% performance. These findings underscore the unique challenges posed by MDAR and its value as a benchmark for advancing audio reasoning research.Code and benchmark can be found at https://github.com/luckyerr/MDAR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03636v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The human voice conveys not just words but also emotional states and individuality. Emotional voice conversion (EVC) modifies emotional expressions while preserving linguistic content and speaker identity, improving applications like human-machine interaction. While deep learning has advanced EVC models for specific target speakers on well-crafted emotional datasets, existing methods often face issues with emotion accuracy and speech distortion. In addition, the zero-shot scenario, in which emotion conversion is applied to unseen speakers, remains underexplored. This work introduces a novel diffusion framework with disentangled mechanisms and expressive guidance, trained on a large emotional speech dataset and evaluated on unseen speakers across in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Experimental results show that our method produces expressive speech with high emotional accuracy, naturalness, and quality, showcasing its potential for broader EVC applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection employs machine learning classification models to distinguish between individuals with AD and those without. Different from conventional classification tasks, we identify within-class variation as a critical challenge in AD detection: individuals with AD exhibit a spectrum of cognitive impairments. Therefore, simplistic binary AD classification may overlook two crucial aspects: within-class heterogeneity and instance-level imbalance. In this work, we found using a sample score estimator can generate sample-specific soft scores aligning with cognitive scores. We subsequently propose two simple yet effective methods: Soft Target Distillation (SoTD) and Instance-level Re-balancing (InRe), targeting two problems respectively. Based on the ADReSS and CU-MARVEL corpora, we demonstrated and analyzed the advantages of the proposed approaches in detection performance. These findings provide insights for developing robust and reliable AD detection models.</description>

      <title>CapSpeech: Enabling Downstream Applications in Style-Captioned Text-to-Speech</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have significantly transformed the field of style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis (CapTTS). However, adapting CapTTS to real-world applications remains challenging due to the lack of standardized, comprehensive datasets and limited research on downstream tasks built upon CapTTS. To address these gaps, we introduce CapSpeech, a new benchmark designed for a series of CapTTS-related tasks, including style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis with sound events (CapTTS-SE), accent-captioned TTS (AccCapTTS), emotion-captioned TTS (EmoCapTTS), and text-to-speech synthesis for chat agent (AgentTTS). CapSpeech comprises over 10 million machine-annotated audio-caption pairs and nearly 0.36 million human-annotated audio-caption pairs. In addition, we introduce two new datasets collected and recorded by a professional voice actor and experienced audio engineers, specifically for the AgentTTS and CapTTS-SE tasks. Alongside the datasets, we conduct comprehensive experiments using both autoregressive and non-autoregressive models on CapSpeech. Our results demonstrate high-fidelity and highly intelligible speech synthesis across a diverse range of speaking styles. To the best of our knowledge, CapSpeech is the largest available dataset offering comprehensive annotations for CapTTS-related tasks. The experiments and findings further provide valuable insights into the challenges of developing CapTTS systems.</description>

We present MMedFD, the first real-world Chinese healthcare ASR corpus designed for multi-turn, full-duplex settings. Captured from a deployed AI assistant, the dataset comprises 5,805 annotated sessions with synchronized user and mixed-channel views, RTTM/CTM timing, and role labels. We introduce a model-agnostic pipeline for streaming segmentation, speaker attribution, and dialogue memory, and fine-tune Whisper-small on role-concatenated audio for long-context recognition. ASR evaluation includes WER, CER, and HC-WER, which measures concept-level accuracy across healthcare settings. LLM-generated responses are assessed using rubric-based and pairwise protocols. MMedFD establishes a reproducible framework for benchmarking streaming ASR and end-to-end duplex agents in healthcare deployment. The dataset and related resources are publicly available at https://github.com/Kinetics-JOJO/MMedFD</description>

      <title>Phoenix-VAD: Streaming Semantic Endpoint Detection for Full-Duplex Speech Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spoken dialogue models have significantly advanced intelligent human-computer interaction, yet they lack a plug-and-play full-duplex prediction module for semantic endpoint detection, hindering seamless audio interactions. In this paper, we introduce Phoenix-VAD, an LLM-based model that enables streaming semantic endpoint detection. Specifically, Phoenix-VAD leverages the semantic comprehension capability of the LLM and a sliding window training strategy to achieve reliable semantic endpoint detection while supporting streaming inference. Experiments on both semantically complete and incomplete speech scenarios indicate that Phoenix-VAD achieves excellent and competitive performance. Furthermore, this design enables the full-duplex prediction module to be optimized independently of the dialogue model, providing more reliable and flexible support for next-generation human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>SPADE: Structured Pruning and Adaptive Distillation for Efficient LLM-TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to introduce SPADE, a framework for Structured Pruning and Adaptive Distillation for Efficient Large Language Model-based text-to-speech (LLM-TTS). Recent LLM-TTS systems achieve strong controllability and zero-shot generalization, but their large parameter counts and high latency limit real-world deployment. SPADE addresses this by combining (i) a pruning step guided by a word-error-rate-based layer importance index to remove non-essential Transformer layers, with (ii) multi-level knowledge distillation to restore autoregressive coherence. On zero-shot benchmarks, SPADE preserves near-parity perceptual quality while halving Transformer depth, reducing VRAM usage by up to 20%, and achieving up to 1.7x faster real-time factor with less than 5% of the original training data. These results show that compact LLM-TTS models can maintain naturalness and speaker similarity while enabling practical real-time speech generation. Audio samples are available at https://mm.kaist.ac.kr/projects/SPADE/.</description>

      <title>TF-Restormer: Complex Spectral Prediction for Speech Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech restoration in real-world conditions is challenging due to compounded distortions such as clipping, band-pass filtering, digital artifacts, noise, and reverberation, and low sampling rates. Existing systems, including vocoder-based approaches, often sacrifice signal fidelity, while diffusion models remain impractical for streaming. Moreover, most assume a fixed target sampling rate, requiring external resampling that leads to redundant computations. We present TF-Restormer, an encoder-decoder architecture that concentrates analysis on input-bandwidth with a time-frequency dual-path encoder and reconstructs missing high-frequency bands through a light decoder with frequency extension queries. It enables efficient and universal restoration across arbitrary input-output rates without redundant resampling. To support adversarial training across diverse rates, we introduce a shared sampling-frequency-independent (SFI) STFT discriminator. TF-Restormer further supports streaming with a causal time module, and improves robustness under extreme degradations by injecting spectral inductive bias into the frequency module. Finally, we propose a scaled log-spectral loss that stabilizes optimization under severe conditions while emphasizing well-predicted spectral details. As a single model across sampling rates, TF-Restormer consistently outperforms prior systems, achieving balanced gains in signal fidelity and perceptual quality, while its streaming mode maintains competitive effectiveness for real-time application. Code and demos are available at https://tf-restormer.github.io/demo.</description>

      <title>Measuring Audio's Impact on Correctness: Audio-Contribution-Aware Post-Training of Large Audio Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) represent an important frontier in multimodal AI, addressing diverse audio tasks. Recently, post-training of LALMs has received increasing attention due to significant performance improvements over foundation models. While single-stage post-training such as reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated promising results, multi-stage approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by RL remain suboptimal. The allocation of data across multiple training stages to maximize LALM capabilities has not been fully explored, and large-scale, high-quality datasets for such research are also lacking. To address these problems, we firstly present AudioMCQ, a comprehensive audio multiple-choice question dataset comprising 571k samples with two kinds of chain-of-thought annotations. Secondly, we investigate the prevalent zero audio-contribution phenomenon in LALMs, where models derive correct answers solely from textual information without processing audio content. We propose Audio-Contribution Filtering to partition data into weak and strong audio-contribution subsets. Based on these insights, we develop two effective post-training paradigms: Weak-to-Strong (SFT on weak audio-contribution data followed by RL on strong audio-contribution data) and Mixed-to-Strong (SFT on mixed audio-contribution data followed by RL on strong audio-contribution data). We achieve first place in the DCASE 2025 Audio-Question-Answering challenge by using AudioMCQ. Additionally, leveraging our dataset with different training strategies, we achieve 78.2\% on MMAU-test-mini, 75.6\% on MMAU, 67.1\% on MMAR, and 70.7\% on MMSU, establishing new state-of-the-art performance across these benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Unifying Symbolic Music Arrangement: Track-Aware Reconstruction and Structured Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15176v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for automatic multitrack music arrangement that enables a single pre-trained symbolic music model to handle diverse arrangement scenarios, including reinterpretation, simplification, and additive generation. At its core is a segment-level reconstruction objective operating on token-level disentangled content and style, allowing for flexible any-to-any instrumentation transformations at inference time. To support track-wise modeling, we introduce REMI-z, a structured tokenization scheme for multitrack symbolic music that enhances modeling efficiency and effectiveness for both arrangement tasks and unconditional generation. Our method outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art models on representative tasks in different arrangement scenarios -- band arrangement, piano reduction, and drum arrangement, in both objective metrics and perceptual evaluations. Taken together, our framework demonstrates strong generality and suggests broader applicability in symbolic music-to-music transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vocal health plays a crucial role in peoples' lives, significantly impacting their communicative abilities and interactions. However, despite the global prevalence of voice disorders, many lack access to convenient diagnosis and treatment. This paper introduces VocalAgent, an audio large language model (LLM) to address these challenges through vocal health diagnosis. We leverage Qwen-Audio-Chat fine-tuned on three datasets collected in-situ from hospital patients, and present a multifaceted evaluation framework encompassing a safety assessment to mitigate diagnostic biases, cross-lingual performance analysis, and modality ablation studies. VocalAgent demonstrates superior accuracy on voice disorder classification compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Its LLM-based method offers a scalable solution for broader adoption of health diagnostics, while underscoring the importance of ethical and technical validation.</description>

      <title>Towards Inclusive ASR: Investigating Voice Conversion for Dysarthric Speech Recognition in Low-Resource Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14874v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for dysarthric speech remains challenging due to data scarcity, particularly in non-English languages. To address this, we fine-tune a voice conversion model on English dysarthric speech (UASpeech) to encode both speaker characteristics and prosodic distortions, then apply it to convert healthy non-English speech (FLEURS) into non-English dysarthric-like speech. The generated data is then used to fine-tune a multilingual ASR model, Massively Multilingual Speech (MMS), for improved dysarthric speech recognition. Evaluation on PC-GITA (Spanish), EasyCall (Italian), and SSNCE (Tamil) demonstrates that VC with both speaker and prosody conversion significantly outperforms the off-the-shelf MMS performance and conventional augmentation techniques such as speed and tempo perturbation. Objective and subjective analyses of the generated data further confirm that the generated speech simulates dysarthric characteristics.</description>

      <title>Description and Discussion on DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 2: First-shot Unsupervised Anomalous Sound Detection for Machine Condition Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the task description for the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2025 Challenge Task 2, titled "First-shot unsupervised anomalous sound detection (ASD) for machine condition monitoring". Building on the DCASE 2024 Challenge Task 2, this task is structured as a first-shot problem within a domain generalization framework. The primary objective of the first-shot approach is to facilitate the rapid deployment of ASD systems for new machine types without requiring machine-specific hyperparameter tunings. For DCASE 2025 Challenge Task 2, sounds from previously unseen machine types have been collected and provided as the evaluation dataset. We received 119 submissions from 35 teams, and an analysis of these submissions has been made in this paper. Analysis showed that various approaches can all be competitive, such as fine-tuning pre-trained models, using frozen pre-trained models, and training small models from scratch, when combined with appropriate cost functions, anomaly score normalization, and use of clean machine and noise sounds.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Graph Neural Network for Compressed Speech Steganalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Steganalysis methods based on deep learning (DL) often struggle with computational complexity and challenges in generalizing across different datasets. Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes enables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and adaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural Network (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of compressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves straightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to capture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained details and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in uncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in VoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for short 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging conditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent over the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016 seconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds. This makes it efficient for online steganalysis tasks, providing a superior balance between detection accuracy and efficiency under the constraint of short samples with low embedding rates.</description>

      <title>Xi+: Uncertainty Supervision for Robust Speaker Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are various factors that can influence the performance of speaker recognition systems, such as emotion, language and other speaker-related or context-related variations. Since individual speech frames do not contribute equally to the utterance-level representation, it is essential to estimate the importance or reliability of each frame. The xi-vector model addresses this by assigning different weights to frames based on uncertainty estimation. However, its uncertainty estimation model is implicitly trained through classification loss alone and does not consider the temporal relationships between frames, which may lead to suboptimal supervision. In this paper, we propose an improved architecture, xi+. Compared to xi-vector, xi+ incorporates a temporal attention module to capture frame-level uncertainty in a context-aware manner. In addition, we introduce a novel loss function, Stochastic Variance Loss, which explicitly supervises the learning of uncertainty. Results demonstrate consistent performance improvements of about 10\% on the VoxCeleb1-O set and 11\% on the NIST SRE 2024 evaluation set.</description>

      <title>FakeSound2: A Benchmark for Explainable and Generalizable Deepfake Sound Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of generative audio raises ethical and security concerns stemming from forged data, making deepfake sound detection an important safeguard against the malicious use of such technologies. Although prior studies have explored this task, existing methods largely focus on binary classification and fall short in explaining how manipulations occur, tracing where the sources originated, or generalizing to unseen sources-thereby limiting the explainability and reliability of detection. To address these limitations, we present FakeSound2, a benchmark designed to advance deepfake sound detection beyond binary accuracy. FakeSound2 evaluates models across three dimensions: localization, traceability, and generalization, covering 6 manipulation types and 12 diverse sources. Experimental results show that although current systems achieve high classification accuracy, they struggle to recognize forged pattern distributions and provide reliable explanations. By highlighting these gaps, FakeSound2 establishes a comprehensive benchmark that reveals key challenges and aims to foster robust, explainable, and generalizable approaches for trustworthy audio authentication.</description>
