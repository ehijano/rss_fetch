      <title>Poisson Kernels and Hilbert Transforms for Trigonometric Heckman-Opdam Polynomials of type $A_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the trigonometric Heckman-Opdam polynomials of type $A_1$. We establish connections with ultraspherical polynomials and derive an explicit expression for the associated Poisson kernel. Using the product formula, we introduce a natural convolution structure and develop a theory of fractional integrals associated with these polynomials. We also define a generalized Hilbert transform in the framework of the Cherednik operator and prove its boundedness on $L^p$-spaces.
  This work provides an alternative perspective on the approach of B. Muckenhoupt and E.M. Stein \cite{MS}.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Sobolev and Besov Spaces: Embeddings and prevalent smoothness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce inhomogeneous Sobolev spaces that naturally generalise the standard Sobolev-Slobodeckij spaces. The inhomogeneity of these spaces is governed by a set function $\mu$, referred to as an environment. In the case where $\mu$ is an almost doubling set function, we relate these new spaces with inhomogeneous Besov spaces recently introduced by Barral-Seuret in 2023. When $\mu$ is in addition a capacity, wee also prove that prevalent elements in such spaces are multifractal (with a singularity spectrum that we determine), completing previous Baire generic results already obtained.</description>

      <title>Differentiable convex extensions with sharp Lipschitz constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a superreflexive Banach space $X$, and a set $E \subset X$, we characterise the $1$-jets $(f,G)$ on $E$ that admit $C^{1,\omega}$ convex extensions $(F,DF)$ to all of $X$; where $\omega$ is any admissible modulus of continuity depending on the regularity of $X$. Moreover, we obtain precise estimates for the growth of the $C^{1,\omega}$ seminorm of the extensions with respect to the initial data. We show how these estimates can be improved in the Hilbert setting, and are asymptotically sharp for H\"older moduli. Remarkably, our extensions have the sharp Lipschitz constant $\mathrm{Lip}(F,X) = \|G\|_{L^\infty(E)}$, when $G$ is a bounded map. All these extensions are given by simple and explicit formulas. We also prove a similar theorem for $C^1$ convex extensions of jets defined on compact subsets $E$ of superreflexive spaces $X$, with the sharp Lipschitz constant too. The results are new even when $X=\mathbb{R}^n.$</description>

      <title>Robustness of nonuniform exponential dichotomies under a wider class of perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The robustness property of exponential dichotomies refers to the stability of this notion under small linear perturbations. In recent work~\cite{PPX}, the authors have identified a new class of perturbations under which the notion of a nonuniform exponential dichotomy persists. In the present paper, we show that it is possible to extend this class. Moreover, unlike~\cite{PPX} where the results are restricted to the case of ordinary differential equations, in the present paper we deal with arbitrary evolution families consisting of possibly noninvertible linear operators.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal relationship between detectability and observability in a non-uniform setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the recent notion of non-uniform complete observability, and on the fact that this property ensures non-uniform exponential detectability, this paper establishes the converse implication under suitable additional assumptions. Specifically, we investigate conditions under which non-uniform exponential detectability guarantees non-uniform complete observability. Our approach is based on a refined analysis of the associated output feedback systems and on the preservation of non-uniform observability properties under such feedback transformations. These results extend the classical equivalence between observability and detectability beyond the uniform framework and provide new tools for the qualitative analysis of time-varying control systems.</description>

      <title>On the existence of solutions of dynamic equations on time scales in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we address the question of solvability of dynamic equations on time scales in Banach spaces. In particular, our main theorem extends the result for classical differential equations in Banach spaces of Bana\'s and Goebel (1980), to an arbitrary time scale. Central role is played by the axiomatic theory of measures of noncompactness. Moreover, we study countable systems of dynamic equations on time scales arising from semi-discretisation of parabolic partial dynamic equations.</description>

      <title>Derivatives of Humbert confluent hypergeometric functions with respect to their parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.05051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humbert confluent hypergeometric functions of two variables arise in many problems of mathematical physics and applied analysis, yet their behavior with respect to parameters has not been systematically studied. In this paper we investigate derivatives with respect to numerator and denominator parameters for the seven classical Humbert functions \Phi{1}, \Phi{2}, \Phi_{3}, Psi_{1}, Psi_{2}, \Xi_{1} and \Xi_{2}. Using their double series representations together with elementary properties of the Gamma and digamma functions, we derive explicit formulas for first order parameter derivatives and express them in compact form in terms of Srivastava triple hypergeometric function F{3}. By differentiating the underlying partial differential equations, we further obtain simple operator recurrences for derivatives of arbitrary order, which yield closed differentiation and reduction formulas in terms of contiguous Humbert functions. Finally, we indicate how these results lead to Taylor type parameter expansions and illustrate their use with basic numerical examples and plots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.09140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies derivatives with respect to the parameters of Srivastava triple hypergeometric functions HA, HB and HC. Using basic properties of the Gamma function and Pochhammer symbols, we obtain explicit formulas for first and higher order derivatives. These derivatives are expressed in terms of Pathan quadruple hypergeometric function F. We also derive Euler type differential operator identities, contiguous relations for unit shifts in the parameters, and recurrence relations satisfied by these derivatives. In addition, we show that derivatives of arbitrary order satisfy systems of linear partial differential equations in the underlying variables. The results extend known differentiation formulas for classical and multivariable hypergeometric functions and provide tools for potential applications in mathematical physics and engineering.</description>

      <title>Distances in sparse sets of large Hausdorff dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distance set $\Delta(E)$ of a set $E$ consists of all non-negative numbers that represent distances between pairs of points in $E$. This paper studies sparse (less than full-dimensional) Borel sets in $\mathbb R^d$, $d \geq 2$ with a focus on properties of their distance sets. Our results are of four types. First, we generalize a classical result of Steinhaus (1920) to Borel sets $E \subseteq [0,1]^d$ with $s$-dimensional Hausdorff content larger than $(1 - \rho)$, for small $\rho &gt; 0$ and $s$ close to $d$. For such sets, we show that $\Delta(E) \supseteq [a, b]$, where $0&lt;a&lt;b$ depend only on $d$ and $\rho$. This leads to our second result, a quantitative formulation of a theorem of Mattila and Sj$\ddot{\text{o}}$lin (1999). For an arbitrary Borel set $E \subseteq [0,1]^d$ of large Hausdorff dimension, we show that $\Delta(E)$ contains a union of intervals whose lengths are dictated by cubes where $E$ holds high density. This structure theorem in turn yields a tool for identifying abundance of distances; this is the third contribution of this article. It allows us to formulate a size property of a set that guarantees all sufficiently large distances, generalizing earlier work of Bourgain (1986). It can also be used to construct examples of totally disconnected sparse sets with this property. Finally, we explore special features of $\Delta(E)$ if $E$ is assumed to have certain structural regularity in addition to large Hausdorff dimension. The additional regularity is harnessed via $L^2$-Fourier asymptotics of measures supported on $E$. Applications of this phenomenon give new information on $\Delta(E)$ when $E$ is locally uniformly $s$-dimensional and quasi-regular, in the terminology of Strichartz (1990). A number of new examples, counterexamples and open problems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Spectral Criteria for Unique Signal Recovery from Two-Sided Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification of sampling sets that enable unique signal recovery is fundamental to many applications in signal processing and remains a central problem in mathematical analysis. Recent studies in the mathematical literature, particularly in the context of the Fourier transform and crystalline measures, have developed a theory that empowers signal recovery from two-sided sampling in both time and frequency domains. Kulikov, Nazarov, and Sodin introduced a method for identifying pairs of sets that enable unique recovery, based on functional inequalities of the Wirtinger-Poincar\'{e} type. In this work, we propose an alternative, spectral approach based on analogies with quantum mechanics. By relating uniqueness pairs to eigenvalue estimates of associated self-adjoint operators, our method offers a conceptually simpler and more flexible framework for studying signal recovery from two-sided sampling. Our approach extends naturally to other unitary transforms commonly used in signal processing. We demonstrate its effectiveness in the contexts of the Fractional Fourier transform and the Hankel transform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10370v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the type A, BC, and D root systems, we determine equivalent conditions between the coefficients of an exponential holomorphic function and the asymptotic values taken by the Dunkl bilinear form when one of its entries is the function. We establish these conditions over the $|\theta N| \rightarrow\infty$ regime for the type A and D root systems and over the $|\theta_0 N|\rightarrow \infty, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system. We also generalize existing equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type A root system and over the $\theta_0 N\rightarrow c_0\in\mathbb{C}, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c_1\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system and prove new equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type D root system. Furthermore, we determine the asymptotics of the coefficients of the Bessel functions over the regimes that we have mentioned.</description>

Abstract: We provide a precise description of the bottom of the spectrum in the semiclassical limit of a harmonic-type Schr{\"o}dinger operator with an inverse square potential. By exploiting the connection between the eigenfunctions of these operators and the Kummer and Whittaker functions, we derive accurate localization results for the non-asymptotic zeros of these functions with respect to their first parameter, uniformly with respect to the argument taken large and real. Moreover, our operators are linked to the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with a constant magnetic field, so that our results describe its spectrum. Our spectral analysis relies on a WKB-type approach.</description>

      <title>On $\beta=6$ Tracy-Widom distribution and the second Calogero-Painlev\'e system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.06733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Calogero-Painlev\'e systems were introduced in 2001 by K. Takasaki as a natural generalization of the classical Painlev\'e equations to the case of the several Painlev\'e ``particles'' coupled via the Calogero type interactions. In 2014, I. Rumanov discovered the remarkable fact that a particular case of the second Calogero-Painlev\'e II equation describes the Tracy-Widom distribution function for the general beta-ensembles with even values of the parameter beta. Most recently, in 2017 work of M. Bertola, M. Cafasso, and V. Rubtsov, it was proven that all Calogero-Painlev\'e systems are Lax integrable, and hence their solutions admit a Riemann-Hilbert representation. This important observation has opened the door to rigorous, based on the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method, asymptotic analysis of the Calogero-Painlev\'e equations. This in turn yields the possibility of rigorous evaluation of the asymptotic behavior of the Tracy-Widom distributions for the values of beta beyond the classical $\beta =1, 2, 4.$ In this work we shall start an asymptotic analysis of the Calogero-Painlev\'e system with a special focus on the Calogero-Painlev\'e system corresponding to $\beta = 6$ Tracy-Widom distribution function. The principle technical challenge is the implementation of the nonlinear steepest descent approach beyond the $2\times 2$ matrix dimension of the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem; in our case, it is $6\times 6$.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity and Fourier asymptotics of spectral measures for 1D Schr\"odinger operators under exponentially decaying perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03971v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity, or even the Lipschitz property, for the spectral measures of half-line discrete Schr\"odinger operators under suitable boundary conditions and exponentially decaying small potentials. These are the first known examples, apart from the free case, of Schr\"odinger operators with Lipschitz continuous spectral measures up to the spectral edge, and it was obtained as a consequence of the Dirichlet boundary condition. Notably, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the time-averaged quantum return probability, either $\log (t) / t$ or $1 / t$, as in the case of the free Laplacian, remains unchanged in this setting. Furthermore, we prove the persistence of the purely absolutely continuous spectrum and the $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity of the spectral measures for (Diophantine) quasi-periodic operators under exponentially decaying small perturbations. These results are optimal and hold for all energies, up to the border of the absolutely continuous spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025) is a generic evolutionary coding agent that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with automated evaluation in an iterative evolutionary framework that proposes, tests, and refines algorithmic solutions to challenging scientific and practical problems. In this paper we showcase AlphaEvolve as a tool for autonomously discovering novel mathematical constructions and advancing our understanding of long-standing open problems.
  To demonstrate its breadth, we considered a list of 67 problems spanning mathematical analysis, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. The system rediscovered the best known solutions in most of the cases and discovered improved solutions in several. In some instances, AlphaEvolve is also able to generalize results for a finite number of input values into a formula valid for all input values. Furthermore, we are able to combine this methodology with Deep Think and AlphaProof in a broader framework where the additional proof-assistants and reasoning systems provide automated proof generation and further mathematical insights.
  These results demonstrate that large language model-guided evolutionary search can autonomously discover mathematical constructions that complement human intuition, at times matching or even improving the best known results, highlighting the potential for significant new ways of interaction between mathematicians and AI systems. We present AlphaEvolve as a powerful new tool for mathematical discovery, capable of exploring vast search spaces to solve complex optimization problems at scale, often with significantly reduced requirements on preparation and computation time.</description>

Abstract: The Kuramoto model describes phase oscillators on the unit circle whose interactions are encoded by a graph. Each edge acts like a spring that pulls the two adjacent oscillators toward each other whenever their phases differ. A central question is to determine which graphs are globally synchronizing, meaning that trajectories of the Kuramoto dynamics converge to the fully synchronized state from almost all initial conditions. This property is tightly linked to the benign nonconvexity of the model's energy landscape. Existing guarantees for global synchronization rely on minimum-degree thresholds, which require the graph to be highly dense. In this work, we show that connected threshold graphs, whose density may vary from $2/n$ to $1$, are globally synchronizing. Our proof relies on a phasor-geometric analysis of the stationary points of the associated energy landscape.</description>
