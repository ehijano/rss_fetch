Abstract: We derive optimal dimension independent constants in the classical Khintchine inequality between the $p$th and fourth moment for $p\ge 4$. As an application we deduce stability estimates for the Khintchine inequality between the $p$th and second moment for $p \geq 4$.</description>

      <title>Temperleyan Domino Tilings with Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze asymptotic height function fluctuations in uniformly random domino tiling models on multiply connected Temperleyan domains. Starting from asymptotic formulas derived by Kenyon [arXiv:math-ph/9910002v1], we show that (1) the difference of the centered height function and a harmonic function with boundary values given by the (random) centered hole heights converges in the sense of moments to a Gaussian free field, which is independent of the hole heights, and (2) the hole heights themselves converge in distribution to a discrete Gaussian random vector. These results confirm general predictions about height fluctuations for tilings on multiply connected domains.</description>

      <title>Decompositions of CSBPs via Poissonian Intertwining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit certain decompositions of continuous-state branching processes (CSBPs), commonly referred to as skeletal decompositions, through the lens of intertwining of semi-groups. Precisely, we associate to a CSBP $X$ with branching mechanism $\psi$ a family of $\mathbb{R}_+\times \mathbb{Z}_+$-valued branching processes $(X^\lambda, L^\lambda)$, indexed by a parameter $\lambda \in (0, \infty)$, that satisfies an intertwining relationship with $X$ through the Poisson kernel with parameter $\lambda x$. The continuous component $X^\lambda$ has the same law as $X$, while the discrete component $L^\lambda$, conditionally on $X^\lambda_t$, has a Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda X^\lambda_t$. The law of $(X^\lambda, L^\lambda)$ depends on the position of $\lambda$ within $[0, \infty) = [0, \rho) \cup [\rho, \infty)$, where $\rho$ is the largest positive root of $\psi$. When $\lambda \geq \rho$, various well-known results concerning skeleton decompositions are recovered. In the supercritical case ($\rho &gt; 0$), when $\lambda&lt;\rho$, a novel phenomenon arises: a birth term appears in the skeleton, corresponding to a one-unit proportional immigration from the continuous to the discrete component. Along the way, the class of continuous-time branching processes taking values in $\mathbb{R}_+ \times \mathbb{Z}_+$ is constructed.</description>

      <title>Fitting regular point patterns with a hyperuniform perturbed lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new methodology for modeling regular spatial data using hyperuniform point processes. We show that, under some mixing conditions on the perturbations, perturbed lattices in general dimension are hyperuniform. Due to their inherent repulsive structure, they serve as an effective baseline model for data sets in which points exhibit repulsiveness. Specifically, we derive an explicit formula for the $K$-function of lattices perturbed by a Gaussian random field, which proves particularly useful in conjunction with the minimal contrast method. We apply this approach to a data set representing the grain centers of a polycrystalline metallic material composed of nickel and titanium.</description>

      <title>Stein's method for models with general clocks: A tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion approximations are widely used in the analysis of service systems, providing tractable insights into complex models. While heavy-traffic limit theorems justify these approximations asymptotically, they do not quantify the error when the system is not in the limit regime. This paper presents a tutorial on the generator comparison approach of Stein's method for analyzing diffusion approximations in Markovian models where state transitions are governed by general clocks, which extends the well-established theory for continuous-time Markov chains and enables non-asymptotic error bounds for these approximations. Building on recent work that applies this method to single-clock systems, we develop a framework for handling models with multiple general clocks. Our approach is illustrated through canonical queueing systems, including the G/G/1 queue, the join-the-shortest-queue system, and the tandem queue. We highlight the role of the Palm inversion formula and the compensated queue-length process in extracting the diffusion generator. Most of our error terms depend only on the first three moments of the general clock distribution. The rest require deeper, model-specific, insight to bound, but could in theory also depend on only the first three moments.</description>

      <title>On the mean exit time from a ball for a symmetric stable process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Getoor in [3] calculated the mean exit time from a ball for the standard isotropic $\alpha$-stable process in $\mathbb{R}^d$ starting from the interior of the ball. The purpose of this note is to show that, up to multplicative constant, the same formula is valid for any symmetric $\alpha$-stable process.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates for Lyapunov exponents of Milstein approximation of stochastic differential systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milstein approximation with step size $\Delta t&gt;0$ of the solution $(X, Y)$ to a two-by-two system of linear stochastic differential equations is considered. It is proved that when the solution of the underlying model is exponentially stable or exponentially blowing up at infinite time, these behaviours are preserved at the level of the Milstein approximate solution $\{(X_n, Y_n)\}$ in both the mean-square and almost-sure senses, provided sufficiently small step size $\Delta t$. This result is based on sharp estimates, from both above and below, of the discrete Lyapunov exponent in the sense that \begin{align*}
  \limsup_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n\Delta t} \log | (X_n, Y_n) | \ge \limsup_{t\to\infty} \dfrac{1}{t} \log |(X(t), Y(t))| - C(\Delta t),\\ \quad
  \limsup_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n\Delta t} \log | (X_n, Y_n) | \le \limsup_{t\to\infty} \dfrac{1}{t} \log |(X(t), Y(t))| + C(\Delta t) , \end{align*} where $C(\Delta t)$ is an infinitesimal with respect to $\Delta t\to 0$ with an explicit order. This type of sharp estimate for approximate solutions to stochastic differential equations seems to be first studied in this work. In particular, the proposed method covers the setting for linear stochastic differential equations as well as the $\theta$-Milstein scheme's setting.</description>

      <title>On minimizing curves in a Brownian potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a $(1+1)$-dimensional semi-discrete random variational problem that can be interpreted as the geometrically linearized version of the critical $2$-dimensional random field Ising model. The scaling of the correlation length of the latter was recently characterized in [11] and [12, Section 5]; our analysis is reminiscent of the multi-scale approach of that work. We show that at every dyadic scale from the system size down to the lattice spacing the minimizer contains at most order-one Dirichlet energy per unit length. To this purpose we adapt arguments from [9] on the $(d+1)$-dimensional version our the model, with a Brownian replacing the white noise potential, to obtain the initial large-scale bounds. Based on our bounds on the $(p=3)$-Dirichlet energy, we give an informal justification of the geometric linearization. Our bounds, which are oblivious to the microscopic cut-off scale provided by the lattice spacing, yield tightness of the law of minimizers in the space of continuous functions as the lattice spacing is sent to zero.</description>

      <title>Eyring-Kramers Law for the Underdamped Langevin Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the underdamped Langevin process $(q(t),p(t))_{t\geq0}$ in $\R^d\times\R^d$. We derive the low-temperature asymptotic of its mean-transition time between basins of attraction for a double-well potential. This asymptotic is called Eyring-Kramers law and often relies in the literature on Potential theory tools which are ill-defined for hypoelliptic processes like the underdamped Langevin process. In this work, we implement a novel approach which circumvents the use of these traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions of Gaussian and Laguerre Ensembles at the Soft Edge II: Level Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our work [arXiv:2403.07628] on asymptotic expansions at the soft edge for the classical $n$-dimensional Gaussian and Laguerre random matrix ensembles. By revisiting the construction of the associated skew-orthogonal polynomials in terms of wave functions, we obtain concise expressions for the level densities that are well suited for proving asymptotic expansions in powers of a certain parameter $h \asymp n^{-2/3}$. In the unitary case, the expansion for the level density can be used to reconstruct the first correction term in an established asymptotic expansion of the associated generating function. In the orthogonal and symplectic cases, we can even reconstruct the conjectured first and second correction terms.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the relationship between the capacity and the geometry for the range of the random walk for $d=3$. In particular, we consider how efficiently the random walk moves or what shape it forms in order to maximize its capacity. In one of our main results, we show a functional law for the capacity of the random walk. In addition, we find that there is a phase transition for the asymptotics of the capacity of the random walk when we condition the diameter of the random walk.</description>

Abstract: This paper treats a new type of random walk referred to as an Antlion Random Walk (ARW), which is motivated by mathematical modeling of the decision-making process using chaotic semiconductor lasers with memory parameters. We discuss the dependency of the property of the probability distribution of ARWs on the memory parameter $\alpha$ and discuss uniqueness of them in contrast to the conventional, simple RWs through similarity to the normal distribution.</description>

      <title>The Density Formula Approach for Non-reversible Isomorphism Theorems, with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical isomorphism theorems for reversible Markov chains have played an important role in studying the properties of local time processes of strongly symmetric Markov processes~\cite{mr06}, bounding the cover time of a graph by a random walk~\cite{dlp11}, and in topics related to physics such as random walk loop soups and Brownian loop soups~\cite{lt07}. Non-reversible versions of these theorems have been discovered by Le Jan, Eisenbaum, and Kaspi~\cite{lejan08, ek09, eisenbaum13}. Here, we give a density-formula-based proof for all these non-reversible isomorphism theorems, extending the results in \cite{bhs21}. Moreover, we use this method to generalize the comparison inequalities derived in \cite{eisenbaum13} for permanental processes and derive an upper bound for the cover time of non-reversible Markov chains.</description>

      <title>On reflected isotropic stable processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build two types of isotropic stable processes reflected in a strongly convex bounded domain $\mathcal{D}$. In both cases, when the process tries to jump across the boundary, it is stopped at the unique point where $\partial\mathcal{D}$ intersects the line segment defined by the attempted jump. It then leaves the boundary either continuously (for the first type) or by a power-law distributed jump (for the second type). The construction of these processes is done via an It\^o synthesis: we concatenate their excursions in the domain, which are obtained by translating, rotating and stopping the excursions of some stable processes reflected in the half-space. The key ingredient in this procedure is the construction of the boundary processes, i.e. the processes time-changed by their local time on the boundary, which solve stochastic differential equations driven by some Poisson measures of excursions. The well-posedness of these boundary processes relies on delicate estimates involving some geometric inequalities and the laws of the undershoot and overshoot of the excursion when it leaves the domain. After having constructed the processes, we show that they are Markov and Feller, we study their infinitesimal generator and write down the reflected fractional heat equations satisfied by their time-marginals.</description>

      <title>Random Bridges in Spaces of Growing Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the limiting behaviour of the path of random bridges treated as random sets in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ with the Euclidean metric and the dimension $d$ increasing to infinity. The main result states that. in the square integrable case, the limit (in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense) is deterministic, namely, it is $[0,1]$ equipped with the pseudo-metric $\sqrt{|t-s|(1-|t-s|)}$. We also show that, in the heavy-tailed case with summands regularly varying of order $\alpha \in (0,1)$, the limiting metric space has a random metric derived from the bridge variant of a subordinator.</description>

      <title>Evolution of a trait distributed over a large fragmented population: Propagation of chaos meets adaptive dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a metapopulation made up of $K$ demes, each containing $N$ individuals bearing a heritable quantitative trait. Demes are connected by migration and undergo independent Moran processes with mutation and selection based on trait values. Mutation and migration rates are tuned so that each deme receives a migrant or a mutant in the same slow timescale and is thus essentially monomorphic at all times for the trait (adaptive dynamics). In the timescale of mutation/migration, the metapopulation can then be seen as a giant spatial Moran model with size $K$ that we characterize. As $K\to \infty$ and physical space becomes continuous, the empirical distribution of the trait (over the physical and trait spaces) evolves deterministically according to an integro-differential evolution equation. In this limit, the trait of every migrant is drawn from this global distribution, so that conditional on its initial state, traits from finitely many demes evolve independently (propagation of chaos). Under mean-field dispersal, the value $X_t$ of the trait at time $t$ and at any given location has a law denoted $\mu_t$ and a jump kernel with two terms: a mutation-fixation term and a migration-fixation term involving $\mu_{t-}$ (McKean-Vlasov equation). In the limit where mutations have small effects and migration is further slowed down accordingly, we obtain the convergence of $X$, in the new migration timescale, to the solution of a stochastic differential equation which can be referred to as a new canonical equation of adaptive dynamics. This equation includes an advection term representing selection, a diffusive term due to genetic drift, and a jump term, representing the effect of migration, to a state distributed according to its own law.</description>

      <title>Simulation of infinite-dimensional diffusion bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let X be the mild solution to a semilinear stochastic partial differential equation. In this article, we develop methodology to sample from the infinite-dimensional diffusion bridge that arises from conditioning X on a linear transformation LXT of the final state XT at some time T &gt; 0. This solves a problem that has so far not been attended to in the literature. Our main contribution is the derivation of a path measure that is absolutely continuous with respect to the path measure of the infinite-dimensional diffusion bridge. This lifts previously known results for stochastic ordinary differential equations to the setting of infinite-dimensional diffusions and stochastic partial differential equations. We demonstrate our findings through numerical experiments on stochastic reaction-diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>Complex abstract Wiener spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real abstract Wiener spaces (AWS) were originally defined by Gross using measurable norms, as a generalisation of the theory of advanced integral calculus in infinite dimensions as introduced by Cameron and Martin. In this paper we present a rigorous, complete and self-contained general framework for $\mathbb{K}$-AWS, where $\mathbb{K} \in \{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\}$ using the language of characteristic functions instead of measurable norms. In particular, we will prove that $X$ is a centred resp. proper $H$-valued Gaussian field over $\mathbb{K}$ iff the covariance function can be written in terms of some non-negative, self-adjoint trace class operator, and that the existence and uniqueness of $X$ is equivalent to the $\mathbb{K}$-AWS. Finally we will relate the $\mathbb{C}$-AWS to the $\mathbb{R}$-AWS by way of a real structure, which is a real linear, complex anti-linear involution on a complex vector space. This allows for a commutative relation between the real and complex Gaussian fields and the real and complex abstract Wiener spaces. We will construct specific examples which fall under this framework like the complex Brownian motion, complex Feynman-Kac formula and complex fractional Gaussian fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study vectors chosen at random from a compact convex polytope in $\mathbb{R}^n$ given by a finite number of linear constraints. We determine which projections of these random vectors are asymptotically normal as $n\to\infty$. Marginal distributions are also studied, showing that in the large $n$ limit random variables under linear constraints become i.i.d. exponential under a rescaling. Our novel approach is based on a complex de Finetti theorem revealing an underlying independence structure as well as on entropy arguments.</description>

      <title>The New Generalized Odd Median Based Unit Rayleigh with a New Shape Oscillating Hazard Rate Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the author presents the generalized form of the Median-Based Unit Rayleigh (MBUR) distribution, a novel statistical distribution that is specifically defined within the interval (0, 1) expressing oscillating hazard rate function. This generalization adds a new parameter to the MBUR distribution that significantly addresses the unique characteristics of data represented as ratios and proportions, which are commonly encountered in various fields of research. The establishment of this generalization aims to deepen our understanding of these phenomena by providing a robust framework for analysis. The paper offers a thorough and meticulous derivation of the probability density function (PDF) for the MBUR distribution, illuminating each phase of the process with clarity and precision.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the controversy in the chess community, where Hikaru Nakamura, a renowned grandmaster, has posted multiple impressive winning streaks over the years on the online platform chess.com, we derive the probabilities of various types of streaks in online chess and/or other sports. Specifically, given the winning/drawing/losing probabilities of individual games, we derive the probabilities of "pure" winning streaks, non-losing streaks, and "in-between" streaks involving at most one draw over the course of games played in a period. The performance of the developed algorithms is examined through numerical studies.</description>

      <title>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic is a classical nonparametric test widely used for comparing an empirical distribution function with a reference distribution or for comparing two empirical distributions. Despite its broad applicability in statistical hypothesis testing and model validation, certain aspects of the KS statistic remain under-explored among the young generation, particularly under finite sample conditions. This paper revisits the KS statistic in both one-sample and two-sample scenarios, considering one-sided and two-sided variants. We derive exact probabilities for the supremum of the empirical process and present a unified treatment of the KS statistic under diverse settings. Additionally, we explore the discrete nature of the hitting times of the normalized empirical process, providing practical insights into the computation of KS test p-values. The study also discusses the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz-Massart (DKWM) inequality, highlighting its role in constructing confidence bands for distribution functions. Using empirical process theory, we establish the limit distribution of the KS statistic when the true distribution includes unknown parameters. Our findings extend existing results, offering improved methodologies for statistical analysis and hypothesis testing using the KS statistic, particularly in finite sample scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We settle two questions on sequence A120243 in the OEIS that were raised by Clark Kimberling and partly solve a conjecture of Van de Lune and Arias de Reyna. We extend Kimberling's questions to the framework of deterministic random walks, automatic sequences, and linear recurrences. Our results indicate that there may be a deeper connection between these structures. In particular, we conjecture that the records of deterministic random walks are $\xi$-Ostrowski automatic for a quadratic rotation number $\xi$.</description>

      <title>On the cutoff phenomenon for fast diffusion and porous medium equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cutoff phenomenon, conceptualized at the origin for finite Markov chains, states that for a parametric family of evolution equations, started from a point, the distance towards a long time equilibrium may become more and more abrupt for certain choices of initial conditions, when the parameter tends to infinity. This threshold phenomenon can be seen as a critical competition between trend to equilibrium and worst initial condition. In this note, we investigate this phenomenon beyond stochastic processes, in the context of the analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations, by proving cutoff for the fast diffusion and porous medium Fokker-Planck equations on the Euclidean space, when the dimension tends to infinity. We formulate the phenomenon using quadratic Wasserstein distance, as well as using specific relative entropy and Fisher information. Our high dimensional asymptotic analysis uses the exact solvability of the model involving Barenblatt profiles. It includes the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics as a special linear case.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of the largest eigenvalue for deformed GOE/GUE random matrices via replica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the probability distribution function $P(\lambda)$ of the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\rm max}$ of $N \times N$ random matrices of the form $H + V$, where $H$ belongs to the GOE/GUE ensemble and $V$ is a full rank deterministic diagonal perturbation. This model is related to spherical spin glasses and semi-discrete directed polymers. In the large $N$ limit, using the replica method introduced in Ref. \cite{TrivializationUs2014}, we obtain the rate function ${\cal L}(\lambda)$ which describes the upper large deviation tail $P(\lambda) \sim e^{- \beta N {\cal L}(\lambda) }$. We also obtain the moment generating function $\langle e^{N s {\lambda}_{\max} } \rangle \sim e^{N \phi(s)}$ and the overlap of the optimal eigenvector with the perturbation $V$. For suitable $V$, a transition generically occurs in the rate functions. For the GUE it has a direct interpretation as a localisation transition for tilted directed polymers with competing columnar and point disorder. Although in a different form, our results are consistent with those obtained recently by Mc Kenna in \cite{McKenna2021}. Finally, we consider briefly the quadratic optimisation problem in presence of an additional random field and obtain its large deviation rate function, although only within the replica symmetric phase.</description>

      <title>A stochastic maximum principle of mean-field type with monotonicity conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to weaken the Lipschitz condition to a monotonicity condition and to study the corresponding Pontryagin stochastic maximum principle (SMP) for a mean-field optimal control problem under monotonicity conditions.The dynamics of the controlled state process is governed by a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) whose coefficients depend not only on the control, the controlled state process itself but also on its law, and in particular, these coefficients satisfy the monotonicity condition with respect to both the controlled state process and its distribution. The associated cost functional is also of mean-field type. Under the assumption of a convex control domain we derive the SMP, which provides a necessary optimality condition for control processes. Under additional convexity assumptions on the Hamiltonian, we further prove that this necessary condition is also a sufficient one. To achieve this, we first address the challenges related to the existence and the uniqueness of solutions for mean-field backward stochastic differential equations and mean-field SDEs whose coefficients satisfy monotonicity conditions with respect to both the solution as well as its distribution. On the other hand we also construct several illustrative examples demonstrating the generality of our results compared to existing literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the critical probability $p_c(Q_n,r)$ for bootstrap percolation with the infection threshold $r$ on the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ with vertex set $V(Q_n)=\{0,1\}^n$ and edges connecting the pairs at Hamming distance $1$. More precisely, by utilizing the techniques developed by Balogh, Bollob{\'a}s, and Morris (2009), we determine the first-order term of $p_c(Q_n,n^a)$ where $\frac{2}{3}&lt;a&lt; 1$. Additionally, we obtain the critical probability $p_c(Q_{k,n},r)$ for bootstrap percolation with the infection threshold $r=\frac{N}{2}$ on the generalized $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_{k,n}$ with vertex set $V(Q_{k,n})=\{0,1\}^n$ and edges connecting the pairs at Hamming distance $1,2,\dots,k$, where $k\ge 2$ and $N=\sum_{i=1}^k\binom{n}{i}$. More precisely, we obtain the first-order term of $p_c(Q_{k,n},\frac{N}{2})$ and some bounds on the second-order term by extending the main theorem from Balogh, Bollob{\'a}s, and Morris (2009).</description>

Abstract: We develop a flexible technique to estimate the characters of symmetric groups, via the Murnaghan--Nakayama rule, the Larsen--Shalev character bounds, the Naruse hook length formula, and appropriate diagram slicings. This allows us to prove sharp character bounds as well as asymptotic equivalents for characters of low-level representations. We also prove an optimal uniform character bound. As a result, we prove under a mild condition on the support size that random walks on symmetric groups generated by a conjugacy class exhibit a total variation and $L^2$ cutoff and find their cutoff profiles.</description>

      <title>Estimating stationary mass, frequency by frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose we observe a trajectory of length $n$ from an $\alpha$-mixing stochastic process over a finite but potentially large state space. We consider the problem of estimating the probability mass placed by the stationary distribution of any such process on elements that occur with a certain frequency in the observed sequence. We estimate this vector of probabilities in total variation distance, showing universal consistency in $n$ and recovering known results for i.i.d. sequences as special cases. Our proposed methodology carefully combines the plug-in (or empirical) estimator with a recently-proposed modification of the Good--Turing estimator called \textsc{WingIt}, which was originally developed for Markovian sequences. En route to controlling the error of our estimator, we develop new performance bounds on \textsc{WingIt} and the plug-in estimator for $\alpha$-mixing stochastic processes. Importantly, the extensively used method of Poissonization can no longer be applied in our non i.i.d. setting, and so we develop complementary tools -- including concentration inequalities for a natural self-normalized statistic of mixing sequences -- that may prove independently useful in the design and analysis of estimators for related problems.</description>

      <title>The infimal convolution structure of the Hellinger-Kantorovich distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Hellinger-Kantorovich distance can be expressed as the metric infimal convolution of the Hellinger and the Wasserstein distances, as conjectured by Liero, Mielke, and Savar\'e. To prove it, we study with the tools of Unbalanced Optimal Transport the so called Marginal Entropy-Transport problem that arises as a single minimization step in the definition of infimal convolution. Careful estimates and results when the number of minimization steps diverges are also provided, both in the specific case of the Hellinger-Kantorovich setting and in the general one of abstract distances.</description>

      <title>An entropy penalized approach for stochastic optimization with marginal law constraints. Complete version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on stochastic optimal control problems with constraints in law, which are rewritten as optimization (minimization) of probability measures problem on the canonical space. We introduce a penalized version of this type of problems by splitting the optimization variable and adding an entropic penalization term.   We prove that this penalized version constitutes a good approximation of the original control problem and we provide an alternating procedure which converges, under a so called ''Stability Condition'', to an approximate solution of the original problem.  We extend the approach introduced in a previous paperof the same authors including a jump dynamics, non-convex costs and constraints on the marginal laws of the controlled process. The interest of our approach is illustrated by numerical simulations related to demand-side management problems arising in power systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Classical Diffusion: Fractional Derivatives in Transport and Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integer-order differential operators were originally used to describe local and isotropic effects, in both space and time. However, in fields like biology, the modelling of complex phenomena with spatial heterogeneity necessitates more advanced approaches. The fractional calculus framework provides powerful tools for developing models that better capture the intricate dynamics of biological systems. This paper derives fractional reaction-diffusion equations from continuous-time random walks, highlighting the role of heavy-tailed distributions in the process. Both fractional partial differential equations, on the macroscopic level, as well as fractional stochastic differential equations, on the microscopic level, will be derived and simulated from, for simple Riesz-fractional diffusion models. A new numerical scheme that implements periodic boundary conditions is proposed to control the loss of mass density. We highlight the key differences between fractional and classical diffusion.</description>

      <title>Beyond Propagation of Chaos: A Stochastic Algorithm for Mean Field Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient flow in the 2-Wasserstein space is widely used to optimize functionals over probability distributions and is typically implemented using an interacting particle system with $n$ particles. Analyzing these algorithms requires showing (a) that the finite-particle system converges and/or (b) that the resultant empirical distribution of the particles closely approximates the optimal distribution (i.e., propagation of chaos). However, establishing efficient sufficient conditions can be challenging, as the finite particle system may produce heavily dependent random variables.
  In this work, we study the virtual particle stochastic approximation, originally introduced for Stein Variational Gradient Descent. This method can be viewed as a form of stochastic gradient descent in the Wasserstein space and can be implemented efficiently. In popular settings, we demonstrate that our algorithm's output converges to the optimal distribution under conditions similar to those for the infinite particle limit, and it produces i.i.d. samples without the need to explicitly establish propagation of chaos bounds.</description>

      <title>Queues with inspection cost: To see or not to see?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider an M/M/1-type queue where joining attains a known reward, but a known waiting cost is paid per time unit spent queueing. In the 1960s, Naor showed that any arrival optimally joins the queue if its length is less than a known threshold. Yet acquiring knowledge of the queue length often brings an additional cost, e.g., website loading time or data roaming charge. Therefore, our model presents any arrival with three options: join blindly, balk blindly, or pay a known inspection cost to make the optimal joining decision by comparing the queue length to Naor's threshold. In a recent paper, Hassin and Roet-Green prove that a unique Nash equilibrium always exists and classify regions where the equilibrium probabilities are non-zero. We complement these findings with new closed-form expressions for the equilibrium probabilities in the majority of cases. Further, Hassin and Roet-Green show that minimizing inspection cost maximises social welfare. Envisaging a queue operator choosing where to invest, we compare the effects of lowering inspection cost and increasing the queue-joining reward on social welfare. We prove that the former dominates and that the latter can even have a detrimental effect on social welfare.</description>

      <title>Model-independent upper bounds for the price of Bermudan option with convex payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose $\mu$ and $\nu$ are probability measures on $\mathbb R$ satisfying $\mu \leq_{cx} \nu$. Let $a$ and $b$ be convex functions on $\mathbb R$ with $a \geq b \geq 0$. We are interested in finding \[ \sup_{\mathcal M} \sup_{\tau} \mathbb{E}^{\mathcal M} \left[ a(X) I_{ \{ \tau = 1 \} } + b(Y) I_{ \{ \tau = 2 \} } \right] \] where the first supremum is taken over consistent models $\mathcal M$ (i.e., filtered probability spaces $(\Omega, \mathcal F, \mathbb F, \mathbb P)$) such that $Z=(z,Z_1,Z_2)=(\int_{\mathbb R} x \mu(dx) = \int_{\mathbb R} y \nu(dy), X, Y)$ is a $(\mathbb F,\mathbb P)$ martingale, where $X$ has law $\mu$ and $Y$ has law $\nu$ under $\mathbb P$) and $\tau$ in the second supremum is a $(\mathbb F,\mathbb P)$-stopping time taking values in $\{1,2\}$.
  Our contributions are first to characterise and simplify the dual problem, and second to completely solve the problem in the symmetric case under the dispersion assumption. A key finding is that the canonical set-up in which the filtration is that generated by $Z$ is not rich enough to define an optimal model and additional randomisation is required. This holds even though the marginal laws $\mu$ and $\nu$ are atom-free.
  The problem has an interpretation of finding the robust, or model-free, no-arbitrage bound on the price of a Bermudan option with two possible exercise dates, given the prices of co-maturing European options.</description>

Abstract: Kemeny's constant quantifies the expected time for a random walk to reach a randomly chosen vertex, providing insight into the global behavior of a Markov chain. We present a novel eigenvector-based formula for computing Kemeny's constant. Moreover, we analyze the impact of network structure on Kemeny's constant. In particular, we use various spectral techniques, such as spectral sparsification of graphs and eigenvalue interlacing, and show that they are particularly useful in this context for deriving approximations and sharp bounds for Kemeny's constant</description>

Abstract: We prove limit theorems for the number of fixed points occurring in a random pattern-avoiding permutation distributed according to a one-parameter family of biased distributions. The bias parameter exponentially tilts the distribution towards favoring permutations with more or fewer fixed points than is typical under the uniform distribution. One case we study features a phase transition where the limiting distribution changes abruptly from negative binomial to Rayleigh to normal depending on the bias parameter.</description>

Abstract: Consider the mean-field spin models where the Gibbs measure of each configuration depends only on its magnetization. Based on the Stein and Laplace methods, we give a new and short proof for the scaling limit theorems with convergence rate for the magnetization in a perturbed model. As an application, we derive the scaling limit theorems for the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) in linear models. Remarkably, we characterize the full diagram of fluctuations for the magnetization and MLEs by analyzing the structure of the maximizers of a function associated with the Hamiltonian. For illustration, we apply our results to several well-known mixed spin models, as well as to the annealed Ising model on random regular graphs</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the stochastic particle method, this paper establishes an easily implementable explicit numerical method for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MV-SDEs) with super-linear growth coefficients. The paper establishes the theory on the propagation of chaos in the $L^{q}$ sense. The optimal strong convergence rate $1/2$-order of the numerical solutions is obtained for the interacting particle system by the stopping time techniques. Furthermore, it is proved that the numerical solutions capture the long-term dynamical behaviors of MV-SDEs precisely, including moment boundedness, stability, and ergodicity. Moreover, a unique numerical invariant probability measure is yielded, which converges to the underlying invariant probability measure of MV-SDEs in the $L^2$-Wasserstein distance. Finally, several numerical experiments are carried out to support the main results.</description>

      <title>Resilience of Rademacher chaos of low degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resilience of a Rademacher chaos is the maximum number of adversarial sign-flips that the chaos can sustain without having its largest atom probability significantly altered. Inspired by probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of linear Rademacher chaos, obtained by Bandeira, Ferber, and Kwan (Advances in Mathematics, Vol. $319$, $2017$), we provide probabilistic lower-bound guarantees for the resilience of Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low degree.
  Our main results distinguish between Rademacher chaos of order two and those of higher order. In that, our first main result pertains to the resilience of decoupled bilinear Rademacher forms where different asymptotic behaviour is observed for sparse and dense matrices. For our second main result, we bootstrap our first result in order to provide resilience guarantees for quadratic Rademacher chaos. Our third main result, generalises the first and handles the resilience of decoupled Rademacher chaos of arbitrary yet sufficiently low order.
  Our results for decoupled Rademacher chaos of order two and that of higher order whilst are established through the same conceptual framework, differ substantially. A difference incurred due to the implementation of the same conceptual argument. The order two result is established using Dudley's maximal inequality for sub-Gaussian processes, the Hanson-Wright inequality, as well as the Kolmogorov-Rogozin inequality. To handle higher order chaos, appeals to Dudley's inequality as well as the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with tools suited for random tensors. Appeals to the Hanson-Wright inequality are replaced with appeals to a concentration result for random tensors put forth by Adamczak and Wolff.
  Our results are instance-dependent and thus allow for the efficient computation of resilience guarantees provided the order of the chaos is constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a new derivation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a compact Riemannian manifold $M$ via the Bellman dynamic programming principle on the infinite dimensional group $SG={\rm SDiff}(M)$ of volume preserving diffeomorphisms. In particular, when the viscosity vanishes, we give a new derivation of the incompressible Euler equation on a compact Riemannian manifold. The main result of this paper indicates an interesting relationship among the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on $M$, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and the viscous Burgers equation on $SG={\rm SDiff}(M)$. This extends Arnold's famous theorem on the geometric interpretation of the incompressible Euler equation on a compact Riemannian manifold $M$ by the geodesic equation on the group $SG={\rm SDiff}(M)$ of volume preserving diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Trace Moments for Schr\"odinger Operators with Matrix White Noise and the Rigidity of the Multivariate Stochastic Airy Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the semigroups of random Schr\"odinger operators of the form $\widehat{H}f=-\frac12f''+(V+\xi)f$, where $f:I\to\mathbb F^r$ ($\mathbb F=\mathbb R,\mathbb C,\mathbb H$) are vector-valued functions on a possibly infinite interval $I\subset\mathbb R$ that satisfy a mix of Robin and Dirichlet boundary conditions, $V$ is a deterministic diagonal potential with power-law growth at infinity, and $\xi$ is a matrix white noise. Our main result consists of Feynman-Kac formulas for trace moments of the form $\mathbf E[\prod_{k=1}^n\mathrm{Tr}[\mathrm e^{-t_k\widehat{H}}]]$ ($n\in\mathbb N$, $t_k&gt;0$).
  One notable example covered by our main result consists of the multivariate stochastic Airy operator (SAO) of Bloemendal and Vir\'ag (Ann. Probab., 44(4):2726-2769, 2016), which characterizes the soft-edge eigenvalue fluctuations of critical rank-$r$ spiked Wishart and GO/U/SE random matrices. As a corollary of our main result, we prove that if $V$'s growth is at least linear (this includes the multivariate SAO), then $\widehat{H}$'s spectrum is number rigid in the sense of Ghosh and Peres (Duke Math. J., 166(10):1789-1858, 2017). Together with the rigidity of the scalar SAO, this completes the characterization of number rigidity in the soft-edge limits of Gaussian $\beta$-ensembles and their finite-rank spiked versions.</description>

      <title>Useful stochastic bounds in time-varying queues with service and patience times having general joint distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a first-come, first-served single server queue with an initial workload $x&gt;0$ and customers who arrive according to an inhomogeneous Poisson process with rate function $\lambda:[0,\infty)\rightarrow[0,\lambda_h ]$ for some $\lambda_h&gt;0$. For each $i\in\mathbb{N}$, let $S_i$ (resp., $Y_i$) be the service (resp., patience) time of the $i$'th customer and assume that $(S_1,Y_1),(S_2,Y_2),\ldots$ is an iid sequence of bivariate random vectors with non-negative coordinates. A customer joins if and only if his patience time is not less than his prospective waiting time (i.e., the left-limit of the workload process at his arrival epoch). Let $\tau(x)$ be the first time when the system becomes empty and let $N^*_\lambda(\cdot)$ be the arrival process of those who join the queue. In the present work we suggest a novel coupling technique which is applied to derive stochastic upper bounds for the functionals: \begin{equation*}
  \int_0^{\tau(x)}g\circ W_x(t){\rm d}t\ \ \text{and}\ \ \int_0^{\tau(x)}g\circ W_x(t){\rm d}N^*_\lambda(t)\,, \end{equation*} where $W_x(\cdot)$ is the workload process in the queue and $g(\cdot)$ is any lower semi-continuous function. We also demonstrate how to utilise these bounds via some examples under the additional assumption that $\lambda(\cdot)$ is periodic.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use an information-theoretic argument due to O'Connell (2000) to prove that every sufficiently symmetric event concerning a countably infinite family of independent and identically distributed random variables is deterministic (i.e., has a probability of either 0 or 1). The i.i.d. condition can be relaxed. This result encompasses the Hewitt-Savage zero-one law and the ergodicity of the Bernoulli process, but also applies to other scenarios such as infinite random graphs and simple renormalization processes.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems describing isolation by distance under varying population size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a central limit theorem for a spatial $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot model with fluctuating population size. At each reproduction, a proportion of the population dies and is replaced by a not necessarily equal mass of new individuals. The mass depends on the local population size and a function thereof. Additionally, as new individuals have a single parental type, with growing population size, events become more frequent and of smaller impact, modelling the successful reproduction of a higher number of individuals. From the central limit theorem we derive a Wright-Mal\'ecot formula quantifying the asymptotic probability of identity by descent and thus isolation by distance. The formula reflects that ancestral lineages are attracted by centres of population mass and coalesce with a rate inversely proportional to the population size. Notably, we obtain this information despite the varying population size rendering the dual process intractable.</description>

Abstract: In (J. Stat. Phys. 132, 275-290, 2008) Borodin and P\'ech\'e introduced a generalization of the extended Airy kernel based on two infinite sets of parameters. For an arbitrary choice of parameters we construct determinantal point processes on $\mathbb{R}^2$ for these generalized kernels. In addition, for a subset of the parameter space we show that the point processes can be lifted to line ensembles on $\mathbb{R}$, which satisfy the Brownian Gibbs property. Our ensembles generalize the wanderer line ensembles introduced by Corwin and Hammond in (Invent. Math. 195, 441-508, 2014).</description>

Abstract: We show that, with very high probability, the random graph Laplacian has simple spectrum. Our method provides a quantitatively effective estimate of the spectral gaps. Along the way, we establish results on affine no-gaps delocalization, no-structure delocalization, overcrowding and small entries of the eigenvectors for the Laplacian model. These findings are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for globally perturbed random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(\xi_1, \eta_1)$, $(\xi_2, \eta_2),\ldots$ be independent copies of an $\mathbb{R}^2$-valued random vector $(\xi, \eta)$ with arbitrarily dependent components. Put $T_n:= \xi_1+\ldots+\xi_{n-1} + \eta_n $ for $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and define $\tau(t) := \inf\{n\geq 1: T_n&gt;t\}$ the first passage time into $(t,\infty)$, $N(t) :=\sum_{n\geq 1}1_{\{T_n\leq t\}}$ the number of visits to $(-\infty, t]$ and $\rho(t):=\sup\{n\geq 1: T_n \leq t\}$ the associated last exit time for $t\in\mathbb{R}$. The standing assumption of the paper is $\mathbb{E}[\xi]\in (0,\infty)$. We prove a weak law of large numbers for $\tau(t)$ and strong laws of large numbers for $\tau(t)$, $N(t)$ and $\rho(t)$. The strong law of large numbers for $\tau(t)$ holds if, and only if, $\mathbb{E}[\eta^+]&lt;\infty$. In the complementary situation $\mathbb{E}[\eta^+]=\infty$ we prove functional limit theorems in the Skorokhod space for $(\tau(ut))_{u\geq 0}$, properly normalized without centering. Also, we provide sufficient conditions under which finite dimensional distributions of $(\tau(ut))_{u\geq 0}$, $(N(ut))_{u\geq 0}$ and $(\rho(ut))_{u\geq 0}$, properly normalized and centered, converge weakly as $t\to\infty$ to those of a Brownian motion. Quite unexpectedly, the centering needed for $(N(ut))$ takes in general a more complicated form than the centering $ut/\mathbb{E}[\xi]$ needed for $(\tau(ut))$ and $(\rho(ut))$. Finally, we prove a functional limit theorem in the Skorokhod space for $(N(ut))$ under optimal moment conditions.</description>

      <title>Criteria for asymptotic stability of eventually continuous Markov-Feller semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish three criteria for the asymptotic behavior of Markov-Feller semigroups. First, we present a criterion for convergence in total variation to a unique invariant measure, requiring only $TV$-eventual continuity of the semigroup at a single point. Second, we propose two new criteria for asymptotic stability that require eventual continuity at a single point. This localized condition is more practical and easier to check. To illustrate the advantages of our framework, we provide an explicit example where verifying eventual continuity at a single point is straightforward, whereas establishing the corresponding global property is challenging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a stochastic Hamiltonian system of $N$ particles with many particles interacting through a potential whose range is large in comparison with the typical distance between neighbouring particles. It is shown that the empirical measures associated to the position and velocity of the system converge to the solutions of stochastic compressible Euler equations in the limit as the particle number tends to infinity. Moreover, we quantify the distance between particles and the limit in suitable Sobolev norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit a canonical, finite dimensional solution family to certain singular SPDEs of the form \begin{equation} \left(\partial_t- \sum_{i,j=1}^d a_{i,j}(x,t) \partial_i \partial_j - \sum_{i=1}^d b_i(x,t) \partial_i - c(x,t)\right) u = F(u, \partial u, \xi) \ , \end{equation} where $a_{i,j}, b_i, c: \mathbb{T}^d\times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and $A=\{a_{i,j}\}_{i,j=1}^d$ is uniformly elliptic. More specifically, we solve the non-translation invariant g-PAM, $\phi^4_2$, $\phi^4_3$ and KPZ-equation and show that the diverging renormalisation-functions are local functions of $A$. We also establish a continuity result for the solution map with respect to the differential operator for these equations.</description>

      <title>Exact asymptotic order for generalised adaptive approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we present an abstract approach to study asymptotic orders for adaptive approximations with respect to a monotone set function $\mathfrak{J}$ defined on dyadic cubes. We determine the exact upper order in terms of the critical value of the corresponding $\mathfrak{J}$-partition function, and we are able to provide upper and lower bounds in term of fractal-geometric quantities. With properly chosen $\mathfrak{J}$, our new approach has applications in many different areas of mathematics, including the spectral theory of Krein-Feller operators, quantization dimensions of compactly supported probability measures, and the exact asymptotic order for Kolmogorov, Gelfand and linear widths for Sobolev embeddings into $L_{\mu}^p$-spaces.</description>

      <title>Learning Service Slowdown using Observational Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Being able to identify service slowdowns is crucial to many operational problems. We study how to use observational congestion data to learn service slowdown in a multi-server system that uses adaptive congestion control mechanisms. We show that a commonly used summary statistic that relies on the marginal congestion measured at individual servers can be highly inaccurate in the presence of adaptive congestion control. We propose a new statistic based on potential routing actions, and show it provides a much more robust signal for server slowdown in these settings. Unlike the marginal statistic, potential action aims to detect changes in the routing actions, and is able to uncover slowdowns even when they do not reflect in marginal congestion. Our results highlight the complexity in performing observational statistical analysis for service systems in the presence of adaptive congestion control. They also suggest that practitioners may want to combine multiple, orthogonal statistics to achieve reliable slowdown detection.</description>

      <title>On the risk levels of distributionally robust chance constrained problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the utilization of perturbed risk levels (PRLs) for the solution of chance-constrained problems via sampling-based approaches. PRLs allow the consideration of distributional ambiguity by rescaling the risk level of the nominal chance constraint. Explicit expressions of the PRL exist for some discrepancy-based ambiguity sets.
  We propose a discrepancy functional not included in previous comparisons of different PRLs based on the likelihood ratio, which we term ,,relative variation distance" (RVD). If the ambiguity set can be described by the RVD, the rescaling of the risk level with the PRL is in contrast to other discrepancy functionals possible even for very low risk levels. We derive distributionally robust one- and two-level guarantees for the solution of chance-constrained problems with randomized methods. We demonstrate the viability of the derived guarantees for a randomized MPC under distributional ambiguity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kneser--Poulsen conjecture asserts that the volume of a union of balls in Euclidean space cannot be increased by bringing their centres pairwise closer. We prove that its natural information-theoretic counterpart is true. This follows from a complete answer to a question asked in arXiv:2210.12842 about Gaussian convolutions, namely that the R\'enyi entropy comparisons between a probability measure and its contractive image are preserved when both undergo simultaneous heat flow. An inequality that unifies Costa's result on the concavity of entropy power with the entropic Kneser--Poulsen theorem is also presented.</description>

Abstract: Random walk spaces are a general framework for the study of PDEs. They include as particular cases locally finite weighted connected graphs and nonlocal settings involving symmetric integrable kernels on $\mathbb{R}^N$. We are interested in the study of evolution problems involving two random walk structures so that the associated functionals have different growth on each structure. We also deal with the case of a functional with different growth on a partition of the random walk.</description>

      <title>Gluing methods for quantitative stability of optimal transport maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish quantitative stability bounds for the quadratic optimal transport map $T_\mu$ between a fixed probability density $\rho$ and a probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Under general assumptions on $\rho$, we prove that the map $\mu\mapsto T_\mu$ is bi-H\"older continuous, with dimension-free H\"older exponents. The linearized optimal transport metric $W_{2,\rho}(\mu,\nu)=\|T_\mu-T_\nu\|_{L^2(\rho)}$ is therefore bi-H\"older equivalent to the $2$-Wasserstein distance, which justifies its use in applications.
  We show this property in the following cases: (i) for any log-concave density $\rho$ with full support in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and any log-bounded perturbation thereof; (ii) for $\rho$ bounded away from $0$ and $+\infty$ on a John domain (e.g., on a bounded Lipschitz domain), while the only previously known result of this type assumed convexity of the domain; (iii) for some important families of probability densities on bounded domains which decay or blow-up polynomially near the boundary. Concerning the sharpness of point (ii), we also provide examples of non-John domains for which the Brenier potentials do not satisfy any H\"older stability estimate.
  Our proofs rely on local variance inequalities for the Brenier potentials in small convex subsets of the support of $\rho$, which are glued together to deduce a global variance inequality. This gluing argument is based on two different strategies of independent interest: one of them leverages the properties of the Whitney decomposition in bounded domains, the other one relies on spectral graph theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of free denoising. For free selfadjoint random variables $a,b$, where we interpret $a$ as a signal and $b$ as noise, we find $E(a|a+b)$. To that end, we study a probability measure $\mu^{( \mathrm{ov} )}_{a,a+b}$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ which we call the overlap measure. We show that $\mu^{( \mathrm{ov} )}_{a,a+b}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the product measure $\mu_a\times \mu_{a+b}$. The Radon-Nikodym derivative gives direct access to $E(a|a+b)$. We show that analogous results hold in the case of multiplicative noise when $a,b$ are positive and the aim is to find $E(a|a^{1/2}ba^{1/2})$. In a parallel development we show that, for a general selfadjoint expression $P(a,b)$ made with $a$ and $b$, finding $E(a|P(a,b))$ is equivalent to finding the distribution of $P(a,b)$ in a certain two-state probability space $(\mathcal{A},\varphi,\chi)$, where $a,b$ are c-free with respect to $(\varphi,\chi)$ in the sense of Bo\.zejko-Leinert-Speicher. We discuss how free denoising (which is set in the framework of an abstract $W^{*}$-probability space) relates to the notion of ''matrix denoising'' previously discussed in the random matrix literature.</description>

      <title>Rough Stochastic Pontryagin Maximum Principle and an Indirect Shooting Method</title>

Abstract: We derive first-order Pontryagin optimality conditions for stochastic optimal control with deterministic controls for systems modeled by rough differential equations (RDE) driven by Gaussian rough paths. This Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) applies to systems following stochastic differential equations (SDE) driven by Brownian motion, yet it does not rely on forward-backward SDEs and involves the same Hamiltonian as the deterministic PMP. The proof consists of first deriving various integrable error bounds for solutions to nonlinear and linear RDEs by leveraging recent results on Gaussian rough paths. The PMP then follows using standard techniques based on needle-like variations. As an application, we propose the first indirect shooting method for nonlinear stochastic optimal control and show that it converges 10x faster than a direct method on a stabilization task.</description>
