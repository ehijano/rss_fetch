      <title>Low-distortion planar embedding of rod-based structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rod-based structures are commonly used in practical applications in science and engineering. However, in many design, analysis, and manufacturing tasks, handling the rod-based structures in three dimensions directly is generally challenging. To simplify the tasks, it is usually more desirable to achieve a two-dimensional representation of the rod-based structures via some suitable geometric mappings. In this work, we develop a novel method for computing a low-distortion planar embedding of rod-based structures. Specifically, we identify geometrical constraints that aim to preserve key length and angle quantities of the 3D rod-based structures and prevent the occurrence of overlapping rods in the planar embedding. Experimental results with a variety of rod-based structures are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, our method can be naturally extended to the design and mapping of hybrid structures consisting of both rods and surface elements. Altogether, our approach paves a new way for the efficient design and fabrication of novel three-dimensional geometric structures for practical applications.</description>

      <title>The Presort Hierarchy for Geometric Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many fundamental problems in computational geometry admit no algorithm running in $o(n \log n)$ time for $n$ planar input points, via classical reductions from sorting. Prominent examples include the computation of convex hulls, quadtrees, onion layer decompositions, Euclidean minimum spanning trees, KD-trees, Voronoi diagrams, and decremental closest-pair.
  A classical result shows that, given $n$ points sorted along a single direction, the convex hull can be constructed in linear time. Subsequent works established that for all of the other above problems, this information does not suffice. In 1989, Aggarwal, Guibas, Saxe, and Shor asked: Under which conditions can a Voronoi diagram be computed in $o(n \log n)$ time? Since then, the question of whether sorting along TWO directions enables a $o(n \log n)$-time algorithm for such problems has remained open and has been repeatedly mentioned in the literature.
  In this paper, we introduce the Presort Hierarchy: A problem is 1-Presortable if, given a sorting along one axis, it permits a (possibly randomised) $o(n \log n)$-time algorithm. It is 2-Presortable if sortings along both axes suffice. It is Presort-Hard otherwise. Our main result is that quadtrees, and by extension Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, and Euclidean minimum spanning trees, are 2-Presortable: we present an algorithm with expected running time $O(n \sqrt{\log n})$. This addresses the longstanding open problem posed by Aggarwal, Guibas, Saxe, and Shor (albeit randomised). We complement this result by showing that some of the other above geometric problems are also 2-Presortable or Presort-Hard.</description>

      <title>Welfarist Formulations for Diverse Similarity Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) is a fundamental problem in data structures with wide-ranging applications, such as web search, recommendation systems, and, more recently, retrieval-augmented generations (RAG). In such recent applications, in addition to the relevance (similarity) of the returned neighbors, diversity among the neighbors is a central requirement. In this paper, we develop principled welfare-based formulations in NNS for realizing diversity across attributes. Our formulations are based on welfare functions -- from mathematical economics -- that satisfy central diversity (fairness) and relevance (economic efficiency) axioms. With a particular focus on Nash social welfare, we note that our welfare-based formulations provide objective functions that adaptively balance relevance and diversity in a query-dependent manner. Notably, such a balance was not present in the prior constraint-based approach, which forced a fixed level of diversity and optimized for relevance. In addition, our formulation provides a parametric way to control the trade-off between relevance and diversity, providing practitioners with flexibility to tailor search results to task-specific requirements. We develop efficient nearest neighbor algorithms with provable guarantees for the welfare-based objectives. Notably, our algorithm can be applied on top of any standard ANN method (i.e., use standard ANN method as a subroutine) to efficiently find neighbors that approximately maximize our welfare-based objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is practical and substantially improves diversity while maintaining high relevance of the retrieved neighbors.</description>

      <title>VedicTHG: Symbolic Vedic Computation for Low-Resource Talking-Head Generation in Educational Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Talking-head avatars are increasingly adopted in educational technology to deliver content with social presence and improved engagement. However, many recent talking-head generation (THG) methods rely on GPU-centric neural rendering, large training sets, or high-capacity diffusion models, which limits deployment in offline or resource-constrained learning environments. A deterministic and CPU-oriented THG framework is described, termed Symbolic Vedic Computation, that converts speech to a time-aligned phoneme stream, maps phonemes to a compact viseme inventory, and produces smooth viseme trajectories through symbolic coarticulation inspired by Vedic sutra Urdhva Tiryakbhyam. A lightweight 2D renderer performs region-of-interest (ROI) warping and mouth compositing with stabilization to support real-time synthesis on commodity CPUs. Experiments report synchronization accuracy, temporal stability, and identity consistency under CPU-only execution, alongside benchmarking against representative CPU-feasible baselines. Results indicate that acceptable lip-sync quality can be achieved while substantially reducing computational load and latency, supporting practical educational avatars on low-end hardware.

      <title>MotionCrafter: Dense Geometry and Motion Reconstruction with a 4D VAE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MotionCrafter, a video diffusion-based framework that jointly reconstructs 4D geometry and estimates dense motion from a monocular video. The core of our method is a novel joint representation of dense 3D point maps and 3D scene flows in a shared coordinate system, and a novel 4D VAE to effectively learn this representation. Unlike prior work that forces the 3D value and latents to align strictly with RGB VAE latents-despite their fundamentally different distributions-we show that such alignment is unnecessary and leads to suboptimal performance. Instead, we introduce a new data normalization and VAE training strategy that better transfers diffusion priors and greatly improves reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that MotionCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in both geometry reconstruction and dense scene flow estimation, delivering 38.64% and 25.0% improvements in geometry and motion reconstruction, respectively, all without any post-optimization.

      <title>Sometimes Two Irrational Guards are Needed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01211v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the art gallery problem, we are given a closed polygon $P$, with rational coordinates and an integer $k$. We are asked whether it is possible to find a set (of guards) $G$ of size $k$ such that any point $p\in P$ is seen by a point in $G$. We say two points $p$, $q$ see each other if the line segment $pq$ is contained inside $P$. It was shown by Abrahamsen, Adamaszek, and Miltzow that there is a polygon that can be guarded with three guards, but requires four guards if the guards are required to have rational coordinates. In other words, an optimal solution of size three might need to be irrational. We show that an optimal solution of size two might need to be irrational. Note that it is well-known that any polygon that can be guarded with one guard has an optimal guard placement with rational coordinates. Hence, our work closes the gap on when irrational guards are possible to occur.</description>

      <title>Maximal Distortion of Geodesic Diameters in Polygonal Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a polygon $P$ with holes in the plane, we denote by $\varrho(P)$ the ratio between the geodesic and the Euclidean diameters of $P$. It is shown that over all convex polygons with $h$~convex holes, the supremum of $\varrho(P)$ is between $\Omega(h^{1/3})$ and $O(h^{1/2})$. The upper bound improves to $\varrho(P)\leq O(1+\min\{h^{3/4}\Delta,h^{1/2}\Delta^{1/2}\})$ if the Euclidean diameter of every hole is most $\Delta$ times the Euclidean diameter of $P$; and to $O(1)$ if every hole is a \emph{fat} convex polygon. Furthermore, we show that the function $g(h)=\sup_P \varrho(P)$ over convex polygons with $h$ convex holes has the same growth rate as an analogous quantity over geometric triangulations with $h$ vertices when $h\rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of the free space of a translating box in R^3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a convex polyhedral robot $B$ that can translate (without rotating) amidst a finite set of non-moving polyhedral obstacles in $\mathbb R^3$. The "free space" $\mathcal F$ of $B$ is the set of all positions in which $B$ is disjoint from the interior of every obstacle.
  Aronov and Sharir (1997) derived an upper bound of $O(n^2\log n)$ for the combinatorial complexity of $\mathcal F$, where $n$ is the total number of vertices of the obstacles, and the complexity of $B$ is assumed constant.
  Halperin and Yap (1993) showed that, if $B$ is either a box or a "flat" convex polygon, then a tighter bound of $O(n^2\alpha(n))$ holds. Here $\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann function.
  In this paper we prove that if $B$ is a box, then the complexity of $\mathcal F$ is $O(n^2)$. Furthermore, if $B$ is a convex polygon whose edges come in parallel pairs, then the complexity of $\mathcal F$ is $O(n^2)$ as well. These results settle the question of the asymptotical worst-case complexity of $\mathcal F$ for a box, as well as for all convex polygons.</description>

      <title>Partitioning Regular Polygons into Circular Pieces I: Convex Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0304023</link>
      <description>arXiv:cs/0304023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore an instance of the question of partitioning a polygon into pieces, each of which is as ``circular'' as possible, in the sense of having an aspect ratio close to 1. The aspect ratio of a polygon is the ratio of the diameters of the smallest circumscribing circle to the largest inscribed disk. The problem is rich even for partitioning regular polygons into convex pieces, the focus of this paper. We show that the optimal (most circular) partition for an equilateral triangle has an infinite number of pieces, with the lower bound approachable to any accuracy desired by a particular finite partition. For pentagons and all regular k-gons, k &gt; 5, the unpartitioned polygon is already optimal. The square presents an interesting intermediate case. Here the one-piece partition is not optimal, but nor is the trivial lower bound approachable. We narrow the optimal ratio to an aspect-ratio gap of 0.01082 with several somewhat intricate partitions.</description>

      <title>The Structural Complexity of Matrix-Vector Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of preprocessing an $n\times n$ matrix $\mathbf{M}$, and supporting queries that, for any vector $v$, returns the matrix-vector product $\mathbf{M} v$. This problem has been extensively studied in both theory and practice: on one side, practitioners have developed algorithms that are highly efficient in practice, whereas on the other side, theoreticians have proven that the problem cannot be solved faster than naive multiplication in the worst-case. This lower bound holds even in the average-case, implying that existing average-case analyses cannot explain this gap between theory and practice. Hence, we study the problem for \emph{structured} matrices. We show that for $n\times n$ Boolean matrices of VC-dimension $d$, the matrix-vector multiplication problem can be solved with $\widetilde{O}(n^2)$ preprocessing and $\widetilde{O}(n^{2-1/d})$ query time. Given the low constant VC-dimensions observed in most real-world data, our results posit an explanation for why the problem can be solved so much faster in practice. Furthermore, we show how to extend this result to the non-Boolean setting with the Pollard pseudodimension.
  Our results yield the first non-trivial upper bounds for many applications. In previous works, the online matrix-vector (OMv) hypothesis (conjecturing that quadratic time is needed per query, even over the boolean semi-ring) was used to prove many conditional lower bounds, showing that it is impossible to compute and maintain high-accuracy estimates for effective resistance, Laplacian solvers, shortest paths, and triangle detection in graphs subject to node insertions and deletions in subquadratic time. Yet, via a reduction to our matrix-vector multiplication result, we show we can maintain these problems efficiently if the input is structured, providing the first subquadratic upper bounds in the high-accuracy regime.</description>

      <title>Universal Solvability for Robot Motion Planning on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Universal Solvability of Robot Motion Planning on Graphs (USolR) problem: given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ and $p$ robots, determine whether any arbitrary configuration of the robots can be transformed into any other arbitrary configuration via a sequence of valid, collision-free moves. We design a canonical accumulation procedure that maps arbitrary configurations to configurations that occupy a fixed subset of vertices, enabling us to analyze configuration reachability in terms of equivalence classes. We prove that in instances that are not universally solvable, at least half of all configurations are unreachable from a given one, and leverage this to design an efficient randomized algorithm with one-sided error, which can be derandomized with a blow-up in the running time by a factor of $p$. Further, we optimize our deterministic algorithm by using the structure of the input graph $G = (V, E)$, achieving a running time of $\mathcal{O}(p \cdot (|V| + |E|))$ in sparse graphs and $\mathcal{O}(|V| + |E|)$ in dense graphs. Finally, we consider the Graph Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (EAUS) problem, where given a connected graph $G$ that is not universally solvable for $p$ robots, the question is to check if for a given budget $b$, at most $b$ edges can be added to $G$ to make it universally solvable for $p$ robots. We provide an upper bound of $p - 2$ on $b$ for general graphs. On the other hand, we also provide examples of graphs that require $\Theta(p)$ edges to be added. We further study the Graph Vertex and Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (VEAUS) problem, where $a$ vertices and $b$ edges can be added, and we provide lower bounds on $a$ and $b$.</description>

      <title>Uncrossed Multiflows and Applications to Disjoint Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multiflow in a planar graph is uncrossed if its support paths do not cross. Recently such flows played a role in approximation algorithms for maximum disjoint paths in "fully-planar" instances, where the combined supply-demand graph is planar, as well as low-congestion unsplittable flows for fully-planar and single-source instances.
  We expand on the theory of uncrossed flows to investigate their utility more generally. We ask three key questions. First, are there other interesting planar multiflow instances that admit uncrossed flows? We answer affirmatively, demonstrating a new family of "pairwise-planar" instances whose flows can be uncrossed. This family subsumes fully-planar but includes substantially more, such as fully-compliant series-parallel instances, and has instances with clique demand graphs. Second, given a fractional uncrossed flow, can we always round it to a "good" integral flow? We again answer positively. For maximization problems (where we maximize the total amount of flow), we obtain integral flows with a constant fraction of the original value. For congestion problems (where we fully route specific given demands), we obtain integral flows with edge congestion 2, or unsplittable flows with an additional additive error. As a consequence we obtain approximation algorithms for maximum disjoint paths and minimum congestion integer multiflow for pairwise-planar instances.
  Finally, given a planar multiflow instance, can we determine if there exists a congestion 1 uncrossed fractional flow (congestion) or find the highest value uncrossed fractional flow (maximization)? For the congestion model, we show this is NP-hard, but finding uncrossed edge-disjoint paths is polytime solvable if the demands span a bounded number of faces. For the maximization model, we present a strong inapproximability result.</description>
