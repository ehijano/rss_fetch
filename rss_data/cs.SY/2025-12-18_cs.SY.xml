      <title>Assessing the Frequency Response Potential of Heavy-Duty Electric Vehicles with Vehicle-to-Grid Integration in the California Power System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of heavy-duty electric vehicles (EVs) with Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) capability can enhance primary frequency response and improve stability in power systems with high renewable penetration. This study evaluates the technical potential of heavy-duty EV fleets to support the California power grid under three practical charging strategies: immediate charging, delayed charging, and constant-minimum-power charging. We develop a simulation framework that couples aggregated frequency dynamics with battery and charger constraints, state-of-charge management, and fleet-availability profiles. Performance is assessed using standard frequency security metrics, including nadir, rate-of-change-of-frequency, overshoot, and settling time, across credible contingency scenarios and renewable generation conditions. Results indicate that both non-V2G modes and V2G-enabled operation can contribute meaningful primary response, with V2G providing the strongest and fastest support while respecting mobility and network limits. Sensitivity analyses show that the relative benefits depend on charging strategy, control parameters, and renewable output, highlighting design trade-offs between response magnitude, duration, and battery usage. Overall, heavy-duty EV fleets-when coordinated by appropriate charging and V2G controls-offer a viable resource for strengthening primary frequency control on the California grid and mitigating stability challenges associated with increasing renewable penetration.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Sensor Node Localization for Achieving Sustainable Smart Agriculture System Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The innovative agriculture system is revolutionizing how we farm, making it one of the most critical innovations of our time! Yet it faces significant connectivity challenges, particularly with the sensors that power this technology. An efficient sensor deployment solution is still required to maximize the network's detection capabilities and efficiency while minimizing resource consumption and operational costs. This paper introduces an innovative sensor allocation optimization method that employs a Gradient-Based Iteration with Lagrange. The proposed method enhances coverage by utilizing a hybrid approach while minimizing the number of sensor nodes required under grid-based allocation. The proposed sensor distribution outperformed the classic deterministic deployment across coverage, number of sensors, cost, and power consumption. Furthermore, scalability is enhanced by extending sensing coverage to the remaining area via Bluetooth, which has a shorter communication range. Moreover, the proposed algorithm achieved 98.5% wireless sensor coverage, compared with 95% for the particle swarm distribution.</description>

      <title>Intertemporal Hedging Demand under Epstein-Zin Preferences in a Multi-Asset Long-Run Risk Model: Evidence from Projected Pontryagin-Guided Deep Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study intertemporal hedging demand in a continuous-time multi-asset long-run risk (LRR) model under Epstein--Zin (EZ) recursive preferences. The investor trades a risk-free asset and several risky assets whose drifts and volatilities depend on an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck type LRR factor. Preferences are described by EZ utility with risk aversion $R$, elasticity of intertemporal substitution $\psi$, and discount rate $\delta$, so that the standard time-additive CRRA case appears as a limiting benchmark.
  To handle the high-dimensional consumption--investment problem, I use a projected Pontryagin-guided deep policy optimization (P-PGDPO) scheme adapted to EZ preferences. The method starts from the continuous-time Hamiltonian implied by the Pontryagin maximum principle, represents the value and costate processes with neural networks, and updates the policy along the Hamiltonian gradient. Portfolio constraints and a lower bound on wealth are enforced by explicit projection operators rather than by adding ad hoc penalties.
  Three main findings emerge from numerical experiments in a five-asset LRR economy: \textbf{(1)} the P-PGDPO algorithm achieves stable convergence across multiple random seeds, validating its reliability for solving high-dimensional EZ problems; \textbf{(2)} wealth floors materially reduce hedging demand by limiting the investor's ability to exploit intertemporal risk-return tradeoffs; and \textbf{(3)} the learned hedging portfolios concentrate exposure in assets with high correlation to the LRR factor, confirming that EZ agents actively hedge long-run uncertainty rather than merely following myopic rules. Because EZ preferences nest time-additive CRRA in the limit $\psi \to 1/R$, I use CRRA as an explicit diagnostic benchmark and, when needed, a warm start to stabilize training in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Remote Magnetic Levitation Using Reduced Attitude Control and Parametric Field Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic navigation systems (eMNS) are increasingly used in minimally invasive procedures such as endovascular interventions and targeted drug delivery due to their ability to generate fast and precise magnetic fields. In this paper, we utilize the OctoMag eMNS to achieve remote levitation and control of a rigid body across large air gaps which showcases the dynamic capabilities of clinical eMNS. A compact parametric analytical model maps coil currents to the forces and torques acting on the levitating object, eliminating the need for computationally expensive simulations or lookup tables and leading to a levitator agnostic modeling approach. Translational motion is stabilized using linear quadratic regulators. A nonlinear time-invariant controller is used to regulate the reduced attitude accounting for the inherent uncontrollability of rotations about the dipole axis and stabilizing the full five degrees of freedom controllable pose subspace. We analyze key design limitations and evaluate the approach through trajectory tracking experiments. This work demonstrates the dynamic capabilities and potential of feedback control in electromagnetic navigation, which is likely to open up new medical applications.</description>

      <title>Consensus-based formation of a swarm of quadrotors interacting over ring digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a cooperative strategy for a group of quadrotors interacting over ring digraphs with macro-vertices of size two. Consensus for a group of general double integrators has been initially investigated, and it has been proved that through a suitable choice of a single controller parameter, consensus and stability of the resulting networked dynamical system can be ensured. This further opens up the possibility of achieving a desired formation and to move a swarm of quadrotors, interacting over ring digraphs, at a desired flight velocity, using a single controller gain. An analysis of achievable velocities is performed. Examples have been provided to offer deeper insights into the obtained analytical results. Simulation studies clearly demonstrate that a desired formation is achieved, starting from arbitrary initial positions, while also ensuring convergence to a final desired flight velocity.</description>

      <title>Ising Machines for Model Predictive Path Integral-Based Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) method that implements Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) as an \emph{Ising machine}, suitable for novel forms of probabilistic computing. By expressing the control problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, we map MPC onto an energy landscape suitable for Gibbs sampling from an Ising model. This formulation enables efficient exploration of (near-)optimal control trajectories. We demonstrate that the approach achieves accurate trajectory tracking compared to a reference MPPI implementation, highlighting the potential of Ising-based MPPI for real-time control in robotics and autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Scheduling the Charge of Temporally Flexible Electric Vehicles: a Market-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing electrification of human activities and the rapid integration of variable renewable energy sources strain the power grid. A solution to address the need for more grid storage is to use the battery of electric vehicles as a back-up capacity. However, drivers tend to disconnect their electric vehicle when its battery is needed the most. We propose a charge scheduler that incentivizes drivers to delay their disconnection to improve vehicle-to-grid services. We also leverage drivers' temporal flexibility to alleviate congestion in oversubscribed charging stations. We formulate the computation of an optimal flexible schedule as a mixed-integer quadratic problem. We tractably approximate its solution using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. Considering the possibility that strategic drivers misreport their charging preferences to the station coordinator, we then propose a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism that incentivizes truthful reporting. We conclude with a simulated case study using real-world data to quantitatively assess the added value of drivers' temporal flexibility for enhancing vehicle-to-grid services and reducing station congestion.</description>

      <title>Operator-Theoretic Joint Estimation of Aging-Aware State of Charge and Control-Informed State of Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of a battery's state of charge and state of health is essential for safe and reliable battery management. Existing approaches often decouple these two states, lack stability guarantees, and exhibit limited generalization across operating conditions. This study introduces a unified operator-theoretic framework for aging-aware state of charge and control-informed state of health estimation. The architecture couples a Koopman-based latent dynamics model, which enables linear forecasting of nonlinear discharge-capacity evolution under varying operational conditions, with a neural operator that maps measurable intra-cycle signals to state of charge. The predicted discharge capacity is incorporated as a static correction within the neural operator pathway, yielding an age-aware state of charge estimate. Stability is ensured through spectral-radius clipping of the Koopman operator. The overall framework is trained end-to-end and evaluated on real-world lithium-ion battery datasets, demonstrating real-time capability while maintaining stable dynamics. To handle condition shifts and unseen regimes, the method integrates both zero-shot and few-shot out-of-distribution adaptation using only a limited number of cycles. Results show accurate and stable capacity forecasts, competitive state of charge trajectories on held-out cycles, and a direct, model-consistent mechanism for tracking capacity fade as a surrogate for state of health across diverse operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing industrial microalgae production through Economic Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The industrial production of microalgae is an important and sustainable process, but its actual competitiveness is closely related to its optimization. The biological nature of the process hinders this task, mainly due to the high nonlinearity of the process along with its changing nature, features that make its modeling, control and optimization remarkably challenging. This paper presents an economic optimization framework aiming to enhance the operation of such systems. An Economic Model Predictive Controller is proposed, centralizing the decision making and achieving the theoretical optimal operation. Different scenarios with changing climate conditions are presented, and a comparison with the typical, non-optimized industrial process operation is established. The obtained results achieve economic optimization and dynamic stability of the process, while providing some insight into the priorities during process operation at industrial level, and justifying the use of optimal controllers over traditional operation.</description>

      <title>Service-Oriented Fast Frequency Response from Flexible Loads and Energy Storage in Low-Inertia Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of inverter-based renewable generation has significantly reduced system inertia, making modern power grids more vulnerable to rapid frequency deviations following disturbances. While a wide range of flexible resources-including electric vehicles (EVs), data centers, and battery energy storage systems (BESS)-have demonstrated the physical capability to provide fast frequency response (FFR), existing studies primarily focus on individual resource performance or controller-level designs. A systematic framework that translates heterogeneous FFR capabilities into deployable, system-level frequency services remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a service-oriented coordination framework for fast frequency response from flexible loads and energy storage, bridging the gap between physical capability assessment and grid-operational utilization. The framework decomposes frequency support into multiple time-critical service layers based on response speed, power capacity, and energy sustainability, and dynamically allocates FFR responsibilities among heterogeneous resources accordingly. By explicitly accounting for response latency, saturation limits, and energy constraints, the proposed approach enables coordinated dispatch that prioritizes ultra-fast resources for initial frequency arrest while leveraging slower but energy-rich resources to sustain recovery.</description>

      <title>Compensation of Coarse Quantization Effects on Channel Estimation and BER in Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-resolution quantization is essential to reduce implementation cost and power consumption in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems for 5G and 6G. While most existing studies assume perfect channel state information (CSI), we model the impact of coarse quantization noise on both channel estimation and data transmission, yielding a more realistic assessment of system performance under imperfect CSI conditions in the uplink. We develop a tight approximation for the bit-error ratio (BER) of uncoded M-QAM with zero-forcing detection, based on the linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) channel estimate. These analytical results enable compensation strategies that jointly optimize quantization resolution, transmit power, and pilot length across different numbers of users and base station antennas. We further demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework through several design scenarios that highlight its effectiveness in optimizing system parameters and improving energy efficiency under quantization constraints. For example, in a 16-QAM system, extending the pilot sequence by 2.5 times and lowering transmit power by 0.5 dB enables a 3-bit quantized system to match the BER of the full-resolution case. The proposed framework offers a fast and accurate alternative to Monte Carlo simulations, enabling practical system optimization under realistic quantization constraints.</description>

      <title>Restless Multi-Process Multi-Armed Bandits with Applications to Self-Driving Microscopies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-content screening microscopy generates large amounts of live-cell imaging data, yet its potential remains constrained by the inability to determine when and where to image most effectively. Optimally balancing acquisition time, computational capacity, and photobleaching budgets across thousands of dynamically evolving regions of interest remains an open challenge, further complicated by limited field-of-view adjustments and sensor sensitivity. Existing approaches either rely on static sampling or heuristics that neglect the dynamic evolution of biological processes, leading to inefficiencies and missed events. Here, we introduce the restless multi-process multi-armed bandit (RMPMAB), a new decision-theoretic framework in which each experimental region is modeled not as a single process but as an ensemble of Markov chains, thereby capturing the inherent heterogeneity of biological systems such as asynchronous cell cycles and heterogeneous drug responses. Building upon this foundation, we derive closed-form expressions for transient and asymptotic behaviors of aggregated processes, and design scalable Whittle index policies with sub-linear complexity in the number of imaging regions. Through both simulations and a real biological live-cell imaging dataset, we show that our approach achieves substantial improvements in throughput under resource constraints. Notably, our algorithm outperforms Thomson Sampling, Bayesian UCB, epsilon-Greedy, and Round Robin by reducing cumulative regret by more than 37% in simulations and capturing 93% more biologically relevant events in live imaging experiments, underscoring its potential for transformative smart microscopy. Beyond improving experimental efficiency, the RMPMAB framework unifies stochastic decision theory with optimal autonomous microscopy control, offering a principled approach to accelerate discovery across multidisciplinary sciences.</description>

      <title>EMFusion: Conditional Diffusion Framework for Trustworthy Frequency Selective EMF Forecasting in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth in wireless infrastructure has increased the need to accurately estimate and forecast electromagnetic field (EMF) levels to ensure ongoing compliance, assess potential health impacts, and support efficient network planning. While existing studies rely on univariate forecasting of wideband aggregate EMF data, frequency-selective multivariate forecasting is needed to capture the inter-operator and inter-frequency variations essential for proactive network planning. To this end, this paper introduces EMFusion, a conditional multivariate diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting framework that integrates diverse contextual factors (e.g., time of day, season, and holidays) while providing explicit uncertainty estimates. The proposed architecture features a residual U-Net backbone enhanced by a cross-attention mechanism that dynamically integrates external conditions to guide the generation process. Furthermore, EMFusion integrates an imputation-based sampling strategy that treats forecasting as a structural inpainting task, ensuring temporal coherence even with irregular measurements. Unlike standard point forecasters, EMFusion generates calibrated probabilistic prediction intervals directly from the learned conditional distribution, providing explicit uncertainty quantification essential for trustworthy decision-making. Numerical experiments conducted on frequency-selective EMF datasets demonstrate that EMFusion with the contextual information of working hours outperforms the baseline models with or without conditions. The EMFusion outperforms the best baseline by 23.85% in continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), 13.93% in normalized root mean square error, and reduces prediction CRPS error by 22.47%.</description>

      <title>Historical Information Accelerates Decentralized Optimization: A Proximal Bundle Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historical information, such as past function values or gradients, has significant potential to enhance decentralized optimization methods for two key reasons: first, it provides richer information about the objective function, which also explains its established success in centralized optimization; second, unlike the second-order derivative or its alternatives, historical information has already been computed or communicated and requires no additional cost to acquire. Despite this potential, it remains underexploited. In this work, we employ a proximal bundle framework to incorporate the function values and gradients at historical iterates and adapt the framework to the proximal decentralized gradient descent method, resulting in a Decentralized Proximal Bundle Method (DPBM). To broaden its applicability, we further extend DPBM to the asynchronous and stochastic setting. We theoretically analysed the convergence of the proposed methods. Notably, both the asynchronous DPBM and its stochastic variant can converge with fixed step-sizes that are independent of delays, which is superior to the delay-dependent step-sizes required by most existing asynchronous optimization methods, as it is easier to determine and often leads to faster convergence. Numerical experiments on classification problems demonstrate that by using historical information, our methods yield faster convergence and stronger robustness in the step-sizes.</description>

      <title>Remotely Detectable Robot Policy Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of machine learning for real-world robotic systems has created a new form of intellectual property: the trained policy. This raises a critical need for novel methods that verify ownership and detect unauthorized, possibly unsafe misuse. While watermarking is established in other domains, physical policies present a unique challenge: remote detection. Existing methods assume access to the robot's internal state, but auditors are often limited to external observations (e.g., video footage). This ``Physical Observation Gap'' means the watermark must be detected from signals that are noisy, asynchronous, and filtered by unknown system dynamics. We formalize this challenge using the concept of a \textit{glimpse sequence}, and introduce Colored Noise Coherency (CoNoCo), the first watermarking strategy designed for remote detection. CoNoCo embeds a spectral signal into the robot's motions by leveraging the policy's inherent stochasticity. To show it does not degrade performance, we prove CoNoCo preserves the marginal action distribution. Our experiments demonstrate strong, robust detection across various remote modalities, including motion capture and side-way/top-down video footage, in both simulated and real-world robot experiments. This work provides a necessary step toward protecting intellectual property in robotics, offering the first method for validating the provenance of physical policies non-invasively, using purely remote observations.</description>

      <title>Lithium-ion battery degradation: Introducing the concept of reservoirs to design for lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing lithium-ion batteries for long service life remains a challenge, as most cells are optimized for beginning-of-life metrics such as energy density, often overlooking how design and operating conditions shape degradation. This work introduces a degradation-aware design framework built around finite, interacting reservoirs (lithium, porosity, and electrolyte) that are depleted over time by coupled degradation processes.
  We extend a physics-based Doyle-Fuller-Newman model to include validated mechanisms such as SEI growth, lithium plating, cracking, and solvent dry-out, and simulate how small design changes impact lifetime. Across more than 1,000 cycles, we find that increasing electrolyte volume by just 1% or porosity by 5% can extend service life by over 30% without significantly affecting cell energy density. However, lithium excess, while boosting initial capacity, can accelerate failure if not supported by sufficient structural or ionic buffers.
  Importantly, we show that interaction between reservoirs is crucial to optimal design: multi-reservoir tuning yields either synergistic benefits or compound failures, depending on operating conditions. We also quantify how C-rate and operating temperature influence degradation pathways, emphasizing the need for co-optimized design and usage profiles.
  By reframing degradation as a problem of managing finite internal reservoirs, this work offers a predictive and mechanistic foundation for designing lithium-ion batteries that balance energy, durability, and application-specific needs.</description>

      <title>A Container-based Approach For Proactive Asset Administration Shell Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In manufacturing, digital twins, realized as Asset Administration Shells (AAS), have emerged as a prevalent practice. These digital replicas, often utilized as structured repositories of asset-related data, facilitate interoperability across diverse systems. However, extant approaches treat the AAS as a static information model, lacking support for dynamic service integration and system adaptation. The existing body of literature has not yet thoroughly explored the potential for integrating executable behavior, particularly in the form of containerized services, into or from the AAS. This integration could serve to enable proactive functionality. In this paper, we propose a submodel-based architecture that introduces a structured service notion to the AAS, enabling services to dynamically interact with and adapt AAS instances at runtime. This concept is implemented through the extension of a submodel with behavioral definitions, resulting in a modular event-driven architecture capable of deploying containerized services based on embedded trigger conditions. The approach is illustrated through a case study on a 3-axis milling machine. Our contribution enables the AAS to serve not only as a passive digital representation but also as an active interface for executing added-value services.%, thereby laying the foundation for future AI-driven adaptation and system-level intelligence in digital twin environments.</description>

      <title>QuantGraph: A Receding-Horizon Quantum Graph Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic programming is a cornerstone of graph-based optimization. While effective, it scales unfavorably with problem size. In this work, we present QuantGraph, a two-stage quantum-enhanced framework that casts local and global graph-optimization problems as quantum searches over discrete trajectory spaces. The solver is designed to operate efficiently by first finding a sequence of locally optimal transitions in the graph (local stage), without considering full trajectories. The accumulated cost of these transitions acts as a threshold that prunes the search space (up to 60% reduction for certain examples). The subsequent global stage, based on this threshold, refines the solution. Both stages utilize variants of the Grover-adaptive-search algorithm. To achieve scalability and robustness, we draw on principles from control theory and embed QuantGraph's global stage within a receding-horizon model-predictive-control scheme. This classical layer stabilizes and guides the quantum search, improving precision and reducing computational burden. In practice, the resulting closed-loop system exhibits robust behavior and lower overall complexity. Notably, for a fixed query budget, QuantGraph attains a 2x increase in control-discretization precision while still benefiting from Grover-search's inherent quadratic speedup compared to classical methods.</description>

      <title>Exact Learning of Linear Model Predictive Control Laws using Oblique Decision Trees with Linear Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful strategy for constrained multivariable systems but faces computational challenges in real-time deployment due to its online optimization requirements. While explicit MPC and neural network approximations mitigate this burden, they suffer from scalability issues or lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in safety-critical systems. This work introduces a data-driven framework that directly learns the Linear MPC control law from sampled state-action pairs using Oblique Decision Trees with Linear Predictions (ODT-LP), achieving both computational efficiency and interpretability. By leveraging the piecewise affine structure of Linear MPC, we prove that the Linear MPC control law can be replicated by finite-depth ODT-LP models. We develop a gradient-based training algorithm using smooth approximations of tree routing functions to learn this structure from grid-sampled Linear MPC solutions, enabling end-to-end optimization. Input-to-state stability is established under bounded approximation errors, with explicit error decomposition into learning inaccuracies and sampling errors to inform model design. Numerical experiments demonstrate that ODT-LP controllers match MPC's closed-loop performance while reducing online evaluation time by orders of magnitude compared to MPC, explicit MPC, neural network, and random forest counterparts. The transparent tree structure enables formal verification of control logic, bridging the gap between computational efficiency and certifiable reliability for safety-critical systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication aims to transmit information most relevant to a task rather than raw data, offering significant gains in communication efficiency for applications such as telepresence, augmented reality, and remote sensing. Recent transformer-based approaches have used self-attention maps to identify informative regions within images, but they often struggle in complex scenes with multiple objects, where self-attention lacks explicit task guidance. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Semantic Communication framework that integrates text-based user queries to guide the information extraction process. Our proposed system employs a cross-modal attention mechanism that fuses visual features with language embeddings to produce soft relevance scores over the visual data. Based on these scores and the instantaneous channel bandwidth, we use an algorithm to transmit image patches at adaptive resolutions using independently trained encoder-decoder pairs, with total bitrate matching the channel capacity. At the receiver, the patches are reconstructed and combined to preserve task-critical information. This flexible and goal-driven design enables efficient semantic communication in complex and bandwidth-constrained environments.</description>

Abstract: This article investigates the problem of controlling linear time-invariant systems subject to time-varying and a priori unknown cost functions, state and input constraints, and exogenous disturbances. We combine the online convex optimization framework with tools from robust model predictive control to propose an algorithm that is able to guarantee robust constraint satisfaction. The performance of the closed loop emerging from application of our framework is studied in terms of its dynamic regret, which is proven to be bounded linearly by the variation of the cost functions and the magnitude of the disturbances. We corroborate our theoretical findings and illustrate implementational aspects of the proposed algorithm by a numerical case study on a tracking control problem of an autonomous vehicle.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Influence of Residential Electric Vehicle Charging on Distribution System Hosting Capacity -- A Case-Study in Arizona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The installation of high-capacity fast chargers for electric vehicles (EVs) is posing a significant risk to the distribution grid as the increased demand from widespread residential EV charging could exceed the technical limits of the distribution system. Addressing this issue is critical, given that current infrastructure upgrades to enhance EV hosting capacity are both costly and time-consuming. Moreover, the inherent uncertainties associated with EV charging parameters make it challenging for power utilities to accurately assess the impact of EVs added to specific locations. To address these knowledge gaps, this study (a) introduces an algorithm to coordinate residential EV charging, and (b) proposes a comprehensive framework that evaluates all transformers within a feeder. The proposed method is applied to a real-world feeder, which includes 120 transformers of varying capacities. The results demonstrate that this approach effectively manages a substantial number of EVs without overloading any of the transformers, while also pinpointing locations that must be prioritized for future upgrades. This framework can serve as a valuable reference for utilities when conducting distribution system evaluations for supporting the growing EV penetration.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Gradient-Tracking-Based Distributed Stochastic Optimization over Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a differentially private gradient-tracking-based distributed stochastic optimization algorithm over directed graphs. In particular, privacy noises are incorporated into each agent's state and tracking variable to mitigate information leakage, after which the perturbed states and tracking variables are transmitted to neighbors. We design two novel schemes for the step-sizes and the sampling number within the algorithm. The sampling parameter-controlled subsampling method employed by both schemes enhances the differential privacy level, and ensures a finite cumulative privacy budget even over infinite iterations. The algorithm achieves both almost sure and mean square convergence for nonconvex objectives. Furthermore, when nonconvex objectives satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition, Scheme (S1) achieves a polynomial mean square convergence rate, and Scheme (S2) achieves an exponential mean square convergence rate. The trade-off between privacy and convergence is presented. The effectiveness of the algorithm and its superior performance compared to existing works are illustrated through numerical examples of distributed training on the benchmark datasets "MNIST" and "CIFAR-10".</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to improve the action smoothness of a cascaded online learning flight control system. Although the cascaded structure is widely used in flight control design, its stability can be compromised by oscillatory control actions, which poses challenges for practical engineering applications. To address this issue, we introduce an online temporal smoothness technique and a low-pass filter to reduce the amplitude and frequency of the control actions. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to analyze policy performance in the frequency domain. Simulation results demonstrate the improvements achieved by the two proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>Missing Money and Market-Based Adequacy in Deeply Decarbonized Power Systems with Long-Duration Energy Storage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability of deeply decarbonised power systems to ensure adequacy may increasingly depend on long-duration energy storage (LDES). A central challenge is whether capacity markets (CMs), originally designed around thermal generation, can provide efficient investment signals when storage becomes a central participant. While recent studies have advanced methods for accrediting variable renewables and short-duration storage, the effectiveness of these methods in CMs with substantial LDES penetration remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we extend a two-stage stochastic equilibrium investment model by endogenising continuous, duration-based capacity accreditation for storage and apply it to a Great Britain-based case using 40 years of weather-driven demand and renewable profiles under varying emission limits. Results show that well-calibrated CMs can sustain near-efficient investment and mitigate revenue volatility, but their effectiveness diminishes in deeply decarbonized systems, underscoring both their potential and the regulatory challenges of supporting large-scale LDES.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven Koopman operator-based approach for designing robust state observers for nonlinear systems. Based on a finite-dimensional surrogate of the Koopman generator, identified via an extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) procedure, a tractable formulation of the observer design problem is enabled on the data-driven model with conic uncertainties. The resulting problem is cast as a semidefinite program (SDP) with linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), guaranteeing exponential convergence of the observer with a predetermined rate in a probabilistic sense. The approach bridges the gap between statistical error tolerance and observer convergence certification, and enables an explicit use of linear systems theory for nonlinear observation in a data-driven framework. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Fair, Flexible, Zero-Waste Digital Electricity Market: A First-Principles Approach Combining Automatic Market Making, Holarchic Architectures and Shapley Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This thesis presents a fundamental rethink of electricity market design at the wholesale and balancing layers. Rather than treating markets as static spot clearing mechanisms, it reframes them as a continuously online, event driven dynamical control system: a two sided marketplace operating directly on grid physics.
  Existing energy only, capacity augmented, and zonal market designs are shown to admit no shock robust Nash equilibrium under realistic uncertainty, instead relying on price caps, uplift, and regulatory intervention to preserve solvency and security. In response, the thesis develops a holarchic Automatic Market Maker (AMM) in which prices are bounded, exogenous control signals derived from physical tightness rather than emergent equilibrium outcomes.
  The AMM generalises nodal and zonal pricing through nested scarcity layers, from node to cluster to zone to region to system, such that participant facing prices inherit from the tightest binding constraint. Nodal and zonal pricing therefore emerge as special cases of a unified scarcity propagation rule.
  Beyond pricing, the AMM functions as a scarcity aware control system and a digitally enforceable rulebook for fair access and proportional allocation under shortage. Fuel costs are recovered through pay as bid energy dispatch consistent with merit order, while non fuel operating and capital costs are allocated according to adequacy, flexibility, and locational contribution.
  Large scale simulations demonstrate bounded input bounded output stability, controllable procurement costs, zero structural waste, and improved distributional outcomes. The architecture is climate aligned and policy configurable, but requires a managed transition and new operational tools for system operators and market participants.</description>

      <title>Safety with Agency: Human-Centered Safety Filter with Application to AI-Assisted Motorsports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11717v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a human-centered safety filter (HCSF) for shared autonomy that significantly enhances system safety without compromising human agency. Our HCSF is built on a neural safety value function, which we first learn scalably through black-box interactions and then use at deployment to enforce a novel state-action control barrier function (Q-CBF) safety constraint. Since this Q-CBF safety filter does not require any knowledge of the system dynamics for both synthesis and runtime safety monitoring and intervention, our method applies readily to complex, black-box shared autonomy systems. Notably, our HCSF's CBF-based interventions modify the human's actions minimally and smoothly, avoiding the abrupt, last-moment corrections delivered by many conventional safety filters. We validate our approach in a comprehensive in-person user study using Assetto Corsa-a high-fidelity car racing simulator with black-box dynamics-to assess robustness in "driving on the edge" scenarios. We compare both trajectory data and drivers' perceptions of our HCSF assistance against unassisted driving and a conventional safety filter. Experimental results show that 1) compared to having no assistance, our HCSF improves both safety and user satisfaction without compromising human agency or comfort, and 2) relative to a conventional safety filter, our proposed HCSF boosts human agency, comfort, and satisfaction while maintaining robustness.</description>

Abstract: Antenna simulation typically involves modeling and optimization, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, slowing down antenna analysis and design. This paper presents a prototype of a large language model (LLM)-based antenna design system (LADS) to assist in antenna simulation. LADS generates antenna models with textual descriptions and images extracted from academic papers, patents, and technical reports (either one or multiple), and it interacts with engineers to iteratively refine the designs. After that, LADS configures and runs an optimizer to meet the design specifications. The effectiveness of LADS is demonstrated by a monopole slotted antenna generated from images and descriptions from the literature. To improve gain stability across the 3.1-10.6 GHz ultra-wide band, LADS modifies the cross-slot into an H-slot and changes substrate material, followed by parameter optimization. As a result, the gain variation is reduced while maintaining the same gain level. The LLM-enabled antenna modeling (LEAM) is available at: https://github.com/TaoWu974/LEAM.</description>

      <title>Observation Compression in Rate-Limited Closed-Loop Distributed ISAC Systems: From Signal Reconstruction to Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In closed-loop distributed multi-sensor integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, performance often hinges on transmitting high-dimensional sensor observations over rate-limited networks. In this paper, we first present a general framework for rate-limited closed-loop distributed ISAC systems, and then propose an autoencoder-based observation compression method to overcome the constraints imposed by limited transmission capacity. Building on this framework, we conduct a case study using a closed-loop linear quadratic regulator (LQR) system to analyze how the interplay among observation, compression, and state dimensions affects reconstruction accuracy, state estimation error, and control performance. In multi-sensor scenarios, our results further show that optimal resource allocation initially prioritizes low-noise sensors until the compression becomes lossless, after which resources are reallocated to high-noise sensors.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Decentralized Constraint-Coupled Optimization: A Dual$^2$ Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a class of decentralized constraint-coupled optimization problem: $\min_{x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_i}, i \in \mathcal{I}; y \in \mathbb{R}^p}$ $\sum_{i=1}^n\left(f_i(x_i) + g_i(x_i)\right) + h(y) \ \text{s.t.} \ \sum_{i=1}^{n}A_ix_i = y$, over an undirected and connected network of $n$ agents. Here, $f_i$, $g_i$, and $A_i$ represent private information of agent $i \in \mathcal{I} = \{1, \cdots, n\}$, while $h$ is public for all agents. Building on a novel dual$^2$ approach, we develop two accelerated algorithms to solve this problem: the inexact Dual$^2$ Accelerated (iD2A) gradient method and the Multi-consensus inexact Dual$^2$ Accelerated (MiD2A) gradient method. We demonstrate that both iD2A and MiD2A can guarantee asymptotic convergence under a milder condition on $h$ compared to existing algorithms. Furthermore, under additional assumptions, we establish linear convergence rates and derive significantly lower communication and computational complexity bounds than those of existing algorithms. Several numerical experiments validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the practical superiority of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Game Management Decisions: A Fuzzy Logic Approach to Real-Time Soccer Substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04480v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In elite soccer, substitution decisions entail significant financial and sporting consequences yet remain heavily reliant on intuition or predictive models that merely mimic historical biases. This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the "FAGNER Paradox" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the "Lukaku Paradox", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions.</description>

      <title>Embodied Co-Design for Rapidly Evolving Agents: Taxonomy, Frontiers, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain-body co-evolution enables animals to develop complex behaviors in their environments. Inspired by this biological synergy, embodied co-design (ECD) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for creating intelligent agents-from virtual creatures to physical robots-by jointly optimizing their morphologies and controllers rather than treating control in isolation. This integrated approach facilitates richer environmental interactions and robust task performance. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of recent advances in ECD. We first formalize the concept of ECD and position it within related fields. We then introduce a hierarchical taxonomy: a lower layer that breaks down agent design into three fundamental components-controlling brain, body morphology, and task environment-and an upper layer that integrates these components into four major ECD frameworks: bi-level, single-level, generative, and open-ended. This taxonomy allows us to synthesize insights from more than one hundred recent studies. We further review notable benchmarks, datasets, and applications in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Finally, we identify significant challenges and offer insights into promising future research directions. A project associated with this survey has been created at https://github.com/Yuxing-Wang-THU/SurveyBrainBody.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous and Proportional Finger Motion Decoding Using Spatial Features from High-Density Surface Electromyography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Restoring natural and intuitive hand function requires simultaneous and proportional control (SPC) of multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs). This study systematically evaluated the multichannel linear descriptors-based block field method (MLD-BFM) for continuous decoding of five finger-joint DoFs by leveraging the rich spatial information of high-density surface electromyography (HD sEMG). Twenty-one healthy participants performed dynamic sinusoidal finger movements while HD sEMG signals were recorded from the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscles. MLD-BFM extracted region-specific spatial features, including effective field strength ($\Sigma$), field-strength variation rate ($\Phi$), and spatial complexity ($\Omega$). Model performance was optimized (block size: $2 \times 2$; window: 0.15 s) and compared with conventional time-domain features and dimensionality reduction approaches when applied to multi-output regression models. MLD-BFM consistently achieved the highest $\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}}$ values across all models. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) combined with MLD-BFM yielded the best performance ($\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}} = 86.68\% \pm 0.33$). Time-domain features also showed strong predictive capability and were statistically comparable to MLD-BFM in some models, whereas dimensionality reduction techniques exhibited lower accuracy. Decoding accuracy was higher for the middle and ring fingers than for the thumb. Overall, MLD-BFM improved continuous finger movement decoding accuracy, underscoring the importance of taking advantage of the spatial richness of HD sEMG. These findings suggest that spatially structured features enhance SPC and provide practical guidance for designing robust, real-time, and responsive myoelectric interfaces.</description>
