      <title>Safe Path Planning and Observation Quality Enhancement Strategy for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Water Quality Monitoring Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) spectral remote sensing technology is widely used in water quality monitoring. However, in dynamic environments, varying illumination conditions, such as shadows and specular reflection (sun glint), can cause severe spectral distortion, thereby reducing data availability. To maximize the acquisition of high-quality data while ensuring flight safety, this paper proposes an active path planning method for dynamic light and shadow disturbance avoidance. First, a dynamic prediction model is constructed to transform the time-varying light and shadow disturbance areas into three-dimensional virtual obstacles. Second, an improved Interfered Fluid Dynamical System (IFDS) algorithm is introduced, which generates a smooth initial obstacle avoidance path by building a repulsive force field. Subsequently, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is employed for rolling-horizon path optimization to handle flight dynamics constraints and achieve real-time trajectory tracking. Furthermore, a Dynamic Flight Altitude Adjustment (DFAA) mechanism is designed to actively reduce the flight altitude when the observable area is narrow, thereby enhancing spatial resolution. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional PID and single obstacle avoidance algorithms, the proposed method achieves an obstacle avoidance success rate of 98% in densely disturbed scenarios, significantly improves path smoothness, and increases the volume of effective observation data by approximately 27%. This research provides an effective engineering solution for precise UAV water quality monitoring in complex illumination environments.</description>

      <title>Fast Navigation Through Occluded Spaces via Language-Conditioned Map Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cluttered environments, motion planners often face a trade-off between safety and speed due to uncertainty caused by occlusions and limited sensor range. In this work, we investigate whether co-pilot instructions can help robots plan more decisively while remaining safe. We introduce PaceForecaster, as an approach that incorporates such co-pilot instructions into local planners. PaceForecaster takes the robot's local sensor footprint (Level-1) and the provided co-pilot instructions as input and predicts (i) a forecasted map with all regions visible from Level-1 (Level-2) and (ii) an instruction-conditioned subgoal within Level-2. The subgoal provides the planner with explicit guidance to exploit the forecasted environment in a goal-directed manner. We integrate PaceForecaster with a Log-MPPI controller and demonstrate that using language-conditioned forecasts and goals improves navigation performance by 36% over a local-map-only baseline while in polygonal environments.</description>

      <title>Developing a Fundamental Diagram for Urban Air Mobility Based on Physical Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that promises to reduce travel time and alleviate congestion in urban transportation systems. As drone density increases, UAM operations are expected to experience congestion similar to that in ground traffic. However, the fundamental characteristics of UAM traffic flow, particularly under real-world operating conditions, remain poorly understood. This study proposes a general framework for constructing the fundamental diagram (FD) of UAM traffic by integrating theoretical analysis with physical experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to derive a UAM FD using real-world physical test data. On the theoretical side, we design two drone control laws for collision avoidance and develop simulation-based traffic generation methods to produce diverse UAM traffic scenarios. Based on Edie's definition, traffic flow theory is then applied to construct the FD and characterize the macroscopic properties of UAM traffic. To account for real-world disturbances and modeling uncertainties, we further conduct physical experiments on a reduced-scale testbed using Bitcraze Crazyflie drones. Both simulation and physical test trajectory data are collected and organized into the UAMTra2Flow dataset, which is analyzed using the proposed framework. Preliminary results indicate that classical FD structures for ground transportation are also applicable to UAM systems. Notably, FD curves obtained from physical experiments exhibit deviations from simulation-based results, highlighting the importance of experimental validation. Finally, results from the reduced-scale testbed are scaled to realistic operating conditions to provide practical insights for future UAM traffic systems. The dataset and code for this paper are publicly available at https://github.com/CATS-Lab/UAM-FD.</description>

      <title>EVE: A Generator-Verifier System for Generative Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visuomotor policies based on generative architectures such as diffusion and flow-based matching have shown strong performance but degrade under distribution shifts, demonstrating limited recovery capabilities without costly finetuning. In the language modeling domain, test-time compute scaling has revolutionized reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs by leveraging additional inference-time compute for candidate solution refinement. These methods typically leverage foundation models as verification modules in a zero-shot manner to synthesize improved candidate solutions. In this work, we hypothesize that generative policies can similarly benefit from additional inference-time compute that employs zero-shot VLM-based verifiers. A systematic analysis of improving policy performance through the generation-verification framework remains relatively underexplored in the current literature. To this end, we introduce EVE - a modular, generator-verifier interaction framework - that boosts the performance of pretrained generative policies at test time, with no additional training. EVE wraps a frozen base policy with multiple zero-shot, VLM-based verifier agents. Each verifier proposes action refinements to the base policy candidate actions, while an action incorporator fuses the aggregated verifier output into the base policy action prediction to produce the final executed action. We study design choices for generator-verifier information interfacing across a system of verifiers with distinct capabilities. Across a diverse suite of manipulation tasks, EVE consistently improves task success rates without any additional policy training. Through extensive ablations, we isolate the contribution of verifier capabilities and action incorporator strategies, offering practical guidelines to build scalable, modular generator-verifier systems for embodied control.</description>

      <title>Planetary Terrain Datasets and Benchmarks for Rover Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary rover exploration is attracting renewed interest with several upcoming space missions to the Moon and Mars. However, a substantial amount of data from prior missions remain underutilized for path planning and autonomous navigation research. As a result, there is a lack of space mission-based planetary datasets, standardized benchmarks, and evaluation protocols. In this paper, we take a step towards coordinating these three research directions in the context of planetary rover path planning. We propose the first two large planar benchmark datasets, MarsPlanBench and MoonPlanBench, derived from high-resolution digital terrain images of Mars and the Moon. In addition, we set up classical and learned path planning algorithms, in a unified framework, and evaluate them on our proposed datasets and on a popular planning benchmark. Through comprehensive experiments, we report new insights on the performance of representative path planning algorithms on planetary terrains, for the first time to the best of our knowledge. Our results show that classical algorithms can achieve up to 100% global path planning success rates on average across challenging terrains such as Moon's north and south poles. This suggests, for instance, why these algorithms are used in practice by NASA. Conversely, learning-based models, although showing promising results in less complex environments, still struggle to generalize to planetary domains. To serve as a starting point for fundamental path planning research, our code and datasets will be released at: https://github.com/mchancan/PlanetaryPathBench.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Tubes for Probabilistic Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay Task in Uncertain Dynamic Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the Spatiotemporal Tube (STT) framework to address Probabilistic Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay (PrT-RAS) tasks in dynamic environments with uncertain obstacles. We develop a real-time tube synthesis procedure that explicitly accounts for time-varying uncertain obstacles and provides formal probabilistic safety guarantees. The STT is formulated as a time-varying ball in the state space whose center and radius evolve online based on uncertain sensory information. We derive a closed-form, approximation-free control law that confines the system trajectory within the tube, ensuring both probabilistic safety and task satisfaction. Our method offers a formal guarantee for probabilistic avoidance and finite-time task completion. The resulting controller is model-free, approximation-free, and optimization-free, enabling efficient real-time execution while guaranteeing convergence to the target. The effectiveness and scalability of the framework are demonstrated through simulation studies and hardware experiments on mobile robots, a UAV, and a 7-DOF manipulator navigating in cluttered and uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>A Novel Robotic Variable Stiffness Mechanism Based on Helically Wound Structured Electrostatic Layer Jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel variable stiffness mechanism termed Helically Wound Structured Electrostatic Layer Jamming (HWS-ELJ) and systematically investigates its potential applications in variable stiffness robotic finger design. The proposed method utilizes electrostatic attraction to enhance interlayer friction, thereby suppressing relative sliding and enabling tunable stiffness. Compared with conventional planar ELJ, the helical configuration of HWS-ELJ provides exponentially increasing stiffness adjustment with winding angle, achieving significantly greater stiffness enhancement for the same electrode contact area while reducing the required footprint under equivalent stiffness conditions. Considering the practical advantage of voltage-based control, a series of experimental tests under different initial force conditions were conducted to evaluate the stiffness modulation characteristics of HWS-ELJ. The results demonstrated its rational design and efficacy, with outcomes following the deduced theoretical trends. Furthermore, a robotic finger prototype integrating HWS-ELJ was developed, demonstrating voltage-driven stiffness modulation and confirming the feasibility of the proposed robotic variable stiffness mechanism.</description>

      <title>World-Coordinate Human Motion Retargeting via SAM 3D Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering world-coordinate human motion from monocular videos with humanoid robot retargeting is significant for embodied intelligence and robotics. To avoid complex SLAM pipelines or heavy temporal models, we propose a lightweight, engineering-oriented framework that leverages SAM 3D Body (3DB) as a frozen perception backbone and uses the Momentum HumanRig (MHR) representation as a robot-friendly intermediate. Our method (i) locks the identity and skeleton-scale parameters of per tracked subject to enforce temporally consistent bone lengths, (ii) smooths per-frame predictions via efficient sliding-window optimization in the low-dimensional MHR latent space, and (iii) recovers physically plausible global root trajectories with a differentiable soft foot-ground contact model and contact-aware global optimization. Finally, we retarget the reconstructed motion to the Unitree G1 humanoid using a kinematics-aware two-stage inverse kinematics pipeline. Results on real monocular videos show that our method has stable world trajectories and reliable robot retargeting, indicating that structured human representations with lightweight physical constraints can yield robot-ready motion from monocular input.</description>

      <title>AstraNav-Memory: Contexts Compression for Long Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifelong embodied navigation requires agents to accumulate, retain, and exploit spatial-semantic experience across tasks, enabling efficient exploration in novel environments and rapid goal reaching in familiar ones. While object-centric memory is interpretable, it depends on detection and reconstruction pipelines that limit robustness and scalability. We propose an image-centric memory framework that achieves long-term implicit memory via an efficient visual context compression module end-to-end coupled with a Qwen2.5-VL-based navigation policy. Built atop a ViT backbone with frozen DINOv3 features and lightweight PixelUnshuffle+Conv blocks, our visual tokenizer supports configurable compression rates; for example, under a representative 16$\times$ compression setting, each image is encoded with about 30 tokens, expanding the effective context capacity from tens to hundreds of images. Experimental results on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON show that our method achieves state-of-the-art navigation performance, improving exploration in unfamiliar environments and shortening paths in familiar ones. Ablation studies further reveal that moderate compression provides the best balance between efficiency and accuracy. These findings position compressed image-centric memory as a practical and scalable interface for lifelong embodied agents, enabling them to reason over long visual histories and navigate with human-like efficiency.</description>

      <title>Structural Induced Exploration for Balanced and Scalable Multi-Robot Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-robot path planning is a fundamental yet challenging problem due to its combinatorial complexity and the need to balance global efficiency with fair task allocation among robots. Traditional swarm intelligence methods, although effective on small instances, often converge prematurely and struggle to scale to complex environments. In this work, we present a structure-induced exploration framework that integrates structural priors into the search process of the ant colony optimization (ACO). The approach leverages the spatial distribution of the task to induce a structural prior at initialization, thereby constraining the search space. The pheromone update rule is then designed to emphasize structurally meaningful connections and incorporates a load-aware objective to reconcile the total travel distance with individual robot workload. An explicit overlap suppression strategy further ensures that tasks remain distinct and balanced across the team. The proposed framework was validated on diverse benchmark scenarios covering a wide range of instance sizes and robot team configurations. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in route compactness, stability, and workload distribution compared to representative metaheuristic baselines. Beyond performance gains, the method also provides a scalable and interpretable framework that can be readily applied to logistics, surveillance, and search-and-rescue applications where reliable large-scale coordination is essential.</description>

      <title>MAction-SocialNav: Multi-Action Socially Compliant Navigation via Reasoning-enhanced Prompt Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Socially compliant navigation requires robots to move safely and appropriately in human-centered environments by respecting social norms. However, social norms are often ambiguous, and in a single scenario, multiple actions may be equally acceptable. Most existing methods simplify this problem by assuming a single correct action, which limits their ability to handle real-world social uncertainty. In this work, we propose MAction-SocialNav, an efficient vision language model for socially compliant navigation that explicitly addresses action ambiguity, enabling generating multiple plausible actions within one scenario. To enhance the model's reasoning capability, we introduce a novel meta-cognitive prompt (MCP) method. Furthermore, to evaluate the proposed method, we curate a multi-action socially compliant navigation dataset that accounts for diverse conditions, including crowd density, indoor and outdoor environments, and dual human annotations. The dataset contains 789 samples, each with three-turn conversation, split into 710 training samples and 79 test samples through random selection. We also design five evaluation metrics to assess high-level decision precision, safety, and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MAction-SocialNav achieves strong social reasoning performance while maintaining high efficiency, highlighting its potential for real-world human robot navigation. Compared with zero-shot GPT-4o and Claude, our model achieves substantially higher decision quality (APG: 0.595 vs. 0.000/0.025) and safety alignment (ER: 0.264 vs. 0.642/0.668), while maintaining real-time efficiency (1.524 FPS, over 3x faster).</description>

      <title>HELP: Hierarchical Embodied Language Planner for Household Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied agents tasked with complex scenarios, whether in real or simulated environments, rely heavily on robust planning capabilities. When instructions are formulated in natural language, large language models (LLMs) equipped with extensive linguistic knowledge can play this role. However, to effectively exploit the ability of such models to handle linguistic ambiguity, to retrieve information from the environment, and to be based on the available skills of an agent, an appropriate architecture must be designed. We propose a Hierarchical Embodied Language Planner, called HELP, consisting of a set of LLM-based agents, each dedicated to solving a different subtask. We evaluate the proposed approach on a household task and perform real-world experiments with an embodied agent. We also focus on the use of open source LLMs with a relatively small number of parameters, to enable autonomous deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The allure of lunar surface exploration and development has recently captured widespread global attention. Robots have proved to be indispensable for exploring uncharted terrains, uncovering and leveraging local resources, and facilitating the construction of future human habitats. In this article, we introduce the modular and on-demand reconfigurable robot (MoonBot), a modular and reconfigurable robotic system engineered to maximize functionality while operating within the stringent mass constraints of lunar payloads and adapting to varying environmental conditions and task requirements. This article details the design and development of MoonBot and presents a preliminary field demonstration that validates the proof of concept through the execution of milestone tasks simulating the establishment of lunar infrastructure. These tasks include essential civil engineering operations, infrastructural component transportation and deployment, and assistive operations with inflatable modules. Furthermore, we systematically summarize the lessons learned during testing, focusing on the connector design and providing valuable insights for the advancement of modular robotic systems in future lunar missions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trajectory Planning for Orbital Robot Rendezvous and Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approaching a tumbling target safely is a critical challenge in space debris removal missions utilizing robotic manipulators onboard servicing satellites. In this work, we propose a trajectory planning method based on nonlinear optimization for a close-range rendezvous to bring a free-floating, rotating debris object in a two-dimensional plane into the manipulator's workspace, as a preliminary step for its capture. The proposed method introduces a dynamic keep-out sphere that adapts depending on the approach conditions, allowing for closer and safer access to the target. Furthermore, a control strategy is developed to reproduce the optimized trajectory using discrete ON/OFF thrusters, considering practical implementation constraints.</description>

      <title>Online Inertia Parameter Estimation for Unknown Objects Grasped by a Manipulator Towards Space Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowing the inertia parameters of a grasped object is crucial for dynamics-aware manipulation, especially in space robotics with free-floating bases. This work addresses the problem of estimating the inertia parameters of an unknown target object during manipulation. We apply and extend an existing online identification method by incorporating momentum conservation, enabling its use for the floating-base robots. The proposed method is validated through numerical simulations, and the estimated parameters are compared with ground-truth values. Results demonstrate accurate identification in the scenarios, highlighting the method's applicability to on-orbit servicing and other space missions.</description>

      <title>Aerial World Model for Long-horizon Visual Generation and Navigation in 3D Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as powerful embodied agents. One of the core abilities is autonomous navigation in large-scale three-dimensional environments. Existing navigation policies, however, are typically optimized for low-level objectives such as obstacle avoidance and trajectory smoothness, lacking the ability to incorporate high-level semantics into planning. To bridge this gap, we propose ANWM, an aerial navigation world model that predicts future visual observations conditioned on past frames and actions, thereby enabling agents to rank candidate trajectories by their semantic plausibility and navigational utility. ANWM is trained on 4-DoF UAV trajectories and introduces a physics-inspired module: Future Frame Projection (FFP), which projects past frames into future viewpoints to provide coarse geometric priors. This module mitigates representational uncertainty in long-distance visual generation and captures the mapping between 3D trajectories and egocentric observations. Empirical results demonstrate that ANWM significantly outperforms existing world models in long-distance visual forecasting and improves UAV navigation success rates in large-scale environments.</description>

      <title>Flexible Multitask Learning with Factorized Diffusion Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multitask learning poses significant challenges due to the highly multimodal and diverse nature of robot action distributions. However, effectively fitting policies to these complex task distributions is often difficult, and existing monolithic models often underfit the action distribution and lack the flexibility required for efficient adaptation. We introduce a novel modular diffusion policy framework that factorizes complex action distributions into a composition of specialized diffusion models, each capturing a distinct sub-mode of the behavior space for a more effective overall policy. In addition, this modular structure enables flexible policy adaptation to new tasks by adding or fine-tuning components, which inherently mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, across both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation settings, we illustrate how our method consistently outperforms strong modular and monolithic baselines.</description>

      <title>StereoVLA: Enhancing Vision-Language-Action Models with Stereo Vision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stereo cameras closely mimic human binocular vision, providing rich spatial cues critical for precise robotic manipulation. Despite their advantage, the adoption of stereo vision in vision-language-action models (VLAs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present StereoVLA, a VLA model that leverages rich geometric cues from stereo vision. We propose a novel Geometric-Semantic Feature Extraction module that utilizes vision foundation models to extract and fuse two key features: 1) geometric features from subtle stereo-view differences for spatial perception; 2) semantic-rich features from the monocular view for instruction following. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary Interaction-Region Depth Estimation task to further enhance spatial perception and accelerate model convergence. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms baselines by a large margin in diverse tasks under the stereo setting and demonstrates strong robustness to camera pose variations.</description>

      <title>Bab_Sak Robotic Intubation System (BRIS): A Learning-Enabled Control Framework for Safe Fiberoptic Endotracheal Intubation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Endotracheal intubation is a critical yet technically demanding procedure, with failure or improper tube placement leading to severe complications. Existing robotic and teleoperated intubation systems primarily focus on airway navigation and do not provide integrated control of endotracheal tube advancement or objective verification of tube depth relative to the carina. This paper presents the Robotic Intubation System (BRIS), a compact, human-in-the-loop platform designed to assist fiberoptic-guided intubation while enabling real-time, objective depth awareness. BRIS integrates a four-way steerable fiberoptic bronchoscope, an independent endotracheal tube advancement mechanism, and a camera-augmented mouthpiece compatible with standard clinical workflows. A learning-enabled closed-loop control framework leverages real-time shape sensing to map joystick inputs to distal bronchoscope tip motion in Cartesian space, providing stable and intuitive teleoperation under tendon nonlinearities and airway contact. Monocular endoscopic depth estimation is used to classify airway regions and provide interpretable, anatomy-aware guidance for safe tube positioning relative to the carina. The system is validated on high-fidelity airway mannequins under standard and difficult airway configurations, demonstrating reliable navigation and controlled tube placement. These results highlight BRIS as a step toward safer, more consistent, and clinically compatible robotic airway management.</description>

      <title>SymDrive: Realistic and Controllable Driving Simulator via Symmetric Auto-regressive Online Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity and controllable 3D simulation is essential for addressing the long-tail data scarcity in Autonomous Driving (AD), yet existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve photorealistic rendering and interactive traffic editing. Current approaches often falter in large-angle novel view synthesis and suffer from geometric or lighting artifacts during asset manipulation. To address these challenges, we propose SymDrive, a unified diffusion-based framework capable of joint high-quality rendering and scene editing. We introduce a Symmetric Auto-regressive Online Restoration paradigm, which constructs paired symmetric views to recover fine-grained details via a ground-truth-guided dual-view formulation and utilizes an auto-regressive strategy for consistent lateral view generation. Furthermore, we leverage this restoration capability to enable a training-free harmonization mechanism, treating vehicle insertion as context-aware inpainting to ensure seamless lighting and shadow consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SymDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view enhancement and realistic 3D vehicle insertion.</description>

      <title>PlanScope: Learning to Plan Within Decision Scope for Urban Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of urban autonomous driving, imitation learning-based methods have shown remarkable effectiveness, with a typical practice to minimize the discrepancy between expert driving logs and predictive decision sequences. As expert driving logs natively contain future short-term decisions with respect to events, such as sudden obstacles or rapidly changing traffic signals. We believe that unpredictable future events and corresponding expert reactions can introduce reasoning disturbances, negatively affecting the convergence efficiency of planning models. At the same time, long-term decision information, such as maintaining a reference lane or avoiding stationary obstacles, is essential for guiding short-term decisions. Our preliminary experiments on shortening the planning horizon show a rise-and-fall trend in driving performance, supporting these hypotheses. Based on these insights, we present PlanScope, a sequential-decision-learning framework with novel techniques for separating short-term and long-term decisions in decision logs. To identify and extract each decision component, the Wavelet Transform on trajectory profiles is proposed. After that, to enhance the detail-generating ability of Neural Networks, extra Detail Decoders are proposed. Finally, to enable in-scope decision supervision across detail levels, Multi-Scope Supervision strategies are adopted during training. The proposed methods, especially the time-dependent normalization, outperform baseline models in closed-loop evaluations on the nuPlan dataset, offering a plug-and-play solution to enhance existing planning models.</description>

      <title>VTAO-BiManip: Masked Visual-Tactile-Action Pre-training with Object Understanding for Bimanual Dexterous Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bimanual dexterous manipulation remains significant challenges in robotics due to the high DoFs of each hand and their coordination. Existing single-hand manipulation techniques often leverage human demonstrations to guide RL methods but fail to generalize to complex bimanual tasks involving multiple sub-skills. In this paper, we introduce VTAO-BiManip, a novel framework that combines visual-tactile-action pretraining with object understanding to facilitate curriculum RL to enable human-like bimanual manipulation. We improve prior learning by incorporating hand motion data, providing more effective guidance for dual-hand coordination than binary tactile feedback. Our pretraining model predicts future actions as well as object pose and size using masked multimodal inputs, facilitating cross-modal regularization. To address the multi-skill learning challenge, we introduce a two-stage curriculum RL approach to stabilize training. We evaluate our method on a bottle-cap unscrewing task, demonstrating its effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments. Our approach achieves a success rate that surpasses existing visual-tactile pretraining methods by over 20%.</description>

      <title>Learning collision risk proactively from naturalistic driving data at scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13556v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately and proactively alerting drivers or automated systems to emerging collisions is crucial for road safety, particularly in highly interactive and complex urban environments. Existing methods either require labour-intensive annotation of sparse risk, struggle to consider varying contextual factors, or are tailored to limited scenarios. Here we present the Generalised Surrogate Safety Measure (GSSM), a data-driven approach that learns collision risk from naturalistic driving without the need for crash or risk labels. Trained over multiple datasets and evaluated on 2,591 real-world crashes and near-crashes, a basic GSSM using only instantaneous motion kinematics achieves an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.9, and secures a median time advance of 2.6 seconds to prevent potential collisions. Incorporating additional interaction patterns and contextual factors provides further performance gains. Across interaction scenarios such as rear-end, merging, and turning, GSSM consistently outperforms existing baselines in accuracy and timeliness. These results establish GSSM as a scalable, context-aware, and generalisable foundation to identify risky interactions before they become unavoidable, supporting proactive safety in autonomous driving systems and traffic incident management.

      <title>Compliant Residual DAgger: Improving Real-World Contact-Rich Manipulation with Human Corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16685v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address key challenges in Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) for real-world contact-rich manipulation: how to collect informative human correction data and how to effectively update policies with this new data. We introduce Compliant Residual DAgger (CR-DAgger), which contains two novel components: 1) a Compliant Intervention Interface that leverages compliance control, allowing humans to provide gentle, accurate delta action corrections without interrupting the ongoing robot policy execution; and 2) a Compliant Residual Policy formulation that learns from human corrections while incorporating force feedback and force control. Our system significantly enhances performance on precise contact-rich manipulation tasks using minimal correction data, improving base policy success rates by 64% on four challenging tasks (book flipping, belt assembly, cable routing, and gear insertion) while outperforming both retraining-from-scratch and finetuning approaches. Through extensive real-world experiments, we provide practical guidance for implementing effective DAgger in real-world robot learning tasks.

      <title>Think, Act, Learn: A Framework for Autonomous Robotic Agents using Closed-Loop Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotics has unlocked unprecedented capabilities in high-level task planning. However, most current systems operate in an open-loop fashion, where LLMs act as one-shot planners, rendering them brittle and unable to adapt to unforeseen circumstances in dynamic physical environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the "Think, Act, Learn" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that enables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through continuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an LLM first "thinks" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans. The robot then "acts" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal sensory feedback. Critically, the "learn" module processes this feedback to facilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal analysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are stored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We demonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world that our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including open-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning. Our framework achieves over a 97% success rate on complex, long-horizon tasks, converges to a stable policy in an average of just 9 trials, and exhibits remarkable generalization to unseen tasks. This work presents a significant step towards developing more robust, adaptive, and truly autonomous robotic agents.</description>

      <title>Super-LIO: A Robust and Efficient LiDAR-Inertial Odometry System with a Compact Mapping Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) is a foundational technique for autonomous systems, yet its deployment on resource-constrained platforms remains challenging due to computational and memory limitations. We propose Super-LIO, a robust LIO system that demands both high performance and accuracy, ideal for applications such as aerial robots and mobile autonomous systems. At the core of Super-LIO is a compact octo-voxel-based map structure, termed OctVox, that limits each voxel to eight fused subvoxels, enabling strict point density control and incremental denoising during map updates. This design enables a simple yet efficient and accurate map structure, which can be easily integrated into existing LIO frameworks. Additionally, Super-LIO designs a heuristic-guided KNN strategy (HKNN) that accelerates the correspondence search by leveraging spatial locality, further reducing runtime overhead. We evaluated the proposed system using four publicly available datasets and several self-collected datasets, totaling more than 30 sequences. Extensive testing on both X86 and ARM platforms confirms that Super-LIO offers superior efficiency and robustness, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Super-LIO processes each frame approximately 73% faster than SOTA, while consuming less CPU resources. The system is fully open-source and plug-and-play compatible with a wide range of LiDAR sensors and platforms. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/Liansheng-Wang/Super-LIO.git</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout, camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.</description>

      <title>How Robot Dogs See the Unseeable: Improving Visual Interpretability via Peering for Exploratory Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Occlusion from obstacles, such as foliage, can severely obstruct a robot's sensors, impairing scene understanding. We show that "peering", a characteristic side-to-side movement used by insects to overcome their visual limitations, can also allow robots to markedly improve visual reasoning under partial occlusion. This is accomplished by applying core signal processing principles, specifically optical synthetic aperture sensing, together with the vision reasoning capabilities of modern large multimodal models. Peering enables real-time, high-resolution, and wavelength-independent perception, which is crucial for vision-based scene understanding across a wide range of applications. The approach is low-cost and immediately deployable on any camera-equipped robot. We investigated different peering motions and occlusion masking strategies, demonstrating that, unlike peering, state-of-the-art multi-view 3D vision techniques fail in these conditions due to their high susceptibility to occlusion. Robots that see through occlusion will gain superior perception abilities - including enhanced scene understanding, situational awareness, camouflage breaking, and advanced navigation.</description>

      <title>Transformer Driven Visual Servoing for Fabric Texture Matching Using Dual-Arm Manipulator</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to align and place a fabric piece on top of another using a dual-arm manipulator and a grayscale camera, so that their surface textures are accurately matched. We propose a novel control scheme that combines Transformer-driven visual servoing with dualarm impedance control. This approach enables the system to simultaneously control the pose of the fabric piece and place it onto the underlying one while applying tension to keep the fabric piece flat. Our transformer-based network incorporates pretrained backbones and a newly introduced Difference Extraction Attention Module (DEAM), which significantly enhances pose difference prediction accuracy. Trained entirely on synthetic images generated using rendering software, the network enables zero-shot deployment in real-world scenarios without requiring prior training on specific fabric textures. Real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed system accurately aligns fabric pieces with different textures.</description>

Abstract: In pipeline inspection, traditional tethered inspection robots are severely constrained by cable length and weight, which greatly limit their travel range and accessibility. To address these issues, this paper proposes a self-propelled pipeline robot design based on force analysis and dynamic simulation, with a specific focus on solving core challenges including vertical climbing failure and poor passability in T-branch pipes. Adopting a wheeled configuration and modular design, the robot prioritizes the core demand of body motion control. Specifically, 3D modeling of the robot was first completed using SolidWorks. Subsequently, the model was imported into ADAMS for dynamic simulation, which provided a basis for optimizing the drive module and motion control strategy.To verify the robot's dynamic performance, an experimental platform with acrylic pipes was constructed. Through adjusting its body posture to surmount obstacles and select directions, the robot has demonstrated its ability to stably traverse various complex pipeline scenarios. Notably, this work offers a technical feasibility reference for the application of pipeline robots in the inspection of medium and low-pressure urban gas pipelines.</description>

      <title>Research on Dead Reckoning Algorithm for Self-Propelled Pipeline Robots in Three-Dimensional Complex Pipelines</title>

Abstract: In the field of gas pipeline location, existing pipeline location methods mostly rely on pipeline location instruments. However, when faced with complex and curved pipeline scenarios, these methods often fail due to problems such as cable entanglement and insufficient equipment flexibility. To address this pain point, we designed a self-propelled pipeline robot. This robot can autonomously complete the location work of complex and curved pipelines in complex pipe networks without external dragging. In terms of pipeline mapping technology, traditional visual mapping and laser mapping methods are easily affected by lighting conditions and insufficient features in the confined space of pipelines, resulting in mapping drift and divergence problems. In contrast, the pipeline location method that integrates inertial navigation and wheel odometers is less affected by pipeline environmental factors. Based on this, this paper proposes a pipeline robot location method based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF). Firstly, the body attitude angle is initially obtained through an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Then, the extended Kalman filtering algorithm is used to improve the accuracy of attitude angle estimation. Finally, high-precision pipeline location is achieved by combining wheel odometers. During the testing phase, the roll wheels of the pipeline robot needed to fit tightly against the pipe wall to reduce slippage. However, excessive tightness would reduce the flexibility of motion control due to excessive friction. Therefore, a balance needed to be struck between the robot's motion capability and positioning accuracy. Experiments were conducted using the self-propelled pipeline robot in a rectangular loop pipeline, and the results verified the effectiveness of the proposed dead reckoning algorithm.</description>

      <title>FAR-AVIO: Fast and Robust Schur-Complement Based Acoustic-Visual-Inertial Fusion Odometry with Sensor Calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Underwater environments impose severe challenges to visual-inertial odometry systems, as strong light attenuation, marine snow and turbidity, together with weakly exciting motions, degrade inertial observability and cause frequent tracking failures over long-term operation. While tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial fusion, typically implemented through an acoustic Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) integrated with visual-inertial measurements, can provide accurate state estimation, the associated graph-based optimization is often computationally prohibitive for real-time deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Here we present FAR-AVIO, a Schur-Complement based, tightly coupled acoustic-visual-inertial odometry framework tailored for underwater robots. FAR-AVIO embeds a Schur complement formulation into an Extended Kalman Filter(EKF), enabling joint pose-landmark optimization for accuracy while maintaining constant-time updates by efficiently marginalizing landmark states. On top of this backbone, we introduce Adaptive Weight Adjustment and Reliability Evaluation(AWARE), an online sensor health module that continuously assesses the reliability of visual, inertial and DVL measurements and adaptively regulates their sigma weights, and we develop an efficient online calibration scheme that jointly estimates DVL-IMU extrinsics, without dedicated calibration manoeuvres. Numerical simulations and real-world underwater experiments consistently show that FAR-AVIO outperforms state-of-the-art underwater SLAM baselines in both localization accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling robust operation on low-power embedded platforms. Our implementation has been released as open source software at https://far-vido.gitbook.io/far-vido-docs.</description>

      <title>UniTacHand: Unified Spatio-Tactile Representation for Human to Robotic Hand Skill Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tactile sensing is crucial for robotic hands to achieve human-level dexterous manipulation, especially in scenarios with visual occlusion. However, its application is often hindered by the difficulty of collecting large-scale real-world robotic tactile data. In this study, we propose to collect low-cost human manipulation data using haptic gloves for tactile-based robotic policy learning. The misalignment between human and robotic tactile data makes it challenging to transfer policies learned from human data to robots. To bridge this gap, we propose UniTacHand, a unified representation to align robotic tactile information captured by dexterous hands with human hand touch obtained from gloves. First, we project tactile signals from both human hands and robotic hands onto a morphologically consistent 2D surface space of the MANO hand model. This unification standardizes the heterogeneous data structures and inherently embeds the tactile signals with spatial context. Then, we introduce a contrastive learning method to align them into a unified latent space, trained on only 10 minutes of paired data from our data collection system. Our approach enables zero-shot tactile-based policy transfer from humans to a real robot, generalizing to objects unseen in the pre-training data. We also demonstrate that co-training on mixed data, including both human and robotic demonstrations via UniTacHand, yields better performance and data efficiency compared with using only robotic data. UniTacHand paves a path toward general, scalable, and data-efficient learning for tactile-based dexterous hands.</description>

      <title>RoboCade: Gamifying Robot Data Collection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imitation learning from human demonstrations has become a dominant approach for training autonomous robot policies. However, collecting demonstration datasets is costly: it often requires access to robots and needs sustained effort in a tedious, long process. These factors limit the scale of data available for training policies. We aim to address this scalability challenge by involving a broader audience in a gamified data collection experience that is both accessible and motivating. Specifically, we develop a gamified remote teleoperation platform, RoboCade, to engage general users in collecting data that is beneficial for downstream policy training. To do this, we embed gamification strategies into the design of the system interface and data collection tasks. In the system interface, we include components such as visual feedback, sound effects, goal visualizations, progress bars, leaderboards, and badges. We additionally propose principles for constructing gamified tasks that have overlapping structure with useful downstream target tasks. We instantiate RoboCade on three manipulation tasks -- including spatial arrangement, scanning, and insertion. To illustrate the viability of gamified robot data collection, we collect a demonstration dataset through our platform, and show that co-training robot policies with this data can improve success rate on non-gamified target tasks (+16-56%). Further, we conduct a user study to validate that novice users find the gamified platform significantly more enjoyable than a standard non-gamified platform (+24%). These results highlight the promise of gamified data collection as a scalable, accessible, and engaging method for collecting demonstration data.</description>

      <title>Planar Juggling of a Devil-Stick using Discrete VHCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planar juggling of a devil-stick using impulsive inputs is addressed using the concept of discrete virtual holonomic constraints (DVHC). The location of the center-of-mass of the devil-stick is specified in terms of its orientation at the discrete instants when impulsive control inputs are applied. The discrete zero dynamics (DZD) resulting from the choice of DVHC provides conditions for stable juggling. A control design that enforces the DVHC and an orbit stabilizing controller are presented. The approach is validated in simulation.</description>

      <title>Motus: A Unified Latent Action World Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While a general embodied agent must function as a unified system, current methods are built on isolated models for understanding, world modeling, and control. This fragmentation prevents unifying multimodal generative capabilities and hinders learning from large-scale, heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose Motus, a unified latent action world model that leverages existing general pretrained models and rich, sharable motion information. Motus introduces a Mixture-of-Transformer (MoT) architecture to integrate three experts (i.e., understanding, video generation, and action) and adopts a UniDiffuser-style scheduler to enable flexible switching between different modeling modes (i.e., world models, vision-language-action models, inverse dynamics models, video generation models, and video-action joint prediction models). Motus further leverages the optical flow to learn latent actions and adopts a recipe with three-phase training pipeline and six-layer data pyramid, thereby extracting pixel-level "delta action" and enabling large-scale action pretraining. Experiments show that Motus achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation (a +15% improvement over X-VLA and a +45% improvement over Pi0.5) and real-world scenarios(improved by +11~48%), demonstrating unified modeling of all functionalities and priors significantly benefits downstream robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>RoboSafe: Safeguarding Embodied Agents via Executable Safety Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embodied agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly capable of executing complex real-world tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to hazardous instructions that may trigger unsafe behaviors. Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance.</description>
