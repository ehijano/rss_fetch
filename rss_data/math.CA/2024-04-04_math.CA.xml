      <title>Curves in the Fourier zeros of polytopal regions and the Pompeiu problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any finite union $P$ of interior-disjoint polytopes in ${\mathbb R}^d$ has the Pompeiu property, a result first proved by Williams [Wil76]. This means that if a continuous function $f$ on $R^d$ integrates to 0 on any congruent copy of $P$ then $f$ is identically 0. By a fundamental result of Brown, Schreiber and Taylor [BST73] this is equivalent to showing that the Fourier-Laplace transform of the indicator function of $P$ does not vanish identically on any 0-centered complex sphere in ${\mathbb C}^d$ . Our proof initially follows the recent one of Machado and Robins [MR23] who are using the Brion-Barvinok formula for the Fourier-Laplace transform of a polytope. But we simplify this method considerably by removing the use of properties of Bessel function zeros. Instead we use some elementary arguments on the growth of linear combinations of exponentials with rational functions as coefficients. Our approach allows us to prove the non-existence of complex spheres of any center in the zero-set of the Fourier-Laplace transform. The planar case is even simpler in that we do not even need the Brion-Barvinok formula. We then go further in the question of which sets can be contained in the null set of the Fourier-Laplace transform of a polytope by extending results of Engel [Eng23] who showed that rationally parametrized hypersurfaces, under some mild conditions, cannot be contained in this null-set. We show that a rationally parametrized curve which is not contained in an affine hyperplane in ${\mathbb C}^d$ cannot be contained in this null-set. Results about curves parametrized by meromorphic functions are also given.</description>

      <title>Fundamental inequalities for the iterated Fourier-cosine convolution with Gaussian weight and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Derived from the results in (Math. Nachr., 283(12):1758-1770, 2010), in this paper, we devoted to studying the boundedness properties for Fourier-cosine convolution weighted by Gaussian functions via Young's type theorem and Saitoh's type inequality. New norm estimations in the weighted space are obtained and application of the corresponding class of convolutions in Fredholm's second kind of integral equation is discussed. The conditions for the solvability of this equation in $L_1$ space are also found, along with the analysis of an illustrative example, which exemplifies that the present object and method solve cases that are not under the conditions of previously known techniques.</description>

      <title>The Beurling-Wintner problem for characteristic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.09779v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns a long-standing problem raised by Beurling and Wintner on completeness of the dilation system $\{\varphi(kx):k=1,2,\cdots\}$ generated by the odd periodic extension on $\mathbb{R}$ of any $\varphi\in L^2[0,1]$. Up to now there has been no explicit description of solutions of the Beurling-Wintner problem even for characteristic functions. We focus on characteristic function $\mathbf{1}_V$ of an open subset $V$ of $(0,1)$ where $V$ is the union of finitely many intervals with rational endpoints. Using substantially techniques from analytic number theory, we fully solved the Beurling-Wintner problem in most interesting situations and exhibit the explicit form of such $V$. As a consequence, it yields a complete solution for the rational version of Kozlov's problem. Moreover, we find that the Beurling-Wintner problem is closely related to the Twin Prime Conjecture and the Sophie Germain Prime Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Two weight Sobolev norm inequalities for fractional vector Riesz transforms and doubling weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a T1 theorem for fractional vector Riesz transforms mapping one weighted Sobolev space to another, where the weights are doubling measures on Euclidean space. Boundedness is characterized by the classical A_2 condition and two dual testing conditions on indicators of cubes. We also show the equivalence of various weighted Sobolev norms when the measure is doubling, something that fails in general.</description>

      <title>Continuations and bifurcations of relative equilibria for the positive curved three body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The positive curved three body problem is a natural extension of the planar Newtonian three body problem to the sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$. In this paper we study the extensions of the Euler and Lagrange Relative equilibria ($RE$ in short) on the plane to the sphere.
  The $RE$ on $\mathbb{S}^2$ are not isolated in general. They usually have one-dimensional continuation in the three-dimensional shape space. We show that there are two types of bifurcations. One is the bifurcations between Lagrange $RE$ and Euler $RE$. Another one is between the different types of the shapes of Lagrange $RE$. We prove that bifurcations between equilateral and isosceles Lagrange $RE$ exist for equal masses case, and that bifurcations between isosceles and scalene Lagrange $RE$ exist for partial equal masses case.</description>
