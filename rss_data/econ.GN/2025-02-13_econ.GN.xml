      <title>Analysis of energy, CO2 emissions and economy of the technological migration for clean cooking in Ecuador</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this study is to analyze the CO2 emissions and economic impacts of the implementation of the National Efficient Cooking Program (NECP) in Ecuador, which aims to migrate the population from Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)-based stoves to electric induction stoves. This program is rooted in the current effort to change Ecuador's energy balance, with hydroelectric power expected to generate 83.61% of national electricity by 2022, ending the need for subsidized LPG. For this analysis, the 2014 baseline situation has been compared with two future scenarios for 2022: a business-as-usual scenario and an NECP-success scenario. This study demonstrates the viability of migration from imported fossil fuels to locally-produced renewable energy as the basis for an efficient cooking facility. The new policies scenario would save US$ 1.162 billion in annual government expenditure on cooking subsidies, and reducing CO2 emissions associated to energy for cooking in 1.8 tCO2/y.</description>

      <title>Assessing the value of advanced computing infrastructure for supporting research: new tools to inform research policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: How much to invest in research facilities has long been a question in research policy and practice in higher education. This matter is time-sensitive due to critical financial challenges at institutions in the USA, with signs of significant problems in Europe. The purpose of this report is to present new techniques for assessment of one particular type of research infrastructure - computing facilities and staff that support research. These new approaches are timely because of the ongoing financial crises which may make it essential for institutions of higher education to make difficult decisions regarding research infrastructure.
  Principal results: We present recently developed methods for assessment of the economic and scientific value of investment in advanced computing facilities and services. Existing examples of these tools in use show that investment in advanced computing facilities and services contributes importantly to positive financial and academic outcomes for institutions of higher education. We present a format based on the Balanced Scorecard concept for summarizing such information.
  Conclusion: The methods presented here enable quantitative assessment of the relationship between investment in computing facilities and research and education outcomes. These methods should be of interest to research policy investigators and practitioners. The analysis methods described may be applied retroactively, making this report of potentially immediate value in setting research policies.</description>

      <title>Predicting Insurance Penetration Rate in Ghana Using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ghana records a low penetration of 1.05% compared to some of its African counterparts. For example South Africa, which has an insurance penetration rate of 17%, followed by Namibia which records 6.3%. This means, there is more room for improvement. More upsetting, with Ghana hovering around the 1% as at 2018, the rate works out to the small amount of Gross Domestic Product. This research seeks to model and forecast insurance penetration rate in Ghana using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average technique. The result indicates that ARIMA (3,1,0) is the appropriate model for insurance penetration in Ghana. Also, results from the forecast could serve as an advisory or the need to re-strategize as a country. Therefore, determining the future pattern of insurance penetration will lead to the remedies that will increase the number of insured in the future.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity in Sectoral Production and the Macro Effect of Sectoral Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of a negative sectoral shock on GDP depends on how important the shocked sector is as a direct and indirect supplier and how easily sectors can substitute inputs. Past estimates of the parameters that determine these qualities in the US have been restrictive: they have not been allowed to vary across industries or across time. This paper uses a novel empirical strategy to relax those restrictions, by exploiting variation in input expenditure share shifts within industries rather than across industries. The resulting estimates exhibit significant sectoral and temporal heterogeneity, and are dynamically correlated with weighted patents. In a calibrated GE model of multi-sector production, this heterogeneity (1) raises[lowers] the GDP effect of negative shocks to sectors whose customers are less[more] able to substitute inputs (e.g. the GDP effect of ``Chemical products'' shocks rises), (2) raises[lowers] the GDP effect of negative sectoral shocks in years where sectors are less[more] able to substitute inputs, and (3) raises[lowers] the GDP effect of negative shocks to sectors as they become more[less] central input suppliers (e.g. between 1997 and 2023 the GDP effect of ``Paper products'' shocks fell and the GDP effect of ``Computer and electronic products'' shocks rose due to changes in their importance as input suppliers).</description>

      <title>Better Together? A Field Experiment on Human-Algorithm Interaction in Child Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithm tools have the potential to improve public service efficiency, but our understanding of how experts use algorithms is limited, and concerns about resulting bias are widespread. We randomize access to algorithm support for workers allocating Child Protective Services (CPS) investigations. Access to the algorithm reduced maltreatment-related hospitalizations, especially for disadvantaged groups, while reducing CPS surveillance of Black children. Child injuries fell by 29 percent. Workers improved their scrutiny of complementary information emphasized by the algorithm, and targeted investigations to children at greater risk of harm irrespective of algorithm-predicted risk. Algorithm-only counterfactuals confirm human-algorithm complementarity for both efficiency and equity.</description>

      <title>Separating Advertising and Marketplace Functions of E-commerce Platforms: Is it Social Welfare Enhancing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of sponsored product listings in prominent positions of consumer search results has made e-commerce platforms, which traditionally serve as marketplaces for third-party sellers to reach consumers, a major medium for those sellers to advertise their products. On the other hand, regulators have expressed anti-trust concerns about an e-commerce platform's integration of marketplace and advertising functions; they argue that such integration benefits the platform and sellers at the expense of consumers and society and have proposed separating the advertising function from those platforms. We show, contrary to regulators' concerns, that separating the advertising function from the e-commerce platform benefits the sellers, hurts the consumers, and does not necessarily benefit the social welfare. A key driver of our findings is that an independent advertising firm, which relies solely on advertising revenue, has same or lesser economic incentive to improve targeting precision than an e-commerce platform that also serves as the advertising medium, even if both have the same ability to target consumers. This is because an improvement in targeting precision enhances the marketplace commission by softening the price competition between sellers, but hurts the advertising revenue by softening the competition for prominent ad positions.</description>

      <title>Human Learning about AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how people form expectations about the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) and consequences for AI adoption. Our main hypothesis is that people rely on human-relevant task features when evaluating AI, treating AI failures on human-easy tasks, and successes on human-difficult tasks, as highly informative of its overall performance. In lab experiments, we show that projection of human difficulty onto AI predictably distorts subjects' beliefs and can lead to suboptimal adoption, as failing human-easy tasks need not imply poor overall performance for AI. We find evidence for projection in a field experiment with an AI giving parenting advice. Potential users strongly infer from answers that are equally uninformative but less humanly-similar to expected answers, significantly reducing trust and future engagement. Our results suggest AI "anthropomorphism" can backfire by increasing projection and de-aligning people's expectations and AI performance.</description>

      <title>Regression coefficient estimation from remote sensing maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13659v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing map products are used to estimate regression coefficients relating environmental variables, such as the effect of conservation zones on deforestation. However, the quality of map products varies, and -- because maps are outputs of complex machine learning algorithms that take in a variety of remotely sensed variables as inputs -- errors are difficult to characterize. Thus, population-level estimates from such maps may be biased. In this paper, we apply prediction-powered inference (PPI) to regression coefficient estimation. PPI generates unbiased estimates by using a small amount of randomly sampled ground truth data to correct for bias in large-scale remote sensing map products. Applying PPI across multiple remote sensing use cases in regression coefficient estimation, we find that it results in estimates that are (1) more reliable than using the map product as if it were 100% accurate and (2) have lower uncertainty than using only the ground truth and ignoring the map product. Empirically, we observe effective sample size increases of up to 17-fold using PPI compared to only using ground truth data. This is the first work to estimate remote sensing regression coefficients without assumptions on the structure of map product errors.
