      <title>Adaptive integration of history variables in constrained mixture models for organ-scale growth and remodeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decades, many computational models have been developed to predict soft tissue growth and remodeling (G&amp;R). The constrained mixture theory describes fundamental mechanobiological processes in soft tissue G&amp;R and has been widely adopted in cardiovascular models of G&amp;R. However, even after two decades of work, large organ-scale models are rare, mainly due to high computational costs (model evaluation and memory consumption), especially in long-range simulations. We propose two strategies to adaptively integrate history variables in constrained mixture models to enable large organ-scale simulations of G&amp;R. Both strategies exploit that the influence of deposited tissue on the current mixture decreases over time through degradation. One strategy is independent of external loading, allowing the estimation of the computational resources ahead of the simulation. The other adapts the history snapshots based on the local mechanobiological environment so that the additional integration errors can be controlled and kept negligibly small, even in G&amp;R scenarios with severe perturbations. We analyze the adaptively integrated constrained mixture model on a tissue patch for a parameter study and show the performance under different G&amp;R scenarios. To confirm that adaptive strategies enable large organ-scale examples, we show simulations of different hypertension conditions with a real-world example of a biventricular heart discretized with a finite element mesh. In our example, adaptive integrations sped up simulations by a factor of three and reduced memory requirements to one-sixth. The reduction of the computational costs gets even more pronounced for simulations over longer periods. Adaptive integration of the history variables allows studying more finely resolved models and longer G&amp;R periods while computational costs are drastically reduced and largely constant in time.</description>

      <title>Effect of seaweed, moringa leaf extract and biofertilizer on growth, yield and fruit quality of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) under greenhouse condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This factorial experiment was conducted in a greenhouse during the period of May 3, 2021 to August 5, 2021 at the research farm belongs to the Horticulture Department, College of Agricultural Engineering Sciences, University of Sulaimani, Sulaimani, Iraq. The experiment was designed to study the effect of some biostimulants, individually and their combinations, on cucumber plants performance under greenhouse conditions; in addition to compare the results with of chemical fertilizers application. The treatments consisted of control (without adding any kinds of biostimulants) recommended dose of 100% chemical fertilizers (RDCF), seaweed extracts (SE), moringa leaf extract (MLE), bacterial-based biostimulant of Fulzym-plus (FP), that contains Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas putida, (SE+MLE), (SE+FP), (MLE+FP), and (SE+MLE+FP). The experiment was laid out in simple RCBD with 3 replications. The results showed that the application of different biostimulants, individually and their combinations, significantly improved the root growth characteristics. However, the highest values of lateral roots number per plant, lateral root length, lateral root diameter and root system dry weight were recorded by the application of recommended dose of chemical fertilizer (RDCF). While, this treatment was not different substantially with the triple combination of the tested biostimulants (SE+FP+MLE) in all studied root characteristics. In addition, untreated plants registered the minimum value of all the mentioned characters.</description>

      <title>Modeling Dense Multimodal Interactions Between Biological Pathways and Histology for Survival Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating whole-slide images (WSIs) and bulk transcriptomics for predicting patient survival can improve our understanding of patient prognosis. However, this multimodal task is particularly challenging due to the different nature of these data: WSIs represent a very high-dimensional spatial description of a tumor, while bulk transcriptomics represent a global description of gene expression levels within that tumor. In this context, our work aims to address two key challenges: (1) how can we tokenize transcriptomics in a semantically meaningful and interpretable way?, and (2) how can we capture dense multimodal interactions between these two modalities? Specifically, we propose to learn biological pathway tokens from transcriptomics that can encode specific cellular functions. Together with histology patch tokens that encode the different morphological patterns in the WSI, we argue that they form appropriate reasoning units for downstream interpretability analyses. We propose fusing both modalities using a memory-efficient multimodal Transformer that can model interactions between pathway and histology patch tokens. Our proposed model, SURVPATH, achieves state-of-the-art performance when evaluated against both unimodal and multimodal baselines on five datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our interpretability framework identifies key multimodal prognostic factors, and, as such, can provide valuable insights into the interaction between genotype and phenotype, enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms at play. We make our code public at: https://github.com/ajv012/SurvPath.</description>

      <title>General surgery vision transformer: A video pre-trained foundation model for general surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The absence of openly accessible data and specialized foundation models is a major barrier for computational research in surgery. Toward this, (i) we open-source the largest dataset of general surgery videos to-date, consisting of 680 hours of surgical videos, including data from robotic and laparoscopic techniques across 28 procedures; (ii) we propose a technique for video pre-training a general surgery vision transformer (GSViT) on surgical videos based on forward video prediction that can run in real-time for surgical applications, toward which we open-source the code and weights of GSViT; (iii) we also release code and weights for procedure-specific fine-tuned versions of GSViT across 10 procedures; (iv) we demonstrate the performance of GSViT on the Cholec80 phase annotation task, displaying improved performance over state-of-the-art single frame predictors.</description>
