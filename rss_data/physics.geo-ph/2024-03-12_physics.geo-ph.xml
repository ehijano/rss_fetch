      <title>Ensemble Kalman filter in geoscience meets model predictive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although data assimilation originates from control theory, the relationship between modern data assimilation methods in geoscience and model predictive control has not been extensively explored. In the present paper, I discuss that the modern data assimilation methods in geoscience and model predictive control essentially minimize the similar quadratic cost functions. Inspired by this similarity, I propose a new ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)-based method for controlling spatio-temporally chaotic systems, which can readily be applied to high-dimensional and nonlinear Earth systems. In this method, the reference vector, which serves as the control target, is assimilated into the state space as a pseudo-observation by ensemble Kalman smoother to obtain the appropriate perturbation to be added to a system. A proof-of-concept experiment using the Lorenz 63 model is presented. The system is constrained in one wing of the butterfly attractor without tipping to the other side by reasonably small control perturbations which are comparable with previous works.</description>

      <title>Energy dissipation in earthquakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earthquakes are rupture-like processes that propagate along tectonic faults and cause seismic waves. The propagation speed and final area of the rupture, which determine an earthquake's potential impact, are directly related to the nature and quantity of the energy dissipation involved in the rupture process. Here we present the challenges associated with defining and measuring the energy dissipation in laboratory and natural earthquakes across many scales. We discuss the importance and implications of distinguishing between energy dissipation that occurs close to and far behind the rupture tip and we identify open scientific questions related to a consistent modeling framework for earthquake physics that extends beyond classical Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics.</description>

      <title>The influence of orography and the direction of prevailing winds on precipitation distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The general circulation of the atmosphere (GCA) carries out a constant and unidirectional transfer of air masses, therefore its influence is manifested in the distribution of precipitation around the globe due to the occurrence of rain shadow behind mountain barriers. Over the territory of Russia, GCA manifests itself in the form of westerly winds, which cause a decrease in precipitation on the leeward side of the Ural Mountains and the Central Siberian Plateau. The contribution of the orographic component to the spatial variability of precipitation on average reaches 50-60% of the monthly precipitation amounts. Forecasting the magnitude of the orographic effect is close to predicting the transfer rates in GCA, the measurement of which has not yet been satisfactorily provided. A possible promising way to solve the problem is to develop special algorithms similar to those used for detecting Madden-Julian oscillations.</description>

      <title>Motifs in earthquake networks: Romania, Italy, United States of America, and Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed description of seismic activity in Romania, Italy, and Japan, as well as the California seismic zone in the United States of America, based on the statistical analysis of the underlying earthquake networks used to model the aforementioned zones. Our results on network connectivity and simple network motifs allow for a complex description of seismic zones, while at the same time reinforcing the current understanding of seismicity as a critical phenomenon. The reported distributions on node connectivity, three-, and four-event motifs are consistent with power-law, i.e., scale-free, distributions over large intervals and are robust across earthquake networks obtained from different discretizations of the seismic zones of interest. In our analysis of the distributions of node connectivity and simple motifs, we distinguish between the global distribution and the powerlaw part of it with the help of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method and complementary cumulative distribution functions (CCDF). The main message is that the distributions reported for the aforementioned seismic zones have large power-law components, extending over some orders of magnitude, independent of discretization. All the results were obtained using publicly-available databases and open-source software, as well as a new toolbox available on GitHub, specifically designed to automatically analyze earthquake databases.</description>

      <title>The impact of microscale physics in continuous time random walks for hydrodynamic dispersion in disordered media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continuous time random walk (CTRW) approach has been widely applied to model large-scale non-Fickian transport in the flow through disordered media. Often, the underlying microscopic transport mechanisms and disorder characteristics are not known, and their effect on large-scale solute dispersion is encoded by a heavy-tailed transition time distribution. Here we study how the microscale physics manifests in the CTRW framework, and how it affects solute dispersion. To this end, we consider transport in disordered media with random sorption and random flow properties. Both disorder mechanisms can give rise to anomalous particle transport. We present the CTRW models corresponding to each of these physical scenarios to discuss the different manifestations of microscale heterogeneity on large-scale dispersion depending on the particle injection modes. The combined impact of random sorption and advection is studied with a novel CTRW model that explicitly represents both microscale disorder mechanisms. While random advection and sorption may show similar large-scale transport behaviors, they can be clearly distinguished in their response to uniform injection conditions, and, in general, to initial particle distributions that are not flux-weighted. These findings highlight the importance of the microscale physics for the interpretation and prediction of anomalous dispersion phenomena in disordered media.</description>

      <title>Zonostrophic turbulence in the subsurface oceans of the Jovian and Saturnian moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to characterize the global circulation of the subsurface ocean of Jovian and Saturnian moons, we analyze the properties of 21 three-dimensional simulations of Boussinesq thermal convection in a rapidly rotating spherical shell. Flow is driven by an adverse temperature contrast imposed across the domain, and is subjected to no-slip boundary conditions. We cover a region of parameter space previously unexplored by global simulations, both in terms of rapid rotation and vigor of convective forcing, closer to, yet still admittedly far from, the conditions appropriate for the subsurface ocean of Ganymede, Europa, Enceladus, and Titan. Our most extreme simulations exhibit a dynamic global circulation that combines powerful east-west zonal jets, planetary waves, and vortices. A spectral analysis of the kinetic energy distribution performed in cylindrical geometry reveals a high degree of anisotropy of the simulated flows. Specifically, the axisymmetric zonal energy spectra follow a steep $-5$ slope in wavenumber space, with the energy amplitude exclusively controlled by the rotation rate. In contrast, the non-axisymmetric residual spectra display a gentle $-5/3$ slope, with the energy amplitude controlled by the thermal buoyancy input power. This spectral behavior conforms with the theory of zonostrophic turbulence and allows us to propose tentative extrapolations of these findings to the more extreme conditions of icy satellites. By assuming that kinetic energy dissipates via Ekman friction we predict an upper bound for the zonal velocity ranging from a few centimeters per second for Enceladus to about one meter per second for Ganymede, with residual velocities smaller than the zonal velocity by an order of magnitude on each moon. These predictions yield typical jets size approaching the ocean depth of Titan, Ganymede and Europa and $10$ to $40\%$ of the ocean depth on Enceladus.</description>
