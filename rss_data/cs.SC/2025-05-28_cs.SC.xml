      <title>Computing transcendence and linear relations of 1-periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A 1-period is a complex number given by the integral of a univariate algebraic function, where all data involved -- the integrand and the domain of integration -- are defined over algebraic numbers. We give an algorithm that, given a finite collection of 1-periods, computes the space of all linear relations among them with algebraic coefficients. In particular, the algorithm decides whether a given 1-period is transcendental, and whether two 1-periods are equal. This resolves, in the case of 1-periods, a problem posed by Kontsevich and Zagier, asking for an algorithm to decide equality of periods. The algorithm builds on the work of Huber and W\"ustholz, who showed that all linear relations among 1-periods arise from 1-motives; we make this perspective effective by reducing the problem to divisor arithmetic on curves and providing the theoretical foundations for a practical and fully explicit algorithm. To illustrate the broader applicability of our methods, we also give an algorithmic classification of autonomous first-order (non-linear) differential equations.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Black-Box Distributive Expanded Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a finite set of finitary operation symbols. An $\Omega$-expanded group is a group (written additively and called the additive group of the $\Omega$-expanded group) with an $\Omega$-algebra structure. We use the black-box model of computation in $\Omega$-expanded groups. In this model, elements of a finite $\Omega$-expanded group $H$ are represented (not necessarily uniquely) by bit strings of the same length, say, $n$. Given representations of elements of $H$, equality testing and the fundamental operations of $H$ are performed by an oracle.
  Assume that $H$ is distributive, i.e., all its fundamental operations associated with nonnullary operation symbols in $\Omega$ are distributive over addition. Suppose $s=(s_1,\dots,s_m)$ is a generating system of $H$. In this paper, we present probabilistic polynomial-time black-box $\Omega$-expanded group algorithms for the following problems: (i) given $(1^n,s)$, construct a generating system of the additive group of $H$, (ii) given $(1^n,s,(t_1,\dots,t_k))$ with $t_1,\dots,t_k\in H$, find a generating system of the additive group of the ideal in $H$ generated by $\{t_1,\dots,t_k\}$, and (iii) given $(1^n,s)$, decide whether $H\in\mathfrak V$, where $\mathfrak V$ is an arbitrary finitely based variety of distributive $\Omega$-expanded groups with nilpotent additive groups. The error probability of these algorithms is exponentially small in $n$. In particular, this can be applied to groups, rings, $R$-modules, and $R$-algebras, where $R$ is a fixed finitely generated commutative associative ring with $1$. Rings and $R$-algebras may be here with or without $1$, where $1$ is considered as a nullary fundamental operation.</description>
