      <title>Fast Algorithm for Calculating Probability of Chess Winning Streaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the controversy in the chess community, where Hikaru Nakamura, a renowned grandmaster, has posted multiple impressive winning streaks over the years on the online platform chess.com, we derive the probabilities of various types of streaks in online chess and/or other sports. Specifically, given the winning/drawing/losing probabilities of individual games, we derive the probabilities of "pure" winning streaks, non-losing streaks, and "in-between" streaks involving at most one draw over the course of games played in a period. The performance of the developed algorithms is examined through numerical studies.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Learn Trigonometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Primary Gasing Triangle, a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 1 unit, to define the primary trigonometric functions: sine and cosine. This triangle serves as the foundational element in a new approach to learning trigonometry, enabling us to derive the Derived Gasing Triangle, where the other four trigonometric functions (tangent, secant, cotangent, and cosecant) are defined. Using the Primary Gasing Triangle, we derive key trigonometric formulas, provide several proofs of the Pythagorean theorem using trigonometry, and solve various trigonometry problems. This approach makes learning trigonometry simpler, easier, and more intuitive.</description>

      <title>The Folding Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Origami is the art of paper folding, and it borrows its name from two Japanese words \emph{ori} and \emph{kami}. In Japanese, {ori} means folding, and the paper is called {kami}. While origami is just a hobby to most, there is a lot more to it. If you fold a square sheet of paper into any of the traditional origami model (for example the flapping bird) and unfold it, you can see crease patterns. These crease patterns tell us that there is a lot of geometry hidden behind the folds.
  In this article, we investigate the symbiotic relationship between mathematics and origami. The first part of this article explores the utility of origami in education. We will see how origami could become an effective way of teaching methods of geometry, mainly because of its experiential nature. Complex origami patterns cannot be created out of thin air. They usually involve understanding deep mathematical theories and the ability to apply them to paper folding. In the second part of the article, we attempt to provide a glimpse of this beautiful connection between origami and mathematics.</description>

      <title>A life in Mathematical Analysis: a conversation with Luigi Rodino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note is the transcription of an interview with Professor Luigi Rodino, on the occasion of the ISAAC-ICMAM Conference of Analysis in Developing Countries (December 2, 2024 - Bogot\`a), that was dedicated to him. Luigi Rodino is at present Emeritus Professor at the University of Turin, and a member of the Accademia delle Scienze di Torino.</description>

      <title>A survey of Zarankiewicz problems in geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03702</link>

Abstract: One of the central topics in extremal graph theory is the study of the function $ex(n,H)$, which represents the maximum number of edges a graph with $n$ vertices can have while avoiding a fixed graph $H$ as a subgraph. Tur{\'a}n provided a complete characterization for the case when $H$ is a complete graph on $r$ vertices. Erd{\H o}s, Stone, and Simonovits extended Tur{\'a}n's result to arbitrary graphs $H$ with $\chi(H) &gt; 2$ (chromatic number greater than 2). However, determining the asymptotics of $ex(n, H)$ for bipartite graphs $H$ remains a widely open problem. A classical example of this is Zarankiewicz's problem, which asks for the asymptotics of $ex(n, K_{t,t})$.
  In this paper, we survey Zarankiewicz's problem, with a focus on graphs that arise from geometry. Incidence geometry, in particular, can be viewed as a manifestation of Zarankiewicz's problem in geometrically defined graphs.</description>

      <title>Formalism 25</title>

Abstract: Abraham Robinson's philosophical stance has been the subject of several recent studies. Erhardt following Gaifman claims that Robinson was a finitist, and that there is a tension between his philosophical position and his actual mathematical output. We present evidence in Robinson's writing that he is more accurately described as adhering to the philosophical approach of Formalism. Furthermore, we show that Robinson explicitly argued {against} certain finitist positions in his philosophical writings. There is no tension between Robinson's mathematical work and his philosophy because mathematics and metamathematics are distinct fields: Robinson advocates finitism for metamathematics but no such restriction for mathematics. We show that Erhardt's analysis is marred by historical errors, by routine conflation of the generic and the technical meaning of several key terms, and by a philosophical {parti pris}. Robinson's Formalism remains a viable alternative to mathematical Platonism.</description>
