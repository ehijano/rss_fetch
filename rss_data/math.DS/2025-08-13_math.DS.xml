      <title>Limit cycles of piecewise smooth vector fields on torus with non-regular switching manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the maximum number of crossing limit cycles in piecewise-smooth vector fields on the two-dimensional torus, where the discontinuity set is the boundary of the fundamental square. Under the assumption of a polynomial first integral of degree n, we apply algebraic curve-intersection methods to obtain sharp upper bounds on cycle counts. In the quadratic case (n=2), we prove at most one cycle of type aa or bb and at most two of type aba or bab, and we give explicit parameter criteria for their existence. For general n, we show that cycles of type bb are bounded by n-1 and those of type aba by n(n-1). Finally, we construct concrete examples achieving these bounds, demonstrating their optimality.</description>

      <title>The $\alpha$-Cap Process: A Continuous Model for Random Geometric Networks of Binary Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent networks of binary neurons are a foundational concept in artificial intelligence. While these networks are traditionally assumed to be fully connected, complex dynamics can emerge when the graph structure is varied. One graph structure of particular interest is the geometric random graph, which models the spatial dependencies present in biological neural networks. In such classes of graphs, global state dependencies tend to complicate analysis, motivating the study of their dynamics in the continuum limit. In this work, we propose and analyze a continuous model for the evolution of binary neuron states in $\mathbb{R}^d$ via a function $\psi:\mathbb{R}^d\to[0,1]$ encoding the neural activity at a point. Our analysis encompasses a class of processes defined by convolution and sharpening; we demonstrate that, when evolved this process, the level sets of $\psi$ asymptotically converge to balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Notably, a special case of this process is the Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme for the motion of interfaces by mean curvature[MBO92], and we provide a novel analysis of its behavior. Our results establish a surprising connection between geometric random graphs and classical models of interface motion, offering new insights into the interplay between spatial structure and neural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for affine stochastic functional differential equations and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the existence and global stability of generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for affine stochastic functional differential equations. Various very basic and important properties are established. In the applications, we present a standard and rigorous procedure for guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of random equilibria for nonlinear stochastic functional differential equations, which attracts all pull-back trajectories in different types of convergence. Some examples are given to illustrate our main results. The results presented in this paper improve and simplify the conclusions of Jiang and Lv [{\it SIAM J. Control Optim.}, 54 (2016), pp. 2383-2402] and [{\it J. Differential Equations}, 367 (2023), pp. 890-921].</description>

      <title>Isochronal Phase Reduction and Speed Correction of a Pulse in a Stochastic Kinematic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method for computing the stochastic wave speed of pulse solutions in kinematic equations subject to small stochastic forcing based on the isochronal phase reduction. These kinematic equations arise as the singular limit of sharp pulse solutions in the FitzHugh-Nagumo system, and our approach contributes a new perspective and method to the growing body of work on stochastic wave propagation in excitable media. The method yields an effective It\^o process for the wave's position. The coefficients of the It\^o process can be computed deterministically allowing for efficient computation. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our method through numerical demonstrations.</description>

      <title>DeepWKB: Learning WKB Expansions of Invariant Distributions for Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning method, called DeepWKB, for estimating the invariant distribution of randomly perturbed systems via its Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation $u_\epsilon(x) = Q(\epsilon)^{-1} Z_\epsilon(x) \exp\{-V(x)/\epsilon\}$, where $V$ is known as the quasi-potential, $\epsilon$ denotes the noise strength, and $Q(\epsilon)$ is the normalization factor. By utilizing both Monte Carlo data and the partial differential equations satisfied by $V$ and $Z_\epsilon$, the DeepWKB method computes $V$ and $Z_\epsilon$ separately. This enables an approximation of the invariant distribution in the singular regime where $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small, which remains a significant challenge for most existing methods. Moreover, the DeepWKB method is applicable to higher-dimensional stochastic systems whose deterministic counterparts admit non-trivial attractors. In particular, it provides a scalable and flexible alternative for computing the quasi-potential, which plays a key role in the analysis of rare events, metastability, and the stochastic stability of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Impacts of the duration and intensity of grazing cycle on vegetation population dynamics in semi-arid ecosystems with seasonal succession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel vegetation model involving seasonal succession to distinguish the dryperiod, growth period and grazing period is proposed. The main aim is to explore the effects of duration and intensity of grazing season on the dynamic behaviors of a single vegetation population and the competitive outcomes between two competing vegetation species. The critical duration of drought period and grazing period that enable the persistence of a single vegetation population is obtained. Further, we found that both the duration andi ntensity of grazing significantly impact the competitive outcomes between two vegetation populations. Numerical examples are performed to validate our theoretical results and in particular to obtain the bifurcation diagram for the duration of dry season and grazing period.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish multiple recurrence results for pretentious measure-preserving multiplicative actions along generalized Pythagorean triples, that is, solutions to the equation $ax^2 + b y^2 = c z^2$. This confirms the ergodic-theoretic form of the generalized Pythagorean partition regularity conjecture in this critical case of structured measure-preserving actions. As a consequence of our main theorem, any finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ generated by the level sets of finitely many pretentious completely multiplicative functions, must contain a monochromatic generalized Pythagorean triple.</description>

      <title>A Rigorous Floquet Approach to Parabolic PDEs, with Applications to Walking Droplet Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet theory provides a powerful tool for studying time-periodic dynamics, allowing the stability and long-time behavior of any periodic, linear ODE to be recast in terms of a linear time-invariant system. However, except when dealing with Hilbert spaces or certain well-behaved classes of operators, Floquet theory cannot be rigorously applied to PDEs without dimensional reduction. We describe a simple, rigorous extension of Floquet theory to a wide class of parabolic PDEs on Banach spaces, enabling direct application with minimal changes from the classical theory.
  To demonstrate the utility of the extended Floquet formalism, we investigate the statistics of 'walking droplets': millimetric oil droplets that self-propel over the surface of a vibrating oil bath. Walking droplets exhibit striking, emergent statistical patterns that are not yet fully understood. For instance, a widespread correspondence has been observed between the statistics of the droplet and the time-average of its guiding wave, but it has only been proved rigorously for a single droplet in an unbounded domain of uniform depth (Durey, Milewski, and Bush, 2018). We apply our Floquet results to derive the droplet-wave statistical correspondence in a highly general case, allowing for arbitrary geometries, multiple droplet interactions, and non-resonant droplet bouncing. Beyond walking droplets, our framework provides a versatile tool for analyzing periodic PDEs more broadly, with promising applications to tidal flows and nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) models under daily cycles.</description>

      <title>Directed Cycles as Higher-Order Units of Information Processing in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directed cycles form the fundamental motifs in natural, social and artificial networks, yet their distinct computational roles remain under-explored, particularly in the context of higher-order structure and function. In this work, we investigate how two types of directed cycles - feedforward and feedback - can act as higher-order structures to facilitate the flow and integration of information in sparse random networks, and how these roles depend on the environment of the cycles. Using information-theoretic measures, we show that network size, sparsity and relative directionality critically impact the information-processing capacities of directed cycles. In a network with no-preferred global direction, a feedforward cycle enables greater information flow and a feedback cycle allows for increased information integration. The relative direction of a feedforward cycle as well as the structural incoherence it induces, determines its capacity to generate higher-order behaviour. Finally, we demonstrate that introducing feedback loops into otherwise feedforward architectures increases the diversity of network activity patterns. These findings suggest that directed cycles serve as computational motifs with local information processing capabilities that depend on the structure they are embedded. Using directed cycles, we highlight the interdependence between higher-order structures and the higher-order order behaviour they can induce in the network dynamics.</description>

      <title>Detectability via observability in a nonuniform framework: dual relationship with controllability and stabilizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a new observability property for nonautonomous linear control systems in finite dimension: the nonuniform complete observability, which is more general than the uniform complete observability. A dual relationship is established between this new notion of observability and the recently defined nonuniform complete controllability property, with the aim of obtaining the main result, which proves that nonuniform complete observability guarantees the nonuniform exponential detectability, a concept related to exponential stability in this framework.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the random dynamical system $f_\omega^n$ generated by a family of maps $\{f_{\omega_0}: \mathbb{S}^1 \to \mathbb{S}^1\}_{\omega_0 \in [-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]},$ $f_{\omega_0}(x) = \alpha \xi (x+\omega_0) +a\ (\mathrm{mod }\ 1),$ where $\xi: \mathbb S^1 \to \mathbb R$ is a non-degenerated map, $a\in [0,1)$, and $\alpha,\varepsilon&gt;0$. Fixing a constant $c\in (0,1)$, we show that for $\alpha$ sufficiently large and for $\varepsilon &gt; \alpha^{-1+c},$ the random dynamical system $f_\omega^n$ presents a random Young tower structure and quenched decay of correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the synchronization behavior of discrete-time Markov chains on countable state spaces. Representing a Markov chain in terms of a random dynamical system, which describes the collective dynamics of trajectories driven by the same noise, allows for the characterization of synchronization via random attractors.
  We establish the existence and uniqueness of a random attractor under mild conditions and show that forward and pullback attraction are equivalent in our setting. Additionally, we provide a sufficient condition for reaching the random attractor, or synchronization respectively, in a time of finite mean.
  By introducing insulated and synchronizing sets, we structure the state space with respect to the synchronization behavior and characterize the size of the random attractor.</description>

      <title>Measures of Systems of Oscillators and Properties of Trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of trajectories in harmonic oscillator systems equipped with a point, absolutely continuous, or singular measure. As demonstrated in [30], infinite-dimensional linear flows of countable oscillator systems exhibit a new class of trajectory behavior. Specifically, these trajectories are non-periodic, and their projections onto any four-dimensional symplectic subspace fail to be dense in the corresponding projection of the invariant torus. Such trajectories do not arise in finite-dimensional systems, are non-generic for countable oscillator systems, but become generic in the continual case. We prove that for a countable harmonic oscillator system, every point on a non-degenerate invariant torus is a non-wandering point of the flow. In contrast, for a continual system with an absolutely continuous measure, all points on such a torus are wandering. Furthermore, for continual systems with a singular measure, we establish sufficient conditions on the measure and torus that rule out the existence of both transitive trajectories and non-wandering points. As an application, we exhibit a class of singular Bernoulli measures satisfying these conditions.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stabilisation of Unstable Periodic Orbits of the Three-Body Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many different models of the physical world exhibit chaotic dynamics, from fluid flows and chemical reactions to celestial mechanics. The study of the three-body problem (3BP) and its many different families of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) have provided fundamental insight into chaotic dynamics as far back as the 19th century. The 3BP, a conservative system, is inherently challenging to sample due to its volume-preservation property. In this paper we present an interpretable data-driven approach for the state-dependent control of UPOs in the 3BP, through leveraging the inherent sensitivity of chaos and the local manifold structure. We overcome the sampling challenge by utilising prior knowledge of UPOs and a novel augmentation strategy. This enables sample-efficient discovery of a verifiable and accurate local Poincar\'{e} map in as few as 55 data points. We suggest that the Poincar\'{e} map is best discovered at a surface of section where the norm of the monodromy matrix, i.e. the local sensitivity to small perturbations, is the smallest. To stabilise the UPOs, we apply small velocity impulses once each period, determined by solving a convex system of linear matrix inequalities based on the linearised map. We constrain the norm of the decision variables used to solve this system, resulting in locally optimal velocity impulses directed along the local stable manifold. Critically, this behaviour is achieved in a computationally efficient manner. We demonstrate this sample-efficient and low-energy method across several orbit families in the 3BP, with potential applications ranging from robotics and spacecraft control to fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Red noise in continuous-time stochastic modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of time-correlated noise is important to applied stochastic modelling. Nevertheless, there is no generally agreed-upon definition of the term red noise in continuous-time stochastic modelling settings. We present here a rigorous argumentation for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process integrated against time ($U_t \mathrm{d} t$) as a uniquely appropriate red noise implementation. We also identify the term $\mathrm{d}U_t$ as an erroneous formulation of red noise commonly found in the applied literature. To this end, we prove a theorem linking properties of the power spectral density (PSD) to classes of It\^{o}-differentials. The commonly ascribed red noise attribute of a PSD decaying as $S(\omega)\sim\omega^{-2}$ restricts the range of possible It\^{o}-differentials $\mathrm{d}Y_t=\alpha_t\mathrm{d} t+\beta_t\mathrm{d} W_t$. In particular, any such differential with continuous, square-integrable integrands must have a vanishing martingale part, i.e. $\mathrm{d}Y_t=\alpha_t\mathrm{d} t$ for almost all $t\geq 0$. We further point out that taking $(\alpha_t)_{t\geq 0}$ to be an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process constitutes a uniquely relevant model choice due to its Gauss-Markov property. The erroneous use of the noise term $\mathrm{d} U_t$ as red noise and its consequences are discussed in two examples from the literature.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected semisimple real algebraic group. We prove that limit cones vary continuously under deformations of Anosov subgroups of $G$ under a certain convexity assumption, which turns out to be necessary. We apply this result to the notion of sharpness for the action of a discrete subgroup on a non-Riemannian homogeneous space. Finally, we show that, within the space of Anosov representations, the growth indicator, the critical exponents, and the Hausdorff dimension of limit sets (with respect to an appropriate non-Riemannian metric) all vary continuously.</description>

      <title>(Non)displaceability in semitoric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adapt and generalize McDuff's method of probes from toric system to so called semitoric integrable systems and apply it to study the (non)displaceability properties of the fibers of $3$ examples of semitoric integrable systems.</description>

      <title>A dynamical systems approach to WKB-methods: The eigenvalue problem for a single well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the eigenvalue problem of the one-dimensional Schr{\"o}dinger equation for smooth single well potentials. In particular, we provide a new interpretation of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization formula. A novel aspect of our results, which are based on recent work of the authors on the turning point problem based upon dynamical systems methods, is that we cover all eigenvalues $E\in [0,\mathcal O(1)]$ and show that the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantitization formula approximates all of these eigenvalues (in a sense that is made precise). At the same time, we provide rigorous smoothness statements of the eigenvalues as functions of $\epsilon$. We find that whereas the small eigenvalues $E=\mathcal O(\epsilon)$ are smooth functions of $\epsilon$, the large ones $E=\mathcal O(1)$ are smooth functions of $n\epsilon \in[c_1,c_2],\,0&lt;c_1&lt;c_2&lt;\infty$, and $0\le \epsilon^{1/3}\ll 1$; here $n\in \mathbb N_0$ is the index of the eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Changing the ranking in eigenvector centrality of a weighted graph by small perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider eigenvector centrality for the nodes of a graph and study the robustness (and stability) of this popular centrality measure. For a given weighted graph {\mathcal G} (both directed and undirected), we consider the associated weighted adjacency matrix A, which by definition is a non-negative matrix. The eigenvector centralities of the nodes of {\mathcal G} are the entries of the Perron eigenvector of A, which is the (positive) eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue with largest modulus. They provide a ranking of the nodes according to the corresponding centralities. An indicator of the robustness of eigenvector centrality consists in looking for a nearby perturbed graph \widetilde{\mathcal G}, with the same structure as {\mathcal G} (i.e., with the same vertices and edges), but with a weighted adjacency matrix \widetilde A such that the highest m entries (m \ge 2) of the Perron eigenvector of \widetilde A coalesce, making the ranking at the highest level ambiguous. To compute a solution to this matrix nearness problem, a nested iterative algorithm is proposed that makes use of a constrained gradient system of matrix differential equations in the inner iteration and a one-dimensional optimization of the perturbation size in the outer iteration. The proposed algorithm produces the {\em optimal} perturbation (i.e., the one with smallest Frobenius norm) of the A which causes the looked-for coalescence, which is a measure of the sensitivity of the graph. Our numerical experiments indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms more standard approaches based on algorithms for constrained optimization. The methodology is formulated in terms of graphs but applies to any nonnegative matrix, with potential applications in fields like population models, consensus dynamics, economics, etc.</description>

      <title>More counterexamples to Lagrangian Poincar\'e recurrence in dimension four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In earlier work, we constructed counterexamples to Lagrangian Poincar\'e recurrence for many toric symplectic four manifolds. Here we provide a few more examples extending the family of counterexamples to include all non-monotone toric symplectic four manifolds.
