      <title>Enhanced One-Color-Two-Photon Resonant Ionization in Highly Charged Ions by Fine-Structure Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraintense pulses from X-ray free-electron lasers can drive, within femtoseconds, multiple processes in the inner shells of atoms and molecules in all phases of matter. The ensuing complex ionization pathways of outer-shell electrons from the neutral to the final highly charged states make a comparison with theory enormously difficult. We resolve these pathways by preparing highly charged ions in an electron beam ion trap before exposing them to the pulsed radiation. This reveals how relativistic fine-structure effects shift electronic energies, largely compensate the core-screening potential, and enable the consecutive, resonant absorption of two quasi-monochromatic X-ray photons that would generally be unfeasible. This doubly-resonant channel enhances the efficiency of two-photon ionization by more than two orders of magnitude, dominating in this regime the nonlinear interaction of light and matter with possible application for future precision X-ray metrology.</description>

      <title>Rotational Splittings in Diatomic Molecules of Interest to Searches for New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diatomic molecules with an energetically low-lying $^3 \Delta_1$ state are attractive platforms to detect new physics beyond the Standard Model, such as parity- and time-reversal violating phenomena. One of the advantages of using a $^3 \Delta_1$ state is its tiny $\Lambda$-splitting due to the coupling between the electronic and rotational angular momenta, which facilitates polarizing the molecules in small external electric fields. Theoretical estimation of the magnitude of the $\Lambda$-splitting is helpful for planning new experiments. In this study, we present a theoretical model to calculate the $\Lambda$-splitting. Our model integrates the relativistic four-component wavefunction and the traditional rotational Hamiltonian based on Hund's case (a). The multireference character of the wavefunction is taken into account. Our calculations for PtH and ThF$^+$ molecules qualitatively agree with experiment. The $\Lambda$-splitting of TaO$^+$ for the rotational ground state is predicted to be around 9 kHz. This tiny splitting can reduce the systematic uncertainty, but in a practical experiment, it may cause depolarization during rotation ramp-up.</description>

      <title>Restricted-Geometry Quantum Models Beyond Atoms: Application to NSDI in Diatomic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a (1+1)-dimensional quantum model designed to describe nonsequential double ionization (NSDI) in homonuclear diatomic molecules exposed to strong linearly polarized laser fields. Extending the restricted-geometry framework previously developed for atomic systems, our approach captures key features of NSDI, including the characteristic knee structure in double ionization yields. Despite its simplifying assumptions, the model shows good agreement with experimental data and proves particularly suitable for systems with $\sigma$-type orbital symmetry. It offers a computationally efficient tool for exploring multi-electron dynamics in molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Sagnac Tractor Atom Interferometer on Photonic Integrated Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the theory of, and propose an experimental design for, a Sagnac tractor atom interferometer based on a photonic integrated circuit (PIC). The atoms are trapped in counter-rotating azimuthal optical lattices, formed by interfering evanescent fields of laser modes injected into circular PIC waveguides. We develop quantum models for the radial and azimuthal dynamics of the interfering atoms in adiabatic frames, which provide computational efficiency. The theory is applied to an exemplary PIC, for which we first compute field modes and atom trapping potentials for $^{87}$Rb. We then evaluate non-adiabaticity, fidelity, and sensitivity of the exemplary PIC.</description>

      <title>Real-time magnetic field noise correction using trapped-ion monitor qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a trapped-ion protocol in which a nearby, dedicated "monitor" qubit tracks magnetic-field drifts in real time without interrupting data-qubit operations. Using two $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ ions and the optical--metastable--ground architecture, we encode the data qubit in the ground-state manifold and the monitor qubit in a metastable-state manifold to achieve spectral separation. The monitor qubit senses common magnetic fluctuations during data-qubit experiments, enabling feedforward corrections to the qubit-control drives. Under applied magnetic noise with a realistic spectrum ($1/f^{2}$), the protocol maintains coherence and, when compared with interleaved calibration, it extends usable data-qubit probe times by up to a factor of ${\sim}\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the experimental duty cycle. These results establish monitor qubits as a scalable tool for real-time recalibration in quantum information processors.</description>

      <title>Helios: A 98-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on Quantinuum Helios, a 98-qubit trapped-ion quantum processor based on the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture. Helios features $^{137}$Ba$^{+}$ hyperfine qubits, all-to-all connectivity enabled by a rotatable ion storage ring connecting two quantum operation regions by a junction, speed improvements from parallelized operations, and a new software stack with real-time compilation of dynamic programs. Averaged over all operational zones in the system, we achieve average infidelities of $2.5(1)\times10^{-5}$ for single-qubit gates, $7.9(2)\times10^{-4}$ for two-qubit gates, and $4.8(6)\times10^{-4}$ for state preparation and measurement, none of which are fundamentally limited and likely able to be improved. These component infidelities are predictive of system-level performance in both random Clifford circuits and random circuit sampling, the latter demonstrating that Helios operates well beyond the reach of classical simulation and establishes a new frontier of fidelity and complexity for quantum computers.</description>

      <title>3D-printed components for electron-ion trapping: Tests of functionality and ultra-high vacuum compatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the ultra-high vacuum compatibility of a microwave-driven electron trap and an atomic oven (for atomic beam generation) fabricated through 3D printing via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). The trap integrates into a coaxial microwave cavity, enabling stable, narrow-band, high-amplitude oscillations of the electric field at the electrodes. The design also supports simultaneous trapping of ions. The oven performs well in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environments without significant outgassing. In addition to achieving the UHV regime for 3D-printed components, pressure variations and their potential impact on electron-ion trapping experiments were investigated over a month. Our results show that experiments with electrons photodetached from trapped and laser-cooled ions are feasible with the trap and oven manufactured by the L-PBF method. These findings establish a foundation for future experiments in microwave detection and the study of low-energy ion-electron interactions at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Protecting collective qubits from non-Markovian dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collectively-encoded qubits, involving ensembles of atomic or solid-state emitters, present many practical advantages for quantum technologies. However, they suffer from uncontrolled inhomogeneous dephasing which couples them to a quasi-continuum of dark states. In most cases, this process cannot be encompassed in a standard master equation with time-independent coefficients, making its description either tedious or inaccurate. We show that it can be understood as a displacement in time-frequency phase space and accurately included in resource-efficient numerical simulations of the qubit's dynamics. This description unveils a regime where the qubit becomes protected from dephasing through a combination of strong driving and non-Markovianity. We experimentally investigate this regime using a Rydberg superatom and extend its coherent dynamics beyond the inhomogeneous-dephasing characteristic time by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Topological order in symmetric blockade structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bottom-up design of strongly interacting quantum materials with prescribed ground state properties is a highly nontrivial task, especially if only simple constituents with realistic two-body interactions are available on the microscopic level. Here we study two- and three-dimensional structures of two-level systems that interact via a simple blockade potential in the presence of a coherent coupling between the two states. For such strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, we introduce the concept of blockade graph automorphisms to construct symmetric blockade structures with strong quantum fluctuations that lead to equal-weight superpositions of tailored states. Drawing from these results, we design a quasi-two-dimensional periodic quantum system that - as we show rigorously - features a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid as its ground state. Our construction is based on the implementation of a local symmetry on the microscopic level in a system with only two-body interactions.</description>
