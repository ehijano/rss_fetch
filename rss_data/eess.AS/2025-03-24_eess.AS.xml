      <title>From Faces to Voices: Learning Hierarchical Representations for High-quality Video-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this study is to generate high-quality speech from silent talking face videos, a task also known as video-to-speech synthesis. A significant challenge in video-to-speech synthesis lies in the substantial modality gap between silent video and multi-faceted speech. In this paper, we propose a novel video-to-speech system that effectively bridges this modality gap, significantly enhancing the quality of synthesized speech. This is achieved by learning of hierarchical representations from video to speech. Specifically, we gradually transform silent video into acoustic feature spaces through three sequential stages -- content, timbre, and prosody modeling. In each stage, we align visual factors -- lip movements, face identity, and facial expressions -- with corresponding acoustic counterparts to ensure the seamless transformation. Additionally, to generate realistic and coherent speech from the visual representations, we employ a flow matching model that estimates direct trajectories from a simple prior distribution to the target speech distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves exceptional generation quality comparable to real utterances, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>SeniorTalk: A Chinese Conversation Dataset with Rich Annotations for Super-Aged Seniors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While voice technologies increasingly serve aging populations, current systems exhibit significant performance gaps due to inadequate training data capturing elderly-specific vocal characteristics like presbyphonia and dialectal variations. The limited data available on super-aged individuals in existing elderly speech datasets, coupled with overly simple recording styles and annotation dimensions, exacerbates this issue. To address the critical scarcity of speech data from individuals aged 75 and above, we introduce SeniorTalk, a carefully annotated Chinese spoken dialogue dataset. This dataset contains 55.53 hours of speech from 101 natural conversations involving 202 participants, ensuring a strategic balance across gender, region, and age. Through detailed annotation across multiple dimensions, it can support a wide range of speech tasks. We perform extensive experiments on speaker verification, speaker diarization, speech recognition, and speech editing tasks, offering crucial insights for the development of speech technologies targeting this age group.</description>

      <title>Imagine to Hear: Auditory Knowledge Generation can be an Effective Assistant for Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models pretrained on text-only corpora often struggle with tasks that require auditory commonsense knowledge. Previous work addresses this problem by augmenting the language model to retrieve knowledge from external audio databases. This approach has several limitations, such as the potential lack of relevant audio in databases and the high costs associated with constructing and querying the databases. To address these issues, we propose Imagine to Hear, a novel approach that dynamically generates auditory knowledge using generative models. Our framework detects multiple audio-related textual spans from the given prompt and generates corresponding auditory knowledge. We develop several mechanisms to efficiently process multiple auditory knowledge, including a CLAP-based rejection sampler and a language-audio fusion module. Our experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on AuditoryBench without relying on external databases, highlighting the effectiveness of our generation-based approach.</description>

      <title>Learning disentangled representations for instrument-based music similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A flexible recommendation and retrieval system requires music similarity in terms of multiple partial elements of musical pieces to allow users to select the element they want to focus on. A method for music similarity learning using multiple networks with individual instrumental signals is effective but faces the problem that using each clean instrumental signal as a query is impractical for retrieval systems and using separated instrumental sounds reduces accuracy owing to artifacts. In this paper, we present instrumental-part-based music similarity learning with a single network that takes mixed sounds as input instead of individual instrumental sounds. Specifically, we designed a single similarity embedding space with disentangled dimensions for each instrument, extracted by Conditional Similarity Networks, which are trained using the triplet loss with masks. Experimental results showed that (1) the proposed method can obtain more accurate feature representation than using individual networks using separated sounds as input in the evaluation of an instrument that had low accuracy, (2) each sub-embedding space can hold the characteristics of the corresponding instrument, and (3) the selection of similar musical pieces focusing on each instrumental sound by the proposed method can obtain human acceptance, especially when focusing on timbre.</description>

      <title>CLAPSep: Leveraging Contrastive Pre-trained Model for Multi-Modal Query-Conditioned Target Sound Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17455v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal sound separation (USS) aims to extract arbitrary types of sounds from real-world recordings. This can be achieved by language-queried target sound extraction (TSE), which typically consists of two components: a query network that converts user queries into conditional embeddings, and a separation network that extracts the target sound accordingly. Existing methods commonly train models from scratch. As a consequence, substantial data and computational resources are required to make the randomly initialized model comprehend sound events and perform separation accordingly. In this paper, we propose to integrate pre-trained models into TSE models to address the above issue. To be specific, we tailor and adapt the powerful contrastive language-audio pre-trained model (CLAP) for USS, denoted as CLAPSep. CLAPSep also accepts flexible user inputs, taking both positive and negative user prompts of uni- and/or multi-modalities for target sound extraction. These key features of CLAPSep can not only enhance the extraction performance but also improve the versatility of its application. We provide extensive experiments on 5 diverse datasets to demonstrate the superior performance and zero- and few-shot generalizability of our proposed CLAPSep with fast training convergence, surpassing previous methods by a significant margin. Full codes and some audio examples are released for reproduction and evaluation.</description>

      <title>Language-Queried Target Sound Extraction Without Parallel Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language-queried target sound extraction (TSE) aims to extract specific sounds from mixtures based on language queries. Traditional fully-supervised training schemes require extensively annotated parallel audio-text data, which are labor-intensive. We introduce a parallel-data-free training scheme, requiring only unlabelled audio clips for TSE model training by utilizing the contrastive language-audio pre-trained model (CLAP). In a vanilla parallel-data-free training stage, target audio is encoded using the pre-trained CLAP audio encoder to form a condition embedding, while during testing, user language queries are encoded by CLAP text encoder as the condition embedding. This vanilla approach assumes perfect alignment between text and audio embeddings, which is unrealistic. Two major challenges arise from training-testing mismatch: the persistent modality gap between text and audio and the risk of overfitting due to the exposure of rich acoustic details in target audio embedding during training. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented strategy. Specifically, we create an embedding cache using audio captions generated by a large language model (LLM). During training, target audio embeddings retrieve text embeddings from this cache to use as condition embeddings, ensuring consistent modalities between training and testing and eliminating information leakage. Extensive experiment results show that our retrieval-augmented approach achieves consistent and notable performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art with better generalizability.</description>

      <title>OmniFlow: Any-to-Any Generation with Multi-Modal Rectified Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce OmniFlow, a novel generative model designed for any-to-any generation tasks such as text-to-image, text-to-audio, and audio-to-image synthesis. OmniFlow advances the rectified flow (RF) framework used in text-to-image models to handle the joint distribution of multiple modalities. It outperforms previous any-to-any models on a wide range of tasks, such as text-to-image and text-to-audio synthesis. Our work offers three key contributions: First, we extend RF to a multi-modal setting and introduce a novel guidance mechanism, enabling users to flexibly control the alignment between different modalities in the generated outputs. Second, we propose a novel architecture that extends the text-to-image MMDiT architecture of Stable Diffusion 3 and enables audio and text generation. The extended modules can be efficiently pretrained individually and merged with the vanilla text-to-image MMDiT for fine-tuning. Lastly, we conduct a comprehensive study on the design choices of rectified flow transformers for large-scale audio and text generation, providing valuable insights into optimizing performance across diverse modalities. The Code will be available at https://github.com/jacklishufan/OmniFlows.</description>

      <title>Offload Rethinking by Cloud Assistance for Efficient Environmental Sound Recognition on LPWANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning-based environmental sound recognition has emerged as a crucial method for ultra-low-power environmental monitoring in biological research and city-scale sensing systems. These systems usually operate under limited resources and are often powered by harvested energy in remote areas. Recent efforts in on-device sound recognition suffer from low accuracy due to resource constraints, whereas cloud offloading strategies are hindered by high communication costs. In this work, we introduce ORCA, a novel resource-efficient cloud-assisted environmental sound recognition system on batteryless devices operating over the Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), targeting wide-area audio sensing applications. We propose a cloud assistance strategy that remedies the low accuracy of on-device inference while minimizing the communication costs for cloud offloading. By leveraging a self-attention-based cloud sub-spectral feature selection method to facilitate efficient on-device inference, ORCA resolves three key challenges for resource-constrained cloud offloading over LPWANs: 1) high communication costs and low data rates, 2) dynamic wireless channel conditions, and 3) unreliable offloading. We implement ORCA on an energy-harvesting batteryless microcontroller and evaluate it in a real world urban sound testbed. Our results show that ORCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to $80 \times$ in energy savings and $220 \times$ in latency reduction while maintaining comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>NotaGen: Advancing Musicality in Symbolic Music Generation with Large Language Model Training Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18008v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce NotaGen, a symbolic music generation model aiming to explore the potential of producing high-quality classical sheet music. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), NotaGen adopts pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning paradigms (henceforth referred to as the LLM training paradigms). It is pre-trained on 1.6M pieces of music in ABC notation, and then fine-tuned on approximately 9K high-quality classical compositions conditioned on "period-composer-instrumentation" prompts. For reinforcement learning, we propose the CLaMP-DPO method, which further enhances generation quality and controllability without requiring human annotations or predefined rewards. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CLaMP-DPO in symbolic music generation models with different architectures and encoding schemes. Furthermore, subjective A/B tests show that NotaGen outperforms baseline models against human compositions, greatly advancing musical aesthetics in symbolic music generation.</description>

      <title>United we stand, Divided we fall: Handling Weak Complementary Relationships for Audio-Visual Emotion Recognition in Valence-Arousal Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio and visual modalities are two predominant contact-free channels in videos, which are often expected to carry a complementary relationship with each other. However, they may not always complement each other, resulting in poor audio-visual feature representations. In this paper, we introduce Gated Recursive Joint Cross Attention (GRJCA) using a gating mechanism that can adaptively choose the most relevant features to effectively capture the synergic relationships across audio and visual modalities. Specifically, we improve the performance of Recursive Joint Cross-Attention (RJCA) by introducing a gating mechanism to control the flow of information between the input features and the attended features of multiple iterations depending on the strength of their complementary relationship. For instance, if the modalities exhibit strong complementary relationships, the gating mechanism emphasizes cross-attended features, otherwise non-attended features. To further improve the performance of the system, we also explored a hierarchical gating approach by introducing a gating mechanism at every iteration, followed by high-level gating across the gated outputs of each iteration. The proposed approach improves the performance of RJCA model by adding more flexibility to deal with weak complementary relationships across audio and visual modalities. Extensive experiments are conducted on the challenging Affwild2 dataset to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach. By effectively handling the weak complementary relationships across the audio and visual modalities, the proposed model achieves a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of 0.561 (0.623) and 0.620 (0.660) for valence and arousal respectively on the test set (validation set).</description>
