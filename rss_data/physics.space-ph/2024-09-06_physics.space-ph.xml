      <title>Emergence of two inertial sub-ranges in solar wind turbulence: dependence on heliospheric distance and solar activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar wind is highly turbulent, and intermittency effects are observed for fluctuations within the inertial range. By analyzing magnetic field spectra and fourth-order moments, we perform a comparative study of intermittency in different types of solar wind measured during periods of solar minima and a maximum. Using eight fast solar wind intervals measured during solar minima between 0.3 au and 3.16 au, we found a clear signature of two inertial sub-ranges with $f^{-3/2}$ and $f^{-5/3}$ power laws in the magnetic power spectra. The intermittency, measured through the scaling law of the kurtosis of magnetic field fluctuations, further confirms the existence of two different power laws separated by a clear break. A systematic study on the evolution of the said sub-ranges as a function of heliospheric distance shows correlation of the break scale with both the turbulence outer scale and the typical ion scales. During solar maximum, we analyzed five intervals for each of Alfv\'enic fast, Alfv\'enic slow and non-Alfv\'enic slow solar wind. Unlike the case during the solar minima, the two sub-ranges are no longer prominent and the Alfv\'enic slow wind is found to be in an intermediate state of turbulence compared to that of the fast wind and the usual non-Alfv\'enic slow wind.</description>

      <title>Electron shock drift acceleration at a low-Mach-number, low-plasma-beta quasi-perpendicular shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shock drift acceleration plays an important role in generating high-energy electrons at quasi-perpendicular shocks, but its efficiency in low beta plasmas is questionable. In this article, we perform a two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation of a low-Mach-number low-plasma-beta quasi-perpendicular shock, and find that the electron cyclotron drift instability is unstable at the leading edge of the shock foot, which is excited by the relative drift between the shock-reflected ions and the incident electrons. The electrostatic waves triggered by the electron cyclotron drift instability can scatter and heat the incident electrons, which facilitates them to escape from the shock's loss cone. These electrons are then reflected by the shock and energized by shock drift acceleration. In this way, the acceleration efficiency of shock drift acceleration at low-plasma-beta quasi-perpendicular shocks is highly enhanced.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray north-south anisotropy: rigidity spectrum and solar cycle variations observed by ground-based muon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The north-south (NS) anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) is dominated by a diamagnetic drift flow of GCRs in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), allowing us to derive key parameters of cosmic-ray propagation, such as the density gradient and diffusion coefficient. We propose a new method to analyze the rigidity spectrum of GCR anisotropy and reveal a solar cycle variation of the NS anisotropy's spectrum using ground-based muon detectors in Nagoya, Japan, and Hobart, Australia. The physics-based correction method for the atmospheric temperature effect on muons is used to combine the different-site detectors free from local atmospheric effects. NS channel pairs in the multi-directional muon detectors are formed to enhance sensitivity to the NS anisotropy, and in this process, general graph matching in graph theory is introduced to survey optimized pairs. Moreover, Bayesian estimation with the Gaussian process allows us to unfold the rigidity spectrum without supposing any analytical function for the spectral shape. Thanks to these novel approaches, it has been discovered that the rigidity spectrum of the NS anisotropy is dynamically varying with solar activity every year. It is attributed to a rigidity-dependent variation of the radial density gradient of GCRs based on the nature of the diamagnetic drift in the IMF. The diffusion coefficient and mean-free-path length of GCRs as functions of the rigidity are also derived from the diffusion-convection flow balance. This analysis expands the estimation limit of the mean-free-path length into $\le200$ GV rigidity region from $&lt;10$ GV region achieved by solar energetic particle observations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the magnetic and thermal evolution of a coronal jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal jets are the captivating eruptions which are often found in the solar atmosphere, and primarily formed due to magnetic reconnection. Despite their short-lived nature and lower energy compared to many other eruptive events, e.g. flares and coronal mass ejections, they play an important role in heating the corona and accelerating charged particles. However, their generation in the ambience of non-standard flare regime is not fully understood, and warrant a deeper investigation, in terms of their onset, growth, eruption processes, and thermodynamic evolution. Toward this goal, this paper reports the results of a data-constrained three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation of an eruptive jet; initialized with a Non-Force-Free-Field (NFFF) extrapolation and carried out in the spirit of Implicit Large Eddy Simulation (ILES). The simulation focuses on the magnetic and dynamical properties of the jet during its onset, and eruption phases, that occurred on February 5, 2015 in an active region NOAA AR12280, associated with a seemingly three-ribbon structure. In order to correlate its thermal evolution with computed energetics, the simulation results are compared with differential emission measurement (DEM) analysis in the vicinity of the jet. Importantly, this combined approach provides an insight to the onset of reconnection in transients in terms of emission and the corresponding electric current profiles from MHD evolutions. The presented study captures the intricate topological dynamics, finds a close correspondence between the magnetic and thermal evolution in and around the jet location. Overall, it enriches the understanding of the thermal evolution due to MHD processes, which is one of the broader aspects to reveal the coronal heating problem.</description>

      <title>Latitudinal dependence of variations in the frequencies of solar oscillations above the acoustic cut-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At high frequencies beyond the acoustic cut-off, a peak-like structure is visible in the solar power spectrum. Known as the pseudo-modes, their frequencies have been shown to vary in anti-phase with solar magnetic activity. In this work, we determined temporal variations in these frequencies across the solar disc, with the aim of identifying any potential latitudinal dependence of pseudo-mode frequency shifts. We utilised nearly 22 years of spatially resolved GONG data for all azimuthal orders, $\textit{m}$, for harmonic degrees 0 $\leq$ $\textit{l}$ $\leq$ 200, and determined shifts using the resampled periodogram method. Periodogram realisations were created from overlapping, successive 216d-long segments in time, and cropped to 5600-6800$\mu$Hz. Cross-correlation functions were then repeatedly generated between these realisations to identify any variation in frequency and the uncertainty. We categorised each mode by its latitudinal sensitivity and used this categorisation to produce average frequency shifts for different latitude bands (15$^\circ$ and 5$^\circ$ in size) which were compared to magnetic proxies, the $F_{\mathrm{10.7}}$ index and GONG synoptic maps. Morphological differences in the pseudo-mode shifts between different latitudes were found, which were most pronounced during the rise to solar maximum where shifts reach their minimum values. At all latitudes, shift behaviour was strongly in anti-correlation with the activity proxy. Additionally, periodicities shorter than the 11-year cycle were observed. Wavelet analysis was used to identify a periodicity of four years at all latitudes.</description>

      <title>Mixed Source Region Signatures Inside Magnetic Switchback Patches Inferred by Heavy Ion Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since Parker Solar Probe's (Parker's) first perihelion pass at the Sun, large amplitude Alfv\'en waves grouped in patches have been observed near the Sun throughout the mission. Several formation processes for these magnetic switchback patches have been suggested with no definitive consensus. To provide insight to their formation, we examine the heavy ion properties of several adjacent magnetic switchback patches around Parker's 11th perihelion pass capitalizing on a spacecraft lineup with Solar Orbiter where each samples the same solar wind streams over a large range of longitudes. Heavy ion properties (Fe/O, C$^{6+}$/C$^{5+}$, O$^{7+}$/O$^{6+}$) related to the wind's coronal origin, measured with Solar Orbiter can be linked to switchback patch structures identified near the Sun with Parker. We find that switchback patches do not contain distinctive ion and elemental compositional signatures different than the surrounding non-switchback solar wind. Both the patches and ambient wind exhibit a range of fast and slow wind qualities, indicating coronal sources with open and closed field lines in close proximity. These observations and modeling indicate switchback patches form in coronal hole boundary wind and with a range of source region magnetic and thermal properties. Furthermore, the heavy ion signatures suggest interchange reconnection and/or shear driven processes may play a role in their creation.</description>

      <title>In situ observations of large amplitude Alfv\'en waves heating and accelerating the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After leaving the Sun's corona, the solar wind continues to accelerate and cools, but more slowly than expected for a freely expanding adiabatic gas. We use in situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter spacecrafts to investigate a stream of solar wind as it traverses the inner heliosphere. The observations show heating and acceleration of the the plasma between the outer edge of the corona and near the orbit of Venus, in connection to the presence of large amplitude Alfv\'en waves. Alfv\'en waves are perturbations in the interplanetary magnetic field that transport energy. Our calculations show the damping and mechanical work performed by the Alfv\'en waves is sufficient to power the heating and acceleration of the fast solar wind in the inner heliosphere.</description>
