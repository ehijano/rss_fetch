      <title>Feasibility Study of Measuring $\Lambda^0\to n\pi^{0}$ Using a High-Granularity Zero-Degree Calorimeter at the Future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Key measurements at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), including first-of-their-kind studies of kaon structure, require the detection of $\Lambda^0$ at forward angles. We present a feasibility study of $\Lambda^0 \to n\pi^0$ measurements using a high-granularity Zero Degree Calorimeter to be located about 35 m from the interaction point. We introduce a method to address the unprecedented challenge of identifying $\Lambda^0$s with energy $O(100)$ GeV that produce displaced vertices of $O(10)$ m. In addition, we present a reconstruction approach using graph neural networks. We find that the energy and angle resolution for $\Lambda^0$ is similar to that for neutrons, both of which meet the requirements outlined in the EIC Yellow Report.Furthermore, we estimate performance for measuring the neutron's direction in the $\Lambda^0$ rest frame, which reflects the $\Lambda^0$ spin polarization. We estimate that the neutral-decay channel $\Lambda^0 \to n\pi^0$ will greatly extend the measurable energy range for the charged-decay channel $\Lambda^0 \to p\pi^-$, which is limited by the location of small-angle trackers and the accelerator magnets. This work paves the way for EIC studies of kaon structure and spin phenomena.</description>

      <title>Recent ALICE results relevant for PDFs at low and high-$x$, saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present recent results from the ALICE Collaboration on the study of coherent and incoherent J/$\psi$ photoproduction in ultra-peripheral Pb-Pb collisions, including results from exclusive and dissociate J/$\psi$ mesons in ultra-peripheral p-Pb interactions. These measurements provide unique insights into the initial state of protons and ions, with great sensitivity for both gluon saturation and shadowing. Furthermore, we will discuss the prospects for these measurements using the Run 3 and Run 4 data.</description>

      <title>Deuteron-${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ scattering using nucleon-${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ optical potentials fitted to four-body amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deuteron-${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ reactions in the 15 to 40 MeV range are studied using a three-body model where the constructed nonlocal optical potentials rely on rigorous nucleon-${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ scattering calculations. The differential cross section for the elastic scattering and neutron transfer reaction is predicted quite well up to 90 deg scattering angles. The importance of the Pauli term in complex potentials is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Supernova Detection at SNOLAB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos carry most of the energy released by a core-collapse supernova. SNOLAB has two neutrino-capable detectors, SNO+ and HALO, that have complementary neutrino flavour sensitivities. SNOLAB is also host to existing facilities, or plans to host future projects, that can enhance sensitivity to these neutrinos. These detectors, together with others worldwide both in existence and planned, will provide insights to a variety of different models using neutrinos from the next galactic supernova.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic jet broadening and jet shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of jet substructure as a way of probing phenomena which break the isotropic behavior of jets, such as jet propagation through an anisotropically flowing quark-gluon plasma or spin correlations. We introduce two novel observables for this purpose: the azimuthal-dependent jet broadening and the azimuthal-dependent jet shape, which generalize the traditional isotropic substructure studies. Using Soft-Collinear Effective Theory, we explicitly calculate the jet functions associated with these observables with a standard jet axis and with a Winner-Take-All jet axis in both the resummed and fixed order limits. While our analysis first and foremost establishes the formalism for the azimuthal-dependent jet substructure, it also brings to light new results for jet substructure in the azimuthally integrated case, such as the semi-inclusive jet function and the exclusive jet shape for the Winner-Take-All axis, and the jet broadening in the fixed order region. As an illustrative example for the new formalism we demonstrate that the azimuthal-dependent jet broadening can be used as a direct probe of the transversity parton distribution function in deep inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>QCD factorization with multihadron fragmentation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Important aspects of QCD factorization theorems are the properties of the objects involved that can be identified as universal. One example is that the definitions of parton densities and fragmentation functions for different types of hadrons differ only in the identity of the nonperturbative states that form the matrix elements, but are otherwise the same. This leads to independence of perturbative calculations on nonperturbative details of external states. It also lends support to interpretations of correlation functions as encapsulations of intrinsic nonperturbative properties. These characteristics have usually been presumed to still hold true in fragmentation functions even when the observed nonperturbative state is a small-mass cluster of $n$ hadrons rather than simply a single isolated hadron. However, the multidifferential aspect of cross sections that rely on these latter types of fragmentation functions complicates the treatment of kinematical approximations in factorization derivations. That has led to recent claims that the operator definitions for fragmentation functions need to be modified from the single hadron case with nonuniversal prefactors. With such concerns as our motivation, we retrace the steps for factorizing the unpolarized semi-inclusive $e^+e^-$ annihilation cross section and confirm that they do apply without modification to the case of a small-mass multihadron observed in the final state. In particular, we verify that the standard operator definition from single hadron fragmentation, with its usual prefactor, remains equally valid for the small-mass $n$-hadron case with the same hard parts and evolution kernels, whereas the more recently proposed definitions with nonuniversal prefactors do not. Our results reaffirm the reliability of most past phenomenological applications of dihadron fragmentation functions.</description>

      <title>Laser-Induced Quenching of the Th-229 Nuclear Clock Isomer in Calcium Fluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 10-minute radiative lifetime of the first excited $^{229}$Th$^{4+}$ nuclear state in ionic crystals provides narrow spectroscopic linewidths, enabling the realization of a solid-state nuclear clock. Due to the 4+ noble gas configuration, electronic readout or state initialization schemes known from atomic clocks are inaccessible. This elongates the interrogation cycle, which will deteriorate the clock performance. To address this limitation we demonstrate laser-induced quenching (LIQ) as a method of depumping the $^{229}$Th isomer population in CaF$_2$. We provide experimental evidence for LIQ at different wavelengths (148 - 420 nm) and temperatures (100 - 350 K), achieving a threefold reduction in the isomer lifetime with 20 mW of laser power.</description>

      <title>Nuclear density dependence of polarization transfer in quasi-elastic ${\rm A}(\vec{e},e' \vec{p})$ reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ratio of the transverse and longitudinal component of polarization transfer to protons in the quasi-elastic $(\vec{e}, e^{\prime} \vec{p}\,)$ reaction, $P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z$, is sensitive to the proton's electromagnetic form factor ratio, $G_E/G_M$. To explore density-dependent in-medium modifications, a comparison of polarization transfer ratios involving protons from distinct nuclear shells, each with different local nuclear densities, has been proposed. In this study, we present such comparisons between four shells, $1s_{1/2}$, $1p_{3/2}$ in $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ and $1d_{3/2}$, $2s_{1/2}$ in $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}$. In an effort to account for other many-body effects that may differ between shells, we use a state-of-the-art relativistic distorted-wave impulse-approximation (RDWIA) calculation and present the double ratios, $(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm Data}/(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm RDWIA}$ as well as the super ratios, $\left[(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm A}/(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm B}\right]_{\rm Data}/\left[(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm A}/(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm B}\right]_{\rm RDWIA}$, for chosen shells A and B, as a function of effective local nuclear densities. We find that double ratios for individual shells show a dependence on the probed effective nuclear densities. Studying the ratios, we observed a systematic variation between pairs of higher- and lower-density shells.</description>

      <title>Competition between allowed and first-forbidden $\beta$ decay in $r$-process waiting-point nuclei within a relativistic beyond-mean-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute $\beta$-decay half-lives of isotonic nuclear chains located at neutron shell closures $N=50$, $82$, $126$ and $184$, which are of particular importance for the $r$-process nucleosynthesis, and study the role of first-forbidden transitions in a framework that includes complex nucleonic correlations beyond the quasiparticle random phase approximation. Such correlations are accounted for by coupling single nucleons to collective degrees of freedom (nuclear vibrations), and are found essential to reproduce available experimental $\beta$-decay rates and more precise many-body methods. We find that the nucleon-vibration correlations tend to decrease the probability of decay via first-forbidden transition near stability, as they enhance Gamow-Teller transitions at low energy. While in the lighter systems allowed transitions dominate, the decay of $N=126$ and $N=184$ nuclei is found to occur to a large extent via first-forbidden transitions, and in particular those induced by $1^-$ and $0^-$ operators. Overall the many-body method based on nucleon-vibration coupling provides an ideal framework for future large-scale calculations. Upcoming experimental measurements of $\beta$-decay rates in the $N=126$ region by radioactive-beam facilities will be crucial in order to validate the approach.</description>

      <title>A simple model to investigate jet quenching and correlated errors for centrality-dependent nuclear-modification factors in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply Bayesian techniques to compare a simple, empirical model for jet-quenching in heavy-ion collisions to centrality-dependent jet-$R_{AA}$ measured by ATLAS for Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$~TeV. We find that the $R_{AA}$ values for central collisions are adequately described with a model for the mean $p_T$-dependent jet energy-loss using only 2-parameters. This model is extended by incorporating 2D initial geometry information from TRENTO and compared to centrality-dependent $R_{AA}$ values. We find that the results are sensitive to value of the jet-quenching formation time, $\tau_f$, and that the optimal value of $\tau_f$ varies with the assumed path-length dependence of the energy-loss. We construct a covariance error matrix for the data from the $p_T$ dependent contributions to the ATLAS systematic errors and perform Bayesian calibrations for several different assumptions for the systematic error correlations. We show that most-probable functions and $\chi^2$ values are sensitive to assumptions made when fitting to correlated errors.</description>
