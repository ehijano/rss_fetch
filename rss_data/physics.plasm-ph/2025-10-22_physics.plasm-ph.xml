      <title>Carrier envelope phase and laser pulse shape effects on Schwinger vacuum pair production in super-Gaussian asymmetric electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of carrier envelope phase and laser pulse shape on electron-positron pair production in the presence of an external asymmetric super-Gaussian electric field by solving the quantum Vlasov equation. By varying the field asymmetry, the pulse shape from Gaussian to super-Gaussian, and the carrier envelope phase, we show the momentum distribution and the number density of created pairs to exhibit extreme sensitivity to these field characteristics. The effects are also qualitatively explained by analyzing the turning-point structures within the WKB formalism. We observed that multiphoton pair production dominates in the case of long falling-pulse asymmetry. For a short falling pulse with a flat-top super-Gaussian laser profile, pair production is further facilitated. For certain field parameters, we demonstrate that the number density can be enhanced by two to three orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of a Multicusp-Assisted Inductively-Coupled Radio-Frequency Plasma Source for Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a detailed characterisation of a multicusp-assisted inductively coupled RF plasma source for plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). Using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and RF-compensated Langmuir probe diagnostics, we measured ion temperature T i and drift velocity v z in argon plasmas near an immersed electrode. The multicusp configuration enhances plasma density at low pressure, enabling stable operation down to 0.8 mTorr. Timeaveraged measurements show no detectable perturbation near the pulsed electrode, indicating full plasma recovery between high-voltage pulses. LIF-derived potential profiles match Riemann's presheath theory, and ion velocity distributions reveal acceleration consistent with sheath dynamics. These results support the use of LIF for steady-state characterisation of the bulk and presheath regions in PIII systems.</description>

      <title>Experimental and numerical investigation of suprathermal electron dynamics using vertical electron cyclotron emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) is equipped with an advanced set of diagnostics for studying suprathermal electron dynamics. Among these, the vertical electron cyclotron emission (VECE) diagnostic offers valuable insights into the electron energy distribution by measuring electron cyclotron emission (ECE) along a vertical line-of-sight. However, reconstructing the electron distribution from ECE measurements is inherently challenging due to harmonic overlap and thermal radiation noise. A more practical approach leverages forward modeling of ECE based on kinetic simulations. To this end, we introduce YODA, a novel synthetic ECE diagnostic framework that simulates emission and (re)absorption of electron cyclotron radiation for arbitrary electron distributions and antenna geometries. The framework is validated against the well-established synthetic ECE code SPECE, using an ohmic TCV discharge as a reference case. In this study, the 3D bounce-averaged Fokker-Planck code LUKE is used to model electron distributions in two electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD) experiments. The synthetic spectra generated using the combined LUKE-YODA framework successfully reproduce the main features of the experimental VECE measurements in both simulated discharges. The combination of kinetic and synthetic ECE simulations allow the identification of the features in the electron distribution function which give rise to certain signatures in the VECE signal.</description>

      <title>Electron Acceleration via Lower-Hybrid Drift Instability in Astrophysical Plasmas: Dependence on Plasma Beta and Suprathermal Electron Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density inhomogeneities are ubiquitous in space and astrophysical plasmas, particularly at magnetic reconnection sites, shock fronts, and within compressible turbulence. The gradients associated with these inhomogeneous plasma regions serve as free energy sources that can drive plasma instabilities, including the lower-hybrid drift instability (LHDI). Notably, lower-hybrid waves are frequently observed in magnetized space plasma environments, such as Earth's magnetotail and magnetopause. Previous studies have primarily focused on modeling particle acceleration via LHDI in these regions using a quasilinear approach. This study expands the investigation of LHDI to a broader range of environments, spanning weakly to strongly magnetized media, including interplanetary, interstellar, intergalactic, and intracluster plasmas. To explore the applicability of LHDI in various astrophysical settings, we employ two key parameters: (1) plasma magnetization, characterized by the plasma beta parameter, and (2) the spectral slope of suprathermal electrons following a power-law distribution. Using a quasilinear model, we determine the critical values of plasma beta and spectral slope that enable efficient electron acceleration via LHDI by comparing the rate of growth of instability and the damping rate of the resulting fluctuations. We further analyze the time evolution of the electron distribution function to confirm these critical conditions. Our results indicate that electron acceleration is generally most efficient in low-beta plasmas ($\beta &lt; 1$). However, the presence of suprathermal electrons significantly enhances electron acceleration via LHDI, even in high-beta plasmas ($\beta &gt; 1$). Finally, we discuss the astrophysical implications of our findings, highlighting the role of LHDI in electron acceleration across diverse plasma environments.</description>

      <title>PCMS: Parallel Coupler For Multimodel Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Parallel Coupler for Multimodel Simulations (PCMS), a new GPU accelerated generalized coupling framework for coupling simulation codes on leadership class supercomputers. PCMS includes distributed control and field mapping methods for up to five dimensions. For field mapping PCMS can utilize discretization and field information to accommodate physics constraints. PCMS is demonstrated with a coupling of the gyrokinetic microturbulence code XGC with a Monte Carlo neutral transport code DEGAS2 and with a 5D distribution function coupling of an energetic particle transport code (GNET) to a gyrokinetic microturbulence code (GTC). Weak scaling is also demonstrated on up to 2,080 GPUs of Frontier with a weak scaling efficiency of 85%.</description>

      <title>Radiation reaction effects on particle dynamics in intense counterpropagating laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-intensity laser-plasma interactions, particles can lose a substantial fraction of their energy by emitting radiation. Using particle-in-cell simulations, we study the impact of radiation reaction on the dynamics of an underdense plasma target struck by counterpropagating circularly polarized laser pulses. By varying the relative wavelengths and intensities of the pulses, we find a range of parameters where radiation reaction can detrap electrons from the interference beat wave. The resulting charge separation field and the dominant direction of ion expulsion are thus reversed by radiative effects. Based on the electron dynamics during the interaction, we estimate the bounds on the parameter regime where the reversal occurs. The bounds take the form of three simple inequalities which depend only on the wavelength, normalized vector potential, and pulse duration ratios of the two lasers as well as the product of the pulse duration with a dimensionless radiation reaction parameter. Our estimates, which predict whether radiation reaction will change the final ion direction for a given set of laser parameters, broadly agree with the simulated results. Finally, we outline an experimental procedure by which the reversal could be used to observe the transition to radiation-dominated dynamics.</description>

      <title>The impact of kinetic and global effects on ballooning 2nd stable pedestals of conventional and low aspect ratio tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The EPED model [P.B. Snyder et al 2011 Nucl. Fusion 51 103016] had success describing the pedestals of the Type-I ELM and QH-mode operations in conventional tokamaks, by combining kinetic ballooning mode (KBM) and peeling-ballooning (PB) constraints. Within EPED, the KBM constraint is usually approximated by the ideal ballooning mode (IBM) stability threshold. It has been noted that quantitative differences between local ideal MHD and gyro-kinetic (GK) ballooning stability can be larger at low aspect ratio. KBM critical pedestals are consistent with observations in initial studies on conventional and spherical tokamaks. In this work, the application of a reduced model for the calculation of the kinetic ballooning stability boundary is presented based on a novel and newly developed Gyro-Fluid System (GFS) code [G.M. Staebler et al 2023 Phys. Plasmas 30 102501]. GFS is observed to capture KBMs in DIII-D as well as the NSTX(-U) pedestals, opening a route integrating this model into EPED. Finally, high-n global ballooning modes are observed to limit the access to the local 2nd stability and thus provide a transport mechanism that constrains the width evolution with beta_p,ped. The high-n global ballooning stability is approximated by its ideal MHD analogue using ELITE. It is shown that nearly local high-n with k_y*rho_s~1/2 modes can provide a proxy for the critical beta_p,ped when a 2nd stable access exists on DIII-D plasmas. The use of GFS and ELITE scaling in EPED provided an improved agreement in comparison to EPED1 with DIII-D pedestal data.</description>

      <title>Experimental and numerical study on Following Streamer mechanism for SF6 breakdown induced by floating linear metal particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently proposed Following Streamer mechanism (Feng et al. 2025 Phys. Rev. Applied 23 064039) seeks to explain how floating metal particles induce SF6 streamer breakdown in the combined gap. This mechanism is derived from a 2D axisymmetric fluid model, which has limitations in describing multiple streamer events in real-world 3D scenarios. To validate the Following Streamer mechanism, we experimentally investigate the discharge morphology of SF6 streamers induced by a floating linear metal particle under negative pulsed voltage. The results are then compared with those from 2D axisymmetric fluid simulations. The comparison reveals both consistencies and discrepancies. Regarding consistencies, experimentally observed features-such as streamer inception at both ends of the metal particle and the formation of subsequent following streamers-support the general idea of the Following Streamer mechanism. Regarding discrepancies, the experiments show a larger number of following streamers and off-axis propagation paths, which cannot be described in the 2D simulation. For scientific rigor, an extended physical model was proposed to improve the description of the Following Streamer mechanism.</description>

      <title>Geometric scaling of laser-driven proton focusing from hemispherical foils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically characterize the focusing behavior of laser-driven proton beams from hemispherical targets of various diameters using mesh radiography. The proton focal location is inferred to be near the geometrical center for the smallest tested hemisphere ($\Psi=D_{hemi}/D_{Laser}=6.1$). However, larger hemispheres ($\Psi=14.6$) degrade the focusing behavior and behave more like flat foils with focal location significantly inside the hemisphere. We also infer a tight virtual focus of $9\pm3~\mu$m through a mesh transition analysis.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification of a multi-component Hall thruster model at varying facility pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference is applied to calibrate and quantify prediction uncertainty in a coupled multi-component Hall thruster model. The model consists of cathode, discharge, and plume sub-models and outputs thruster performance metrics, one-dimensional plasma properties, and the angular distribution of the current density in the plume. The simulated thrusters include a magnetically shielded thruster operating on krypton, the H9, and an unshielded thruster operating on xenon, the SPT-100, at pressures between 4.3--43 $\mu$Torr-Kr and 1.7--80 $\mu$Torr-Xe, respectively. After calibration, the model captures key pressure-related trends, including changes in thrust and upstream shifts in the ion acceleration region. Furthermore, the model exhibits predictive accuracy to within 10\% when evaluated on flow rates and pressures not included in the training data, and can predict some performance characteristics across test facilities to within the same range of conditions. Compared to a previous model calibrated on some of the same data [Eckels et al. 2024], the model reduced predictive errors in thrust and discharge current by greater than 50%. An extrapolation to on-orbit performance is performed with an error of 9%, capturing trends in discharge current but not thrust. These findings are discussed in the context of using data for predictive Hall thruster modeling in the presence of facility effects.</description>
