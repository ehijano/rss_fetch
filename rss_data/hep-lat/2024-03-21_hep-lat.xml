      <title>Magnetic Moment of $\Xi_b(6227)$ as Molecular Pentaquark State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation of $\Xi_b(6227)$ state, in this study considering $\Xi_b(6227)$ has a molecular structure, we calculate magnetic moment of this state in quark model. The magnetic moment of a hadron gives valuable information about the internal structure and shape deformations. We observe that orbital excitation of $\Xi_b(6227)$ molecular state change the results of magnetic moment significantly. We also observe that light quarks in $\Xi_b(6227)$ molecular state determine magnetic moment. Measurement of the magnetic moment of $\Xi_b(6227)$ can clarify the nature of this state and be useful to identify the quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>Approximate SU(5), Fine Structure Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We fit the three finestructure constants of the Standard Model with three, in first approximation theoretically estimable parameters, 1) a "unifiedscale",turning out not equal to the Planck scale and thus only estimable by a very speculative story, 2) a "number of layers" being a priori the number of families, and 3) a unified coupling related to a critical coupling on a lattice. So formally we postdict the three fine structure constants! In the philosophy of our model there is a physically lattice theory with link variables taking values in a (or in the various) "small" representations of the Standard Model Group. We argue for that these representations functio in first approximation as were the theory a genuine $SU(5)$ theory. Next we take into account fluctuation of the gauge fields in the lattice and obtain a correction to the a priori $SU(5)$ approximation, because of course the link fluctuations not corresponding any Standard model Lie algebra, but only to the SU(5), do not exist. The model is a development of our old anti-grand-unification model having as its genuine gauge group, close to fundamental scale, a cross product of the standard model group S(U(3)x U(2)) with itself, there being one Cartesian product factor for each family. In these old works we included the hypotesis of "multiple point criticallity principle" which here effectively means the coupling constants be critical on the lattice. Counted relative to the Higgs scale we suggest the in our sense "unified scale" (where the deviations between the inverse fine structure constants deviate by quantum fluctuations being only from standard model groups, not SU(5)) makes up the 2/3 th power of the Planck scale relative to the Higgs scale, or better the top quark mass scale.</description>

      <title>Generalized Free Conformal Field Theories at Infinite Temperature -- In memory of Iwasaki-sensei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can space-time symmetries such as Lorentz, dilatation, or conformal symmetry be recovered at infinite temperature? To address this question, we study correlation functions of generalized free conformal field theories (a.k.a free holographic theories in thermal AdS space-time) at infinite temperature. We show that they are broken at the leading order in bosonic correlation functions, but a non-trivial scaling symmetry may emerge.</description>

      <title>Qu8its for Quantum Simulations of Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the utility of $d=8$ qudits, qu8its, for quantum simulations of the dynamics of 1+1D SU(3) lattice quantum chromodynamics, including a mapping for arbitrary numbers of flavors and lattice size and a re-organization of the Hamiltonian for efficient time-evolution. Recent advances in parallel gate applications, along with the shorter application times of single-qudit operations compared with two-qudit operations, lead to significant projected advantages in quantum simulation fidelities and circuit depths using qu8its rather than qubits. The number of two-qudit entangling gates required for time evolution using qu8its is found to be more than a factor of five fewer than for qubits. We anticipate that the developments presented in this work will enable improved quantum simulations to be performed using emerging quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Randomized measurement protocols for lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized measurement protocols, including classical shadows, entanglement tomography, and randomized benchmarking are powerful techniques to estimate observables, perform state tomography, or extract the entanglement properties of quantum states. While unraveling the intricate structure of quantum states is generally difficult and resource-intensive, quantum systems in nature are often tightly constrained by symmetries. This can be leveraged by the symmetry-conscious randomized measurement schemes we propose, yielding clear advantages over symmetry-blind randomization such as reducing measurement costs, enabling symmetry-based error mitigation in experiments, allowing differentiated measurement of (lattice) gauge theory entanglement structure, and, potentially, the verification of topologically ordered states in existing and near-term experiments. Crucially, unlike symmetry-blind randomized measurement protocols, these latter tasks can be performed without relearning symmetries via full reconstruction of the density matrix.</description>

      <title>Anomalies in Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The currently accepted mathematical description of the fundamental constituents and interactions of matter is the Standard Model of particle physics. Its last missing particle, the famous Higgs boson, was observed at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in 2012. However, it is clear that the Standard Model cannot be the ultimate theory of Nature, and e.g. cannot account for Dark Matter or non-vanishing neutrino masses (and does not include gravity). In fact, searches for physics beyond the SM have been intensified since the Higgs boson discovery. In this article, we review the hints for new physics, called ``anomalies'', obtained in particle physics experiments within the last years. We consider both direct high-energy searches for new resonances at the LHC and indirect low-energy precision experiments. These anomalies range from the nuclear scale (approximately the mass of the proton) to the electroweak scale (i.e. the mass of the Higgs boson) to the TeV scale (the highest scale directly accessible at the LHC), therefore spanning over four orders of magnitude. After discussing the experimental and theoretical status of the anomalies, we summarize possible explanations in terms of new particles and new interactions. In particular, new Higgs bosons and leptoquarks are promising candidates. Discovery prospects and implications for future colliders are discussed.</description>

      <title>Reduced tensor network formulation for non-Abelian gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formulating non-Abelian gauge theories as a tensor network is known to be challenging due to the internal degrees of freedom that result in the degeneracy in the singular value spectrum. In two dimensions, it is straightforward to 'trace out' these degrees of freedom with the use of character expansion, giving a reduced tensor network where the degeneracy associated with the internal symmetry is eliminated. In this work, we show that such an index loop also exists in higher dimensions in the form of a closed tensor network we call the 'armillary sphere'. This allows us to completely eliminate the matrix indices and reduce the overall size of the tensors in the same way as is possible in two dimensions. This formulation allows us to include significantly more representations with the same tensor size, thus making it possible to reach a greater level of numerical accuracy in the tensor renormalization group computations.</description>

      <title>Fermionic wave packet scattering: a quantum computing approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to prepare Gaussian wave packets with momentum on top of the interacting ground state of a fermionic Hamiltonian. Using Givens rotation, we show how to efficiently obtain expectation values of observables throughout the evolution of the wave packets on digital quantum computers. We demonstrate our technique by applying it to the staggered lattice formulation of the Thirring model and studying the scattering of two wave packets. Monitoring the the particle density and the entropy produced during the scattering process, we characterize the phenomenon and provide a first step towards studying more complicated collision processes on digital quantum computers. In addition, we perform a small-scale demonstration on IBM's quantum hardware, showing that our method is suitable for current and near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>On the dependence of the Landau gauge ghost-gluon-vertex on the number of flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gauge-boson, ghost and fermion propagators as well as the gauge-boson--ghost vertex function are studied for SU(N), Sp(2N) and SO(N) gauge groups. We solve a set of coupled Dyson-Schwinger equations in Landau gauge for a variable, fractional number $N_f$ of massless fermions in the fundamental representation. For large $N_f$ we find a phase transition from a chirally broken into a chirally symmetric phase that is consistent with the behavior expected inside the conformal window. Even in the presence of fermions the gauge-boson--ghost-vertex dressing remains small. In the conformal window this vertex shows the expected power law behavior. It does not assume its tree-level value in the far infrared, but the respective dressing function is a constant greater than one.</description>
