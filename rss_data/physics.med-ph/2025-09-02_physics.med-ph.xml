      <title>Analysis of the Institutional Free Market in Accredited Medical Physics Residency Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The pathway to clinical medical physics involves 3 distinct stages of accredited positions, including (i) graduate education, (ii) residency training &amp; (iii) employment. While CAMPEP accredits programs &amp; people, the type of positions and numbers available are each more influenced by local institutional free market forces driving their choices. Methods: Understanding the overall status and trajectories of the full range of residency positions was the rationale for this survey, using publicly available data reported 2017 to 2023 timeframe. Results: Current data shows 108 therapy residency programs with 163 positions, and 38 diagnostic imaging residency programs with 39 positions. The total numbers show growth in positions by +6.5/year in therapy, and +2.1/year in imaging. There are 18 therapy and 10 imaging residencies longer than 2 years, all at university hospitals, and nearly all requiring a PhD. The number of programs that accept graduates with either MS or PhD, versus PhD only, has grown, from 69 to 105 from 2017 to 2023. There was a trend in large health networks increasing their residency numbers from 9 to 23 in this timeframe. The total 7-year growth trend was compared to numbers of graduating students, showing reasonable agreement between positions with expected inter-year variation. Conclusions: There has been growth in numbers of accredited residencies, with accompanying shifts in program types &amp; student education expected. Most are 2-years, while there is smaller growth in longer programs with research added in, primarily at university hospitals. Major growth has occurred in residencies accepting both MS and PhD graduates, while those accepting only PhD graduates tends to be more imaging focused and at university centers. Overall, the number positions has been keeping pace with the known growth in graduates from accredited medical physics graduate programs.</description>

      <title>AI-Guided PET Image Reconstruction and Multi-Tracer Imaging: Novel Methods, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LAFOV PET/CT has the potential to unlock new applications such as ultra-low dose PET/CT imaging, multiplexed imaging, for biomarker development and for faster AI-driven reconstruction, but further work is required before these can be deployed in clinical routine. LAFOV PET/CT has unrivalled sensitivity but has a spatial resolution of an equivalent scanner with a shorter axial field of view. AI approaches are increasingly explored as potential avenues to enhance image resolution.</description>

      <title>Reporte de visita m\'edica sobre la aplicaci\'on de braquiterapia de baja tasa con Cs-137 en una paciente con c\'ancer de cuello uterino, estadio IIB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During an academic visit to the National Oncology Institute (ION), the low-dose-rate brachytherapy procedure with Cs-137 was observed in a patient with stage IIB cervical cancer. The experience provided insight into both the clinical preparation of the patient and the dose planning process through imaging studies. Despite certain logistical limitations, strict adherence to safety protocols, disinfection procedures, and radioactive source handling was emphasized. The coordinated participation of medical physicists and technicians highlighted the practical application of physical principles, such as the use of X-rays, and underscored the relevance of an interdisciplinary approach in brachytherapy. This observation emphasized the importance of professional collaboration to ensure both patient safety and treatment effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study on the characterization of lyzed blood samples using dual-wavelength photoacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anemia is a global health concern, prompting the need for rapid and accurate diagnostic tools, especially for vulnerable populations. Estimating the blood lysis level (LL) and oxygen saturation (SO2) are essential not only for anemia but also for other hemolytic conditions. This study explores the potential of photoacoustic (PA) spectroscopy as a quantitative tool for evaluating hemolysis in anemia diagnosis. In vitro PA measurements on human blood samples were validated through computational modeling using the discrete dipole approximation, Monte Carlo, and k-Wave acoustic simulations. The quantitative values of blood hematocrit (H), LL and SO2 have been estimated using simulated and experimental PA signals. The wavelength pairs 700-905 nm and 700-1000 nm have been found to be optimal for the simultaneous estimation of these parameters and provided H and SO2 estimations with accuracy approximately &gt; 90% up to LL=14% and for LL = 0-30%, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the actual and evaluated lysis levels has been computed to be \approx 0.90. Further investigation is needed to enhance the robustness and clinical applicability of the developed method under an in vivo setting when both the H and LL levels are not known.</description>

      <title>Radial spoke energy for self-navigated motion detection and position-ordered dynamic musculoskeletal MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion remains a key challenge in MRI, as both involuntary (e.g., head motion) and voluntary (e.g., joint motion) movement can degrade image quality or provide opportunities for dynamic assessment. Existing motion sensing methods, such as external tracking or navigator sequences, often require additional hardware, increase SAR, or demand sequence modification, which limits clinical flexibility. We propose a computationally efficient, self-navigated motion sensing technique based on spoke energy derived from 3D radial k-space data. Using the Fourier Slice and Parseval's theorems, spoke energy captures object-coil alignment and can be computed without altering the sequence. A sliding window summation improves robustness, and a second principal component analysis (2ndPCA) strategy yields a unified motion-sensitive signal. Beyond conventional head motion correction, we demonstrate the novel application of this method in enhancing dynamic 4D MRI of the ankle and knee under a continuous movement protocol. By sorting spokes based on position rather than time, we achieve motion-resolved reconstructions with improved anatomical clarity. This approach enables real-time motion detection and supports broader adoption of motion-aware dynamic MRI.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Aortic Valve Stenosis on Pulse Wave Morphology: An in silico study with 16,038 virtual subjects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) presents challenges in asymptomatic detection, resulting in delayed intervention. This study aims to understand how AVS affects pulse wave (PW) morphology. A PW database of 16,038 virtual subjects aged 50 to 75 was created, representing normal physiology and varying AVS degrees. All subjects were simulated using a closed-loop one-dimensional/zero-dimensional blood flow model of the entire cardiovascular system, incorporating a four-chamber heart model capable of simulating different levels of AVS by reducing the orifice area of the aortic valve. Even in cases below clinical significance, distinct PW morphology changes were observed, suggesting potential for early AVS detection using peripheral PWs from non-invasive at-home devices.</description>

      <title>Quantitative imaging of 478-keV prompt gamma rays from boron neutron capture reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate imaging and quantitative measurement of 478-keV prompt gamma rays are critical for advancing boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), a promising cancer treatment. Although numerical simulations have indicated that such measurements are feasible, their practical application has proven challenging. This study introduces a gamma-ray imaging detector designed specifically for precise BNCT measurements. Using boron-rich phantom samples, we successfully imaged 478-keV gamma rays and established a linear correlation between gamma-ray production and boron concentration. Furthermore, applying this technique in a recognized BNCT treatment facility demonstrated the detector's effectiveness in monitoring boron dose distribution during neutron irradiation, both in pretreatment diagnostics and throughout the treatment process.</description>

      <title>Clinical Metadata Guided Limited-Angle CT Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical imaging frameworks.</description>
