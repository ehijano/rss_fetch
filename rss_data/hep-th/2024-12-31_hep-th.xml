      <title>Accidental Symmetry Near Extreme Spinning Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near the horizon of extremal charged black holes, an accidental symmetry is known to act on zero-temperature perturbations, transforming them into finite-temperature ones. In this paper, we uncover the corresponding accidental symmetry of the vacuum Einstein equation near the horizon of extremal spinning black holes. To do so, we first devise a new method of deriving the symmetry near the ${\rm AdS}_2 \times S^2$ near-horizon geometry of extreme Reissner-Nordstr\"om, using a new scaling coordinate transformation that unifies the near-horizon limits of extremal and near-extremal black holes in a way that is regular at zero temperature. We use our new method to obtain the accidental symmetry in the near-horizon of extreme Kerr (NHEK). We show that accidental symmetries combine neatly with the near-horizon isometries inside a Virasoro algebra.</description>

      <title>Cosmohedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been a long-standing challenge to find a geometric object underlying the cosmological wavefunction for Tr($\phi^3$) theory, generalizing associahedra and surfacehedra for scattering amplitudes. In this note we describe a new class of polytopes -- "cosmohedra" -- that provide a natural solution to this problem. Cosmohedra are intimately related to associahedra, obtained by "blowing up" faces of the associahedron in a simple way, and we provide an explicit realization in terms of facet inequalities that further "shave" the facet inequalities of the associahedron. We also discuss a novel way for computing the wavefunction from cosmohedron geometry that extends the usual connection with polytope canonical forms. We illustrate cosmohedra with examples at tree-level and one loop; the close connection to surfacehedra suggests the generalization to all loop orders. We also briefly describe "cosmological correlahedra" for full correlators. We speculate on how the existence of cosmohedra might suggest a "stringy" formulation for the cosmological wavefunction/correlators, generalizing the way in which the Minkowski sum decomposition of associahedra naturally extend particle to string amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Modular Intersections, Time Interval Algebras and Stringy AdS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the modular flow and conjugation of time interval algebras of conformal Generalized Free Fields (GFF) in $(0+1)$-dimensions in vacuum. For non-integer scaling dimensions, for general time-intervals, the modular conjugation and the modular flow of operators outside the algebra are non-geometric. This is because they involve a Generalized Hilbert Transform (GHT) that treats positive and negative frequency modes differently. However, the modular conjugation and flows viewed in the dual bulk AdS$_2$ are local, because the GHT geometrizes as the local antipodal symmetry transformation that pushes operators behind the Poincar\'e horizon. These algebras of conformal GFF satisfy a Twisted Modular Inclusion and a Twisted Modular Intersection property. We prove the converse statement that the existence of a (twisted) modular inclusion/intersection in any quantum system implies a representation of the (universal cover of) conformal group $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$, respectively. We discuss the implications of our result for the emergence of Stringy AdS$_2$ geometries in large $N$ theories without a large gap. Our result applied to higher dimensional eternal AdS black holes explains the emergence of two copies of $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ on future and past Killing horizons.</description>

      <title>Holography and discrete theta angles for disconnected gauge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from holography, we derive the symmetry TFT for $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM with $\mathfrak{so}(2n)$ gauge algebra, including terms which were previously unaccounted for holographically, by considering the action of the symmetry TFT on manifolds with torsion cycles. We then study gapped boundary conditions of the symmetry TFT and show how they correspond to the global forms and discrete theta angles studied by Hsin and Lam, including their higher group and non-invertible symmetries and anomalies. In particular, we analyse the case of theories with disconnected gauge groups. Considering the action of S-duality on the boundary conditions then leads to predictions for S-duality between these theories.</description>

      <title>String stars in $d\geq 7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We raise a thermodynamic puzzle for Horowitz--Polchinski (HP) solutions in the presence of extra compact dimensions and show that it can be resolved by the existence of higher-dimensional string stars. We provide non-trivial evidence for the existence of such string stars in spacetime dimensions $d\geq 7$ as higher-dimensional counterparts of HP solutions in bosonic and type II string theories. In particular, we explicitly construct string star solutions in $d=7$ that are under perturbative control. In $d&gt;7$, at the Hagedorn temperature, we identify these string stars as a specific representative of a new one-parameter bounded family of Euclidean solutions which can be under perturbative control. The higher-order $\alpha'$ corrections play a crucial role in our arguments and, as pointed by other works, nullify the previous arguments against the existence of string stars in $d\geq 7$. The higher-dimensional string stars have non-zero free energy at Hagedorn temperature and their mass and free energy are of the same order as those of a string-sized black hole. In $d&gt;7$, these solutions are string sized, but in $d=7$, the size of these solutions diverges as $\sim (T_{\rm H}-T)^{-1/4}$ near the Hagedorn temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a Bhabha-like scattering in a massive Rarita-Schwinger model at finite temperature. The analysis is conducted at the tree level and addresses temperature effects through the thermofield dynamics formalism. We consider the usual fermion-antifermion into fermion-antifermion scattering and compute the cross-section in order to investigate the influence of the finite temperature effects.</description>

      <title>The nucleon properties in finite temperature and density with Gaussian fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of nucleons at finite temperature and density using a two-flavor quark meson model with Gaussian fluctuations that extend beyond the mean-field approximation. Our findings suggest that Gaussian fluctuations lead to a non-monotonic behavior of the nucleon mass as a function of temperature and density, which may play an important role in the study of the hadronization process of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Moreover, we observe an increase in the nucleon radius due to Gaussian fluctuations, suggesting an effective repulsive force akin to the Casimir effect, as observed in the gold-bromobenzene-silica system. This study offers new insights into how temperature, density, and quantum fluctuations affect the structure and properties of nucleons under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>A Family of Vertex Operator Algebras from Argyres-Douglas Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that multiple vertex operator algebras (VOAs) can arise from a single 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory (SCFT). The connection is given by the BPS monodromy operator $M$, which is a wall-crossing invariant quantity that captures the BPS spectrum on the Coulomb branch. We find that the trace of the multiple powers of the monodromy operator $\mathrm{Tr} M^N$ produces the vacuum characters of a VOA for each $N$. In particular, we realize unitary VOAs of the Deligne-Cvitanovi\'c exceptional series type $(A_2)_1$, $(G_2)_1$, $(D_4)_1$, $(F_4)_1$, $(E_6)_1$ from Argyres-Douglas theories. We also find the modular invariant characters of the `intermediate vertex subalgebra' $(E_{7\frac{1}{2}})_1$ and $(X_1)_1$. Our analysis allows us to construct 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories that flow to $\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFTs in the IR, which gives rise to the topological field theories realizing the VOAs with these characters.</description>

      <title>Topological Gauge Theories with Sixteen Supercharges: Higher $A_\infty$-categorification of Floer Homologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to [arXiv:2410.18575], and a third and final installment of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We will show how, via a 3d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of certain topologically-twisted 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ and 8d $\mathcal{N} = 1$ gauge theories, one can derive novel Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories that 2-categorify the 3d-Haydys-Witten, Haydys-Witten, and holomorphic Donaldson-Thomas Floer homology of two, four, and five-manifolds, respectively. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the aforementioned twisted gauge theories, these Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories can be shown to be equivalent to corresponding Fukaya-Seidel type $A_{\infty}$-categories. Together with previous results from [arXiv:2410.18575] and [arXiv:2311.18302], we will furnish purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Bousseau [3] and Doan-Rezchikov [4].</description>

      <title>Primary scalar hair in Gauss-Bonnet black holes with Thurston horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we construct novel asymptotically locally AdS$_5$ black hole solutions of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory at the Chern-Simons point, supported by a scalar field that generates primary hair. The strength of the scalar field is governed by an independent integration constant; when this constant vanishes, the spacetime reduces to a black hole geometry devoid of hair. The existence of these solutions is intrinsically tied to the horizon metric, which is modeled by three non-trivial Thurston geometries: Nil, Solv, and $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$. The quadratic part of the scalar field action corresponds to a conformally coupled scalar in five dimensions -an invariance of the matter sector that is explicitly broken by the introduction of a quartic self-interaction. These black holes are characterized by two distinct parameters: the horizon radius and the temperature. Notably, there exists a straight line in this parameter space along which the horizon geometry exhibits enhanced isometries, corresponding to solutions previously reported in JHEP 02, 014 (2014). Away from this line, for a fixed horizon radius and temperatures above or below a critical value, the metric's isometries undergo spontaneous breaking. Employing the Regge-Teitelboim approach, we compute the mass and entropy of these solutions, both of which vanish. Despite this, only one of the integration constants can be interpreted as hair, as the other modifies the local geometry at the conformal boundary. Finally, for Solv horizon geometries, we extend these hairy solutions to six dimensions.</description>

      <title>Holographic fermions in the Dyonic Gubser-Rocha black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fermionic properties of a dyonic Gubser-Rocha model in the context of gauge/gravity duality. This model incorporates both a magnetic field and momentum relaxation. We have derived this model's scaling exponent, revealing the influence of the magnetic field and momentum relaxation on low-energy physics. As the magnetic field strength and momentum relaxation increase, the spectral function of the dual field changes significantly. Specifically, we observe variations in the scaling exponent, Fermi momentum, and dispersion relations as the magnetic field increases, highlighting the system's transition from a Fermi liquid to a non-Fermi liquid, and eventually to an insulating state. Our analysis of the magneto-scattering rate reveals that it is nearly zero in the Fermi liquid region, increases significantly in the non-Fermi liquid region, and ultimately arrives at a maximum value in the insulating state.</description>

      <title>Spectral sum rules and phase transition in strongly coupled QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By incorporating contributions from both the (chromo)electric scale $gT$ and (chromo)magnetic scale $g^2T$, we establish spectral sum rules of quarks for strongly coupled QCD that respect Fermi-Dirac statistics as required by quantum mechanics. In sharp contrast to QED and weakly coupled QCD whose spectral functions consist of discontinuous zero-dimensional (poles) and one-dimensional (branch cuts) non-analytic contributions from real energy $p_0 \in \mathbb{R}$, the derived spectral function for strongly coupled quarks features continuous but non-analytic contributions from complex energy $p_0 \in \mathbb{C}$ that are two-dimensional in nature. In light of the novel sum rules, we uncover an intrinsic QCD transition between a three-mode phase at small coupling and a one-mode phase at large coupling. The transition is induced by the magnetic scale that generates a massless hydro-like mode with the genuine non-Abelian feature of positivity violation and serving as the Goldstone mode of the Lorentz symmetry breaking. The thermal mass serves as an order parameter of the transition and vanishes at large coupling in line with phenomenological predictions from Dyson-Schwinger equations and gauge/gravity duality. This result provides novel insights into the mechanism of the QCD deconfinement transition.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of information scrambling and decoherence in the integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of information scrambling, captured by out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), is a central indicator of the nature of many-body quantum dynamics. Here, we compute analytically the complete time dependence of the OTOC for an integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, $N$ Majoranas with random two-body interactions of infinite range, coupled to a Markovian bath at finite temperature. In the limit of no coupling to the bath, the time evolution of scrambling experiences different stages. For $t \lesssim \sqrt{N}$, after an initial polynomial growth, the OTOC approaches saturation in a power-law fashion with oscillations superimposed. At $t \sim \sqrt{N}$, the OTOC reverses trend and starts to decrease linearly in time. The reason for this linear decrease is that, despite being a subleading $1/N$ effect, the OTOC in this region is governed by the spectral form factor of the antisymmetric couplings of the SYK model. The linear decrease stops at $t \sim 2N$, the Heisenberg time, where saturation occurs. The effect of the environment is an overall exponential decay of the OTOC for times longer than the inverse of the coupling strength to the bath. The oscillations at $t \lesssim \sqrt{N}$ indicate lack of thermalization -- a desired feature for a better performance of quantum information devices.</description>

      <title>Flipped $SU(5)$ GUT with conformal gravity from a single supermultiplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Grassmann envelope is used to find the $\mathcal{N}=1$ `superquasiconformal' algebra in $D=10+1$. The adjoint representation of this algebra is found to contain $\mathfrak{su}_{2,2}\oplus \mathfrak{u}_{1}\oplus \mathfrak{su}_{5}$ as a submaximal subalgebra, giving a spectrum of conformal gravity with flipped $SU_{5}\times U_{1}$ GUT. Combining Yang-Mills theory with MacDowell-Mansouri gravity over the conformal group is found to recover the Einstein-Hilbert action with a cosmological constant. An action for the theory is presented, which contains the gauge bosons of gravity and GUT, three generations of fermions in an efficient manner, and a new Higgs sector. By using the superalgebra for the entire multiplet, the theory gauges a non-supersymmetric subalgebra without introducing superpartners.</description>

      <title>Special Fano geometry from Feynman integrals</title>

Abstract: One of the fundamental open questions in QFT is what kind of functions appear as Feynman integrals. In recent years this question has often been considered in a geometric context by interpreting the polynomials that appear in these integrals as defining algebraic varieties. One focal point of the past decade has in particular been the class of Calabi-Yau varieties that arise in some types of Feynman integrals. A class of manifolds that includes CYs as a special case are varieties of special Fano types. These varieties were originally introduced because the class of CY spaces is not closed under mirror symmetry. Their Hodge structure is of a more general type and the middle cohomology in particular is determined by two integers, the dimension of the manifold and a charge $Q$. In the present paper this class of manifolds is considered in the context of Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>Consistent deformations in the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for studying consistent interactions of local gauge theories, which is based on the presymplectic BV-AKSZ formulation. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it operates in terms of finite-dimensional spaces and avoids working with quotient spaces such as local functionals or functionals modulo on-shell trivial ones. The structure that is being deformed is that of a presymplectic gauge PDE, which consists of a graded presymplectic structure and a compatible odd vector field. These are known to encode the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formulation of a local gauge theory in terms of the finite dimensional supergeometrical object. Although in its present version the method is limited to interactions that do not deform the pre-symplectic structure and relies on some natural assumptions, it gives a remarkably simple way to analyse consistent interactions. The approach can be considered as the BV-AKSZ extension of the frame-like approach to consistent interactions. We also describe the underlying homological deformation theory, which turns out to be slightly unusual compared to the standard deformations of differential graded Lie algebras. As an illustration, the Chern-Simons and YM theories are rederived starting from their linearized versions.</description>

      <title>False vacuum decay of excited states in finite-time instanton calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting information about a system's metastable ground state energy employing functional methods usually hinges on utilizing the late-time behavior of the Euclidean propagator, practically impeding the possibility of determining decay widths of excited states. We demonstrate that such obstacles can be surmounted by working with bounded time intervals, adapting the standard instanton formalism to compute a finite-time amplitude corresponding to excited state decay. This is achieved by projecting out the desired resonant energies utilizing carefully chosen approximations to the excited state wave functions in the false vacuum region. To carry out the calculation, we employ unconventional path integral techniques by considering the emerging amplitude as a single composite functional integral that includes fluctuations at the endpoints of the trajectories. This way, we explicitly compute the sought-after decay widths, including their leading quantum corrections, for arbitrary potentials, demonstrating accordance with traditional WKB results. While the initial starting point of weighting Euclidean propagator contributions according to their endpoints using false vacuum states has been proposed earlier, we find several flaws in the published evaluation of the relevant amplitudes. Although we show that the previous proposition of employing a sequential calculation scheme -- where the functional integral is evaluated around extremal trajectories with fixed endpoints, weighted only at a subsequent stage -- can lead to the desired goal, the novel composite approach is found to be more concise and transparent.</description>

      <title>$S^1$ reduction of 4D $\mathcal{N}=4$ Schur index and 3D $\mathcal{N}=8$ mass-deformed partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the compactification of 4D $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM on $S^1$ from the viewpoint of the superconformal index. In the cases that the gauge group of the 4D SYM is $U(N)$ and $Usp(2N)$, the resulting 3D theory is believed to be the ABJM theory with the Chern-Simons level $k=1$ and $k=2$, respectively. This suggests that the small $S^1$ limit of the superconformal index of these 4D $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYMs is identical to the sphere partition function of the ABJM theories. Using a recently observed relation between the 4D and 3D R-charges for theories with twelve or more supercharges, we explicitly confirm this identity in the Schur limit of the 4D index. Our result provides a direct quantitative check of the relation between 4D $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYMs and 3D $\mathcal{N}=8$ ABJM theories.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field on a higher-spin Background via Fedosov quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal higher-spin gravity is the log-divergent part of the effective action of the scalar field coupled to background fields via higher-spin currents, as was defined by Segal and Tseytlin, which can be worked out over the flat space background. We revisit the problem of the scalar field in a higher-spin background and propose a manifestly covariant version thereof. The construction utilizes the Fedosov quantization of the cotangent bundle and the action is written with the help of the trace on a curved phase space that is provided by the Feigin--Felder--Shoikhet cocycle. The same construction allows one to formulate quantum mechanics on a curved space, the phase space being the cotangent bundle.</description>

      <title>Cascading from $\mathscr{N}=2$ Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory to Confinement and Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Adjoint QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that adjoint QCD in 3+1 dimensions, with any $SU(N)$ gauge group and two Weyl fermion flavors (i.e. one adjoint Dirac fermion), confines and spontaneously breaks its chiral symmetries via the condensation of a fermion bilinear. We flow to this theory from pure $\mathscr{N}=2$ SUSY Yang-Mills theory with the same gauge group, by giving a SUSY-breaking mass $M$ to the scalars in the $\mathscr{N} = 2$ vector multiplet. This flow can be analyzed rigorously at small $M$, where it leads to a deconfined vacuum at the origin of the $\mathscr{N}=2$ Coulomb branch. The analysis can be extended to all $M$ using an Abelian dual description that arises from the $N$ multi-monopole points of the $\mathscr{N} = 2$ theory. At each such point, there are $N-1$ hypermultiplet Higgs fields $h_m^{i = 1, 2}$, which are $SU(2)_R$ doublets. We provide a detailed study of the phase diagram as a function of $M$, by analyzing the semi-classical phases of the dual using a combination of analytic and numerical techniques. The result is a cascade of first-order phase transitions, along which the Higgs fields $h_m^i$ successively turn on, and which interpolates between the Coulomb branch at small $M$, where all $h_m^i = 0$, and a maximal Higgs branch, where all $h_m^i \neq 0$, at sufficiently large $M$. We show that this maximal Higgs branch precisely matches the confining and chiral symmetry breaking phase of two-flavor adjoint QCD, including its broken and unbroken symmetries, its massless spectrum, and the expected large-$N$ scaling of various observables. The spontaneous breaking pattern $SU(2)_R \to U(1)_R$, consistent with the Vafa-Witten theorem, is ensured by an intricate alignment mechanism for the $h_m^i$ in the dual, and leads to a $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$ sigma model of increasing radius along the cascade.</description>

Abstract: In previous two articles we postulated that field equations for arbitrary spin and helicity are Casimir eigenvalue equations. In massive case, from such principle equation, we derived spin-$0$ Klein-Gordon, spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Dirac and spin-$1$ vector equations. In the present article we will derived spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ Rarita-Schwinger equation, which is nontrivial combination of vector and spinor case. We will also show that vector-spinor field contains two spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Dirac fields.</description>

      <title>Open String Amplitudes: Singularities, Asymptotics, and New Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open string amplitudes at tree level have been studied for over fifty years, but there is no known analytic form for general $n$-point amplitudes, and their conventional representation in terms of worldsheet integrals does not make many of their most basic physical properties manifest. Recently, a formulation of these amplitudes exposing the underlying "binary geometry" via the use of "$u$" variables has given us many insights into their basic features. In this paper, we initiate a systematic exploration of fundamental aspects of open string amplitudes from this new point of view. We begin by giving explicit expressions for the factorization of amplitudes at general massive levels. We then study the asymptotic behavior when subsets of kinematic variables become large, delineating regimes with exponential (generalized hard scattering) and power-law (generalized Regge) behavior. We also give precise expressions for the asymptotics, which reveal another example of the recently observed property of factorization away from poles. We finally derive new recursion relations and infinite series representations for the amplitude, and for five points, we present a new closed-form expression for the amplitude that for the first time gives its analytic continuation to all of kinematic space.</description>

      <title>Bulk thimbles dual to trace relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximal giant graviton is a D-brane wrapping a maximal $S^3\subset S^5$ within $\text{AdS}_5\times S^5$. It represents an upper bound on the $R$ charge that can be carried by certain bulk states. We study the maximal giant and its half-BPS fluctuations, motivated by a recent proposal \cite{Lee:2023iil} connecting these fluctuations to trace relations in the boundary theory. In a computation of the partition function of half-BPS states, we find that the maximal giant is an unstable saddle point and that its Lefschetz thimble corresponds to the quantization of an imaginary phase space. The states resulting from the quantization of this phase space contribute negatively to the partition function and can be regarded as bulk duals of trace relations. Finally, we study a model for a path integral that would connect together components of the bulk half-BPS field space with different numbers of giants.</description>

      <title>The Domain Wall Soliton's Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the one-loop tension of the domain wall soliton in the $\phi^4$ double-well model. Our result agrees with previous results from Dashen, Hasslacher and Neveu (1974) in 1+1d and Jaimunga, Semenoff and Zarembo (1999) in 2+1d. After an additional 25 year interval, we have obtained a one-loop tension correction of $0.0410959m^3$ in 3+1d. In this case, unlike lower-dimensional cases, even after normal ordering there are ultraviolet divergences that require both mass and also coupling constant renormalization. We renormalized the coupling so that the three-point interaction in the effective potential is given by its tree level value at zero external momenta.</description>

      <title>Quantum flux operators in the fermionic theory and their supersymmetric extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct quantum flux operators with respect to the Poincar\'e symmetry in the massless Dirac theory at future null infinity. An anomalous helicity flux operator emerges from the commutator of the superrotation generators. The helicity flux operator corresponds to the local chiral symmetry which is the analog of superduality in the gauge theories. We also find its relation to the non-closure of the Lie transport of the spinor field around a loop. We discuss various algebras formed by these operators and constrain the test functions by the requirement of eliminating the non-local terms and satisfying the Jacobi identities. Furthermore, we explore their $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric extension in the Wess-Zumino model. There are four kinds of quantum flux operators, which correspond to the supertranslation, superrotation, superduality and supersymmetry, respectively. Interestingly, besides the expected supertranslation generator, a helicity flux operator will also emerge in the commutator between the superflux operators. We check that our flux algebra can give rise to the super-BMS and super-Poincar\'e algebras with appropriate choice of parameters. In the latter reduction, we find the helicity flux reduces to behaving like a $R$ symmetry generator in the commutator with the superflux. For completion, we derive the $R$ flux which also includes a charge flux for complex scalar besides the helicity flux for spinor field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the spiralling branes technique introduced in arXiv:2312.16990 to many-body integrable systems. We start by giving a new R-matrix description of the trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider (RS) Hamiltonians and eigenfunctions using the intertwiners of quantum toroidal algebra. We then consider elliptic deformations of the RS system, elucidate how Shiraishi functions appear naturally in the process and relate them to certain special infinite system of intertwiners of the algebra. We further show that there are two distinguished elliptic deformations, one of which leads to the conventional elliptic RS Hamiltonians, while the other produces trigonometric Koroteev-Shakirov Hamiltonians. Along the way we prove the fully noncommutative version of the "noncommutative Jacobi identities" for affine qq-characters recently introduced by Grekov and Nekrasov.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We renormalize Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) when gauge fixed in the nonlinear Curci-Ferrari gauge to four loops in the modified minimal subtraction (MSbar) scheme. We reproduce the four loop QCD MSbar beta-function from the Slavnov-Taylor identity for this gauge which relates the coupling constant renormalization to the gluon, Faddeev-Popov ghost and gauge parameter anomalous dimensions. This is carried out for a nonzero gauge parameter, without having to evaluate a vertex function. The anomalous dimension of the BRST invariant dimension two gluon and ghost mass term is deduced from a similar Slavnov-Taylor identity for this gauge. Consequently we construct the renormalization group functions in the minimal momentum subtraction scheme to four loops. As a corollary we deduce the five loop beta-function and quark mass anomalous dimensions in the same scheme. We also outline the pros and cons of employing the Curci-Ferrari gauge to access the six loop QCD beta-function in the MSbar scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantum mechanical systems of spin chain type, with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and $\mathcal{N}=2$ or $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetry, described in $\mathcal{N}=2$ superspace in terms of nonlinear chiral multiplets. We prove that they are natural truncations of 1D sigma models, whose target spaces are $\mathsf{SU}(n)$ (co)adjoint orbits. As a first application, we compute the Witten indices of these finite-dimensional models showing that they reproduce the Dolbeault and de Rham indices of the target space. The problem of finding the exact spectra of generalized Laplace operators on such orbits is shown to be equivalent to the diagonalization of spin chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering amplitudes for colored theories have recently been formulated in a new way, in terms of curves on surfaces. In this note we describe a canonical set of functions we call surface functions, associated to all orders in the topological expansion, that are naturally suggested by this point of view. Surface functions are generating functions for all inequivalent triangulations of the surface. They generalize matrix model correlators, and in the planar limit, coincide with field theoretic loop integrands. We show that surface functions satisfy a universal recursion relation, the cut equation, that can be solved without introducing spurious poles, to all orders in the genus expansion. The formalism naturally extends to include triangulations with closed curves, corresponding to theories with uncolored particles. This new recursion is quite different from the topological recursion relations satisfied by matrix models. Applied to field theory, the new recursion efficiently computes all-order planar integrands for general colored theories, together with uncolored theories at tree-level. As an example we give the all-order recursion for the planar NLSM integrand. We attach a Mathematica notebook for the efficient computation of these planar integrands, with illustrative examples through four loops.</description>

      <title>The 3BF theory as a TQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the path integral quantization of the topological 3BF theory, whose gauge symmetry is described by a 3-group. This theory is relevant for the quantization of general relativity coupled to Standard Model of elementary particles. We explicitly construct a state sum corresponding to the discretized path integral of a 3BF action. Being a topological invariant of 4-dimensional manifolds with boundary, this state sum gives rise to a topological quantum field theory (TQFT), realized as a functor between the category of cobordisms and the category of Hilbert spaces. After an introduction to appropriate category theory concepts and the construction of the state sum, we provide an explicit proof that it satisfies all Atiyah's axioms, and thus represents a genuine TQFT. The formulation of this TQFT represents a major step in the spinfoam quantization programme for a realistic theory of quantum gravity with matter.</description>

      <title>Timelike and gravitational anomalous entanglement from the inner horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, the boundary causal development and the entanglement wedge of any boundary spacelike interval can be mapped to a thermal CFT$_2$ and a Rindler $\widetilde{\text{AdS}_3}$ respectively via certain boundary and bulk Rindler transformations. Nevertheless, the Rindler mapping is not confined in the entanglement wedges. While the outer horizon of the Rindler $\widetilde{\text{AdS}_3}$ is mapped to the RT surface, we also identify the pre-image of the inner horizon in the original AdS$_3$, which we call the inner RT surface. In this paper we give some new physical interpretation for the inner RT surface. Firstly, the inner RT surface breaks into two pieces which anchor on the two tips of the causal development. Furthermore, we can take the two tips as the end points of a certain timelike interval and the inner RT surface is exactly the spacelike geodesic that represents the real part of the so-called holographic timelike entanglement entropy (HTEE). We also identify a timelike geodesic at boundary of the extended entanglement wedge, which represents the imaginary part of the HTEE. Secondly, in the duality between the topologically massive gravity (TMG) and gravitational anomalous CFT$_2$, the entanglement entropy and the mixed state correlation that is dual to the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS) receive correction from the Chern-Simons term in the TMG. We find that, the correction to the holographic entanglement entropy can be reproduced by the area of the inner RT surface with a proper regulation, while the mixed state correlation can be represented by the saddle geodesic chord connecting with the two pieces of the inner RT surface of the mixed state we consider, which we call the inner EWCS. The equivalence between the twist on the RT surface and the length of inner RT surface is also discussed.</description>

      <title>3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Mirror Symmetry, TQFTs, and 't Hooft Anomaly Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any local unitary 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) has a corresponding "universal" relevant deformation that takes it to a gapped phase. This deformation preserves all continuous internal symmetries, $\mathcal{S}$, and therefore also preserves any 't Hooft anomalies supported purely in $\mathcal{S}$. We describe the resulting phase diagram in the case of SCFTs that arise as the endpoints of renormalization group flows from 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Abelian gauge theories with any number of $U(1)$ gauge group factors and arbitrary integer charges for the matter fields. We argue that the universal deformations take these QFTs to Abelian fractional quantum Hall states in the infrared (IR), and we explain how to match 't Hooft anomalies between the non-topological ultraviolet theories and the IR topological quantum field theories (TQFTs). Along the way, we give a proof that 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ mirror symmetry of our Abelian gauge theories descends to a duality of these TQFTs. Finally, using our anomaly matching discussion, we describe how to connect, via the renormalization group, abstract local unitary 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFTs with certain 't Hooft anomalies for their internal symmetries to IR phases (partially) described by Abelian spin Chern-Simons theories.</description>

      <title>Higher-Dimensional Black Holes and Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scalar tidal responses of spinning higher-dimensional black holes, and their effective field theory description. After constructing the effective field theory of a spinning point particle in general dimension, we apply this theory to match the scalar responses of a variety of black hole solutions. In addition to the five-dimensional Myers--Perry black hole, we derive the scalar responses of spinning black holes in the large $D$ limit, and also study the responses of black holes in the ultra-spinning regime. We find that in the most generic case, the static responses of higher-dimensional spinning black holes do not vanish, but for special cases we find a pattern of zeroes in the responses, similar to other known examples. Further, we observe various interesting relations between the responses.</description>

      <title>Coupled minimal models revisited II: Constraints from permutation symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling $N$ large rank $m$ minimal models and flowing to IR fixed points is a systematic way to build new classes of compact unitary 2d CFTs which are likely to be irrational, and potentially have a positive Virasoro twist gap above the vaccuum. In this paper, we build on the construction of [1], establishing that, for spins less than 10, additional currents transforming in non-trivial irreducible representations of the permutation symmetry $S_N$ are not conserved at the IR fixed points. Along the way, we develop a finer understanding of the spectrum of these theories, of the special properties of the $N=4$ case and of non-invertible symmetries that constrain them. We also discuss variations of the original setup of [1] some of which can exist for smaller values of the UV central charge.</description>

      <title>Ordinary limits of the hyperbolic hypergeometric integral identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of the partition function of supersymmetric gauge theories on compact manifolds can be reduced to matrix integrals by using the supersymmetric localization technique. Such matrix integrals in the case of three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories on lens space can be expressed in terms of hyperbolic hypergeometric integrals. By studying partition functions of supersymmetric dual theories, one can obtain new complicated identities for this type of special function. We derive new ordinary hypergeometric identities from the reduction of certain hyperbolic hypergeometric integral identities obtained via supersymmetric infrared dualities.</description>

Abstract: We complete the classification of all smooth 4-dimensional Kahler geometries admitting a twistor (conformal Killing-Yano) 2-form invariant under a 2-torus action. We establish that there are six geometrically distinct families, and we provide them in a simple form amenable to calculations and compute their curvature. We also find that for toric geometries the square norm of the twistor 2-form is quadratic in moment maps, and we are led to conjecture that this holds when less symmetry is present.</description>

      <title>Gravitational EFT for dissipative open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate on the effective field theory (EFT) construction for dissipative open systems coupled to dynamical gravity, in light of recent developments on the EFT of dissipative hydrodynamics (HydroEFT). Our construction is based on the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and its symmetries as well as microscopic unitarity. A key aspect of dynamical gravity is that gravity couples to all degrees of freedom universally, hence the EFT has to take into account the energy-momentum tensor of the environment to which the energy escapes from the dissipative system of interest. We incorporate this effect by modeling the environment based on HydroEFT, assuming validity of the derivative expansion of the environment sector. For illustration, we apply our EFT recipe to a dissipative scalar field coupled to dynamical gravity that can be used, e.g., for dissipative inflation. In particular we quantify impacts of fluctuations in the environment sector on the scalar dynamics. We also apply the same framework to dissipative gravity, discussing dissipative gravitational waves and the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss topological defect lines in holomorphic vertex operators algebras and superalgebras, in particular Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman Monster VOA $V^\natural$ with central charge $c=24$, and Conway module SVOA $V^{f\natural}$ with $c=12$. First, we consider duality defects in $V^\natural$ for all non-anomalous Fricke elements of the Monster group, and provide a general formula for the corresponding defect McKay-Thompson series. Furthermore, we describe some general properties of the category of defect lines preserving the $N=1$ superVirasoro algebra in $V^{f\natural}$. We argue that, under some mild assumptions, every such defect in $V^{f\natural}$ is associated with a $\mathbb{Z}$-linear map form the Leech lattice to itself. This correspondence establishes a surjective (not injective) ring homomorphism between the Grothendieck ring of the category of topological defects and the ring of Leech lattice endomorphisms. Finally, we speculate about possible generalization of the Moonshine conjectures that include topological defect lines.</description>

      <title>From Painlev\'e equations to ${\cal N}=2$ susy gauge theories: prolegomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the linear problems in $z,t$ (time) associated to the Painlev\'e III$_3$ and III$_1$ equations when the Painlev\'e solution $q(t)$ approaches a pole or a zero. In this limit the problem in $z$ for the Painlev\'e III$_3$ reduces to the modified Mathieu equation, while that for the Painlev\'e III$_1$ to the Doubly Confluent Heun Equation. These equations appear as Nekrasov-Shatashvili quantisations/deformations of Seiberg-Witten differentials for $SU(2)$ ${\cal N}=2$ super Yang-Mills gauge theory with number of flavours $N_f=0$ and $N_f=2$, respectively. These results allow us to conjecture that this link holds for any Painlev\'e equation relating each of them to a different matter theory, which is actually the same as in the well-established Painlev\'e gauge correspondence, but {\it with another deformation ($\Omega$-background)}. An explicit expression for the dual gauge period (and then prepotential) is also found. As a by-product, a new solution to the connexion problem is illustrated.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chromodynamics in two spacetime dimensions admits a finite non-invertible symmetry described mathematically by a fusion category. This symmetry is spontaneously broken at long distances, leading to distinct vacua. When the theory has a mass gap, the spectrum is therefore characterized by particle excitations above a single vacuum and soliton sectors interpolating between vacua. We use anyon condensation and the representation theory of fusion categories to obtain exact results about this spectrum, exhibiting the allowed multiplets. Often, particles and solitons are in the same representation and therefore must have equal masses. Furthermore, the fusion category symmetry frequently implies the existence of certain stable states in the spectrum. The resulting degeneracies are encoded in quiver diagrams where nodes are vacua and arrows are excited states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations of the spacetime metric induce an uncertainty in the horizon area of a black hole. Working in linearized quantum gravity, we derive the variance in the area of a four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole from the renormalized graviton propagator. We find that the standard deviation of the horizon area scales as the product of the Schwarzschild radius and the Planck length. For macroscopic black holes, the quantum uncertainty is therefore enormous in Planck units.</description>

      <title>Classical $J\bar T$ symmetries -- three ways -- and a precision holography check</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $J\bar T$ deformation is a fully tractable irrelevant deformation of two-dimensional CFTs, which yields a UV-complete QFT that is local and conformal along one lightlike direction and non-local along the remaining one. Such QFTs are interesting, in particular, as toy models for the holographic dual to (near)-extremal black holes. Despite its non-locality, the deformed theory has been shown to posess a (Virasoro-Kac-Moody)$^2$ symmetry algebra, whose action on the non-local side is non-standard. In this article we present, in a unified way, three different perspectives on the classical symmetries of $J\bar T$ - deformed CFTs: Hamiltonian, Lagrangian and holographic, showing how the peculiar action of the symmetries can be recovered in each of them. The perfect match we obtain between the Lagrangian and holographic results constitutes a precision check of the holographic dictionary proposed in [1], which we slightly generalize and improve. We also comment on the interpretation of the Comp\`ere-Song-Strominger boundary conditions from the $J\bar T$ viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Holographic observers for time-band algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the algebra of observables in a time band on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space in a theory of quantum gravity. Strictly speaking this algebra does not have a commutant because products of operators within the time band give rise to operators outside the time band. However, we show that in a state where the bulk contains a macroscopic observer, it is possible to define a coarse-grained version of this algebra with a non-trivial commutant, and a resolution limited by the observer's characteristics. This algebra acts on a little Hilbert space that describes excitations about the observer's state and time-translated versions of this state. Our construction requires a choice of dressing that determines how elements of the algebra transform under the Hamiltonian. At leading order in gravitational perturbation theory, and with a specific choice of dressing, our construction reduces to the modular crossed-product described previously in the literature. We also prove a theorem showing that this is the only crossed product of a type III$_1$ algebra resulting in an algebra with a trace. This trace can be used to define entropy differences between states in the little Hilbert space that are insensitive to the properties of the observer. We discuss some technical challenges in extending this construction to higher orders in perturbation theory. Lastly, we review the construction of interior operators in the eternal black hole and show that they can be written as elements of a crossed product algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the colour-dependence of scattering amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory with arbitrary (but fixed) gauge group and various representations of charged matter. When the rank of the gauge theory is taken arbitrarily large compared to the number of particles involved in an amplitude, it is well known that the number of independent colour-structure tensors grows factorially with multiplicity; however, for any fixed gauge group, this number grows at most exponentially with multiplicity. We review how this counting arises in representation theory and survey its implications for a wide variety of specific gauge groups with various representations of charged matter, uncovering several surprising structures along the way.</description>

      <title>Cut-Out Wedges in $H_{3}$ and the Borel-Resurgent Chern-Simons Matrix Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a systematic study of the Chern--Simons theory with gauge group \(\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})\times\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})\) restricted to a wedge-identified manifold in the hyperbolic upper-half-space. The wedge geometry is created by imposing an angular cutoff in the \((x,y)\) plane and identifying two boundary lines, which introduces a single noncontractible loop in the manifold. By imposing the flat-connection condition of the Chern--Simons gauge fields, the path integral reduces to a finite-dimensional matrix integral in \(\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})\times\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})\) . Although Chern-Simons theory is a topological theory, the resulting matrix integral remains nontrivial due to noncompact directions and boundary constraints.
  The large-\(k\) expansion of the matrix integral is carried out by selecting a classical configuration in the space of holonomies and expanding around it in inverse powers of \(k\). The resulting coefficients of the asymptotic series exhibit factorial growth, enabling us to apply the Borel resummation techniques. Summation over these subleading sectors removes potential ambiguities in the Borel integral and clarifies the emergence of a resurgent transseries structure. In the Borel-resurgent analysis, we show that, despite the apparent simplicity of the reduced action, the wedge geometry yields a rich interplay of perturbative and non-perturbative phenomena. This work presents an explicit example of how a finite-dimensional matrix integral in its expansions is physically meaningful through Borel resummation.</description>

      <title>Topological Responses of the Standard Model Gauge Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Built upon the previous work on the 4d anomalies and 5d cobordism invariants (namely, 5d invertible field theory [iTFT] or symmetry-protected topological state [SPTs]) of the Standard Model [SM] gauge theory with compatible (SU(3)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1))/$\mathbb{Z}_q$ gauge group for $q=1,2,3,6$, we further enumerate lower-dimensional iTFT / SPTs in 4d, 3d, 2d, and 1d. While the 4d SPTs are interesting gapped phases attachable to the SM, those integer classes of SPTs (either the torsion or the free cobordism class) are not universal and are difficult to detect. However, fractional SPTs are more universal and can be detected by a topological response similar to the Hall conductance under an appropriate symmetry twist background field. We find a nontrivial symmetry-extension from a magnetic 1-symmetry U(1)$_{[1]}^m$ by an electric 1-symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_{6/q,[1]}^e$ introducing the $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{6/q}$ fractionalization class. While we also introduce the background fields for Baryon minus Lepton number $({\bf B}-{\bf L})$ like 0-symmetries of U(1)$_{{\bf Q} - N_c {\bf L}}$, U(1)$_X$, and $\mathbb{Z}_{4,X}$, that introduces two more data $\alpha \in 1,3$ and $\beta \in 1,5$ for the SMs. We present their Hall conductance response data (denoted as $\sigma, \sigma'$, and $\sigma''$ respectively), between 0-symmetry and 1-symmetry background fields, and show their fractional dependence on the SM data $(q,\alpha,\beta, k)$.</description>

      <title>Branes Screening Quarks and Defect Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we generalize a well-known computation showing Wilson lines exhibit Coulomb scaling laws in AdS/CFT at zero temperature. The area difference between a surface that returns to the boundary, and one that plunges into the bulk, determines the potential between two quarks. This result is naturally extended to Wilson surfaces associated to general p-form symmetries in boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) by embedding a Karch-Randall (KR) brane in the geometry. We find (generalized) Coulomb law scaling in subregion size $\Gamma$ is recovered only above the critical angle for the brane, $\theta_{c,p}$. The potential between the two quarks (or defect operators) vanishes precisely when the surface connecting them ceases to exist at $\theta_{c,p}$. This screening effect, where the operators are fully screened below the critical angle, is a phase transition from Coulomb law to perimeter law with the brane angle $\theta_p$ acting as an order parameter. This effect is also explored at finite temperature, where we introduce a new regularization procedure to obtain closed-form results.</description>

      <title>Semi-Classical Spin Hydrodynamics in Flat and Curved Spacetime: Covariance, Linear Waves, and Bjorken Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore various aspects of semi-classical spin hydrodynamics, where hydrodynamic currents are derived from an expansion in the reduced Planck constant $\hbar$, incorporating both flat and curved spacetimes. After establishing covariant definitions for angular momentum currents, we demonstrate that the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor requires modifications involving the Riemann curvature and the spin tensors. We also revise pseudo-gauge transformations to ensure their applicability in curved spacetimes. Key assumptions for semi-classical spin hydrodynamics are introduced, enabling studies without explicitly invoking quantum kinetic theory. We derive and analyze the linearized semi-classical spin hydrodynamic equations, proving that spin and fluid modes decouple in the linear regime. As a concrete example, we study the ideal-spin approximation in a dissipative fluid with shear viscosity. This analysis confirms our general result: the damping of spin waves is governed solely by spin relaxation time coefficients, independent of linear fluid perturbations. We also examine the Gibbs stability criterion and reveal its limitations at first order in $\hbar$, signaling the inherent anisotropy of the equilibrium state, which remains unaddressed in current semi-classical spin hydrodynamics formulations. Finally, within a conformal Bjorken flow background and using the slow-roll approximation attractor for the fluid sector, we show that the relaxation of the spin potential is governed by spin relaxation time coefficients, mirroring the damping behavior of spin waves in the linear regime.</description>

      <title>Moments to All Orders from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the traditional moments approach in lattice QCD, based on operator product expansion (OPE), can be realized in a way that avoids power divergent mixings, and thus allows to extract moments order by order, to all orders in principle. We propose to use momentum instead of distance as a leverage to extract moments at a given order. Moreover, by utilizing symmetry of the lattice matrix elements, we can determine the even and odd moments separately. As a demonstrative example, we determine the first three moments beyond the tensor charge gT of the isovector quark transversity distribution in the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Rational-function interpolation from p-adic evaluations in scattering amplitude calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical interpolation techniques are widely employed for calculating large rational functions in scattering amplitude computations. It has been observed in recent years that these rational functions greatly simplify upon partial fractioning. In this conference proceedings paper, based on the article [H. A. Chawdhry, Phys. Rev. D 110, 056028 (2024)], a technique is presented to interpolate such rational functions directly in partial-fractioned form, from evaluations at special integer points chosen for their properties under a p-adic absolute value. It is shown that the technique can require 25 times fewer numerical probes than conventional finite-field-based techniques and can produce results that are more compact in size by 2 orders of magnitude. The reconstructed results moreover exhibit additional patterns that could be exploited in future work to further improve the size of the results and the number of required numerical probes.</description>

      <title>Planar Six-Point Feynman Integrals for Four-Dimensional Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute all planar two-loop six-point Feynman integrals entering scattering observables in massless gauge theories such as QCD. A central result of this paper is the formulation of the differential-equations method under the algebraic constraints stemming from four-dimensional kinematics, which in this case leaves only 8 independent scales. We show that these constraints imply that one must compute topologies with only up to 8 propagators, instead of the expected 9. This leads to the decoupling of entire classes of integrals that do not contribute to scattering amplitudes in four dimensional gauge theories. We construct a pure basis and derive their canonical differential equations, of which we discuss the numerical solution. This work marks an important step towards the calculation of massless $2\to 4$ scattering processes at two loops.</description>

      <title>Estimating time in quantum chaotic systems and black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize new universal features of the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, by considering a hypothetical task of "time estimation." Most macroscopic observables in a chaotic system equilibrate to nearly constant late-time values. Intuitively, it should become increasingly difficult to estimate the precise value of time by making measurements on the state. We use a quantity called the Fisher information from quantum metrology to quantify the minimum uncertainty in estimating time. Due to unitarity, the uncertainty in the time estimate does not grow with time if we have access to optimal measurements on the full system. Restricting the measurements to act on a small subsystem or to have low computational complexity leads to results expected from equilibration, where the time uncertainty becomes large at late times. With optimal measurements on a subsystem larger than half of the system, we regain the ability to estimate the time very precisely, even at late times.
  Hawking's calculation for the reduced density matrix of the black hole radiation in semiclassical gravity contradicts our general predictions for unitary quantum chaotic systems. Hawking's state always has a large uncertainty for attempts to estimate the time using the radiation, whereas our general results imply that the uncertainty should become small after the Page time. This gives a new version of the black hole information loss paradox in terms of the time estimation task. By restricting to simple measurements on the radiation, the time uncertainty becomes large. This indicates from a new perspective that the observations of computationally bounded agents are consistent with the semiclassical effective description of gravity.</description>

Abstract: Light scalars that couple to leptons are common figures in beyond the Standard Model endeavors. Considering a scalar that has universal and couplings to leptons only, we compute this leptophilic scalar contribution to the $e^{-}e^{+} \rightarrow \tau^{+}\tau^{-} S $ production cross section with $S \rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-$. We later compare the expected signal with recent data from the Belle collaboration collected near the resonance $\Upsilon(4S)$ with $\mathcal{L}=626 fb^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity to place limits on the couplings-mass plane for the $4$~MeV-$6.5$~GeV mass range to show that Belle stands a great laboratory for light scalars, particularly excluding part of the parameter space in which the muon g-2 anomaly is addressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the vector meson $\omega$ into the Quark Meson model, and study the impact of vector interactions on the properties of static hadrons using the mean-field approximation. The short-range repulsive force associated with vector interactions leads to an expansion of the root mean square radius of nucleons. While the mass of hadrons increases, the gap between this mass and the energy of the three free constituent quarks decreases, resulting in the instability of hadrons. Our study of nucleon mass and radius at finite temperature and density has potential applications for particle yield in heavy ion collisions and the mass-radius relationship in compact stars.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Scattering, Emergent Interactions of Solitons in the Zakharov-Kuznetsov Equation through Conservative and non-Conservative Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to study collision process of soliton solutions in the 2+1 dimensional Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation. The Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation originally was the model in three dimensions of plasma with a uniform magnetic field and it is a direct extension of the KdV equation into higher dimensions and is a typical quasi-integrable system. PINNs successfully solve the equations in the forward process and the solutions are obtained using the mesh-free approach and automatic differentiation while accounting for conservation laws. In the inverse process, the proper form of the equation can be successfully derived from a given training data. On the other hand, the situation becomes weird in the collision process. The result in the forward analysis no longer possesses the conservation laws, which is ought to be referred to as a dynamically incompatible field configuration (DIFC) instead of the solutions of the system. Conservative PINNs are thus introduced and we succeed to obtain the solutions that satisfy the conservation laws. The inverse analysis suggests a different equation where the coefficients exhibit the significant changes, which implies an emergent temporal interaction. With these modulated coefficients, we recalculate the equation and confirm that the conservation law has unquestionably improved.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that Cherenkov radiation can be interpreted as ghost instability of a certain type. Solutions of modified gravity theories often contain ghost instabilities. One type of such ghost instability is associated with existence of different types of species with causal cones that do not share common time, which leads to vacuum decay via creation of particles with positive and negative energies. We show that this ghost instability can be seen as Cherenkov radiation and vice versa.</description>

Abstract: We present a more efficient method for constructing the complete EFT operator basis for particles of any mass and spin, based on on-shell method and Young tableaux. By classifying the amplitude bases according to the polarization configurations of massive particles and using their high-energy limit, our approach can construct EFT basis in a straightforward way, without need of auxiliary fields and tedious basis decomposition. Based on this improved method, we develop a Mathematica code that can automatically construct the EFT basis for particles of any spin. As applications, the EFT bases up to d=8 are explicitly constructed for dark photons and, for the first time, for spin-3/2 gravitino like particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the lack of a universally accepted quantum gravity theory, gravitons are considered the quantum noise in gravitational waves. Wave mediation requires that gravitons be in a coherence state, with an abundance number of order $\sim10^{79}$. Thus, the detection of coherent-state gravitons may be possible in a LIGO-like experiment via Compton scattering with a nanospherical test mass. This work presents the associating scattering amplitude calculation using effective field theory, calculating a total cross section approximately $100 ~\mathrm{cm^2}$ for a coherence state and $\sim10^{-81}~\mathrm{m^2}$ for a single graviton. An experiment proposal involving levitation techniques of a nanosphere is given in full description.</description>

Abstract: In this letter we propose a new interpretation of the Casimir effect. Concretely, we show that the Casimir energy can be written as the quantum ``Von Neumann'' entropy associated to a 2-qubit, mixed, non-separable, pseudo-density matrix of the relevant quantum fluctuations. The quantum entropy we introduce draws parallels to the concept of quantum inseparability found in quantum information theory. Our results suggest that the Casimir energy is a measure of the entanglement of quantum fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: We directly evaluate the probability amplitudes in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity using the Lorentzian path integral formulation. By imposing boundary conditions on the scale factor and the dilaton field, the Lorentzian path integral uniquely yields the probability amplitude without contradiction. Under Dirichlet boundary conditions, we demonstrate that the amplitude derived from the Lorentzian path integral is expressed in terms of the modified Bessel function of the second kind. Furthermore, we provide the determinant for various boundary conditions and perform a detailed analysis of the Lefschetz thimble structure and saddle points. In contrast to four-dimensional gravity, we show that the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal is approximately valid in JT quantum cosmology. Furthermore, addressing quantum perturbation issues, we show that the quantum genesis of the two-dimensional universe occurs and exhibits perturbative regularity when the dilaton field is non-zero and large as an initial condition.</description>

      <title>Machine learning the Renyi entropy of multiple disjoint intervals with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals are computed from the improved swapping operations by two methods: one is from the direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and the other one is from the state-of-the-art machine learning method with neural networks. We use the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model in one-dimension to demonstrate the strategy of the improved swapping operation. In particular, we study the second Renyi entropy with two, three and four disjoint intervals. We find that the results from the above two methods match each other very well within errors, which indicates that the machine learning method is applicable for calculating the Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals. Moreover, as the magnetic field increases, the Renyi entropy grows as well until the system arrives at the critical point of the phase transition. However, as the magnetic field exceeds the critical value, the Renyi entropy will decrease since the system enters the paramagnetic phase. Overall, these results match the theoretical predictions very well and demonstrate the high accuracy of the machine learning methods with neural networks.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of dense nucleon matter at low temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport properties of cold and dense nucleon matter are important for both nuclear and astrophysics but are relatively less studied than those at finite temperatures. In this paper, we present a primary study of bulk and shear viscosities in the limit $T/\mu_B \ll 1$, where $T$ and $\mu_B$ are the temperature and the baryon chemical potential. The analysis is performed for a generic system where nucleons are dressed by the condensation of both scalar and vector interactions. Under the relaxation time approximation of the Boltzmann equation, we compute the viscosities of the system to leading power in $T/\mu_B$ expansion and establish a relation between the thermodynamic potential and transport coefficients, including bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) and shear viscosity ($\eta$). It is found that hydrodynamic stability ($\zeta&gt;0$) imposes additional constraints on the thermodynamic potential. As an example, these relations are applied to the Walecka model. The fluid properties of the cold and dense nucleon matter are characterized by the dimensionless combination of viscosities times the quasi-Fermi momentum over the enthalpy. Furthermore, we discuss the implication of the stability condition on the range of applicability of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the analogy between graviton emission in a thermal radiation environment and the laser mechanism, where photons of the same momentum and polarization are amplified. Using interaction picture perturbation theory, we analyze the time evolution of the graviton number operator and its expectation value in a squeezed vacuum state, describing the inflationary graviton state. During the radiation-dominated era of the early universe, we find secular growth in the graviton number, leading to the breakdown of perturbative analysis within approximately ten Hubble times after reheating. We also explore analogous effects in a Minkowski background. As a thought experiment, we consider LIGO/Virgo-like detectors immersed in a radiation environment at temperatures of $O(10)$ GeV. In this scenario, graviton numbers at $O(100)$ Hz could be enhanced, suggesting a mechanism to amplify gravitational wave signals. While this setup is beyond current experimental capabilities, it points to potential advancements in gravitational wave measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss fermion tunneling from the black hole exterior to white hole exterior geometry using the spin foam technique in background-independent Loop Quantum Gravity. The fermion transition time is equal, longer, or shorter than the black hole tunneling time, depending on the Euclidean dihedral angle. For a locally pinched negative curvature, fermions accumulate in the black hole exterior region where the black hole has already emerged from the white hole. Conversely, in locally stretched positive curvature, fermions reach the white hole exterior prior to the black hole, indicating an Einstein-Rosen bridge-like geometry in black hole-to-white hole bounce.</description>

      <title>Curvature, area and Gauss-Bonnet formula of the Moyal sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied some geometric properties of the Moyal sphere. Using the conformal metric of the sphere in ordinary space and the matrix basis, we calculated the scalar curvature, total curvature integral and area of the Moyal sphere. We found that when the noncommutative parameter approaches to 0, the scalar curvature and area of the Moyal sphere return to those of the ordinary sphere. As the noncommutative parameter increases, the area of the Moyal sphere will decrease and eventually approach to 0. We found that the total curvature integral of the two-dimensional Moyal sphere still satisfies the usual Gauss-Bonnet formula and does not depend on the noncommutative parameter. We also calculated the approximate expression of the conformal metric with a constant curvature and obtained the corresponding correction function. In addition, we also studied a type of generalized deformed Moyal sphere with two noncommutative parameters and obtained similar results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deformation technique, known as the warped convolution, takes quantum fields in Minkowski spacetime to quantum fields in noncommutative Minkowski space-time. Since a quantum field is an operator valued regular distribution and the warped convolution is (weakly) an oscillatory integral of Rieffel type, we prove that the symbol classes introduced by Hormander admit extensions which are suited to the warped convolutions of scalar quantum field operators. We further show that, if a particular vector state on the undeformed algebra of field operators fulfills the microlocal spectrum condition, then every vector state on the deformed algebra generated by these warped convolutions fulfills the microlocal spectrum condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an $S$-duality converse to the one studied by the 1st, 2nd and 4th authors; this is also a case of a twisted version of the relative Langlands duality of Ben Zvi, Sakellaridis and Venkatesh.. Namely, we prove that the $S$-dual of $\text{SO}(2n+1)\times \text{Sp}(2n)$ acting on the tensor product of their tautological representations is the symplectic mirabolic space $\text{Sp}(2n)\times\text{Sp}(2n)$ acting on the product $T^* \text{Sp}(2n)$ and the tautological representations of $\text{Sp}(2n)$. (Note that due to the anomaly, the dual of the second factor $\text{Sp}(2n)$ is the metaplectic dual, i.e. $\text{Sp}(2n)$). We also formulate the corresponding global conjecture, which describes explicitly the categorical theta-correspondence on the Langlands dual side.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible SPTs: an on-site realization of (1+1)d anomaly-free fusion category symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate (1+1)d symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with fusion category symmetries. We emphasize that the UV description of an anomaly-free fusion category symmetry must include the fiber functor, giving rise to a local symmetry action, a charge category and a trivial phase. We construct an ``onsite'' matrix-product-operator (MPO) version of the Hopf algebra symmetry operators in a lattice model with tensor-product Hilbert space. In particular, we propose a systematic framework for classifying and constructing SPTs with non-invertible symmetries. An SPT phase corresponds to a Q-system in the charge category, such that the Q-system becomes a matrix algebra when the symmetry is forgotten. As an example, we provide an explicit microscopic realization of all three $\mathsf{Rep}^\dagger(D_8)$ SPT phases, including a trivial phase, and further demonstrate the $S_3$-duality among these three SPT phases.</description>

      <title>The Two-Loop Lipatov Vertex in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy factorization of 2 -&gt; 2 amplitudes in QCD has been recently pushed to the next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order by determining the three-loop gluon Regge trajectory. This was based on computing multi-Reggeon exchanges using rapidity evolution in the shock-wave formalism, and disentangling between the Regge pole and Regge cut contributions. In the present paper we extend the relevant theoretical framework to 2 -&gt; 3 processes, and compute all multi-Reggeon exchanges necessary for extracting the two-loop Reggeon-gluon-Reggeon Lipatov vertex from 2 -&gt; 3 amplitudes. Then, specializing general amplitude methods to multi-Regge kinematics, we derive analytic expressions for non-planar two-loop gg -&gt; ggg, gq -&gt; ggq and qq -&gt; qgq QCD amplitudes in that limit. Matching these to the multi-Reggeon computation, we determine the QCD Lipatov vertex in dimensional regularization at two loops through finite terms. We also determine the one-loop vertex through O(epsilon^4). All results are expressed in a compact form in terms of a basis of single-valued generalised polylogarithms, manifesting target-projectile symmetry and reality properties. Furthermore, our basis of functions is explicitly finite in the soft limit, featuring delicate cancellation of spurious rational poles by transcendental functions. Agreement between all three partonic channels, as well agreement of the maximal weight contributions with the super Yang-Mills Lipatov vertex provide robust checks of the result.</description>

Abstract: We derive the Hamiltonian function for extended teleparallel theories of gravity in their covariant formulation. In particular, we present the Hamiltonian for $f(T)$ gravity and New General Relativity. From this, we obtain the related Hamilton equations, which are presented both in covariant formulation and Weitzenb\"ock gauge. In this framework, teleparallel equivalent to General Relativity, its $f(T)$ extension and New General Relativity can be compared. We find that $f(T)$ and New General Relativity consistently reduce to the Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity, while significant differences appear comparing the Hamilton equations of $f(T)$ with $f(R)$ gravity.</description>

Abstract: Periods of rational integrals appear in quantum mechanics through asymptotic expansions of traces computed with the semiclassical symbol calculus. In particular, a novel formal series expansion for the trace of the Dirac delta of the quantization of a polynomial Hamiltonian is developed. Reducing these integrals modulo total derivatives results in a novel formula for normal forms of the integrals. In the case of one degree of freedom, the two dimensional residue formula relates the rational integrals to the quantum actions in the exact WKB formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the second order gravitational perturbations in an AdS black brane background. The equations of motion for the second order modes are obtained in terms of gauge invariant variables, where in general the second order quasi-normal modes are sourced by two first order quasi-normal modes. The ratio of the amplitudes between the second order mode and the product of two linear modes in the source is numerically computed. Remarkably, it turns out that the quadratic-to-linear ratio of amplitudes at horizon is found to be of order one in general. In particular, the resonance occurs at special positions in momentum space, where the amplitude becomes divergent. The condition leading to the resonance is that the combined frequency of two sources coincides with one of another first order quasi-normal mode. This phenomenon is in contrast to what is observed in asymptotically flat spacetime.</description>

      <title>Emergence, Formation and Dynamics of Hot QCD Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we make progress in two concrete directions in the vast landscape of hot QCD physics. The first one is quarkonium transport inside quark-gluon plasma (QGP), the high temperature phase of QCD. Over the past two decades it has been realized that a significant fraction of quarkonium suppression in high energy heavy ion collisions comes from dynamic dissociation and recombination processes, instead of static screening of the interaction potential as originally proposed by Matsui and Satz. Our contribution is the formulation of the precise correlation functions in QCD at finite temperature that describe the dissociation and recombination processes of heavy quarkonium in QGP, as well as their calculation in weakly coupled QCD and strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We also formulate the Euclidean version of these correlation functions so that they may be calculated using Lattice QCD techniques. The second contribution we make is the development of tools to understand the process of hydrodynamization in QCD kinetic theory and their application to a simplified description where only a subset of the QCD scattering mechanisms are included. By doing this, we learn that the process of hydrodynamization in this theory, and specifically, how memory of the initial condition is lost, follows the recently proposed Adiabatic Hydrodynamization scenario. Concretely, hydrodynamization proceeds through a sequential process in which a monotonously shrinking set of low-energy states dominate the dynamics, where the opening of an energy gap relative to the ground state(s) signals the start of each stage of this process. The hydrodynamic attractor is reached when only one low-energy state remains as the ground state, and the system approaches local thermal equilibrium following the adiabatic evolution of this low-energy state.</description>

      <title>The Casimir Effect in (3+1)-dimensional lattice Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature: the unexpected universality of quarkiton and glueton boundary states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our earlier work on the Casimir effect in (3+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills theory, we identified two novel nonperturbative states arising in QCD with boundaries: the glueton and the quarkiton. The glueton, or "gluon exciton", is a colorless bound state formed by gluons interacting with their negatively colored images in a chromometallic mirror. The quarkiton, or "quark exciton", is a meson-like state comprising a heavy quark attracted to its image through the mirror. In this study, we extend our analysis to finite temperatures near the deconfinement phase transition $(T \approx 0.78 T_c)$, where we observe a linear potential between a color-neutral chromometallic mirror and a heavy test quark. Our result suggests that the quarkiton state can have a physical relevance since mirrors for photons and, presumably, gluons can be realized in field theories as domain-wall solutions. Furthermore, we find a striking universality: the ratio of the glueton mass to the bulk $0^{++}$ glueball mass - defining the bulk mass gap - matches the ratio of the quarkiton string tension to the string tension between quark and anti-quark in the absence of the mirror, with a value $\mathcal{R} = 0.294(11)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating superradiance in cylinders has recently been observed experimentally using acoustic waves to shed light on the understanding of the superradiant phenomenon in black holes. In this paper, for the first time, we study superradiance in acoustic black holes through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation using COMSOL multiphysics. We find that superradiance can occur in acoustic black holes when the general superradiance condition is met. We also find the amplification effect is significantly weaker in acoustic black holes than in regular cylinders, due to the absorption in such structure.</description>

      <title>Parametrized topological phases in 1d and T-duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are families of physical systems that cannot be adiabatically evolved to the trivial system uniformly across the parameter space, even if each system in the family belongs to the trivial phase. The obstruction is measured by higher Berry class. We analyze families of topological systems in 1+1d using families of invertible TQFTs and families of RG fixed states of spin chains. We use the generalized matrix-product states to describe RG fixed points of all translation invariant pure splits states on spin chains. Families of such fixed points correspond to bundles of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. There exists a global MPS parametrization of the family if and only if the latter bundle is trivial. We propose a novel duality of parametrized topological phases which is an avatar of the T-duality in string theory. The duality relates families with different parameter spaces and different higher Berry classes. Mathematically, the T-duality is realized by gauging the circle action on the continuous trace algebra generated by parametrized matrix-product tensors.</description>

      <title>Searches for Power-Law Warped Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extra dimensions with a bulk dilaton field can be power-law warped, unlike the exponential warping in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. We show that this mildly warped extra dimension can address the hierarchy problem with a novel Kaluza-Klein (KK) spectrum characterized by lighter feebly coupled KK modes compared to the KK modes in the RS model. We investigate the prospects of searching for signatures of such KK modes at current and future colliders, such as the LHC, CLIC, and FCC-ee using visible decays of KK gravitons. We also update the current bounds and projected limits for the RS model and the linear dilaton (LD) model. Furthermore, we explore the long-lived regime of KK gravitons at Belle II, beam dump experiments, e.g., FASER2, MATHUSLA, and SHiP, as well as constraints from astrophysical and cosmological observations. We find that combining both kinds of searches will enable comprehensive coverage of the model parameter space relevant to the electroweak hierarchy problem.</description>

      <title>Entangling gates from cabling of knots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While there is a general consensus about the structure of one qubit operations in topological quantum computer, two qubits are as usual a more difficult and complex story of different attempts with varying approaches, problems and effectiveness. In this paper we discuss how to construct an efficient realization of a two qubit gate in topological quantum computer, by using principle of cabling from the knot theory. This allows to construct a braiding of cables dependent on the parameters of the theory where there is a low probability of moving out of computational space (high fidelity of operation) while there is a non-trivial entangling two-qubit operation. We also present some examples of these operations for different parameters of the theory.</description>

      <title>New Black Hole Solutions of Second and First Order Formulations of Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the so-called Palatini formulation of General Relativity and of its modifications and extensions, we consider an analogous formulation of the dynamics of a self-interacting gauge field which is determined by non-linear extension of Maxwell's theory, usually known as nonlinear electrodynamics. In this first order formalism the field strength and the gauge potential are treated, a priori as independent, and, as such, varied independently in order to produce the field equations. Accordingly we consider within this formalism alternative and generalized non-linear Lagrangian densities. Several new spherically-symmetric objects are constructed analytically and their main properties are studied. The solutions are obtained in flat spacetime ignoring gravity and for the self-gravitating case with emphasis on black holes. As a background for comparison between the first and second order formalisms, some of the solutions are obtained by the conventional second order formalism, while for others a first order formalism is applied. Among the self-gravitating solutions we find new black holes and study their main characteristics. Some of the solutions can regularize the total energy of a point charge although their black hole counterparts are not regular.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate some widely-known holography properties of accelerating and rotating black hole, described by rotating C-metric, especially the case in Nariai limit, which are related to Kerr-CFT correspondence but differs in that the outer horizon will coincide the acceleration horizon and the extremal geometry is described by $dS_{2}$ rather than $AdS_{2}$. In order to achieve this goal we define a regularized Komar mass with physical interpretation of varying the horizon area from massless limit to general case. We also reduce the action to a 2-dimensional JT-type action and discuss some of its properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present NNLOCAL, a proof-of-concept parton-level Monte Carlo program implementing the extension of the completely local subtraction scheme CoLoRFulNNLO to the case of color-singlet production in hadron collisions. We have built general local subtraction terms that regularize all single and double unresolved infrared singularities in real radiation phase space. The subtractions are then integrated fully analytically to the required order in the parameter of dimensional regularization. Combining the integrated counterterms with the virtual contributions we demonstrate the cancellation of all infrared poles explicitly. We validate our procedure by computing the fully differential cross section for the production of a Higgs boson at the LHC in an effective field theory with gluons only. Our code provides the first public implementation of a completely local analytic subtraction scheme at next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Signatures of Neutrino Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tiny neutrino masses are most naturally explained by the seesaw mechanism through singlet right-handed neutrinos, which can further explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. In this work, we propose a new approach to study cosmological signatures of neutrino seesaw through the interaction between inflaton and right-handed neutrinos. After inflation the inflaton predominantly decays into right-handed neutrinos and its decay rate is modulated by the fluctuations of Higgs field which act as the source of curvature perturbations. We demonstrate that this modulation produces primordial non-Gaussian signatures, which can be measured by the forthcoming large-scale structure surveys. We find that these surveys have the potential to probe a large portion of the neutrino seesaw parameter space, opening up a new window for testing the high scale seesaw mechanism.</description>

Abstract: We present a stable cosmological model of a closed universe in the presence of conventional scalar field. The stability of the model and absence of singularity is ensured by spatial curvature without the need for additional peculiar matter. We reconstruct the Lagrangian and numerically compute observational predictions, including the number of e-folds, the spectral index $n_s$, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We present several sets of parameters that satisfy the current observational data.</description>

      <title>The (in)stability of quasinormal modes of Boulware-Deser-Wheeler black hole in the hyperboloidal framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quasinormal modes of Boulware-Deser-Wheeler black hole in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity theory within the hyperboloidal framework. The effective potentials for the test Klein-Gordon field and gravitational perturbations of scalar, vector, and tensor type are thoroughly investigated and put into thirteen typical classes. The effective potentials for the gravitational perturbations have more diverse behaviors than those in general relativity, such as double peaks, the existence of the negative region adjacent to or far away from the event horizon, etc. These lead to the existence of unstable modes ($\text{Im} \omega&lt;0$), and the presence of gravitational wave echoes. These rich phenomenons are inherent in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, rather than artificially introduced by hand. What's more, the (in)stability of quasinormal modes are studied in frequency domain and time domain, respectively. For the frequency aspect, the pseudospectrum is used to account for the instability of the spectrum. For the time domain, we add a small bump to the effective potential, and find that the new waveform does not differ significantly from the original one, where the comparison is characterized by the so-called mismatch functions. This means that quasinormal modes are stable in time domain. In this way, our study reveals the non-equivalence of the stability of quasinormal modes in the frequency domain and the time domain. We also numerically investigate Price's law at both finite distances and infinity with the assistance of the hyperboloidal approach.</description>

Abstract: The polynomial affine model of gravity was proposed as an alternative to metric and metric-affine gravitational models. What at the beginning was thought as a source of unpredictability, the presence of many terms in the action, turned out to be a milestone, since it contains all possible combinations of the fields compatible with the covariance under diffeomorphisms. Here, we present a review of the advances in the analysis of the model after ten years of its proposal, and sketch the guideline of our future perspectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the generating function $C_N(A)$, which enumerates classical closed random walks on square and triangular lattices with $N$ steps and a signed area $A$, characterized by the number of moves in each hopping direction. This enumeration problem is mapped to the trace of powers of anisotropic Hofstadter-like Hamiltonian and is connected to the cluster coefficients of exclusion particles: exclusion strength parameter $g = 2$ for square lattice walks, and a mixture of $g = 1$ and $g = 2$ for triangular lattice walks. By leveraging the intrinsic link between the Hofstadter model and high energy physics, we propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration $C_N(A)$ in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory: square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walks are associated with local $\mathcal{B}_3$.</description>

      <title>Topological dark energy from black-hole formations and mergers through the gravity-thermodynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the gravity-thermodynamics approach in the case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, and its corresponding Wald-Gauss-Bonnet entropy, which due to the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem it is related to the Euler characteristic of the Universe topology. However, we consider the realistic scenario where we have the formation and merger of black holes that lead to topology changes, which induce entropy changes in the Universe horizon. We extract the modified Friedmann equations and we obtain an effective dark energy sector of topological origin. We estimate the black-hole formation and merger rates starting from the observed star formation rate per redshift, which is parametrized very efficiently by the Madau-Dickinson form, and finally we result to a dark-energy energy density that depends on the cosmic star formation rate density, on the fraction $f_{\text{BH}}$ of stars forming black holes, on the fraction of black holes $f_\text{merge}$ that eventually merge, on the fraction $ f_{\text{bin}}$ of massive stars that are in binaries, on the average mass of progenitor stars that will evolve to form black holes $ \langle m_{\text{prog}} \rangle $, as well as on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. We investigate in detail the cosmological evolution, obtaining the usual thermal history. Concerning the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter, we show that at intermediate redshifts it exhibits phantom-like or quintessence-like behavior according to the sign of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling, while at early and late times it tends to the cosmological constant value. Finally, we study the effect of the other model parameters, showing that for the whole allowed observationally estimated ranges, the topological dark-energy equation-of-state parameter remains within its observational bounds.</description>

      <title>Causality and Stability from Acoustic Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories with derivative interactions form backgrounds which spontaneously break Lorentz invariance. We investigate the dynamics of free scalar perturbations on general anisotropic backgrounds. We demonstrate that the phonons move on null geodesics of an acoustic spacetime described by its own metric and own connection featuring nonmetricity with respect to the usual spacetime metric. We give distinct physical interpretations to the acoustic metric and its inverse. The first defines rays and their phase velocities. The latter defines momenta and the dispersion relation. We classify possible acoustic geometries and provide a physical interpretation for them.
  We discuss the phonon properties that moving observers, inequivalent owing to the breaking of Lorentz invariance, would measure. Ghosts and true gradient instabilities are to be read off from invariant properties of the acoustic metric - its signature and determinant. However, the choice of the observer's frame can cause some confusion and paradoxes, including apparent instabilities. For instance, complex phonon energies can appear entirely due to the ill-posedness of the Cauchy problem in the frame chosen. On the other hand, unbounded negative phonon energies can appear, without ghosts or gradient instabilities, for observers moving supersonically, when phonon Cherenkov radiation can be emitted.
  The action for phonons also gives an acoustically covariantly conserved energy-momentum tensor (EMT) which is, however, not conserved in the usual spacetime. Nonetheless, in the presence of an acoustic timelike Killing vector, the acoustic Hamiltonian functional is a conserved charge in both the acoustic and in the usual spacetimes, and even has the same value in both. Thus, the acoustic Hamiltonian can be used to bound the motion of phonons interacting with other species living in the usual spacetime.</description>

Abstract: Theoretical predictions for high-energy collision processes at particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), rely on calculations in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which are often computationally challenging. In these conference proceedings, we explore the possibility of using quantum computers to simulate QCD processes in the perturbative QCD regime. In particular, as a first step towards that goal, we present quantum circuits to simulate the colour part of perturbative QCD. The circuits are validated by implementing them on a simulated quantum computer and verifying the colour factors for several example Feynman diagrams.</description>

      <title>General Covariant Gauge Fixing for Massless Spin-Two Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:0707.2590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most general covariant gauge fixing Lagrangian is considered for a spin-two gauge theory in the context of the Faddeev-Popov procedure. In general, five parameters characterize this gauge fixing. Certain limiting values for these parameters give rise to a spin-two propagator that is either traceless or transverse, but for no values of these parameters is this propagator simultaneously traceless and transverse. Having a traceless-transverse (TT) propagator ensures that only the physical degrees of freedom associated with the tensor field propagate, and hence it is analogous to the Landau gauge in electrodynamics. To obtain such a traceless-transverse propagator, a gauge fixing Lagrangian which is not quadratic must be employed; this sort of gauge fixing Lagrangian is not encountered in the usual Faddeev-Popov procedure. It is shown that when this non-quadratic gauge fixing Lagrangian is used, two Fermionic and one Bosonic ghost arise. As a simple application we discuss the energy-momentum tensor of the gravitational field at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Holographic entanglement negativity for disjoint subsystems in $\mathrm{AdS_{d+1}/CFT_d}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2001.10534v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a construction to compute the holographic entanglement negativity for bipartite mixed state configurations of two disjoint subsystems in higher dimensional conformal field theories (CFT$_d$s) dual to bulk AdS$_{d+1}$ geometries. Our proposal follows from the corresponding AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ scenario and involves an algebraic sum of the areas of bulk RT surfaces for certain combinations of subsystems. Utilizing our construction we compute the holographic entanglement negativity at the leading order through a perturbative expansion, for such bipartite mixed states of two disjoint subsystems with long rectangular strip geometries in CFT$_d$s dual to bulk pure AdS$_{d+1}$ geometries and AdS$_{d+1}$-Schwarzschild black holes.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly in (1+1) dimensions revisited: complementary kinetic perspective and universality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.02844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reinvestigate the classic example of the chiral anomaly in (1+1) dimensional spacetime. By reviewing the derivation of charge conservation using the semiclassical Boltzmann equation, we show that chiral anomalies could emerge in (1+1) dimensions without Berry curvature corrections to the kinetic theory. The pivotal step depends only on the asymptotic behavior of the distribution function of the quasiparticle--and thus its dispersion relation--in the limit of $\mathbf p\to\pm\infty$ rather than the detailed functional form of the dispersion. We address two subjects motivated by this observation. First, we reformulate (1+1)-dimensional chiral anomaly using kinetic theory with the current algebra approach and the gradient expansion of the Dirac Lagrangian, adding a complementary perspective to existing approaches. Second, we demonstrate the universality of the chiral anomaly across various quasiparticle dispersions. For two-band models linear in the temporal derivative, with Fujikawa's method we show it is sufficient to have a chirality-odd strictly monotonic dispersion in order to exhibit the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Towards a unitary formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime: the case of de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06046v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Before we ask what the quantum gravity theory is, it is a legitimate quest to formulate a robust quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS). Several conceptual problems, especially unitarity loss (pure states evolving into mixed states), have raised concerns over several decades. In this paper, acknowledging the fact that {time} is a parameter in quantum theory, which is different from its status in the context of General Relativity (GR), we start with a "quantum first approach" and propose a new formulation for QFTCS based on the discrete spacetime transformations which offer a way to achieve unitarity. We rewrite the QFT in Minkowski spacetime with a direct-sum Fock space structure based on the discrete spacetime transformations and geometric superselection rules. Applying this framework to QFTCS, in the context of de Sitter (dS) spacetime, we elucidate how this approach to quantization complies with unitarity and the observer complementarity principle. We then comment on understanding the scattering of states in de Sitter spacetime. Furthermore, we discuss briefly the implications of our QFTCS approach to future research in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Gauge field fluctuation corrected QED3 effective action by fermionic particle-vortex duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06916v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a non-perturbative framework for incorporating gauge field fluctuations into effective actions of QED3 in the infrared using fermionic particle-vortex duality. This approach is demonstrated through the applications to models containing N species of 2-component Dirac fermions in solvable and interpretable electromagnetic backgrounds, focusing on N = 1 or 2. For the N = 1 model, we establish a correspondence between fermion Casimir energy at finite density and the magnetic Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, and further evaluate the corrections to their amplitudes. This predicts amplification of charge susceptibility and reduction of magnetic permeability. We additionally provide physical interpretations for each component of our calculation and offer alternative derivations based on energy density measurements in different characteristic lengths. For N = 2, we show that magnetic catalysis is erased in a U(1)xU(1) QED3, indicating no breakdown of chiral symmetry. Reasoning is offered based on the properties of the lowest Landau level wave functions.</description>

      <title>Hidden zeros for particle/string amplitudes and the unity of colored scalars, pions and gluons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the emergence of a new understanding of scattering amplitudes in the simplest theory of colored scalar particles - the Tr$(\phi^3)$ theory - based on combinatorial and geometric ideas in the kinematic space of scattering data. In this paper we report a surprise: far from the toy model it appears to be, the ''stringy'' Tr$(\phi^3)$ amplitudes secretly contain the scattering amplitudes for pions, as well as non-supersymmetric gluons, in any number of dimensions. The amplitudes for the different theories are given by one and the same function, related by a simple shift of the kinematics. This discovery was spurred by another fundamental observation: the tree-level Tr$(\phi^3)$ field theory amplitudes have a hidden pattern of zeros when a special set of non-planar Mandelstam invariants is set to zero. Furthermore, near these zeros, the amplitudes simplify, by factoring into a non-trivial product of smaller amplitudes. Remarkably the amplitudes for pions and gluons are observed to also vanish in the same kinematical locus. These properties further generalize to the ''stringy'' Tr$(\phi^3)$ amplitudes. There is a unique shift of the kinematic data that preserves the zeros, and this shift is precisely the one that unifies colored scalars, pions, and gluons into a single object. We will focus in this paper on explaining the hidden zeros and factorization properties and the connection between all the colored theories, working for simplicity at tree-level. Subsequent works will describe this new formulation for the Non-linear Sigma Model and non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, at all loop orders.</description>

Abstract: We show that position space correlators of a Poincare invariant quantum field theory can be recast in terms of conformally invariant correlators, in other words, as functions of conformal cross ratios. In particular, we show that correlators of massless fields in flat spacetimes with $n-$point interactions can be expressed as position space soft limits of conformally invariant correlators with $(n+1)-$point interactions. We show that this correspondence applies at the level of every Feynman diagram that appears in the perturbative expansion of the correlators in the respective coupling constants. We apply this method to find exact answers for some Feynman diagrams including several loop examples. We also show that the analogous correlators for massive fields can be expressed as infinite sums of conformal correlators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scattering amplitudes for the simplest theory of colored scalar particles - the Tr($\Phi^3$) theory - have recently been the subject of active investigations. In this letter we describe an unanticipated wider implication of this work: the Tr($\Phi^3$) theory secretly contains Non-linear Sigma Model (NLSM) amplitudes to all loop orders. The NLSM amplitudes are obtained from Tr$(\Phi^3)$ amplitudes by a unique shift of kinematic variables. We show that this shifted kinematics produces amplitudes for a cubic theory with a linear term in potential, with extrema spontaneously breaking $U(N) \to U(N-k) \times U(k)$. The Goldstone amplitudes for this theory coincide with those of pions in the $U(N) \times U(N) \to U(N)$ chiral Lagrangian to all orders in the planar limit. We also give a purely on-shell understanding of this correspondence, showing integrands defined by the kinematic shifts have the correct residues on poles and appropriately produce the Adler zero. Finally, we discuss how similar kinematic shifts produce certain infinite classes of mixed amplitudes of pions and Tr($\Phi^3$) scalars, most of which are not interpretable from the Lagrangian description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19909v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a hydrodynamic framework derived from the action of a perfect fluid, modified by the hydrodynamic analog of Novikov's multivalued functional. This modification introduces spin degrees of freedom into the fluid. The structure closely resembles the Abelian version of the Wess-Zumino functional, commonly applied in field theories with chiral anomalies. The deformation incorporates the transport properties of Weyl fermions and exhibits the chiral anomaly in the case of a charged fluid. It is also consistent with Onsager's semiclassical quantization of circulation. Additionally, we discuss the hydrodynamic analog of instantons and related topological invariants.</description>

Abstract: We explore the landscape of F-theory compactifications on Calabi--Yau fourfolds whose complex structure moduli space is the thrice-punctured sphere. As a first part, we enumerate all such Calabi--Yau fourfolds under the additional requirement that it has a large complex structure and conifold point at two of the punctures. We find 14 monodromy tuples by demanding the monodromy around infinity to be quasi-unipotent. As second part, we study the four different types of phases arising at infinity. For each we consider a working example where we determine the leading periods and other physical couplings. We also included a notebook that sets up the period vectors for any of these models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14237v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct CFT states describing a putative holographic dual to local excitations in the three-dimensional de Sitter space (dS), called the bulk local states. We find that the conjugation operation in dS$_3/$CFT$_2$ is notably different from that in AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$. This requires us to combine two bulk local states constructed out of different primary states in a CPT-invariant way. This analysis explains why Green's functions in the dS Euclidean vacuum cannot simply be obtained from the Wick rotation of those in AdS. We also argue that this characteristic feature explains the emergence of a time coordinate from the dual Euclidean CFT. We show that the information metric for the quantum estimation of bulk coordinate values replicates the de Sitter space metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The synchronous gauge in gravity ($g_{0 \lambda} = - \delta_{0 \lambda}$) is ill-defined due to the singularity at $p_0 = 0$ in the graviton propagator. Previously we studied "softening" this gauge by considering instead the gauge $n^\lambda g_{\lambda \mu} = 0$, $n^\lambda = (1, - \varepsilon (\partial^j \partial_j )^{- 1} \partial^k ) $ in the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$. We now explore the possibility of using a principal value prescription (not in the standard Cauchy sense), which amounts, roughly speaking, to replacing singularities $p_0^{-j} \Rightarrow [ (p_0 + i \varepsilon )^{-j} + (p_0 - i \varepsilon )^{-j} ] / 2$, which then behave like distributions. We show that such a propagator follows upon adding to the action a gauge-violating term of a general form, which reduces to $ \sim \int f_\lambda \Lambda^{\lambda \mu} f_\mu \d^4 x $ with a constant operator $\Lambda^{\lambda \mu}$ depending on $\partial$ and a metric functional $f_\lambda$. The contribution of the ghost fields to the effective action is analysed. For the required intermediate regularization, the discrete structure of the theory at small distances is implied. It is shown that the ghost contribution can be disregarded in the limit $ \varepsilon \to 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using universal predictions provided by classical soft theorems, we revisit the energy emission spectrum for gravitational scatterings of compact objects in the low-frequency expansion. We calculate this observable beyond the zero-frequency limit, retaining an exact dependence on the kinematics of the massive objects. This allows us to study independently the ultrarelativistic or massless limit, where we find agreement with the literature, and the small-deflection or post-Minkowskian (PM) limit, where we provide explicit results up to $\mathcal{O}(G^5)$. These confirm that the high-velocity limit of a given PM order is smoothly connected to the corresponding massless result whenever the latter is analytic in the Newton constant $G$. We also provide explicit expressions for the waveforms to order $\omega^{-1}$, $\log\omega$, $\omega(\log\omega)^2$ in the soft limit, $\omega\to0$, expanded up to sub-subleading PM order, as well as a conjecture for the logarithmic soft terms of the type $\omega^{n-1}(\log\omega)^{n}$ with $n\ge 3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first study the consequence of spacetime translations and Lorentz transformations on Celestial CFT OPEs. Working with the light transforms of the operators belonging to the modified Mellin basis, we found that the leading order singularity in the OPE of such operators could be fixed purely using Poincar\'e symmetries owing to the non-trivial action of the translations on these operators. The OPE coefficient is then fixed using the soft limit of the correlation functions. We check that this singular structure obtained from symmetries is consistent with the OPE limit of three-point functions. This approach could potentially be useful for studying Celestial CFT without adverting to bulk physics. As another goal, we explore the significance of light transformation in Carrollian CFTs. In the special cases we considered, we show that light transformation equips us with a map between two branches of Carroll CFT in $d=3$ dimension at the level of correlation functions in the near coincident limit.</description>

Abstract: Embedding Feynman integrals in Grassmannians, we can write Feynman integrals as some finite linear combinations of generalized hypergeometric functions. In this paper we present a general method to obtain Gauss relations among those generalized hypergeometric functions. The hypergeometric expressions of Feynman integral are continued from a connected component to another by the inverse Gauss relations, then continued to the whole domain of definition by the Gauss-Kummer relations. The Laurent series of the Feynman integral around the space-time dimension $D=4$ is obtained by the Gauss adjacent relations where the coefficient of the term with power of $D-4$ is given as the linear combinations of hypergeometric functions with integer parameters. As examples, we illustrate how to obtain the expressions for the Feynman integrals of the 1-loop self-energy and a 2-loop massless triangle diagram in the domains of definition.</description>

Abstract: We consider non-critical heterotic strings compactified on $S^1$. For full rank theories, they are related to odd self-dual lattices and are structurally of the same form as the critical non-supersymmetric theories. For dimensions up to 14 the associated moduli spaces are Coxeter polytopes already studied by Vinberg and Kaplinskaya. In the heterotic string context, the Coxeter diagrams of these moduli spaces are related through transformations representing the process of dimension changing tachyon condensation of Hellerman-Swanson. For dimensions 8 and 6 respectively on $S^1$ and $T^2$ we show that at special points in the moduli space the subcritical string is the CHS background for two coincident NS5-branes and the intersection of two such pairs. These configurations are interpreted as an end result of condensing heterotic winding tachyons along one or two Scherck-Schwarz circles at self-dual radius. We give evidence that in the first case there is a T-duality between the pair of NS5-branes and a recently constructed non-supersymmetric heterotic 6-brane.</description>

Abstract: The entanglement entropy of the Hawking radiation contains contributions from a region inside the black hole, which is called islands, implying that the Hawking radiation contains the information of islands. The boundary of the island is given by the quantum extremal surface, whose position is determined so that the entanglement entropy is extremized. In many cases of stationary black holes and a few cases of evaporating black holes, it was already confirmed that the quantum extremal surface is located outside the horizon for stationary black holes and is inside the horizon for evaporating black holes. In this paper, we calculate islands in general black holes and show that the island extends to the outside of the horizon for stationary black holes but is hidden inside the horizon for evaporating black holes independent of details of the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the geodesics connecting two time-like separated boundary points in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. We find that in spherically symmetry Schwarzschild AdS black hole, smooth space-like geodesics can connect timelike-separated points by winding around the horizon multiple times. Similar result will also happen in modified BTZ black hole which contains photon ring in the bulk. According to recent holographic proposal on time-like entanglement entropy, our result suggests that, if there is photon ring/sphere in the bulk, then the time-like entanglement entropy AdS3/CFT2 duality may not have an imaginary part and so further understanding may be necessary.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics in 2d HCFTs on the curved background: the case of q-M\"obius Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We will explore the dynamical property of non-equilibrium phenomena induced by two-dimensional holographic conformal field theory (2d holographic CFT) Hamiltonian on the curved spacetime by studying the time dependence of the entanglement entropy and mutual information. Here, holographic CFT is the CFT having the gravity dual. We will start from the boundary and thermofield double states, evolve the systems in Euclidean time with the Hamiltonian on the curved background, and then evolve them in real-time with the same Hamiltonian. We found that the early- and late-time entanglement structure depends on the curved background, while the entanglement growth does not, and is linear. Furthermore, in the gravity dual for the thermofield double state, this entanglement growth is due to the linear growth of the wormhole, while in the one for the boundary state, it is due to the in-falling of the end of the world brane to the black hole. We discussed the low temperature system can be regarded as the dynamical system induced by the multi-joining quenches. We also discussed the effective description of the high temperature system, called line tension picture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we present the non-relativistic regime of the Hietarinta gravity theory and its extension to supergravity. At the bosonic level, we derive the non-relativistic version of the Hietarinta model by employing a contraction process and addressing the non-degeneracy of the invariant metric. To incorporate supersymmetry, we apply the Lie algebra expansion method to obtain the non-relativistic formulation of $\mathcal{N}=2$ Hietarinta supergravity. Our results reveal that the non-relativistic Hietarinta theory encompasses the extended Bargmann (super)gravity as a special case, yet it differs significantly from other existing non-relativistic (super)gravity models. Furthermore, we generalize our analysis to include a cosmological constant term in the non-relativistic Hietarinta (super)gravity action and examine its effects on the torsion structure.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we construct the classical phase space of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with positive cosmological constant on spatial slices with circle topology. This turns out to be somewhat more intricate than in the case of negative cosmological constant; this phase space has many singular points and is not even Hausdorff. Nonetheless, it admits a group-theoretic description which is quite amenable to quantization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a presymplectic BV-AKSZ sigma model encoding the ghost-free massive bigravity theory action as well as its Batalin-Vilkovisky extension in terms of the finite-dimensional graded geometry of the target space. A characteristic feature of the construction is that the target space is realised as a quasi-regular submanifold of a linear graded manifold which, in turn, is a direct product of two copies of the shifted Poincar\'e or (anti-)de Sitter Lie algebra. This graded manifold comes equipped with a natural presymplectcic structure and the compatible pre-$Q$ structure which is a sum of the Chevalley-Eilenberg differentials of each copy of the Lie algebra and the interaction term. The constraints determining the submanifold are the supergeometrical realisation of the known Deser-van Nieuwenhuizen condition and its descendant.</description>

      <title>Discrete Max-Focusing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Focusing Conjecture (QFC) lies at the foundation of holography and semiclassical gravity. The QFC implies the Bousso bound and the Quantum Null Energy Condition (QNEC). The QFC also ensures the consistency of the quantum extremal surface prescription and bulk reconstruction in AdS/CFT.
  However, the central object in the QFC -- the expansion of lightrays -- is not defined at points where geodesics enter or leave a null congruence. Moreover, the expansion admits three inequivalent quantum extensions in terms of the conditional max, min, and von Neumann entropies.
  Here we formulate a discrete notion of nonexpansion that can be evaluated even at non-smooth points. Moreover, we show that a single conjecture, the discrete max-QFC, suffices for deriving the QNEC, the Bousso bound, and key properties of both max and min entanglement wedges. Continuous numerical values need not be assigned, nor are the von Neumann or min-versions of the quantum expansion needed. Both our new notion of nonexpansion, and also the properties of conditional max entropies, are inherently asymmetric and outward directed from the input wedge. Thus the framework we develop here reduces and clarifies the axiomatic structure of semiclassical gravity, eliminating redundancies and fixing ambiguities.
  We also derive a new result: the strong subadditivity of the generalized smooth conditional max and min entropies of entanglement wedges.</description>

      <title>Graded transcendental functions: an application to four-point amplitudes with one off-shell leg</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several recent works have demonstrated the powerful algebraic simplifications that can be achieved for scattering amplitudes through a systematic grading of transcendental quantities. We develop these concepts to construct a minimal basis of functions tailored to a scattering amplitude in a general way. Starting with formal solutions for all master integral topologies, we organise the appearing functions by properties such as their symbol alphabet or letter adjacency. We rotate the basis such that functions with spurious features appear in the least possible number of basis elements. Since their coefficients must vanish for physical quantities, this approach avoids complex cancellations. As a first application, we evaluate all integral topologies relevant to the three-loop $Hggg$ and $Hgq\bar{q}$ amplitudes in the leading-colour approximation and heavy-top limit. We describe the derivation of canonical differential equation systems and present a method for fixing boundary conditions without the need for a full functional representation. Using multiple numerical reductions, we test the maximal transcendentality conjecture for $Hggg$ and identify a new letter which appears in functions of weight 4 and 5. In addition, we provide the first direct analytic computation of a three-point form factor of the operator $\mathrm{Tr}(\phi^2)$ in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ sYM and find agreement with numerical and bootstrapped results.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple chiral 2d theory living on a momentum space celestial sphere whose behaviour exactly produces various IR dynamics of recent resurged interests for 4d (selfdual) Einstein gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes. We demonstrate how to use simple 2d CFT computations to reproduce 4d BMS algebra and $w_{1+\infty}$ algebra, deduce the form of both chiral and anti-chiral stress tensors and recover the necessity for dressing hard particles asymptotically with soft modes. We further discuss how possible extensions of this 2d theory incorporates further dynamical information of 4d Einstein gravity.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we analyze the effects of stochastic magnetic fluctuations with respect to an intense magnetic field background over the yields for photon and dilepton emission processes in a thermalized quark-gluon plasma phase. Such stochastic fluctuations model the effects of nearly random initial conditions for the nuclei participating in non-central heavy-ion collisions, which are the sources of the background magnetic field. Our theoretical results predict significant anisotropic effects due to stochastic magnetic noise over the angular distribution for photon and dilepton production rates in this scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Poisson electrodynamics is the semi-classical limit of $U(1)$ non-commutative gauge theory. It has been studied so far as a theoretical model, where an external field would be the source of the non-commutativity effects in space-time. Being the Standard Model of fundamental interactions a local theory, the prediction of observables within it would be drastically altered by such affects. The natural question that arises is: how do particles interact with this field? In this work, we will answer this question using a point-like charged particle interacting with the Poisson gauge field, investigating how their trajectories are affected using the $\kappa$-Minkowski structure. The interaction arises from the construction of a gauge-invariant action. Using the field solutions, we find the second-order equation for the deformed Lorentz force, indicating possible effects of an emergent gravity due to non-commutativity.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</description>

Abstract: It is often assumed that the maximum number of independent states a black hole may contain is $N_{BH}=e^{S_{BH}}$, where $S_{BH}=A/4$ is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and $A$ the horizon area in Planck units. I present a simple and straightforward argument showing that the number of states that can be distinguished by local observers inside the hole must be greater than this number.</description>

      <title>Limits on Clustering and Smooth Quintessence from the EFTofLSS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.07554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) to analyze cosmological models with clustering quintessence, which allows us to consistently describe the parameter region in which the quintessence equation of state $w &lt; - 1$. First, we extend the description of biased tracers in redshift space to the presence of clustering quintessence, and compute the one-loop power spectrum. We solve the EFTofLSS equations using the exact time dependence, which is relevant to obtain unbiased constraints. Then, fitting the full shape of BOSS pre-reconstructed power spectrum measurements, the BOSS post-reconstruction BAO measurements, BAO measurements from 6DF/MGS and eBOSS, the Supernovae from Pantheon, and a prior from BBN, we bound the clustering quintessence equation of state parameter $w=-1.011_{-0.048}^{+0.053}$ at $68\%$ C.L.. Further combining with Planck, we obtain $w=-1.028_{-0.030}^{+0.037}$ at $68\%$ C.L.. We also obtain constraints on smooth quintessence, in the physical regime $w \geq -1$: combining all datasets, we get $-1\leq w &lt; - 0.979$ at $68\%$ C.L.. These results strongly support a cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: When a system consists of a large subsystem (bath) and a small one (probe), thermalization implies induction of temperature of the bath onto the probe. If both the bath and the probe are described by same microscopic Hamiltonian, thermalization further entails that the probe imbibes the phase of the bath. We refer to this phenomenon as {\it phase thermalization}. However, it is not clear whether this phenomenon is realizable when the probe and the bath are described by different microscopic Hamiltonians. We show {\it phase thermalization} is possible even when the microscopic Hamiltonians differ significantly. We provide an explicit example, where the probe is a Fermi liquid realized by a Majorana chain with $n \gg 1$ fermions per site interacting through random hopping and the bath is an incoherent metal described by another Majorana chain with $N &gt; n$ fermions per site interacting through arbitrarily long range random four-fermion interaction. In deep infrared (\emph{i.e.} at very low energies), the probe turns into an incoherent metal, with Lyapunov spectrum and diffusion coefficient identical to the bath.</description>

      <title>A Representation Transformation of Parametric Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A transformation on homogeneous polynomials is proposed, which is further applied to parametric Feynman integrals. The two representations related through this transformation are dual to each other. And it naturally leads to dualities of Landau equations and linear integral relations between the two representations. For integrals with momentum-space correspondences, the dual representation is equivalent to the Baikov representation.</description>

      <title>1-loop equals torsion for fibered 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In earlier work of two of the authors, two 1-loop polynomial invariants of cusped 3-manifolds were constructed using combinatorial data of ideal triangulations, and conjectured to be equal to the $\mathbb{C}^2$ and the $\mathbb{C}^3$-torsion polynomials. Here, we prove this conjecture for layered triangulations of fibered 3-manifolds with toroidal boundary, and we illustrate our theorems with exact computations of the 1-loop and the torsion polynomials. As further evidence for the conjecture, we confirm it for more than 6,600 nonfibered manifolds, and use this data to explore the extent to which the $\mathbb{C}^2$-torsion determines the Thurston norm.</description>

      <title>Typical entanglement entropy in systems with particle-number conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the typical bipartite entanglement entropy $\langle S_A\rangle_N$ in systems containing indistinguishable particles of any kind as a function of the total particle number $N$, the volume $V$, and the subsystem fraction $f=V_A/V$, where $V_A$ is the volume of the subsystem. We expand our result as a power series $\langle S_A\rangle_N=a f V+b\sqrt{V}+c+o(1)$, and find that $c$ is universal (i.e., independent of the system type), while $a$ and $b$ can be obtained from a generating function characterizing the local Hilbert space dimension. We illustrate the generality of our findings by studying a wide range of different systems, e.g., bosons, fermions, spins, and mixtures thereof. We provide evidence that our analytical results describe the entanglement entropy of highly excited eigenstates of quantum-chaotic spin and boson systems, which is distinct from that of integrable counterparts.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of classical fields by gravitational shockwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational shockwaves are geometries where components of the transverse curvature have abrupt behaviour across null hypersurfaces, which are fronts of the waves. We develop a general approach to describe classical field theories on such geometries in a linearized approximation, by using free scalar fields as a model. Perturbations caused by shockwaves exist above the wave front and are solutions to a characteristic Cauchy problem with initial data on the wave front determined by a supertranslation of ingoing fields. A special attention is paid to perturbations of fields of pointlike sources generated by plane-fronted gravitational shockwaves. One has three effects: conversion of non-stationary perturbations into an outgoing radiation, a spherical scalar shockwave which appears when the gravitational wave hits the source, and a plane scalar shockwave accompanying the initial gravitational wave. Our analysis is applicable to gravitational shockwaves of a general class including geometries sourced by null particles and null branes.</description>

      <title>Gravity from entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14391v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravity is derived from an entropic action coupling matter fields with geometry. The fundamental idea is to relate the metric of Lorentzian spacetime {to a quantum operator, playing the role of an renormalizable effective density matrix and to describe the matter fields topologically, according to a Dirac-K\"ahler formalism, as the direct sum of a zero-form, a one-form and a two-form. While the geometry of spacetime is defined by its metric, the matter fields can be used to define an alternative metric, the metric induced by the matter fields, which geometrically describes the interplay between spacetime and matter. The proposed entropic action is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the matter fields. The modified Einstein equations obtained from this action reduce to the Einstein equations with zero cosmological constant in the regime of low coupling. By introducing the {\em G-field}, which acts as a set of Lagrangian multipliers, the proposed entropic action reduces to a dressed Einstein-Hilbert action with an emergent small and positive cosmological constant only dependent on the G-field. The obtained equations of modified gravity remain second order in the metric and in the G-field. A canonical quantization of this field theory could bring new insights into quantum gravity while further research might clarify the role that the G-field could have for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from thermal heavy scalar dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a gauge singlet scalar with mass around 1-100 TeV as a thermal heavy dark matter candidate along with a dilaton as a Higgs portal mediator in a dimensionless scalar extension of the Standard Model. We demonstrate analytically that such a model gives rise to very strong first-order electroweak phase transition through supercooling. We calculate the corresponding gravitational wave signals due to bubble collisions during the phase transition. The produced gravitational waves can be detected by future space-based gravitational wave detectors in the frequency range from 10^{-4} Hz to 0.1 Hz.</description>

      <title>Loop quantum effects on direct detection prediction in two-scalar dark matter scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of quantum corrections on the elastic scattering cross section of dark matter off nucleus in two-scalar dark matter model. Among two extra singlet scalars in the two-scalar model, the lighter one is stable and plays the role of dark matter candidate and the heavier one contributes in dark matter co-annihilation processes in thermal history of the early universe. It is already known that the two-scalar model at tree level, unlike the single-scalar dark matter model, can easily evade the bounds from direct detection (DD) experiments. The claim here is that taking into account the loop effects, in some regions of the parameter space, the DM-nucleon cross section becomes larger than the tree level contribution. Therefore, loop effects move the regions which were below the neutrino floor at tree level, up to the regions which are detectable by future DD experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the limit of vanishing up, down and strange quark masses, QCD exhibits a chiral symmetry. This symmetry is broken spontaneously to its vector subgroup, giving rise to Goldstone bosons. These acquire a small mass through the explicit chiral symmetry breaking for non-vanishing quark masses. The consequences of these broken symmetries can be investigated in a suitably tailored effective field theory called chiral pertubation theory. It admits a perturbative expansion in the external momenta and the Goldstone boson masses and can be systematically analyzed in terms of a loop expansion. The appearing ultraviolet divergences in loop diagrams can be dealt with order-by-order through the Goldstone boson contact interactions. Matter fields like the lowest-lying baryons can also included, leading to a rich and testable phenomenology of low-energy QCD.</description>

      <title>Boundaries, frames and the issue of physical covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on three distinct lines of recent developments: edge modes and boundary charges in gravitational physics, relational dynamics in classical and quantum gravity, and quantum reference frames. We argue that these research directions are in fact linked in multiple ways, and can be seen as different aspects of the same research programme. This research programme has two main physical goals and one general focus, as well as broader conceptual implications. The physical goals are to move beyond the two idealizations/approximations of asymptotic or closed boundary conditions in gravitational physics and of ideal reference frames (coded in coordinate frames or gauge fixings), thus achieving a more realistic modelling of (quantum) gravitational physical phenomena. These two goals combine to identify a key open issue: a proper characterization of physical covariance, i.e. covariance across fully physical (as opposed to idealized) reference frames. The broader conceptual implications concern the influence of observers in physics and possible physical limits to objectivity.</description>

      <title>Chaotic motion of the charged test particle in Kerr-MOG black hole with explicit symplectic algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Kerr-MOG black hole has attracted widespread research interest and has been widely used in fields such as galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing in galaxy clusters, and the formation of large-scale structures in the universe. In this paper, we mainly focus on dynamics of the charged particle around Kerr-MOG black hole. At first, the field equations for the charged particle under the Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG) theory are presented. Then, according to the characteristics of the Hamiltonian system, the Hamiltonian can be decomposed into five integrable parts, and three kinds of explicit symplectic algorithms are constructed. Numerical experiments show that the algorithm ($PR{K_6}4$) is the optimal one. At last, the Poincar\'e section and the fast Lyapunov indicator (FLI) are used to explore dynamic evolution of the particle. From the numerical results, it is easy to find that the energy $E$, the angular momentum $L$, the magnetic field parameter $\beta$, the black hole spin parameter $a$, and the gravitational field strength parameter $\alpha$ have an impact on the motion of the particle. In particular, the chaotic region increases as $E$, $\beta$, or $\alpha$ increases, but decreases with the increases of $a$ or $L$. Moreover, when any two of the five parameters are applied simultaneously, it is easy to observe that $a$ and $L$ play a dominant role.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect in the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.</description>
