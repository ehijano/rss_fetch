      <title>Topological and optical signatures of modified black-hole entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how deviations from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy modify black-hole spacetimes through the recently proposed entropy-geometry correspondence. For four representative modified entropies, namely Barrow, R\'enyi, Kaniadakis, and logarithmic, we derive the corresponding effective metrics and analyze their thermodynamic and topological classification using the off-shell free energy and winding numbers. We show that Barrow and R\'enyi entropies yield a single unstable sector with global charge $W=-1$, while logarithmic and Kaniadakis corrections produce canceling defects with $W=0$, revealing topological structures absent in the Schwarzschild case. Using the modified metrics, we further calculate the photon-sphere radius and shadow size, showing that each modified entropy relation induces characteristic optical shifts. Thus, by comparing with Event Horizon Telescope observations of Sgr A$^\ast$, we extract new bounds on all entropy-deformation parameters. Our results demonstrate that thermodynamic topology, together with photon-sphere phenomenology, offers a viable way to test generalized entropy frameworks and probe departures from the Bekenstein-Hawking area law.</description>

      <title>A cyclic scale-invariance universe with negative variable cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AdS vacuum corresponds to a negative cosmological constant $\Lambda$. While it is well-motivated theoretically, There has always been controversy over its actual existence. The AdS-dS transition is corresponding to a sign switching $\Lambda$. We have proposed an ansatz for a negative time-varying cosmological constant $\Lambda(H)$ as a function of Hubble parameter $H$, and used it in constructing a periodic model with no future singularity in a scale-invariance gravity. With the proposed Ansatz for negative $\Lambda$, The model leads to a physically acceptable cosmic description, while we get unphysical parameters with the positive and zero values of $\Lambda$. The model reveals a Quintom behavior with a sign flipping of cosmic pressure during each period. The non-conventional mechanism of negative $\Lambda$ that are expected to address the late-time acceleration has been revisited.</description>

      <title>On non-equatorial embeddings into $\mathbb{R}^3$ of spherically symmetric wormholes with topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, the embedding procedure for spherically symmetric spacetimes has been restricted to the equatorial plane $\theta = \pi/2$. This conventional approach, however, encounters a fundamental limitation: not every spherically symmetric geometry admits an isometric embedding of its equatorial slice into three-dimensional Euclidean space. When such embeddings are not possible, the standard geometric intuition becomes inapplicable. In this work, we generalize the embedding procedure to slices with arbitrary polar angles $\theta \neq \pi/2$, thereby extending the visualization and analysis of spacetimes beyond the reach of traditional methods.
  The formalism is applied to Schwarzschild-like wormholes and to a generalized Minkowski spacetime with angular deficit or excess, which are particularly relevant since their equatorial slices cannot be consistently embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$. In these cases, we identify the explicit constraints on the radial coordinate, polar angle, and geometric parameters required to guarantee consistent embeddings into three-dimensional Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Graviton Condensate Stars and Its Gravitational Echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the exact stellar configurations that contain an ordinary perfect-fluid matter that interacts minimally with a condensate of gravitons with distinct pressure conditions on the surface. We propose vanishing transverse pressure on the surface for, namely graviton condensate type 1 and vanishing radial pressure on the surface for type 2. The condition for the radial pressure of type 1 requires the existence of a thin shell that will balance the pressure discontinuity while for type 2, the discontinuity on transverse pressure does not require the additional thin shell. It is found that the Buchdahl inequality of the resulting stellar configurations depends on the parameter related to the graviton condensate, such that we can find the ultra-compact regime of the stellar models. Moreover, the echo time and echo frequency within the ultra-compact regime are computed. At the same compactness, it is found that the presence of the graviton condensate will delay the gravitational echoes for type 2 and will expedite the gravitational echoes for type 1 compared to constant density star, $\tau_{echo2}&gt;\tau_{CDS}&gt;\tau_{echo1}$. Furthermore, the gravitational perturbation of a massless scalar wave is also investigated to support these results. These results could open more opportunities for the observational study of graviton in the near future, mostly from the compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>First-order general constitutive equations for relativistic fluids using the projection method in the Chapman-Enskog expansion of the Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first-order out of equilibrium correction to the distribution function, obtained by implementing the projection method for the perturbed relativistic Boltzmann equation using the Chapman-Enskog method, is generalized in order to explicitly include the freedom of choice for thermodynamic frame and representation. It is shown how this procedure leads to general constitutive equations that couple the thermodynamic fluxes to all forces including a weak external electromagnetic field. Special cases of the resulting force-flux relations have been shown to lead to physically sound theories for relativistic fluids.</description>

      <title>Chiral gravitational waves from domain walls in Nieh-Yan gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scattering of gravitational waves by axion domain walls in teleparallel gravity with the Nieh-Yan term. Since a domain wall causes the parity violation, the transmitted gravitational waves also exhibit the parity violation. We calculate the degree of circular polarization of gravitational waves. It turns out that gravitational waves after going through the domain wall could be chiral. Remarkably, the degree of circular polarization does not depend on the tension of the domain wall.</description>

      <title>Spherically symmetric solutions in quasi-local Einstein-Weyl gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-gravitational effective actions with higher-derivative and non-local operators are expected to regularize the singularities of general relativity. Here we focus on quasi-local Einstein-Weyl gravity and obtain a classification of Frobenius solutions in static spherical symmetry. In contrast to local Einstein-Weyl gravity, and more generally quadratic gravity, we find that the quasi-local theory admits only regular solutions at the radial core. In addition, we find asymptotic $1/r^{6}$-corrections to the Schwarzschild geometry at large radial distances. Other solution classes around generic expansion points describe Schwarzschild-like and other types of horizons, as well as symmetric and non-symmetric wormhole throats.</description>

      <title>Inspiral-Transition-Plunge Gravitational Waveforms Beyond Kerr: A Kerr-Newman Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary black hole mergers with asymmetric component masses are key targets for both third-generation ground-based and future space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, offering unique access to the strong-field dynamics of gravity. The evolution is commonly divided into three stages: the adiabatic inspiral, the transition, and the plunge. To date, constructions of inspiral-transition-plunge waveforms have largely focused on Schwarzschild or Kerr background spacetimes. In this paper, we extend these efforts to spacetimes beyond Kerr by constructing such waveforms in a Kerr-Newman background. For simplicity, we allow the primary black hole to carry spin and charge while keeping the secondary object neutral and non-spinning. We work in the small charge-to-mass ratio regime and adopt the Dudley-Finley approximation, in which the gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations decouple. In particular, the gravitational sector satisfies a Teukolsky-like equation, enabling only minimal modifications relative to the Kerr case when constructing the waveform. Having the inspiral-transtion-plunge waveforms in hand, we studied observational prospects for constraining the charge of the central black hole. We find that, for intermediate-mass-ratio mergers observed with the Einstein Telescope, explicitly modeling the post-inspiral dynamics significantly tightens charge-to-mass ratio constraints. In particular, the bounds on the charge-to-mass ratio can reach $O(10^{-3})$ in the region of primary masses and spins where the post-inspiral signal dominates, yielding charge bounds that can be orders of magnitude tighter than those obtained from the inspiral alone or from the current bound with GW150914. These results lay the groundwork for inspiral-transition-plunge waveform modeling in beyond-Kerr spacetimes and for probing non-Kerr signatures in future GW observations.</description>

      <title>Acoustic horizons and the Hawking effect in polariton fluids of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes develop polariton fluids of light as programmable simulators of quantum fields on tailored curved spacetimes, with emphasis on acoustic horizons and the Hawking effect. After introducing exciton-polariton physics in semiconductor microcavities, we detail the theoretical tools to study the mean field and the quantum hydrodynamics of this driven-dissipative quantum system. We derive the mapping to relativistic field theories and cast horizon physics as a pseudounitary stationary scattering problem. We present the Gaussian optics circuit that describes observables and fixes detection weights for the horizon modes in near- and far-field measurements. We provide a practical experimental toolkit (phase-imprinted flows, coherent pump-probe spectroscopy, balanced and homodyne detection) and a step-by-step workflow to extract amplification, quadrature squeezing, and entanglement among correlations. Finally, we discuss the potential of this platform to investigate open questions in quantum field theory in curved spacetime, such as near horizon effects and quasinormal modes, as well as other phenomena universal to rotating geometries, from rotational superradiance to dynamical instabilities. We further outline the interplay between rotational superradiance and the Hawking effect, proposing to spatially resolve measurements as a roadmap for `dumb hole spectroscopy' and the study of entanglement dynamics in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Analogue gravity with Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogue gravity explores how collective excitations in condensed matter systems can reproduce the behavior of fields in curved spacetimes. An important example is the acoustic black holes that can occur for sound in a moving fluid. In these lecture notes, we focus on atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), quantum fluids that provide an interesting platform for analogue gravity studies thanks to their accurate theoretical description, remarkable experimental control, and ultralow temperatures that allow the quantum nature of sound to emerge. We give a pedagogical introduction to analogue black holes and the theoretical description of BECs and their elementary excitations, which behave as quantum fields in curved spacetimes. We then apply these tools to survey the current understanding of black-hole superradiance and analogue Hawking radiation, including explicit examples and numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Thermodynamic properties of Schwarzschild black hole in non-commutative gauge theory of gravity"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent study [Annals Phys. 455 (2023) 169394, e-Print: 2204.01901 [gr-qc]] examined the thermodynamic behavior of an axially symmetric black hole within a non-commutative framework that mimics the effect of an angular momentum. However, the analysis presents notable computational inconsistencies. In that analysis, the event horizon was miscalculated, and this error propagated through and compromised all subsequent results. In addition, an incorrect definition of surface gravity was used -- the spherically symmetric case was invoked for an axially symmetric spacetime -- rendering the thermodynamic results invalid. In other words, all the results presented in the paper require a thorough reexamination.</description>

      <title>Covariance, relativity, and the proper mass of the universe in the no-boundary wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A discrete class of privileged reference frames in a closed universe with identical equations of motion for physical degrees of freedom was found. A representation of the quantum state of the universe in a privileged reference frame was obtained as a Euclidean functional integral with no-boundary conditions. The boundary condition at the Pole, in addition to the smoothness conditions, is the infinite asymptotic behavior of the Hubble parameter. This makes it possible to regularize the functional integral by changing the sign of the expansion energy of the universe. The proposed construction also allows for the addition of a non-zero proper mass of the universe.</description>

      <title>Probing Hairy Kerr Black Holes through Quasi-Periodic Oscillations I: A study based on the kinematic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole (BH) solutions endowed with nontrivial scalar or matter fields - commonly known as hairy black holes - have attracted significant interest in recent years. They admit extra parameters beyond mass, charge, and angular momentum, leading to a richer phenomenology. Characterizing their allowed parameter space is therefore crucial, especially in light of the available data from electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations. The rotating hairy black hole solutions studied here are inspired by the gravitational decoupling method and satisfy the Einstein field equations with a conserved energy-momentum tensor that respects the strong energy conditions (SECs). We explore in detail the horizon structure of such black holes and report for the first time certain unique features, not observed in Kerr BHs. We investigate the sensitivity of the hairy parameters on the fundamental frequencies associated with the motion of matter in the hairy Kerr spacetime, and compare them with the Kerr scenario. The theoretical models aimed to explain the observed high-frequency observations (HFQPOs) in BHs are associated with the fundamental frequencies. Hence, such a study enables us to constrain the parameter space of the hairy Kerr spacetime by comparing the model-dependent HFQPO frequencies with the available observations. By comparing the kinematic models of HFQPOs with the observations of six BH sources, we report the most favored parameter space for each of these BHs. Our analysis also provides a framework to discern the most suitable model for each of these sources. Interestingly, even with the present precision of the data, the Relativistic Precession Model seems to be less suitable compared to the Tidal Disruption Model for the sources GRO J1655-40 and XTE J1859+226. The implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Pfaffian Systems, Cartan Connections, and the Null Surface Formulation of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review examines the role of differential forms, Pfaffian systems, and hypersurfaces in general relativity. These mathematical constructions provide the essential tools for general relativity, in which the curvature of spacetime;described by the Einstein field equations;is most elegantly formulated using the Cartan calculus of differential forms. Another important subject in this discussion is the notion of conformal geometry, where the relevant invariants of a metric are characterized by Elie Cartan's normal conformal connection. The previous analysis is then used to develop the null surface formulation (NSF) of general relativity, a radical framework that postulates the structure of light cones rather than the metric itself as the fundamental gravitational variable. Defined by a central Pfaffian system, this formulation allows the entire spacetime geometry to be reconstructed from a single scalar function, $Z$, whose level surfaces are null.</description>

      <title>Causal character of imaginary Killing spinors and spinorial slicings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize spin initial data sets that saturate the BPS bound in the asymptotically AdS setting. This includes both gravitational waves and rotating black holes in higher dimensions, and we establish a sharp dimension threshold in each case. A key ingredient in our argument is a theorem providing a general criterion for when an imaginary Killing spinor of mixed causal type can be replaced by one that is strictly timelike or null. Moreover, in analogy with the minimal surface method, we demonstrate that spinors can be used to construct a codimension-$2$ slicing.</description>

Abstract: A set of 3+1 equations for stochastic inflation incorporating all metric and scalar matter degrees of freedom, first presented in previous work, are re-derived in a gauge invariant manner. We then present numerical implementations of these stochastic equations, cast in the BSSN formulation of Numerical Relativity, demonstrating their efficacy in both a slow-roll and an ultra slow-roll scenario. We find the evolution is correctly reproduced for all the dynamical variables, and the energy and momentum constraints are well-satisfied. This demonstrates that the stochastic equations are theoretically and numerically robust and ready to be applied to a wider inflationary landscape. Our simulations result in real space realizations of the fully non-linear stochastic dynamics with gradient information retained. As a generalisation of standard stochastic inflation, inflationary numerical relativity and lattice cosmology, this work opens up the possibility for reliable predictions of non-perturbative phenomena and provides precise initial conditions for subsequent cosmological eras.</description>

      <title>Search for Gravitational Wave Memory in PPTA and EPTA Data: A Complete Signal Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform searches for gravitational wave memory in the data of two major Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments located in Europe and Australia. Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are the primary sources of gravitational waves in PTA experiments. We develop and carry out the first search for late inspirals and mergers of these sources based on full numerical relativity waveforms with null (nonlinear) gravitational wave memory. Additionally, we search for generic bursts of null gravitational wave memory, exploring possibilities of reducing the computational cost of these searches through kernel density and normalizing flow approximation of the posteriors. We rule out the mergers of SMBHBs with a chirp mass of 10^10 Solar Mass up to 700 Mpc over 18 years of observation at 95% credibility. We rule out the observation of generic displacement memory bursts with strain amplitudes &gt; 10^-14 in brief periods of the observation time but across the sky, or over the whole observation time but for certain preferred sky positions, at 95%$credibility.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Relativistic Tidal Response of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear tidal response of relativistic neutron stars by computing the fully relativistic, static, quadratic Love numbers. Using both the worldline effective field theory for extended gravitating bodies and second-order perturbations of relativistic stellar models, we derive the nonlinear tidal deformation induced by an external gravito-electric tidal field to quadratic order. Through a suitable matching procedure, we provide for the first time the leading nonlinear tidal corrections to the conservative dynamics and gravitational-wave signal of binary systems. Quadratic Love numbers are enhanced more than the linear ones in the small-compactness limit. Because of this, despite entering the gravitational-wave phase at 8th post-Newtonian (PN) order, the leading quadratic Love number can be as important as the next-to-next-to-leading order linear tidal correction, which enters at 7th PN order, and is larger than the subleading point-particle contribution entering at 4th PN order. In particular, quadratic Love numbers can be as large as ~10% of the linear Love numbers in the late inspiral phase. Our approach provides a framework to also compute the (subleading) nonlinear effects induced by magnetic tidal fields and higher multipole moments, and sets the foundations for incorporating nonlinear tidal effects in high-precision gravitational-wave modeling.</description>

      <title>Quasitopological gravity and double-copy formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to the quasitopological theory of gravity based on a modified classical double--copy construction. Focusing on static, spherically symmetric configurations, we show that all vacuum solutions of $D$--dimensional quasitopological gravity can be obtained from an auxiliary non--linear electrodynamics defined in a flat $(D+1)$--dimensional spacetime. The gravitational field equations reduce to an algebraic relation between a primary curvature invariant and the electric field strength, while the remaining dynamics is governed by a Gauss--law constraint for a point--like charge in the auxiliary space. This correspondence provides a transparent interpretation of higher--curvature gravitational interactions in terms of non--linear gauge dynamics and explains the absence of higher--derivative terms in the reduced equations. As illustrative examples, we apply the formalism to Born--Infeld and Hayward--type models, obtaining higher--dimensional regular black--hole solutions with a de~Sitter--like core. Our results extend the scope of the double--copy paradigm beyond Einstein gravity and suggest a unifying framework for a broad class of higher--curvature theories.</description>

      <title>Computing spectral shifts for Johannsen-Psaltis Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing number of gravitational wave (GW) detections and the increasing sensitivity of GW detectors have enabled precision tests of General Relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime. The recent observation of multiple quasinormal modes (QNMs) in GW250114 marks a major advance for observational black hole spectroscopy. This clear signal, together with the growing number of GW detections, highlights the need for accurate predictions of QNM spectra in beyond-GR theories in order to carry out precision searches for new physics. In this work, we continue to lay the foundation for such predictions using a modified Teukolsky formalism in conjunction with the eigenvalue perturbation method. We compute the spectral shifts of slowly rotating Johannsen-Psaltis black holes for $2 \leq \ell \leq 10$, all $m$, and overtones $n = 0, 1, 2$, and confirm the large-$\ell$ behavior of the modes by comparing with the WKB approximation. We find that these black holes admit definite-parity modes but break the isospectrality between even- and odd-parity QNMs at all spins, and that the shifts depend linearly on $m$ for slow spins. We further derive a general parity condition that any beyond-GR modification to the metric must satisfy to support definite-parity modes, providing new insights into isospectrality breaking and parity structure in gravitational perturbations.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Constraints on Scalar-Tensor Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we derive novel constraints on scalar-tensor theories from neutrino physics. Spatial variations of the background scalar field effectively generate density and position-dependent Standard Model masses, including neutrinos. Neutrinos are a unicum in the SM due to their ability both to propagate over galactic distances and to traverse dense media such as Earth. This makes them an ideal probe of the background scalar field, which can in turn alter flavour oscillations and supernova time delays. As we enter the era of precision neutrino physics, we are compelled to explore such a scenario. We derive expressions for the relevant observables and obtain new bounds on a broad class of scalar-tensor models. We finally map the bounds to popular screening mechanisms models, such as the Symmetron and Chameleon.</description>

      <title>Stellar Superradiance and Low-Energy Absorption in Dense Nuclear Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons such as axions and dark photons are well-motivated hypothetical particles, whose couplings to ordinary matter can be effectively constrained by stellar cooling. Limits on these interactions can be obtained by demanding that their emission from the stellar interior does not lead to excessive energy loss. An intriguing question is whether the same microphysical couplings can also be probed through neutron star superradiance, in which gravitationally bound bosonic modes grow exponentially by extracting rotational energy from the star. Although both processes originate from boson-matter interactions, they probe very different kinematic regimes. Stellar cooling probes boson emission at thermal wavelengths, while superradiance is governed by modes whose wavelength is comparable to or greater than the size of the star. Previous work has attempted to relate the microphysical neutron-nucleon scattering and inverse-bremsstrahlung absorption rates directly to the macroscopic growth rate of superradiant bound states. In this work, we re-examine this connection and show that a naive extrapolation of the microphysical absorption rate to the superradiant regime would imply superradiant rates comparable to astrophysical timescales characterised by pulsar spindown. These naive rates are especially high for vector fields. However, we demonstrate that this conclusion changes once collective multiple-scattering effects in dense nuclear matter are taken into account. Repeated nucleon collisions modify the effective low-energy absorption experienced by the bosonic bound state, strongly suppressing the rate relevant for superradiance.</description>

      <title>Black Holes and Abelian Instantons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the electromagnetic $\theta$-term is a physical parameter of the Standard Model coupled to gravity. Specifically, in the context of 4-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory we show that there exist Euclidean field configurations that have finite action, are asymptotically flat, and feature non-zero electromagnetic second Chern number. These ``gravitational Abelian instantons" correspond to a dyonic extension of a Euclidean wormhole. We argue that these configurations should be included in the gravitational path integral, and that doing so generates a non-perturbative contribution to the vacuum energy density that is $\theta$-dependent. We provide a Lorentzian interpretation of these instantons as capturing the effect of quantum fluctuations corresponding to pair production and annihilation of charged black holes. When $\theta$ is the expectation value of a dynamical axion field, the instantons presented here generate a potential for the axion, thereby breaking the axion shift symmetry. This provides yet another example of how quantum gravity violates global symmetries through the existence of black holes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walks and Exact RG in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local physics of light scalar fields in de Sitter space is well described by classical random walks, as expressed through the framework of Stochastic Inflation. Recent work has clarified how this formalism arises from quantum field theory (QFT) and the renormalization group (RG), allowing for corrections to this formalism to be determined order by order. Yet, this description is incomplete. For example, the quantum dynamics of these fields are expected to become important when determining the tail of the probability distribution for the fluctuations. In this paper, we develop the understanding of fields in de Sitter as a quantum walk in order to bridge the gap between the classical and quantum description. We use the framework of exact RG to calculate the evolution equation for the reduced density matrix of the long wavelength fields. This master equation provides the direct map from light fields to models of quantum walks. We show how to reduce the master equation to Stochastic Inflation, and provide a new understanding of how the higher-order corrections arise. In the process, we demonstrate that divergences and secular growth in de Sitter, for both light and heavy fields, can be absorbed by (dynamical) renormalization.</description>

      <title>Glueballs Confinement and Cosmological Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework in which the dynamics of a scalar glueball field, originating from phenomenological nonperturbative QCD confinement, simultaneously governs the deconfinement transition of strongly interacting matter and drives cosmological inflation. Starting from a temperature-dependent effective potential $V_{eff}(\phi, T)$, we show that the glueball mass vanishes at a critical temperature $T_{c\phi}$, signaling a first-order phase transition characterized by supercooling and a transient metastable vacuum. In the high-temperature regime $T &gt; T_{c\phi}$, the deconfined phase naturally produces an exponential expansion of the scale factor, providing the correct conditions for inflation. By computing the slow-roll parameters and the resulting spectral index $n_s$, tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_s$, and running $\alpha_s$, we confront the model with the Planck observations. The predicted values of $n_s$ and $r_s$ fall within the Planck confidence contours for a broad and physically motivated range of the parameter $\gamma$ and for $N \approx 50\text{--}60$ e-folds. A distinctive linear relation, $r_s = 4(1-n_s)-72\gamma$, emerges as a testable signature of the model. Normalization to the observed scalar amplitude further constrains the thermal correction parameter $\sigma^2$ and the coupling $\gamma$, linking cosmological data directly to QCD-scale dynamics. These results demonstrate that a confinement-inspired potential can naturally reproduce the observed inflationary phenomenology and offer a novel bridge between early-universe cosmology and the nonperturbative sector of QCD.</description>

      <title>Scaling solutions for gauge invariant flow equations in dilaton quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of quantum gravity for models of a scalar singlet coupled to the metric. Such models describe inflation for early cosmology and dynamical dark energy for late cosmology. We work within the ''variable gravity approximation" keeping in the effective action an arbitrary field dependence for terms with up to two derivatives. We focus on the scaling solutions of the gauge invariant functional flow equation which describes the dependence of the effective action on a momentum or length scale. The existence of such solutions is required for the ultraviolet fixed point defining an ultraviolet complete renormalizable quantum field theory for gravity. Our findings strengthen the case for the presence of a ''dilaton quantum gravity fixed point" for which the Planck mass increases proportional to the scalar field for large field values. This fixed point is different from the extended Reuter fixed point with a flat scalar potential and field-independent Planck mass, which is also seen in our setting.</description>

      <title>General Effective Theories of Black Holes in the Large D Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the general form of the effective equations governing black hole dynamics in the limit of a large number of dimensions $D$. These split into a universal \emph{soap-bubble} embedding condition for stationary configurations and a set of nonlinear dynamical evolution equations describing near-horizon fluctuations of $O(1/D)$ amplitude over horizon scales of $O(1/\sqrt{D})$. We obtain these equations in full generality, including arbitrary asymptotic sources in the near-horizon region, and we show that they form a parabolic system with a well-posed initial value problem. To connect the various approaches to large-$D$ black hole dynamics, we also show that both the embedding and dynamical equations can be derived from the covariant membrane formalism. We clarify the intrinsic scope of the large-$D$ approach, emphasizing that it yields a well-posed dynamical evolution only on horizon scales of $O(1/\sqrt{D})$, which is the range where the most relevant horizon dynamics occur. Our results highlight the versatility of these effective theories for studying a wide class of black hole phenomena.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Lockdown: When Decoherence Saves the Universe from Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how quantum decoherence influences the tunneling dynamics of quantum fields in cosmological spacetimes. Specifically, we study a scalar field in an asymmetric double well potential during inflation, coupled to environmental degrees of freedom provided either by heavy spectator fields or by short-wavelength modes as they cross out the Hubble scale. This setup enables a systematic derivation of both Markovian and non-Markovian master equations, along with their stochastic unravelings, which we solve numerically. We find that, while decoherence is essential for suppressing quantum interference between vacua, its impact on the relative vacuum populations is limited. Fields heavier than the Hubble scale relax adiabatically toward the true vacuum with high probability, while lighter fields exhibit non-adiabatic enhancements of false-vacuum occupation. Once the system has decohered, quantum tunneling between vacua becomes strongly suppressed, effectively locking the system into the stochastically selected local minimum. This ``cosmic lockdown'' mechanism is a manifestation of the quantum Zeno effect: environmental monitoring stabilizes enhanced false-vacuum occupation for light fields by preventing them from tunneling.</description>

Abstract: In this review, we summarize the main ideas of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory, which is a rigorous framework combining some of the Haag-Kastler axioms with perturbative methods involving formal power series. It allows for the construction of interacting QFT models in four spacetime dimensions and works on arbitrary globally hyperbolic manifolds. This approach has also led to the development of a non-perturbative construction of local nets of C*-algebras for interacting theories, which will also be discussed at the end of this review.</description>

      <title>Gravitational charges and radiation in asymptotically locally de Sitter spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive discussion of gravitational charges and radiation in four-dimensional asymptotically locally de Sitter (AldS) spacetimes. Such spacetimes have compact spatial sections and possess spacelike past and future infinities, $\mathscr{I}^\pm$. We show that the variational problem is well-posed if one specifies a conformal class up to three-dimensional diffeomorpshims at $\mathscr{I}^\pm$, provided one adds at $\mathscr{I}^\pm$ suitable local terms. These are analogues of the AdS covariant counterterms of holographic renormalisation. Radiation is possible only when the conformal class at infinity is non-trivial. Bulk diffeomorphisms that asymptote to conformal Killing vectors at $\mathscr{I}^\pm$ lead to gravitational charges that are conserved under radial translations, while transformations that asymptote to a general three-dimensional vector imply that the gravitational charges satisfy flux-balance laws. We also present quantities that are invariant under temporal translations, if gravitational flux is absent, but otherwise satisfy flux-balance laws. We derive these results using first principles application of Noether's method as well as covariant phase space methods. We apply our formalism to several exact solutions, including the Robinson-Trautman-dS class, which we use to demonstrate the existence of conserved charges even in the absence of asymptotic conformal Killing vectors and the existence of monotonic charges, including the Bondi mass.</description>

      <title>Invisible gravitons and large-scale magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large-scale limits on the relic signals of gravitational radiation complement the bounds coming from the interferometric detectors (in the audio band) and from the pulsar timing arrays (in the nHz range). Within this inclusive perspective the spectral energy density of the gravitons is sharply suppressed in the aHz region even though the high frequency signal can be comparatively much larger both in the kHz and GHz domains. For there are no direct tests on the expansion rate prior to the formation of the light nuclei, a modified postinflationary timeline affects the total number of $e$-folds and additionally suppresses the tensor to scalar ratio by making the relic signals effectively invisible in the aHz range. The expansion rate prior to nucleosynthesis is further bounded by the evolution of the hypercharge field and the large-scale magnetism also constrains the decelerated expansion rate. The magnetogenesis requirements are compatible with a potentially detectable spectral energy density of the relic gravitons between the MHz and the THz while the tensor to scalar ratio remains suppressed in the aHz region. A maximum of the spectral energy density of the gravitons in the audio domain leads instead to a larger magnetic field when the scale of the gravitational collapse of the protogalaxy (of the order of the Mpc) gets comparable with the Hubble radius before equality. Along a converse viewpoint the results obtained here imply that a long decelerated stage expanding faster than radiation does not affect the high frequency range but reduces the effective number of $e$-folds by so enhancing the tensor to scalar ratio, possibly beyond its observational limit.</description>

      <title>Another 100 Years of Quantum Interpretation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretation is not the only way to explain a theory's success, form and features, and nor is it the only way to solve problems we see with a theory. This can also be done by giving a reductive explanation of the theory, by reference to a newer, more accurate, and/or more fundamental theory. We are seeking a theory of quantum gravity, a more fundamental theory than both quantum mechanics and general relativity, yet, while this theory is supposed to explain general relativity, it's not typically been thought to be necessary, or able, to explain quantum mechanics -- a task instead assigned to interpretation. Here, I question why this is. I also present a new way of assessing the various interpretations of quantum mechanics, in terms of their heuristic and unificatory potential in helping us find a more fundamental theory.</description>

      <title>Holography and the Swampland: Constraints on Quantum Gravity from Holographic Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Swampland Program aims to delineate the space of consistent low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) that admit a UV completion in quantum gravity from those that do not. In parallel, holography, and particularly the AdS/CFT correspondence, offers a non-perturbative definition of quantum gravity in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes. In this paper, we explore the Swampland Conjectures through the lens of holography, focusing on how holographic consistency conditions, such as the convexity of the conformal field theory (CFT) spectrum, the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), and the modular bootstrap, map onto Swampland constraints in the bulk. We argue that the holographic principle provides a geometric realization of Swampland bounds, particularly on scalar field potentials and the absence of long-lived de Sitter vacua. Finally, we discuss how the emergent bulk locality in AdS/CFT provides evidence that the Swampland conjectures may themselves be manifestations of deeper holographic consistency conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a geometric proof of the invariance of the relativistic spacetime interval based solely on the constancy of the speed of light, and the homogeneity and isotropy of spacetime. The derivation is based on a simple construction involving light rectangles, whose areas remain invariant across inertial frames. Based on this construction, we also derive the Lorentz transformations.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating sub-picometer non-reciprocity levels in the Three-Backlink Experiment for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current planned space-based gravitational-wave detectors require a bidirectional optical connection, referred to as Backlink, between two adjacent optical benches to provide a mutual phase reference for the local interferometric measurements. However, if the Backlink shows asymmetry between the two propagation directions, the effective optical pathlengths of the counter-propagating beams can introduce a differential phase noise, called non-reciprocity, into the main interferometric measurement that will limit the achievable accuracy in time-delay interferometry (TDI) post-processing. Hence, it is important to understand the properties of the Backlink to ensure that it will not compromise the interferometric detection. The Three-Backlink Experiment (3BL), which consists of an optical test facility with two rotatable benches, was designed under the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) framework to study the performance of three Backlink configurations: two fiber-based and one free-beam scheme. In this paper, we report recent experimental results from the 3BL. We describe the commissioning and the subsequent noise mitigation. We achieve a setup noise floor below $1\text{ pm}\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ across most of the LISA measurement band, and provide an understanding of the current technical limitations. With this low-noise baseline, we measured the performance of the three Backlink implementations under non-rotational conditions. We show that all three Backlinks reach sub-picometer non-reciprocity levels across most of the frequency band, with the remaining part dominated by the mentioned testbed noise. This enabled us to conduct a preliminary study of the Backlink inherent noise, where we emphasized on the backscatter noise intrinsic to a straightforward fiber-based Backlink, as this is the current baseline for LISA.</description>

      <title>A Compact Formula for Conserved Three-Point Tensor Structures in 4D CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a compact analytic formula for a complete basis of conformally invariant tensor structures for three-point functions of conserved operators in arbitrary 4D Lorentz representations. The construction follows directly from a novel constraint equivalent to applying conservation conditions at each point: the leading terms in all OPE limits appear as symmetric traceless tensors. We derive this by lifting to a unified $\mathrm{SU}(m,m|2n)$ analytic superspace framework, where the conservation conditions are automatically solved and then reducing back to 4D CFT. The same method is also used for cases involving one non-conserved operator. This formalism further reveals a map of the counting of CFT tensor structures to that of finite-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(2n)$ representations, solved by Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. All results can be directly re-interpreted as three-point $\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal tensor structures via the unified analytic superspace.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic gravitational wave background induced by arbitrary source fields that are amplified during cosmological inflation. The associated tensor spectral index is shown to be given, under minimal assumptions, by a simple formula easy to use in most situations of accelerated expansion. For slow-roll inflation, the induced spectrum is nearly scale-invariant, with an index that slightly deviates from the standard outcome of vacuum generated gravitational waves. Remarkably, we demonstrate that scale invariance remains true regardless of the original spectrum of the source.</description>

Abstract: The ultra-relativistic (Carrollian) regime of gravity has recently emerged as a fertile framework for exploring holography, non-Lorentzian symmetries, and geometric limit of General Relativity. In this letter, we establish the presence of a non-vanishing torsion within three-dimensional Carrollian gravity by constructing the Carrollian Mielke-Baekler (C-MB) gravity theory in its Chern-Simons formulation, obtained as the ultra-relativistic limit of the relativistic Mielke-Baekler model. The resulting C-MB theory features non-zero temporal torsion and curvature, together with spatial curvature, providing the most general three-dimensional Carrollian gravity model with these properties. Several known ultra-relativistic gravity theories arise as particular limits of this framework, highlighting its unifying character.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes as cosmic expansion accelerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel and natural mechanism for cosmic acceleration driven by primordial black holes (PBHs) exhibiting repulsive behavior. Using a new ``Swiss Cheese'' cosmological approach, we demonstrate that this cosmic acceleration mechanism is a general phenomenon by examining three regular black hole spacetimes - namely the Hayward, the Bardeen and the Dymnikova spacetimes - as well as the singular de Sitter-Schwarzschild spacetime. Interestingly, by matching these black hole spacetimes with an isotropic and homogeneous expanding Universe, we obtain a phase of cosmic acceleration that ends at an energy scale characteristic to the black hole parameters or due to black hole evaporation. This cosmic acceleration mechanism can be relevant either to an inflationary phase with a graceful exit and reheating or to an early dark energy type of contribution pertinent to the Hubble tension. Remarkably, we find that ultra-light PBHs with masses $m&lt;5\times 10^8\mathrm{g}$ dominating the energy content of the Univese before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can drive a successful inflationary expansion era without the use of an inflaton field. Additionally, PBHs with masses $m \sim 10^{12}\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $0.107 &lt; \Omega^\mathrm{eq}_\mathrm{PBH}&lt; 0.5$, slightly before matter-radiation equality, can produce a substantial amount of early dark energy, helping to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the great interest in studying quantum and gravitational phenomena in a unified way, scalar bosons are considered in a cosmic string spacetime and in a non-inertial frame, with a generalized Coulomb-type interaction containing both inverse quadratic and inverse cubic corrections. Solutions for this generalized interaction are shown for an arbitrary state in the slow rotation limit in a quasi-exact manner and a discussion is given of the structure of the problem, whose special case appears in the form of a doubly confluent Heun differential equation. The previously known solution for the simplest case of this problem, corresponding to the ordinary Coulomb interaction, is recovered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers is essential for extracting their rich physics. A key detail for understanding the physics of mergers is predicting the precise time when the amplitude of the gravitational wave strain peaks, which can differ significantly among the different harmonic modes. We propose two semi-analytical methods to predict these differences using the same three inputs from Numerical Relativity (NR): the remnant mass and spin and the instantaneous frequency of each mode at its peak amplitude. The first method uses the frequency evolution predicted by the Backwards-One-Body model, while the second models the motion of an equatorial timelike geodesic in the remnant black hole spacetime. We compare our models to the SXS waveform catalog for quasi-circular, non-precessing systems and find excellent agreement for $l = |m|$ modes up to $l=8$, with mean and median differences from NR below 1$M$ in nearly all cases across the parameter space. We compare our results to the differences predicted by leading Effective-One-Body and NR surrogate waveform models and find that in cases corresponding to the largest timing differences, our models can provide significant increases in accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Black bounces are compact objects with a wormhole structure hidden behind an event horizon. This type of metric can be obtained through general relativity by considering the presence of exotic matter. Such spacetimes can also arise within the framework of effective theories inspired by loop quantum gravity. In this work, we verify the possibility of obtaining black bounce models inspired by loop quantum gravity as solutions of general relativity. For this, we examine which sources can generate these solutions and the consequences of using these types of sources. We find that the sources can be expressed as a combination of a phantom scalar field and nonlinear electrodynamics. Once we obtain the sources in terms of fields, we analyze the energy conditions for each field separately to verify which of the fields is responsible for the violation of the energy conditions.</description>

      <title>A Unified Dynamical Systems Framework for Cosmology in $f(Q)$ Gravity: Generic Features Beyond the Coincident Gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified dynamical systems framework for spatially flat FLRW cosmology in $f(Q)$ gravity, covering all three connection branches via a single set of Hubble-normalised variables without fixing $f(Q)$ \textit{a priori}. This connection-agnostic, model-independent approach enables direct comparison across branches and reveals generic structural features that are not apparent in model or connection-specific analyses. Beyond fixed points, we identify invariant submanifolds, model-independent trajectories, and viable phase-space regions common to multiple branches. For a broad class of viable $f(Q)$ models, we find generic de Sitter attractors and matter-dominated points in non-coincident branches, ensuring late-time acceleration without fine-tuning. An invariant submanifold is shown to reproduce $\Lambda$CDM-like backgrounds despite dynamics distinct from GR, offering a geometric origin for cosmic acceleration detectable only at the perturbation level. On this submanifold, a first integral enables analytic reconstruction of the dynamical connection and uncovers hidden conservation laws. While trivial connections display strong parameter dependence, nontrivial branches often exhibit parameter-independent behaviour. We also analyse the variation of the effective gravitational coupling $\kappa_{\text{eff}}=\frac{1}{f_Q}$ across branches, providing observational constraints that bridge theory and data. Applying the framework to $f(Q)=\alpha Q+\beta(-Q)^n$, we recover late-time acceleration and $\Lambda$CDM-like behaviour without vacuum energy. Finally, we propose a general route for extending dynamical systems analysis to broader classes of $f(Q)$ models using the $m_i$-hierarchy method, which enables closure of the autonomous system for models previously inaccessible to standard approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the maximum mass limit of strange stars in quadratic curvature gravity with the non-minimal matter coupling. The characteristic parameters of the quadratic curvature coupling and the non-minimal matter coupling imply the contributions from higher-order curvature terms and the coupling between matter and geometry, respectively. We explicitly demonstrate that the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor can be modified, and that in the vanishing limit of the non-minimal matter coupling, the formalism of general relativity is recovered. By deriving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations from the gravitational field equations and applying the MIT bag model equation of state, we obtain the corresponding mass-radius relationships for strange stars. Furthermore, we show that the maximum mass limit of strange stars can exceed the general relativistic counterpart. Specifically, we find that a maximum mass up to 3.11 solar mass is achievable, suggesting that the lighter companion of GW190814 could plausibly be a strange star.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous scalarization of generic, static, and spherically symmetric regular black holes supported by nonlinear electrodynamics. Starting from an arbitrary seed metric, we employ the P-dual formalism to reconstruct the electromagnetic sector and subsequently couple a real scalar field nonminimally. As a worked example, we apply the framework to the regular Balart-Vagenas black hole, showing that scalarized and scalar-free branches can coexist in a region where the scalarized configurations are entropically preferred. We further assess possible observational imprints, finding percent-level deviations in both the shadow size and the fundamental scalar quasi-normal modes ($&lt; 10\%$ for small charge-to-mass ratios), indicating that current electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations do not rule out these solutions. Our construction thus provides a general route to explore scalarization on top of nonlinear-electrodynamics-supported spacetimes, extending beyond specific Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like cases.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals in the cold vector dark matter environment</title>

Abstract: With regard to the observed dark matter density profile in galaxies and clusters, the scalar dark matter scenario has been previously studied for potential detectability through gravitational wave observations at measurable signal-to-noise ratios. In the present study, we consider the case of dark matter described by a massive vector field, also referred to as the Proca field. The density profile in the vicinity of the black hole is explicitly constructed for a broad range of dark matter mass, $\mu\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-15}{\mathrm eV}$, which allows it to exhibit both particle and wave-like characteristics. While in the particle regime, the computation of the DM density distribution is analytically tractable, we find it convenient to compute the same numerically in the wave regime. Nevertheless, in the outer region, the surrounding dark matter is assumed to follow a broken power-law distribution, represented by a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with a central spike. For the purpose of investigating the detectability of the vector dark matter in the gravitational wave spectrum, we have modelled a stellar-mass black hole ($1M_{\odot}$) inspiralling into a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $10^4M_{\odot}$ within such a vector dark matter environment. With this setup, we analyzed the dephasing in the gravitational wave strain induced by vector dark matter and performed a Fisher forecast for upcoming LISA observations, with particular emphasis on the distinctive features in both the particle and wave regimes of the dark matter. Additionally, most of the important results have been compared with the scalar dark matter case.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Phase Transitions and Quantum Entropy Corrections in the Simpson-Visser Regular Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regular black holes offer a compelling framework to explore the consequences of resolving the central singularity of standard black holes. Using the Simpson-Visser "black-bounce" geometry as an elegant, analytically tractable framework, we explore the intricate thermodynamic behavior in such models. We demonstrate that this regular spacetime exhibits a critical instability, marked by a phase transition where the heat capacity is discontinuous. This transition signals a fundamental change in the black hole's evaporation state, which depends on the regularization parameter. Pushing beyond the semiclassical limit, we then derive the leading-order quantum corrections to the entropy via the Hamilton-Jacobi tunneling formalism. Our analysis provides a refined statistical basis for the entropy of non-singular spacetimes and offers a quantitative analysis of the nature of the black hole end-state. These results reveal that singularity resolution is not merely a geometric modification but a profound thermodynamic event, with direct implications for the stability and ultimate fate of evaporating black holes.</description>

      <title>Master Variables and Darboux Symmetry for Axial Perturbations of the Exterior and Interior of Black Hole Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent efforts have shown that Kantowski-Sachs spacetime provides a useful framework for analyzing perturbations inside a Schwarzschild black hole (BH). In these studies, the adoption of a Hamiltonian formulation offers an insightful perspective. The aim of this work is twofold. First, we revisit and elaborate the results obtained so far in Kantowski-Sachs, with the focus placed on axial perturbations. In particular, by exploiting the relation between this spacetime and the interior of a nonrotating BH, we consider the extension of those results to the exterior geometry of the BH. In this way, we clarify the relation between the axial perturbative gauge invariants emerging from the canonical analysis and the already well-established axial BH invariants, often referred to as master functions. We do so by providing a unified picture of the Hamiltonian formalism, which does not distinguish, formally, between exterior and interior geometries. The second objective is to explore the role of Darboux transformations, which were found as hidden symmetries in the context of BH perturbations, and their appearance in the Hamiltonian setting. Within this framework, the Hamiltonian formulation provides a clear geometric interpretation and characterization of Darboux transformations within the axial sector, viewing them as the set of canonical transformations between Hamiltonians for axial master functions.</description>

      <title>Master functions and hybrid quantization of perturbed nonrotating black hole interiors</title>

Abstract: Master functions of black holes are fundamental tools in gravitational-wave physics and are typically derived within a Lagrangian framework. Starting from the Kantowski-Sachs geometry, one can instead construct a perturbative Hamiltonian description for the interior region of an uncharged and nonrotating black hole. This approach provides a complementary perspective and enables a quantum treatment of the background geometry and its perturbations. In this work, we extend the application of this formulation to the exterior region and establish a correspondence between the perturbative invariants of the canonical approach and the master functions commonly used in black hole analyses. Once a consistent Hamiltonian description for their canonical counterparts is obtained, a hybrid quantization of the master functions follows naturally.</description>

      <title>CMB delensing with deep learning</title>

Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) stands as a pivotal source for studying weak gravitational lensing. While the lensed CMB aids in constraining cosmological parameters, it simultaneously smooths the original CMB's features. The angular power spectrum of the unlensed CMB showcases sharper acoustic peaks and more pronounced damping tails, enhancing the precision of inferring cosmological parameters that influence these aspects. Although delensing diminishes the $B$-mode power spectrum, it facilitates the pursuit of primordial gravitational waves and enables a lower variance reconstruction of lensing and additional sources of secondary CMB anisotropies. In this work, we explore the potential of deep learning techniques, specifically the U-Net++ algorithm, to play a pivotal role in CMB delensing. We analyze three fields, namely $T$, $Q$, and $U$ sky maps, present the angular power spectra of the CMB delensed $TT$, $EE$, $BB$, and $TE$, and compare them with the unlensed CMB angular power spectra. Our findings reveal that the angular power spectrum of the lensed CMB, processed by U-Net++, closely aligns with that of the unlensed CMB. Thus, U-Net++ based CMB delensing proves to be effective in mitigating the impacts of weak gravitational lensing, paving the way for enhancing the CMB delensing power spectrum in forthcoming CMB experiments. The code utilized for this analysis is available on GitHub.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we derive the singular condition for black holes and demonstrate the potential resolution of the Schwarzschild black hole singularity in general relativity using non-perturbative $\alpha^{\prime}$ corrections of string theory. This work is motivated by the Belinskii, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz (BKL) proposal, which suggests that the structure of the black hole interior in vacuum Einstein's equations can be transformed into the Kasner universe near the singularity. This transformation allows for the description of the black hole interior using the $O\left(d,d\right)$ invariant anisotropic Hohm-Zwiebach action, which includes all orders of $\alpha^{\prime}$ corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply in a simple model derived from quadratic $\mathcal{R}^2$ gravity the technique of Dyson-Schwinger equations to solve for its corresponding quantum theory. Particularly, we solve the classical equations of motion to get a solution to the hierarchy of Dyson-Schwinger equations in the limit of large Ricci scalar, assumed to be constant and larger than the square of the Starobinsky mass. Moving to the Einstein frame, the model admits Higgs-like solutions with a single particle having a finite mass. We quantize the scalar field showing the appearing of a mass gap through a Higgs-like solution. The presence of the mass gap, that increases with the square root of the Ricci scalar, shows how the effect of the scalar sector at low-energy becomes ineffective, making it relevant only at short distances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many theories of physical interest, which admit a Hamiltonian description, exhibit symmetries under a particular class of non - strictly canonical transformation, known as dynamical similarities. The presence of such symmetries allows a reduction process to be carried out, eliminating a single degree of freedom from the system, which we associate with an overall scale. This process of `contact reduction' leads to theories of a frictional nature, in which the physically-observable quantities form an autonomous subsystem, that evolves in a predictable manner. We demonstrate that this procedure has a natural generalisation to theories of higher order; detailed examples are provided, and physical implications discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized stress-energy tensor for a massless quantum scalar field in the background of the horizonless Bardeen spacetime. Within the weak-field approximation, we show that the vacuum fluctuations differ significantly between conformally and nonconformally coupled fields, both in magnitude and in their behavior at short and intermediate distances. At large distances, we recover the universal asymptotic behavior previously observed in black hole and Newtonian star backgrounds. Going beyond the weak-field regime, we find that, for certain parameter ranges, the modes of the field can develop imaginary frequencies, leading to instabilities and an exponential growth of vacuum fluctuations. We also discuss critically the applicability of the anomaly-induced effective action for computing the renormalized stress-energy tensor in the conformally coupled case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave measurements of the binary black hole population provide insights into the evolution of merging binaries. We explore potential correlation between mass and mass ratio with phenomenological population models where the minimum mass of the smaller (secondary) black hole can change with the mass of the bigger (primary) black hole. We use binary black hole signals from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog with and without the relatively extreme mass-ratio GW190814. When excluding GW190814, models with a variable minimum mass are disfavoured compared to one with a constant minimum mass, with log Bayes factors of -2.49 to -0.98, indicating that the biggest black holes can merge with the smallest. When including GW190814, a parabola model that allows the minimum mass to decrease with increasing primary mass is favoured over a constant minimum-mass model with a log Bayes factor of 4.44. When allowing the minimum mass to decrease, the overall population distributions remain similar whether or not GW190814 is included. This shows that with added model flexibility, we can reconcile potential outlier observations within our population. These investigations motivate further explorations of correlations between mass ratio and component masses in order to understand how evolutionary processes may leave an imprint on these distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativity, treated as a low energy effective field theory, predicts quantum corrections to Newtons law of gravitation arising from loops of matter and graviton fields. While these corrections are negligible for the Standard Model particle content, the situation changes dramatically in the presence of a hidden or dark sector containing a very large number of light degrees of freedom. In such cases, loop induced modifications to the Newtonian potential can accumulate to levels testable in laboratory and astrophysical probes of gravity at short distances. In this work we systematically derive and constrain the impact of large dark sectors on precision tests of Newtons law, translating effective field theory predictions into the experimental language of Yukawa type deviations and inverse square law deformations. By mapping precision fifth force constraints onto bounds on species multiplicities and masses, we show that current and forthcoming experiments already impose nontrivial constraints on the size and structure of hidden sectors coupled only gravitationally. For truly massless hidden states, present data still permit multiplicities as large as 1e61, with modest spin dependence; for finite masses the constraints reduce to the familiar short range Yukawa parameterization. Our results provide a model independent framework for confronting dark sector scenarios with precision gravity data and clarify how non minimal scalar couplings, potential higher derivative poles at large species number, and Kaluza Klein towers fit within this picture. The approach is complementary to cosmological probes: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background constrain relic abundances under specified production histories, whereas laboratory tests constrain the spectrum of light states irrespective of their cosmological population.</description>

Abstract: We identify what has been referred to as 'cut-off CFT' in holographic braneworld with $T^2$ or $T\bar T$ theory (depending on the dimension of the bulk), so that the holographic dual of AdS-gravity with Neumann boundary conditions is a $T^2$-deformed CFT that is set free. After making statements that apply for general dimensions higher than three, we focus on the case of a three-dimensional bulk. We find from bulk arguments that the effective theory on the brane is governed by a $T\bar T$-like flow equation, such that under certain assumptions the effective gravity theory on the brane is given by a $T\bar T$-like deformed timelike Liouville theory, which limits to the description of the holographic Weyl anomaly for branes that approach the asymptotic boundary.</description>

      <title>Towards a worldsheet theory of entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new action for entanglement entropy in the framework of the AdS$_{3}$/CFT$_{2}$ correspondence. This action is constructed directly from the entanglement entropy of the CFT$_{2}$, and we show that the Einstein equations of AdS$_{3}$ gravity can be derived from it. In the near-coincidence limit, using Riemann normal coordinates, the action reduces to a string worldsheet action in a curved background that naturally includes the symmetric spacetime metric, an antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond field, and a dilaton. The Kalb-Ramond field gives rise to a string charge density, from which we demonstrate that bit threads can be exactly reproduced. This correspondence provides a clear physical interpretation of bit threads. Exploiting this correspondence, we establish explicit relations between the emergent string worldsheet and the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface, providing new insights into entanglement entropy. In particular, entanglement entropy can be computed from open string charge, while Bekenstein-Hawking entropy arises from closed string charge through open-closed string duality. These results suggest a unified picture in which the Susskind-Uglum conjecture, open-closed string duality, and the ER=EPR proposal emerge as equivalent manifestations of the same underlying principle. Finally, we propose a quantization of the RT surface, pointing to a possible connection with loop quantum gravity that refines Wall's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Decoherence from Imaginary-Order Spectral Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mechanism of spontaneous decoherence is examined in which the generator of quantum dynamics is replaced by the imaginary-order (which is fundamentally different from real-order fractional calculus) spectral deformation $H^{1+i\beta}$ for a positive self-adjoint Hamiltonian $H$. The deformation modifies dynamical phases through the factor $E^{i\beta}=e^{i\beta\log E}$, whose rapid oscillation suppresses interference between distinct energies. A non-stationary-phase analysis yields quantitative estimates: oscillatory contributions to amplitudes or decoherence functionals decay at least as $\mathcal{O}(1/|\beta|)$. The kinematical structure of quantum mechanics -- the Hilbert-space inner product, projection operators, and the Born rule -- remains unchanged; the modification is entirely dynamical and acts only through spectral phases.
  Physical motivations for the deformation arise from clock imperfections, renormalization-group and effective-action corrections that introduce logarithmic spectral terms, and semiclassical gravity analyses in which complex actions produce spectral factors of the form $E^{i\beta}$. The mechanism is illustrated in examples relevant to quantum-gravity-inspired quantum mechanics.
  A detailed related-work analysis contrasts the present mechanism with Milburn-type intrinsic decoherence, Di\'osi-Penrose gravitational collapse, GRW/CSL models, clock-induced decoherence, and energy-conserving collapse models, as well as environmental frameworks such as Lindblad master equations, Caldeira-Leggett baths, and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian deformations. This positions $H^{1+i\beta}$ dynamics as a compact, testable, and genuinely novel phenomenological encapsulation of logarithmic spectral corrections arising in quantum-gravity-motivated effective theories, while remaining fully compatible with standard quantum kinematics.</description>

      <title>Universal Supercritical Behavior in Global Monopole-Charged AdS Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically investigate the Widom line and universal supercritical crossover for charged AdS black holes threaded by a global monopole. We compute thermodynamic variables in both the extended and canonical ensembles. We derive the scaled variance $\Omega$ using the Gibbs free energy and locate the Widom line as the extrema of this. Using mean-field expansion of the equation of state near criticality, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L^\pm$. We show that the monopole parameter shifts the critical parameters but does not change the mean-field universal scaling: the leading linear term and the nonanalytic correction remain universal in both ensembles. We also verify this with numerical computation and show the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L^\pm$.</description>
