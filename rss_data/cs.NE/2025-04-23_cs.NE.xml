      <title>Comparative Analysis of Evolutionary Algorithms for Energy-Aware Production Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy transition is driving rapid growth in renewable energy generation, creating the need to balance energy supply and demand with energy price awareness. One such approach for manufacturers to balance their energy demand with available energy is energyaware production planning. Through energy-aware production planning, manufacturers can align their energy demand with dynamic grid conditions, supporting renewable energy integration while benefiting from lower prices and reduced emissions. Energy-aware production planning can be modeled as a multi-criteria scheduling problem, where the objectives extend beyond traditional metrics like makespan or required workers to also include minimizing energy costs and emissions. Due to market dynamics and the NP-hard multi-objective nature of the problem, evolutionary algorithms are widely used for energy-aware scheduling. However, existing research focuses on the design and analysis of single algorithms, with limited comparisons between different approaches. In this study, we adapt NSGA-III, HypE, and $\theta$-DEA as memetic metaheuristics for energy-aware scheduling to minimize makespan, energy costs, emissions, and the number of workers, within a real-time energy market context. These adapted metaheuristics present different approaches for environmental selection. In a comparative analysis, we explore differences in solution efficiency and quality across various scenarios which are based on benchmark instances from the literature and real-world energy market data. Additionally, we estimate upper bounds on the distance between objective values obtained with our memetic metaheuristics and reference sets obtained via an exact solver.</description>

      <title>Event2Vec: Processing neuromorphic events directly by representations in vector space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neuromorphic event cameras have overwhelming advantages in temporal resolution, power efficiency, and dynamic range compared to traditional cameras. However, the event cameras output asynchronous, sparse, and irregular events, which are not compatible with mainstream computer vision and deep learning methods. Various methods have been proposed to solve this issue but at the cost of long preprocessing procedures, losing temporal resolutions, or being incompatible with massively parallel computation. Inspired by the great success of the word to vector, we summarize the similarities between words and events, then propose the first event to vector (event2vec) representation. We validate event2vec on classifying the ASL-DVS dataset, showing impressive parameter efficiency, accuracy, and speed than previous graph/image/voxel-based representations. Beyond task performance, the most attractive advantage of event2vec is that it aligns events to the domain of natural language processing, showing the promising prospect of integrating events into large language and multimodal models. Our codes, models, and training logs are available at https://github.com/fangwei123456/event2vec.</description>

      <title>CAPO: Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16005v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by solving a wide range of tasks simply guided by a prompt. Yet their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. While automated prompt optimization addresses this challenge by finding optimal prompts, current methods require a substantial number of LLM calls and input tokens, making prompt optimization expensive. We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by integrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as operators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective optimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes instructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for improved robustness. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization methods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%p. Our algorithm achieves better performances already with smaller budgets, saves evaluations through racing, and decreases average prompt length via a length penalty, making it both cost-efficient and cost-aware. Even without few-shot examples, CAPO outperforms its competitors and generally remains robust to initial prompts. CAPO represents an important step toward making prompt optimization more powerful and accessible by improving cost-efficiency.</description>

      <title>AlphaGrad: Non-Linear Gradient Normalization Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16020v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce AlphaGrad, a memory-efficient, conditionally stateless optimizer addressing the memory overhead and hyperparameter complexity of adaptive methods like Adam. AlphaGrad enforces scale invariance via tensor-wise L2 gradient normalization followed by a smooth hyperbolic tangent transformation, $g' = \tanh(\alpha \cdot \tilde{g})$, controlled by a single steepness parameter $\alpha$. Our contributions include: (1) the AlphaGrad algorithm formulation; (2) a formal non-convex convergence analysis guaranteeing stationarity; (3) extensive empirical evaluation on diverse RL benchmarks (DQN, TD3, PPO). Compared to Adam, AlphaGrad demonstrates a highly context-dependent performance profile. While exhibiting instability in off-policy DQN, it provides enhanced training stability with competitive results in TD3 (requiring careful $\alpha$ tuning) and achieves substantially superior performance in on-policy PPO. These results underscore the critical importance of empirical $\alpha$ selection, revealing strong interactions between the optimizer's dynamics and the underlying RL algorithm. AlphaGrad presents a compelling alternative optimizer for memory-constrained scenarios and shows significant promise for on-policy learning regimes where its stability and efficiency advantages can be particularly impactful.</description>

      <title>Continuous signal sparse encoding using analog neuromorphic variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving fast and reliable temporal signal encoding is crucial for low-power, always-on systems. While current spike-based encoding algorithms rely on complex networks or precise timing references, simple and robust encoding models can be obtained by leveraging the intrinsic properties of analog hardware substrates. We propose an encoding framework inspired by biological principles that leverages intrinsic neuronal variability to robustly encode continuous stimuli into spatio-temporal patterns, using at most one spike per neuron. The encoder has low model complexity, relying on a shallow network of heterogeneous neurons. It relies on an internal time reference, allowing for continuous processing. Moreover, stimulus parameters can be linearly decoded from the spiking patterns, granting fast information retrieval. Our approach, validated on both analog neuromorphic hardware and simulation, demonstrates high robustness to noise, spike jitter, and reduced heterogeneity. Consistently with biological observations, we observed the spontaneous emergence of patterns with stereotyped spiking order. The proposed encoding scheme facilitates fast, robust and continuous information processing, making it well-suited for low-power, low-latency processing of temporal data on analog neuromorphic substrates.</description>

      <title>EEG Right &amp; Left Voluntary Hand Movement-based Virtual Brain-Computer Interfacing Keyboard Using Hybrid Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), particularly those based on electroencephalography (EEG), offer promising solutions for assisting individuals with motor disabilities. However, challenges in reliably interpreting EEG signals for specific tasks, such as simulating keystrokes, persist due to the complexity and variability of brain activity. Current EEG-based BMIs face limitations in adaptability, usability, and robustness, especially in applications like virtual keyboards, as traditional machine-learning models struggle to handle high-dimensional EEG data effectively. To address these gaps, we developed an EEG-based BMI system capable of accurately identifying voluntary keystrokes, specifically leveraging right and left voluntary hand movements. Using a publicly available EEG dataset, the signals were pre-processed with band-pass filtering, segmented into 22-electrode arrays, and refined into event-related potential (ERP) windows, resulting in a 19x200 feature array categorized into three classes: resting state (0), 'd' key press (1), and 'l' key press (2). Our approach employs a hybrid neural network architecture with BiGRU-Attention as the proposed model for interpreting EEG signals, achieving superior test accuracy of 90% and a mean accuracy of 91% in 10-fold stratified cross-validation. This performance outperforms traditional ML methods like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Naive Bayes, as well as advanced architectures such as Transformers, CNN-Transformer hybrids, and EEGNet. Finally, the BiGRU-Attention model is integrated into a real-time graphical user interface (GUI) to simulate and predict keystrokes from brain activity. Our work demonstrates how deep learning can advance EEG-based BMI systems by addressing the challenges of signal interpretation and classification.</description>
