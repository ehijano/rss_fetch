      <title>An LLM-Powered Clinical Calculator Chatbot Backed by Verifiable Clinical Calculators and their Metadata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical calculators are widely used, and large language models (LLMs) make it possible to engage them using natural language. We demonstrate a purpose-built chatbot that leverages software implementations of verifiable clinical calculators via LLM tools and metadata about these calculators via retrieval augmented generation (RAG). We compare the chatbot's response accuracy to an unassisted off-the-shelf LLM on four natural language conversation workloads. Our chatbot achieves 100% accuracy on queries interrogating calculator metadata content and shows a significant increase in clinical calculation accuracy vs. the off-the-shelf LLM when prompted with complete sentences (86.4% vs. 61.8%) or with medical shorthand (79.2% vs. 62.0%). It eliminates calculation errors when prompted with complete sentences (0% vs. 16.8%) and greatly reduces them when prompted with medical shorthand (2.4% vs. 18%). While our chatbot is not ready for clinical use, these results show progress in minimizing incorrect calculation results.</description>

      <title>NaFM: Pre-training a Foundation Model for Small-Molecule Natural Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural products, as metabolites from microorganisms, animals, or plants, exhibit diverse biological activities, making them crucial for drug discovery. Nowadays, existing deep learning methods for natural products research primarily rely on supervised learning approaches designed for specific downstream tasks. However, such one-model-for-a-task paradigm often lacks generalizability and leaves significant room for performance improvement. Additionally, existing molecular characterization methods are not well-suited for the unique tasks associated with natural products. To address these limitations, we have pre-trained a foundation model for natural products based on their unique properties. Our approach employs a novel pretraining strategy that is especially tailored to natural products. By incorporating contrastive learning and masked graph learning objectives, we emphasize evolutional information from molecular scaffolds while capturing side-chain information. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in various downstream tasks related to natural product mining and drug discovery. We first compare taxonomy classification with synthesized molecule-focused baselines to demonstrate that current models are inadequate for understanding natural synthesis. Furthermore, by diving into a fine-grained analysis at both the gene and microbial levels, NaFM demonstrates the ability to capture evolutionary information. Eventually, our method is experimented with virtual screening, illustrating informative natural product representations that can lead to more effective identification of potential drug candidates.</description>

      <title>GRiNS: A Python Library for Simulating Gene Regulatory Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergent dynamics of complex gene regulatory networks govern various cellular processes. However, understanding these dynamics is challenging due to the difficulty of parameterizing the computational models for these networks, especially as the network size increases. Here, we introduce a simulation library, Gene Regulatory Interaction Network Simulator (GRiNS), to address these challenges. GRiNS integrates popular parameter-agnostic simulation frameworks, RACIPE and Boolean Ising formalism, into a single Python library capable of leveraging GPU acceleration for efficient and scalable simulations. GRiNS extends the ordinary differential equations (ODE) based RACIPE framework with a more modular design, allowing users to choose parameters, initial conditions, and time-series outputs for greater customisability and accuracy in simulations. For large networks, where ODE-based simulation formalisms do not scale well, GRiNS implements Boolean Ising formalism, providing a simplified, coarse-grained alternative, significantly reducing the computational cost while capturing key dynamical behaviours of large regulatory networks. The documentation and installation instructions for GRiNS can be found at https://moltenecdysone09.github.io/GRiNS/.</description>

      <title>Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modality Representation Learning for Antibody-Antigen Interactions Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While deep learning models play a crucial role in predicting antibody-antigen interactions (AAI), the scarcity of publicly available sequence-structure pairings constrains their generalization. Current AAI methods often focus on residue-level static details, overlooking fine-grained structural representations of antibodies and their inter-antibody similarities. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a multi-modality representation approach that integates 3D structural and 1D sequence data to unravel intricate intra-antibody hierarchical relationships. By harnessing these representations, we present MuLAAIP, an AAI prediction framework that utilizes graph attention networks to illuminate graph-level structural features and normalized adaptive graph convolution networks to capture inter-antibody sequence associations. Furthermore, we have curated an AAI benchmark dataset comprising both structural and sequence information along with interaction labels. Through extensive experiments on this benchmark, our results demonstrate that MuLAAIP outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of predictive performance. The implementation code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/trashTian/MuLAAIP for reproducibility.</description>

      <title>MammAlps: A multi-view video behavior monitoring dataset of wild mammals in the Swiss Alps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring wildlife is essential for ecology and ethology, especially in light of the increasing human impact on ecosystems. Camera traps have emerged as habitat-centric sensors enabling the study of wildlife populations at scale with minimal disturbance. However, the lack of annotated video datasets limits the development of powerful video understanding models needed to process the vast amount of fieldwork data collected. To advance research in wild animal behavior monitoring we present MammAlps, a multimodal and multi-view dataset of wildlife behavior monitoring from 9 camera-traps in the Swiss National Park. MammAlps contains over 14 hours of video with audio, 2D segmentation maps and 8.5 hours of individual tracks densely labeled for species and behavior. Based on 6135 single animal clips, we propose the first hierarchical and multimodal animal behavior recognition benchmark using audio, video and reference scene segmentation maps as inputs. Furthermore, we also propose a second ecology-oriented benchmark aiming at identifying activities, species, number of individuals and meteorological conditions from 397 multi-view and long-term ecological events, including false positive triggers. We advocate that both tasks are complementary and contribute to bridging the gap between machine learning and ecology. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/eceo-epfl/MammAlps</description>

      <title>Efficient parameter inference in networked dynamical systems via steady states: A surrogate objective function approach integrating mean-field and nonlinear least squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In networked dynamical systems, inferring governing parameters is crucial for predicting nodal dynamics, such as gene expression levels, species abundance, or population density. While many parameter estimation techniques rely on time-series data, particularly systems that converge over extreme time ranges, only noisy steady-state data is available, requiring a new approach to infer dynamical parameters from noisy observations of steady states. However, the traditional optimization process is computationally demanding, requiring repeated simulation of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a surrogate objective function that leverages decoupled equations to compute steady states, significantly reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, by optimizing the surrogate objective function, we obtain steady states that more accurately approximate the ground truth than noisy observations and predict future equilibria when topology changes. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method across ecological, gene regulatory, and epidemic networks. Our approach provides an efficient and effective way to estimate parameters from steady-state data and has the potential to improve predictions in networked dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A primer on inference and prediction with epidemic renewal models and sequential Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renewal models are widely used in statistical epidemiology as semi-mechanistic models of disease transmission. While primarily used for estimating the instantaneous reproduction number, they can also be used for generating projections, estimating elimination probabilities, modelling the effect of interventions, and more. We demonstrate how simple sequential Monte Carlo methods (also known as particle filters) can be used to perform inference on these models. Our goal is to acquaint a reader who has a working knowledge of statistical inference with these methods and models and to provide a practical guide to their implementation. We focus on these methods' flexibility and their ability to handle multiple statistical and other biases simultaneously. We leverage this flexibility to unify existing methods for estimating the instantaneous reproduction number and generating projections. A companion website "SMC and epidemic renewal models" provides additional worked examples, self-contained code to reproduce the examples presented here, and additional materials.</description>

      <title>Leveraging statistical models to improve pre-season forecasting and in-season management of a recreational fishery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective management of recreational fisheries requires accurate forecasting of future harvests and real-time monitoring of ongoing harvests. Traditional methods that rely on historical catch data to predict short-term harvests can be unreliable, particularly if changes in management regulations alter angler behavior. In contrast, statistical modeling approaches can provide faster, more flexible, and potentially more accurate predictions, enhancing management outcomes. In this study, we developed and tested models to improve predictions of Gulf of Mexico gag harvests for both pre-season planning and in-season monitoring. Our best-fitting model outperformed traditional methods (i.e., estimates derived from historical average harvest) for both cumulative pre-season projections and in-season monitoring. Notably, our modeling framework appeared to be more accurate in more recent, shorter seasons due to its ability to account for effort compression. A key advantage of our framework is its ability to explicitly quantify the probability of exceeding harvest quotas for any given season duration. This feature enables managers to evaluate trade-offs between season duration and conservation goals. This is especially critical for vulnerable, highly targeted stocks. Our findings also underscore the value of statistical models to complement and advance traditional fisheries management approaches.</description>

      <title>Distributional bias compromises leave-one-out cross-validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-validation is a common method for estimating the predictive performance of machine learning models. In a data-scarce regime, where one typically wishes to maximize the number of instances used for training the model, an approach called "leave-one-out cross-validation" is often used. In this design, a separate model is built for predicting each data instance after training on all other instances. Since this results in a single test instance available per model trained, predictions are aggregated across the entire dataset to calculate common performance metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic or R2 scores. In this work, we demonstrate that this approach creates a negative correlation between the average label of each training fold and the label of its corresponding test instance, a phenomenon that we term distributional bias. As machine learning models tend to regress to the mean of their training data, this distributional bias tends to negatively impact performance evaluation and hyperparameter optimization. We show that this effect generalizes to leave-P-out cross-validation and persists across a wide range of modeling and evaluation approaches, and that it can lead to a bias against stronger regularization. To address this, we propose a generalizable rebalanced cross-validation approach that corrects for distributional bias for both classification and regression. We demonstrate that our approach improves cross-validation performance evaluation in synthetic simulations, across machine learning benchmarks, and in several published leave-one-out analyses.</description>

      <title>RankByGene: Gene-Guided Histopathology Representation Learning Through Cross-Modal Ranking Consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides essential spatial context by mapping gene expression within tissue, enabling detailed study of cellular heterogeneity and tissue organization. However, aligning ST data with histology images poses challenges due to inherent spatial distortions and modality-specific variations. Existing methods largely rely on direct alignment, which often fails to capture complex cross-modal relationships. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that aligns gene and image features using a ranking-based alignment loss, preserving relative similarity across modalities and enabling robust multi-scale alignment. To further enhance the alignment's stability, we employ self-supervised knowledge distillation with a teacher-student network architecture, effectively mitigating disruptions from high dimensionality, sparsity, and noise in gene expression data. Extensive experiments on seven public datasets that encompass gene expression prediction, slide-level classification, and survival analysis demonstrate the efficacy of our method, showing improved alignment and predictive performance over existing methods.</description>

      <title>FlowDock: Geometric Flow Matching for Generative Protein-Ligand Docking and Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Powerful generative AI models of protein-ligand structure have recently been proposed, but few of these methods support both flexible protein-ligand docking and affinity estimation. Of those that do, none can directly model multiple binding ligands concurrently or have been rigorously benchmarked on pharmacologically relevant drug targets, hindering their widespread adoption in drug discovery efforts. In this work, we propose FlowDock, the first deep geometric generative model based on conditional flow matching that learns to directly map unbound (apo) structures to their bound (holo) counterparts for an arbitrary number of binding ligands. Furthermore, FlowDock provides predicted structural confidence scores and binding affinity values with each of its generated protein-ligand complex structures, enabling fast virtual screening of new (multi-ligand) drug targets. For the well-known PoseBusters Benchmark dataset, FlowDock outperforms single-sequence AlphaFold 3 with a 51% blind docking success rate using unbound (apo) protein input structures and without any information derived from multiple sequence alignments, and for the challenging new DockGen-E dataset, FlowDock outperforms single-sequence AlphaFold 3 and matches single-sequence Chai-1 for binding pocket generalization. Additionally, in the ligand category of the 16th community-wide Critical Assessment of Techniques for Structure Prediction (CASP16), FlowDock ranked among the top-5 methods for pharmacological binding affinity estimation across 140 protein-ligand complexes, demonstrating the efficacy of its learned representations in virtual screening. Source code, data, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/FlowDock.</description>
