      <title>Stiff Circuit System Modeling via Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient circuit behavior modeling is a cornerstone of modern electronic design automation. Among different types of circuits, stiff circuits are challenging to model using previous frameworks. In this work, we propose a new approach using Crossformer, which is a current state-of-the-art Transformer model for time-series prediction tasks, combined with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to model stiff circuit transient behavior. By leveraging the Crossformer's temporal representation capabilities and the enhanced feature extraction of KANs, our method achieves improved fidelity in predicting circuit responses to a wide range of input conditions. Experimental evaluations on datasets generated through SPICE simulations of analog-to-digital converter (ADC) circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with significant reductions in training time and error rates.</description>

      <title>A Black Box Variational Inference Scheme for Inverse Problems with Demanding Physics-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian methods are particularly effective for addressing inverse problems due to their ability to manage uncertainties inherent in the inference process. However, employing these methods with costly forward models poses significant challenges, especially in the context of non-differentiable models, where the absence of likelihood model gradient information can result in high computational costs. To tackle this issue, we develop a novel Bayesian inference approach based on black box variational inference, utilizing importance sampling to reuse existing simulation model calls in the variational objective gradient estimation, without relying on forward model gradients. The novelty lies in a new batch-sequential sampling procedure, which only requires new model evaluations if the currently available model evaluations fail to yield a suitable approximation of the objective gradient. The resulting approach reduces computational costs by leading to variational parameter updates without requiring new model evaluations when possible, while adaptively increasing the number of model calls per iteration as needed. In combination with its black box nature, this new approach is suitable for inverse problems involving demanding physics-based models that lack model gradients. We demonstrate the efficiency gains of the proposed method compared to its baseline version, sequential Monte Carlo, and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo in diverse benchmarks, ranging from density matching to the Bayesian calibration of a nonlinear electro-chemo-mechanical model for solid-state batteries.</description>

      <title>Fourier Neural Operators for Two-Phase, 2D Mold-Filling Problems Related to Metal Casting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reframes mold filling in metal casting as a simplified 2D operator learning surrogate to avoid costly transient CFD simulations. The method combines a graph based encoder that aggregates neighborhood information on an unstructured input mesh to encode geometry and boundary data, a Fourier spectral core that operates on a regular latent grid to capture global interactions, and a graph based decoder that maps latent fields back to a target mesh. The model jointly predicts velocities, pressure, and volume fraction over a fixed horizon and generalizes across varied ingate locations and process settings. On held out geometries and inlet conditions it reproduces large scale advection and the fluid air interface with errors concentrated near steep gradients. Mean relative L2 errors are about 5 percent across all fields. Inference is roughly 100 to 1000 times faster than conventional CFD simulations, thereby enabling rapid in-the-loop design exploration. Ablation studies show accuracy drops monotonically with stronger spatial subsampling of input vertices while temporal subsampling causes a gentler decline. Cutting the training data by 50 percent yields only small error growth. Overall the results demonstrate neural operators as efficient surrogates for 2D mold filling and related filling problems and enable fast exploration and optimization of gating system designs in casting workflows.</description>

      <title>Towards Automated Quality Assurance of Patent Specifications: A Multi-Dimensional LLM Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the surge in patent applications and emergence of AI drafting tools, systematic evaluation of patent content quality has received limited research attention. To address this gap, We propose to evaluate patents using regulatory compliance, technical coherence, and figure-reference consistency detection modules, and then generate improvement suggestions via an integration module. The framework is validated on a comprehensive dataset comprising 80 human-authored and 80 AI-generated patents from two patent drafting tools. Experimental results show balanced accuracies of 99.74\%, 82.12\%, and 91.2\% respectively across the three detection modules when validated against expert annotations. Additional analysis was conducted to examine defect distributions across patent sections, technical domains, and authoring sources. Section-based analysis indicates that figure-text consistency and technical detail precision require particular attention. Mechanical Engineering and Construction show more claim-specification inconsistencies due to complex technical documentation requirements. AI-generated patents show a significant gap compared to human-authored ones. While human-authored patents primarily contain surface-level errors like typos, AI-generated patents exhibit more structural defects in figure-text alignment and cross-references.</description>

      <title>Graph Network-based Structural Simulator: Graph Neural Networks for Structural Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate modeling of dynamic structural problems.
  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss, which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.
  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful predictions.
  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated structural simulations.</description>

      <title>LaMP-Val: Large Language Models Empower Personalized Valuation in Auction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Auctions are a vital economic mechanism used to determine the market value of goods or services through competitive bidding within a specific framework. However, much of the current research primarily focuses on the bidding algorithms used within auction mechanisms. This often neglects the potential benefits of incorporating individual users' unique preferences into the valuation process. Our theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrates that valuation errors can significantly impact the overall utility. To bridge this gap, we propose a personalized valuation framework, namely Large \underline{La}nguage \underline{M}odels-powered \underline{P}ersonalized \underline{Val}uation (LaMP-Val), which integrates Large Language Models to incorporate personalized semantic preference into users valuation process. LaMP-Val integrating three components: data, learning, and evaluation. The data component tackles the challenge of building a novel dataset specifically for LLMs fine-tuning in personalized valuation modeling. The learning component introduces a diversity template to enhance LLMs' capacity for modeling fine-grained personal valuation patterns. The evaluation component establishes a closed-loop system where LLM-generated valuations interact with bidding strategies and auction. It proposes two novel metrics to quantify valuation precision and bidding intention accuracy in personalized scenarios. Extensive experiments show that LaMP-Val more accurately captures personalized values and achieves greater profits than baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Design 4.0: Paradigm Evolution Toward the Agentic AI Era</title>

Abstract: Research and practice in Intelligent Design (ID) have significantly enhanced engineering innovation, efficiency, quality, and productivity over recent decades, fundamentally reshaping how engineering designers think, behave, and interact with design processes. The recent emergence of Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has demonstrated general knowledge-based reasoning capabilities, and open new avenues for further transformation in engineering design. In this context, this paper introduces Intelligent Design 4.0 (ID 4.0) as an emerging paradigm empowered by foundation model-based agentic AI systems. We review the historical evolution of ID across four distinct stages: rule-based expert systems, task-specific machine learning models, large-scale foundation AI models, and the recent emerging paradigm of foundation model-based multi-agent collaboration. We propose an ontological framework for ID 4.0 and discuss its potential to support end-to-end automation of engineering design processes through coordinated, autonomous multi-agent-based systems. Furthermore, we discuss challenges and opportunities of ID 4.0, including perspectives on data foundations, agent collaboration mechanisms, and the formulation of design problems and objectives. In sum, these insights provide a foundation for advancing Intelligent Design toward greater adaptivity, autonomy, and effectiveness in addressing the growing complexity of engineering design.</description>

      <title>GroupSHAP-Guided Integration of Financial News Keywords and Technical Indicators for Stock Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in finance-specific language models such as FinBERT have enabled the quantification of public sentiment into index-based measures, yet compressing diverse linguistic signals into single metrics overlooks contextual nuances and limits interpretability. To address this limitation, explainable AI techniques, particularly SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations), have been employed to identify influential features. However, SHAP's computational cost grows exponentially with input features, making it impractical for large-scale text-based financial data. This study introduces a GRU-based forecasting framework enhanced with GroupSHAP, which quantifies contributions of semantically related keyword groups rather than individual tokens, substantially reducing computational burden while preserving interpretability. We employed FinBERT to embed news articles from 2015 to 2024, clustered them into coherent semantic groups, and applied GroupSHAP to measure each group's contribution to stock price movements. The resulting group-level SHAP variables across multiple topics were used as input features for the prediction model. Empirical results from one-day-ahead forecasting of the S&amp;P 500 index throughout 2024 demonstrate that our approach achieves a 32.2% reduction in MAE and a 40.5% reduction in RMSE compared with benchmark models without the GroupSHAP mechanism. This research presents the first application of GroupSHAP in news-driven financial forecasting, showing that grouped sentiment representations simultaneously enhance interpretability and predictive performance.</description>
