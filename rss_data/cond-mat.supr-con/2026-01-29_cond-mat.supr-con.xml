      <title>Detecting half-quantum superconducting vortices by spin-qubit relaxometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Half-quantum vortices in spin-triplet superconductors are predicted to harbor Majorana zero modes and may provide a viable avenue to topological quantum computation. Here, we introduce a novel approach for directly measuring the half-integer-quantized magnetic fluxes, $\Phi = h / (4e)$, carried by such half-quantum vortices via spin-qubit relaxometry. We consider a superconducting strip with a narrow pinch point at which vortices cross quasi-periodically below a spin qubit as a result of a bias current. We demonstrate that the relaxation rate of the spin qubit exhibits a pronounced peak if the vortex-crossing frequency matches the transition frequency of the spin qubit and conclude that the magnetic flux $\Phi$ of a single vortex can be obtained by dividing the corresponding voltage along the strip with the transition frequency. We discuss experimental constraints on implementing our proposed setup in spin-triplet candidate materials like UTe$_2$, UPt$_3$, and URhGe.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature anomaly and anisotropy of critical magnetic fields in transition-metal dichalcogenide superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify why spin-singlet superconductivity persists in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides even in high magnetic fields beyond the Pauli limit. The phenomenon called Ising protection is caused by two magnetically active potentials: a Zeeman field and an Ising spin-orbit interaction. These potentials induce two spin-triplet pairing correlations in a spin-singlet superconductor. One belonging to odd-frequency symmetry class arises solely from a Zeeman field and always makes the superconducting state unstable. The other belonging to even-frequency symmetry class arise from the interaction between the two magnetic potentials and eliminate the instability caused by odd-frequency pairs. The presence or absence of even-frequency spin-triplet pairs explains the anisotropy of the Ising protection. The analytical expression of the superfluid weight enables us to conclude that even-frequency spin-triplet Cooper pairs support spin-singlet superconductivity in high Zeeman fields.</description>

      <title>Giant anomalous Josephson effect as a probe of spin texture in topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface states of topological insulators feature chiral spin-momentum locking. When such states are used as weak link between two superconductors, their spin texture gives rise to the anomalous Josephson effect, i.e., to a $\varphi_0$ shift in the current phase relation. In this work, we explore the anomalous Josephson effect in junctions where the weak link is a HgTe nanowire. We observe a giant anomalous $\varphi_0$-shift of the current-phase relation, which we attribute to the fact that HgTe surface states feature a single Fermi contour. Moreover, by varying the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field, we obtain information about the spin texture in momentum space. In particular, we found that the spin is not exactly perpendicular to the momentum, but shows a significant deviation of 19 degrees. Our results establish the anomalous Josephson effect as a sensitive tool to probe the spin texture of chiral 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Microscopic structure of the vortex cores in granular niobium: A coherent quantum puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When macroscopic quantum condensates -- superconductors, superfluids, cold atoms and ions, polaritons etc. -- are put in rotation, a quantum vortex lattice forms inside. In homogeneous type-II superconductors, each vortex has a tiny core where the superconducting gap $\Delta(r)$ is known to smoothly vanish towards the core centre on the scale of the coherence length $\xi$. The cores host quantized quasiparticle energy levels known as Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) bound states [Caroli {\it et al.,} Phys. Lett. v. 9, 307 (1964)]. In pure materials, the spectrum of the low-lying CdGM states has the characteristic level spacing $\sim \Delta_0^2/E_F$, where $E_F$ is the Fermi energy and $\Delta_0$ is the bulk gap. In disordered ones, the CdGM states shift and broaden due to scattering. Here, we show, both experimentally and theoretically, that the situation is completely different in granular Nb films, which are commonly used in superconducting electronics. In these films, in which the grains are smaller than $\xi$, the gap $\Delta$ in the quasiparticle spectrum reduces towards the vortex core centres by discrete jumps at the grain boundaries. The bound states adapt to the local environment and appear at unexpectedly high energies. Both $\Delta(r)$ and bound states form a puzzle-like spatial structure of the core, elements of which are whole grains. Our discovery shakes up the established understanding of the quantum vortex and encourages a reconsideration of the vortex motion and pinning mechanisms in granular superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconducting density of states of nitridized Aluminum thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitride-based superconductors represent a family of superconducting thin film materials displaying higher quality than their corresponding bare superconductor when used in devices for applications such as cosmic radiation sensing. In recent times, Niobium-based and Titanium-based nitrides were used to improve the quality of superconducting devices in quantum technology applications. Recently, nitridized Aluminum (NitrAl) has been found to display higher critical temperatures and enhanced resilience to magnetic fields compared to those of Al, making it a new interesting candidate for superconducting quantum circuit applications. However, the microscopic properties of NitrAl remain highly unexplored. Here we use Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) to measure the superconducting density of states of a thin film sample of nitridized-Aluminum (NitrAl), with a room temperature resistivity between pure Al and fully insulating aluminum nitride. We show that the in-gap density of states is zero up to about $\hbar\omega=250~\mathrm{\mu eV}$ and that there is a distribution of values of the superconducting gap around $\Delta_0=360~\mathrm{\mu eV}$, close to the BCS expectation $\Delta=1.76 k_{\mathrm{B}}T_{\mathrm{c}}$. We also find varying superconducting gap values at the nanometer scale, by approximately 10\%, when probing different regions of the sample. These results suggest a gap which is larger than the one of pure Al, and is spatially more homogeneous than the superconducting gap values often found in thin films. Our work demonstrates that STM is as a powerful tool to screen materials for quantum devices through the measurement of the spatial dependence of the superconducting density of states.</description>

      <title>Fingerprinting superconductors by disentangling Andreev and quasiparticle currents across tunable tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunneling Andreev reflection (TAR) spectroscopy offers a powerful new approach to fingerprint superconducting pairing symmetry at the atomic scale. By leveraging the exponential sensitivity of excess tunneling decay rate to Andreev reflection, TAR robustly distinguishes between s-wave, d-wave, and more complex order parameters, overcoming limitations of traditional conductance-based techniques. Here, using atomistic superconducting transport simulations, we show that the additivity of excess decay rate enables clear separation of Andreev and quasiparticle currents. In particular, we reveal how their competition as well as higher-order scattering processes shape both the decay rate spectra and their dependence on the coupling strength. We show that this phenomenology stems from the fact that Andreev reflection dominates mid-gap conductance for s-wave superconductors, it is suppressed for the d-wave, and it coexists with quasiparticle tunneling in sign-changing symmetries if the expectation value for the superconducting gap remains finite. These distinct spectral fingerprints pave the way for atomically resolved identification of unconventional superconducting states.</description>

      <title>Field induced superconductivity in a magnetically doped two-dimensional crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic field induced superconductivity is a rare property in nature due to the sensitivity of spin-singlet Cooper pairing to time-reversal symmetry breaking perturbations. However, in rare cases, an interplay between magnetic fields and ions can be engineered to bring about superconductivity at finite fields. Here we use ultra-thin LaSb$_2$ doped with dilute Ce paramagnetic impurities to demonstrate a magnetic field-induced superconducting dome in a two-dimensional crystal. The reduced dimensionality of the structure enables the use of an in-plane magnetic field to dynamically suppress spin fluctuations on the Ce-site, which leads to an anomalous enhancement of the critical temperature with increasing field. By modelling the spin scattering dynamics across the experimental parameter space, we reveal insight into the complex nature of paramagnetic impurities in magnetic fields at low temperature, and how their manipulation can result in the ability to tune between competing magnetic pair-breaking regimes. Realizing this physics in a two-dimensional crystalline setting invites the application of similar approaches to unconventional forms of superconductivity while also highlighting new experimental standards which should be employed when studying ultra-thin materials in general.</description>

      <title>Stripe antiferromagnetism and chiral superconductivity in tWSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The layer-dependent Hamiltonians of parallel-stacked MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ homobilayer moir\'e materials are topologically non-trivial, both in real space and in momentum space, and have been shown to support integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, as well as antiferromagnetic and superconducting states. Here, we address the interplay between the antiferromagnetic and superconducting states observed in tWSe$_2$ when the Fermi level is close to its $M$-point van Hove singularity and the displacement field is small. We combine DFT with path-integrals to construct a minimal moir\'e band model that accounts for lattice relaxation along the $c$-axis and perform Hartree-Fock calculations to identify competing charge and spin ordered states. For tWSe$_2$ at $\theta=2.7^\circ$ and $\theta=3.65^\circ$, we find that a layer antiferromagnet (AFM), a stripe spin-density-wave (SDW), and the ferromagnetic Chern insulator (FM) are the primary candidates for the ground state at zero displacement field, and argue that antiferromagnetic spin interactions on the next neighbor bond $J_2$ can induce a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral superconducting state.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Kohn-Luttinger topological superconductivity in bands with nontrivial geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of the electron wavefunction on Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity. The role of the wavefunction is encoded in a complex form factor describing the topology and geometry of the bands. We show that the electron wavefunction significantly impacts the superconducting transition temperature and superconducting order parameter. We illustrate this using the lowest Landau level form factor and find exponential enhancement of Tc for the resulting topological superconductor. We find that the ideal band geometry, which favors a fractional Chern insulator in the flat band limit, has an optimal Tc. Finally, we apply this understanding to a model relevant to rhombohedral graphene multilayers and unravel the importance of the band geometry for achieving robust superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Q-ball mechanism of electron transport properties of high-T$_c$ superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09610v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theory is presented of a mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates, based on the fact that 'nested' fermionic states near the Fermi surface of electrons/holes cause instability with respect to formation of the Q-balls (nontopological solitons) of coherently condensed spin/charge density wave fluctuations (SDW/CDW) with the wave-vector that matches the 'nesting' one. Simultaneously, the 'nested' fermions form superconducting condensate of Cooper/local pairs inside the Q-balls, with Q-ball SDW/CDW field being a 'pairing glue'. Thus, Q-balls possess lower total energy with respect to not condensed thermal SDW/CDW fluctuations and form a Q-balls 'gas' via first order phase transition below a temperature T$^*$. Besides, superconducting condensates inside the Q-balls induce a spectral gap on the nested parts of the Fermi surface, thus creating pseudogap phase. The Q-ball semiclassical field breaks chiral symmetry along the Matsubara time axis in Euclidean space-time possessing conserved Noether "charge" Q that makes the Q-ball volume finite. Prediction of the Q-ball scenario in cuprates is supported by micro X-ray diffraction data in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+y}$ in the pseudogap phase. The Q-balls of baryonic fields were originally predicted in Minkowski space-time by Sidney Coleman. In this paper it is demonstrated analytically that scattering of itinerant fermions on the Q-balls causes linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity, that may explain famous 'Plankian' behavior in the 'strange metal' phase of high-Tc cuprates. Calculated diamagnetic response of Q-balls gas in the 'strange metal' phase and the phase diagram of high-Tc cuprates, with superconducting dome touching the 'strange metal' area at the optimal (holes)doping, are also in qualitative accord with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Braiding: Topological Superconductivity Unlocked under Arbitrary Magnetic Field Directions in Curved Planar Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Abelian statistics of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are central to fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. Planar Josephson junctions provide a particularly versatile platform for realizing robust topological superconductivity hosting MZMs over a broad parameter space. However, it is generally believed that such topological superconductivity is restricted to a narrow range of in-plane magnetic field orientations, posing a major obstacle to scalable and noncollinear junction-network architectures. Here, we uncover that the apparent suppression of MZMs under misaligned fields does not arise from the destruction of topological superconductivity itself, but instead originates from emergent shifted bulk states at other momenta that obscure the global excitation gap and MZMs. By introducing spatial modulations along the junction to scatter and gap out these bulk states, we restore a global topological gap and recover MZMs for arbitrary in-plane magnetic field orientations. Remarkably, such modulations can be naturally realized by transforming a straight junction into a curved geometry, rendering the topological gap robust against field misalignment and enabling MZMs survival in complex junction networks. Building on this robustness, we propose a scalable protocol for MZMs braiding and fusion using gate or superconducting-phase control, opening new routes toward scalable topological quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Bosonic phases across the superconductor-insulator transition in infinite-layer samarium nickelate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity arises from the global phase coherence of Cooper pairs. Modulation of phase coherence leads to quantum phase transitions, serving as an important tool for studying unconventional superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate bosonic phases across the superconductor-insulator transition in infinite-layer nickelate superconducting films by the control of spatially periodic network patterns. Magnetoresistance oscillations with a periodicity of h/2e provide direct evidence of 2e Cooper pairing in nickelates. The phase transition is predominantly driven by enhanced superconducting fluctuations, and Cooper pairs are involved in charge transport across the transition. Notably, we observe two types of anomalous metallic phases, emerging respectively at finite magnetic fields and down to zero magnetic field. They can be characterized by bosonic excitations, suggesting the dynamic roles of vortices in the ground states. Our work establishes nickelates as a key platform for investigating the rich landscape of bosonic phases controlled via the phase coherence of Cooper pairs.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of anomalous temperature dependence of resistivity in V-Al alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$ is a representative example of highly resistive metallic alloys exhibiting a crossover to a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR), known as the Mooij correlation. Despite numerous proposals to explain this anomalous behavior,none have provided a satisfactory quantitative explanation thus far. In this work, we calculate the electrical conductivity using an ab initio methodology that combines the Kubo-Greenwood formalism with the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The temperature dependence of the conductivity is obtained within a CPA-based model of thermal atomic vibrations. Using this approach, we observe the crossover to the negative TCR behavior in V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$, with the temperature coefficient following the Mooij correlation, which matches experimental observations in the intermediate-to-high temperature range. Analysis of the results allows us to clearly identify a non-Boltzmann contribution responsible for this behavior and describe it as a function of temperature and composition.</description>
