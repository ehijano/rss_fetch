      <title>Sparse Recovery for Overcomplete Frames: Sensing Matrices and Recovery Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal models formed as linear combinations of few atoms from an over-complete dictionary or few frame vectors from a redundant frame have become central to many applications in high dimensional signal processing and data analysis. A core question is, by exploiting the intrinsic low dimensional structure of the signal, how to design the sensing process and decoder in a way that the number of measurements is essentially close to the complexity of the signal set. This chapter provides a survey of important results in answering this question, with an emphasis on a basis pursuit like convex optimization decoder that admits a wide range of random sensing matrices. The results are quite established in the case signals are sparse in an orthonormal basis, while the case with frame sparse signals is much less explored. In addition to presenting the latest results on recovery guarantee and how few random heavier-tailed measurements fulfill these recovery guarantees, this chapter also aims to provide some insights in proof techniques. We also take the opportunity of this book chapter to publish an interesting result (Theorem 3.10) about a restricted isometry like property related to a frame.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Assisted Hybrid Model Based Message Passing for Parametric Holographic MIMO Near Field Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input and multiple-output (HMIMO) is a promising technology with the potential to achieve high energy and spectral efficiencies, enhance system capacity and diversity, etc. In this work, we address the challenge of HMIMO near field (NF) channel estimation, which is complicated by the intricate model introduced by the dyadic Green's function. Despite its complexity, the channel model is governed by a limited set of parameters. This makes parametric channel estimation highly attractive, offering substantial performance enhancements and enabling the extraction of valuable sensing parameters, such as user locations, which are particularly beneficial in mobile networks. However, the relationship between these parameters and channel gains is nonlinear and compounded by integration, making the estimation a formidable task. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel neural network (NN) assisted hybrid method. With the assistance of NNs, we first develop a novel hybrid channel model with a significantly simplified expression compared to the original one, thereby enabling parametric channel estimation. Using the readily available training data derived from the original channel model, the NNs in the hybrid channel model can be effectively trained offline. Then, building upon this hybrid channel model, we formulate the parametric channel estimation problem with a probabilistic framework and design a factor graph representation for Bayesian estimation. Leveraging the factor graph representation and unitary approximate message passing (UAMP), we develop an effective message passing-based Bayesian channel estimation algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Protograph-Based Batched Network Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batched network codes (BNCs) are a low-complexity solution for communication through networks with packet loss. Although their belief propagation (BP) performance is proved to approach capacity in the asymptotic regime, there is no evidence indicating that their BP performance is as good as expected in the finite-length regime. In this paper, we propose a protograph-based construction for BNCs, referred to as protograph-based BNCs (P-BNCs), which significantly differs from existing BNCs in three aspects: 1) Unlike traditional constructions where the degree of variable nodes is random, P-BNCs have a highly structured Tanner graph with specified degree distributions for both variable nodes and check nodes. 2) Traditional BNCs use a fixed degree distribution to generate all batches, making their performance highly sensitive to channel conditions, but P-BNCs achieve good performance under varying channel conditions due to their rate-compatible structures. 3) The construction of PBNCs takes into account joint BP decoding with a sparse precode, whereas traditional constructions typically do not consider a precode, or assume the presence of a precode that can recover a certain fraction of erasures. Thanks to these three improvements, P-BNCs not only have higher achievable rates under varying channel conditions, but more importantly, their finite-length BP performance is significantly improved.</description>

      <title>ESPARGOS: Phase-Coherent WiFi CSI Datasets for Wireless Sensing Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of WiFi signals to sense the physical environment is gaining popularity, with some common applications being motion detection and transmitter localization. Standard-compliant WiFi provides a cost effective, easy and backward-compatible approach to Joint Communication and Sensing and enables a seamless transfer of results from experiments to practical applications. However, most WiFi sensing research is conducted on channel state information (CSI) data from current-generation devices, which are usually not meant for sensing applications and thus lack sufficient spatial diversity or phase synchronization. With ESPARGOS, we previously developed a phase-coherent, real-time capable many-antenna WiFi channel sounder specifically for wireless sensing. We describe how we use ESPARGOS to capture large CSI datasets that we make publicly available. The datasets are extensively documented and labeled, for example with information from reference positioning systems, enabling data-driven and machine learning-based research.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Mutual Interference in Uplink ISAC Receivers: A Projection Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual function radar and communication (DFRC) is a promising research direction within integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), improving hardware and spectrum efficiency by merging sensing and communication (S&amp;C) functionalities into a shared platform. However, the DFRC receiver (DFRC-R) is tasked with both uplink communication signal detection and simultaneously target-related parameter estimation from the echoes, leading to issues with mutual interference. In this paper, a projection-based scheme is proposed to equivalently transform the joint signal detection and target estimation problem into a joint signal detection process across multiple snapshots. Compared with conventional successive interference cancellation (SIC) schemes, our proposed approach achieves a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and a higher ergodic rate when the radar signal is non-negligible. Nonetheless, it introduces an ill-conditioned signal detection problem, which is addressed using a non-linear detector. By jointly processing an increased number of snapshots, the proposed scheme can achieve high S&amp;C performance simultaneously.</description>

      <title>$\varepsilon$-MSR Codes for Any Set of Helper Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes are a class of maximum distance separable (MDS) array codes capable of repairing any single failed node by downloading the minimum amount of information from each of the helper nodes. However, MSR codes require large sub-packetization levels, which hinders their usefulness in practical settings. This led to the development of another class of MDS array codes called $\varepsilon$-MSR codes, for which the repair information downloaded from each helper node is at most a factor of $(1+\varepsilon)$ from the minimum amount for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. The advantage of $\varepsilon$-MSR codes over MSR codes is their small sub-packetization levels. In previous constructions of epsilon-MSR codes, however, several specific nodes are required to participate in the repair of a failed node, which limits the performance of the code in cases where these nodes are not available. In this work, we present a construction of $\varepsilon$-MSR codes without this restriction. For a code with $n$ nodes, out of which $k$ store uncoded information, and for any number $d$ of helper nodes ($k\le d&lt;n$), the repair of a failed node can be done by contacting any set of $d$ surviving nodes. Our construction utilizes group algebra techniques, and requires linear field size. We also generalize the construction to MDS array codes capable of repairing $h$ failed nodes using $d$ helper nodes with a slightly sub-optimal download from each helper node, for all $h \le r$ and $k \le d \le n-h$ simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trace Distance and Fidelity Estimations for Pure Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the distinguishability between quantum states is a basic problem in quantum information theory. In this paper, we develop optimal quantum algorithms that estimate both the trace distance and the (square root) fidelity between pure states to within additive error $\varepsilon$ using $\Theta(1/\varepsilon)$ queries to their state-preparation circuits, quadratically improving the long-standing folklore $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$. At the heart of our construction, is an algorithmic tool for quantum square root amplitude estimation, which generalizes the well-known quantum amplitude estimation.</description>

      <title>Generic Reed-Solomon Codes Achieve List-decoding Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05256v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Brakensiek, Gopi and Makam introduced higher order MDS codes as a generalization of MDS codes. An order-$\ell$ MDS code, denoted by $\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$, has the property that any $\ell$ subspaces formed from columns of its generator matrix intersect as minimally as possible. An independent work by Roth defined a different notion of higher order MDS codes as those achieving a generalized singleton bound for list-decoding. In this work, we show that these two notions of higher order MDS codes are (nearly) equivalent.
  We also show that generic Reed-Solomon codes are $\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$ for all $\ell$, relying crucially on the GM-MDS theorem which shows that generator matrices of generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve any possible zero pattern. As a corollary, this implies that generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve list decoding capacity. More concretely, we show that, with high probability, a random Reed-Solomon code of rate $R$ over an exponentially large field is list decodable from radius $1-R-\epsilon$ with list size at most $\frac{1-R-\epsilon}{\epsilon}$, resolving a conjecture of Shangguan and Tamo.</description>

      <title>Smart Helper-Aided F-RANs: Improving Delay and Reducing Fronthaul Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In traditional Fog-Radio Access Networks (F-RANs), enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs) are connected to a macro base station (MBS) through fronthaul links. Deploying a massive number of eRRHs is not always feasible due to site constraints and the cost of fronthaul links. This paper introduces an innovative concept of using smart helpers (SHs) in F-RANs. These SHs do not require fronthaul links and listen to the nearby eRRHs' communications. Then, they smartly select and cache popular content. This capability enables SHs to serve users with frequent on-demand service requests potentially. As such, network operators have the flexibility to easily deploy SHs in various scenarios, such as dense urban areas and temporary public events, to expand their F-RANs and improve the quality of service (QoS). To study the performance of the proposed SH-aided F-RAN, we formulate an optimization problem of minimizing the average transmission delay that jointly optimizes cache resources and user scheduling. To tackle the formulated problem, we develop an innovative multi-stage algorithm that uses a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Various performance measures, e.g., the average transmission delay, fronthaul load, and cache hit rate of the proposed SH-aided F-RAN are evaluated numerically and compared with those of traditional F-RANs.</description>

      <title>On Local Mutual-Information Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local mutual-information privacy (LMIP) is a privacy notion that aims to quantify the reduction of uncertainty about the input data when the output of a privacy-preserving mechanism is revealed. We study the relation of LMIP with local differential privacy (LDP), the de facto standard notion of privacy in context-independent (CI) scenarios, and with local information privacy (LIP), the state-of-the-art notion for context-dependent settings. We establish explicit conversion rules, i.e., bounds on the privacy parameters for an LMIP mechanism to also satisfy LDP/LIP, and vice versa. We use our bounds to formally verify that LMIP is a weak privacy notion. We also show that uncorrelated Gaussian noise is the best-case noise in terms of CI-LMIP if both the input data and the noise are subject to an average power constraint.</description>

      <title>Massive Digital Over-the-Air Computation for Communication-Efficient Federated Edge Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) is a promising technology converging communication and computation over wireless networks, which can be particularly effective in model training, inference, and more emerging edge intelligence applications. AirComp relies on uncoded transmission of individual signals, which are added naturally over the multiple access channel thanks to the superposition property of the wireless medium. Despite significantly improved communication efficiency, how to accommodate AirComp in the existing and future digital communication networks, that are based on discrete modulation schemes, remains a challenge. This paper proposes a massive digital AirComp (MD-AirComp) scheme, that leverages an unsourced massive access protocol, to enhance compatibility with both current and next-generation wireless networks. MD-AirComp utilizes vector quantization to reduce the uplink communication overhead, and employs shared quantization and modulation codebooks. At the receiver, we propose a near-optimal approximate message passing-based algorithm to compute the model aggregation results from the superposed sequences, which relies on estimating the number of devices transmitting each code sequence, rather than trying to decode the messages of individual transmitters. We apply MD-AirComp to the federated edge learning (FEEL), and show that it significantly accelerates FEEL convergence compared to state-of-the-art while using the same amount of communication resources. To support further research and ensure reproducibility, we have made our code available at https://github.com/liqiao19/MD-AirComp.</description>

      <title>Movable Antennas Meet Intelligent Reflecting Surface: When Do We Need Movable Antennas?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA)/fluid antenna (FA) techniques have both received increasing attention in the realm of wireless communications due to their ability to reconfigure and improve wireless channel conditions. In this paper, we investigate the integration of MAs/FAs into an IRS-assisted wireless communication system. In particular, we consider the downlink transmission from a multi-MA base station (BS) to a single-antenna user with the aid of an IRS, aiming to maximize the user's received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), by jointly optimizing the BS/IRS active/passive beamforming and the MAs' positions. Due to the similar capability of MAs and IRS for channel reconfiguration, we first conduct theoretical analysis of the performance gain of MAs over conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) under the line-of-sight (LoS) BS-IRS channel and derive the conditions under which the performance gain becomes more or less significant. Next, to solve the received SNR maximization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that decomposes it into two subproblems and solve them alternately. Numerical results are provided to validate our analytical results and evaluate the performance gains of MAs over FPAs under different setups.</description>

      <title>Inferior Myocardial Infarction Detection from lead II of ECG: A Gramian Angular Field-based 2D-CNN Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13011v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for inferior myocardial infarction (MI) detection using lead II of electrocardiogram (ECG). We evaluate our proposed method on a public dataset, namely, Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) ECG dataset from Physionet. Under our proposed method, we first clean the noisy ECG signals using db4 wavelet, followed by an R-peak detection algorithm to segment the ECG signals into beats. We then translate the ECG timeseries dataset to an equivalent dataset of gray-scale images using Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF) and Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF) operations. Subsequently, the gray-scale images are fed into a custom two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) which efficiently differentiates between a healthy subject and a subject with MI. Our proposed approach achieves an average classification accuracy of 99.68%, 99.80%, 99.82%, and 99.84% under GASF dataset with noise and baseline wander, GADF dataset with noise and baseline wander, GASF dataset with noise and baseline wander removed, and GADF dataset with noise and baseline wander removed, respectively. Most importantly, this work opens the floor for innovation in wearable devices to measure lead II ECG (e.g., by a smart watch worn on right wrist, along with a smart patch on left leg), in order to do accurate, real-time and early detection of inferior wall MI.</description>

      <title>Shot Segmentation Based on Von Neumann Entropy for Key Frame Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video key frame extraction is important in various fields, such as video summary, retrieval, and compression. Therefore, we suggest a video key frame extraction algorithm based on shot segmentation using Von Neumann entropy. The segmentation of shots is achieved through the computation of Von Neumann entropy of the similarity matrix among frames within the video sequence. The initial frame of each shot is selected as key frames, which combines the temporal sequence information of frames. The experimental results show the extracted key frames can fully and accurately represent the original video content while minimizing the number of repeated frames.</description>
