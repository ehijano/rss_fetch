      <title>Anisotropic mesh adaptation for unsteady two-phase flow simulation with the Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an anisotropic mesh adaptation procedure based on Riemannian metrics for the simulation of two-phase incompressible flows with non-matching densities. The system dynamics are governed by the Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations, discretized with mixed finite elements and implicit time-stepping. Spatial accuracy is controlled throughout the simulation by the \emph{global transient fixed-point method} from Alauzet \emph{et al.}, in which the simulation time is divided into sub-intervals, each associated with an adapted anisotropic mesh. The simulation is run in a fixed-point loop until convergence of each mesh--solution pair. Each iteration takes advantage of the previously computed solution and accurately predicts the flow variations. This ensures that the mesh always captures the fluid-fluid interface, and allows for a dynamic control of the interface thickness at a fraction of the computational cost compared to uniform or isotropic grids. Moreover, using a modest number of time sub-intervals reduces the transfer error from one mesh to another, which would otherwise eventually spoil the numerical solution. The overall adaptive procedure is verified with manufactured solutions and the well-known rising bubble benchmark.</description>

      <title>An Introductory Guide to Koopman Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman operators provide a linear framework for data-driven analyses of nonlinear dynamical systems, but their infinite-dimensional nature presents major computational challenges. In this article, we offer an introductory guide to Koopman learning, emphasizing rigorously convergent data-driven methods for forecasting and spectral analysis. We provide a unified account of error control via residuals in both finite- and infinite-dimensional settings, an elementary proof of convergence for generalized Laplace analysis -- a variant of filtered power iteration that works for operators with continuous spectra and no spectral gaps -- and review state-of-the-art approaches for computing continuous spectra and spectral measures. The goal is to provide both newcomers and experts with a clear, structured overview of reliable data-driven techniques for Koopman spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning and Reduced-Order Modeling of Navier-Stokes Equations in Complex Porous Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations within the complex microstructure of a porous material. Discretizing the equations on a fine grid using a staggered (e.g., marker-and-cell, mixed FEM) scheme results in a nonlinear residual. Adopting the Newton method, a linear system must be solved at each iteration, which is large, ill-conditioned, and has a saddle-point structure. This demands an iterative (e.g., Krylov) solver, that requires preconditioning to ensure rapid convergence. We propose two monolithic \textit{algebraic} preconditioners, $a\mathrm{PLMM_{NS}}$ and $a\mathrm{PNM_{NS}}$, that are generalizations of previously proposed forms by the authors for the Stokes equations ($a\mathrm{PLMM_{S}}$ and $a\mathrm{PNM_{S}}$). The former is based on the pore-level multiscale method (PLMM) and the latter on the pore network model (PNM), both successful approximate solvers. We also formulate faster-converging geometric preconditioners $g\mathrm{PLMM}$ and $g\mathrm{PNM}$, which impose $\partial_n\boldsymbol{u}\!=\!0$ (zero normal-gradient of velocity) exactly at subdomain interfaces. Finally, we propose an accurate coarse-scale solver for the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations based on $g\mathrm{PLMM}$, capable of computing approximate solutions orders of magnitude faster. We benchmark our preconditioners against state-of-the-art block preconditioners and show $g\mathrm{PLMM}$ is the best-performing one, followed closely by $a\mathrm{PLMM_{S}}$ for steady-state flow and $a\mathrm{PLMM_{NS}}$ for transient flow. All preconditioners can be built and applied on parallel machines.</description>

      <title>Nonconforming Linear Element Method for a Generalized Tensor-Valued Stokes Equation with Application to the Triharmonic Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonconforming linear element method is developed for a three-dimensional generalized tensor-valued Stokes equation associated with the Hessian complex in this paper. A discrete Helmholtz decomposition for the piecewise constant space of traceless tensors is established, ensuring the well-posedness of the nonconforming method, and optimal error estimates are derived. Building on this, a low-order decoupled finite element method for the three-dimensional triharmonic equation is constructed by combining the Morley-Wang-Xu element methods for the biharmonic subproblems with the proposed nonconforming linear element method. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Trace and Diagonal Estimator for Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the trace and diagonal entries of an N-order tensor (where $N \geq 2$) under the framework where the tensor can only be accessed through tensor-vector multiplication. The aim is to estimate the tensor's diagonal entries and trace by minimizing the number of tensor-vector queries. The seminal work of Hutchinson and its extended version due to Bekas et al. give unbiased estimates of the trace and diagonal elements of a given matrix, respectively, using matrix-vector queries. However, to the best of our knowledge, no analogous results are known for estimating the trace and diagonal entries of higher-order tensors using tensor-vector queries. This paper addresses this gap and presents unbiased estimators for the trace and diagonal entries of a tensor under this model. Our proposed methods can be seen as generalizations of Hutchinson's and Bekas et al.'s estimators and reduce to their estimators when N = 2. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of our proposals and complement it with supporting simulations.</description>

      <title>Stable neural networks and connections to continuous dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of instabilities, for example in the form of adversarial examples, has given rise to a highly active area of research concerning itself with understanding and enhancing the stability of neural networks. We focus on a popular branch within this area which draws on connections to continuous dynamical systems and optimal control, giving a bird's eye view of this area. We identify and describe the fundamental concepts that underlie much of the existing work in this area. Following this, we go into more detail on a specific approach to designing stable neural networks, developing the theoretical background and giving a description of how these networks can be implemented. We provide code that implements the approach that can be adapted and extended by the reader. The code further includes a notebook with a fleshed-out toy example on adversarial robustness of image classification that can be run without heavy requirements on the reader's computer. We finish by discussing this toy example so that the reader can interactively follow along on their computer. This work will be included as a chapter of a book on scientific machine learning, which is currently under revision and aimed at students.</description>

      <title>Davis-Kahan Theorem under a moderate gap condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Davis-Kahan theorem provides an efficient bound on the perturbation of eigenspaces of a matrix under a large (eigenvalue) gap condition. In this paper, we consider the case when the gap is moderate. Using a bootstrapping argument, we obtain a new bound which is efficient when the perturbation matrix is uncorrelated to the ground matrix. We believe that this bound is sharp up to a logarithmic term.</description>

      <title>Finite element analysis of density estimation using preintegration for elliptic PDE with random input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyses the finite element component of the error when using preintegration to approximate the cdf and pdf for uncertainty quantification (UQ) problems involving elliptic PDEs with random inputs. It is a follow up to Gilbert, Kuo, Srikumar, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 63 (2025), pp. 1025-1054, which introduced a method of density estimation for a class of UQ problems, based on computing the integral formulations of the cdf and pdf by performing an initial smoothing preintegration step and then applying a quasi-Monte Carlo quadrature rule to approximate the remaining high-dimensional integral. That paper focussed on the quadrature aspect of the method, whereas this paper studies the spatial discretisation of the PDE using finite element methods. First, it is shown that the finite element approximation satisfies the required assumptions for the preintegration theory, including the important monotonicity condition. Then the finite element error is analysed and finally, the combined finite element and quasi-Monte Carlo error is bounded. It is shown that under similar assumptions, the cdf and pdf can be approximated with the same rate of convergence as the much simpler problem of computing expected values.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Finite Expression Method for PDEs with Oscillatory Solutions on Complex Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with highly oscillatory solutions on complex domains remains a challenging and important problem. High-frequency oscillations and intricate geometries often result in prohibitively expensive representations for traditional numerical methods and lead to difficult optimization landscapes for machine learning-based approaches. In this work, we introduce an enhanced Finite Expression Method (FEX) designed to address these challenges with improved accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency. The proposed framework incorporates three key innovations: a symbolic spectral composition module that enables FEX to learn and represent multiscale oscillatory behavior; a redesigned linear input layer that significantly expands the expressivity of the model; and an eigenvalue formulation that extends FEX to a new class of problems involving eigenvalue PDEs. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that FEX accurately resolves oscillatory PDEs on domains containing multiple holes of varying shapes and sizes. Compared with existing neural network-based solvers, FEX achieves substantially higher accuracy while yielding interpretable, closed-form solutions that expose the underlying structure of the problem. These advantages, often absent in conventional finite element, finite difference, and black-box neural approaches, highlight FEX as a powerful and transparent framework for solving complex PDEs.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Tensor Completion via Trace-Regularized Fully-Connected Tensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fully-connected tensor network (FCTN) decomposition has gained prominence in the field of tensor completion owing to its powerful capacity to capture the low-rank characteristics of tensors. Nevertheless, the recovery of local details in the reconstructed tensor still leaves scope for enhancement. In this paper, we propose efficient tensor completion model that incorporates trace regularization within the FCTN decomposition framework. The trace regularization is constructed based on the mode-$k$ unfolding of the FCTN factors combined with periodically modified negative laplacian. The trace regularization promotes the smoothness of the FCTN factors through discrete second-order derivative penalties, thereby enhancing the continuity and local recovery performance of the reconstructed tensor. To solve the proposed model, we develop an efficient algorithm within the proximal alternating minimization (PAM) framework and theoretically prove its convergence. To reduce the runtime of the proposed algorithm, we design an intermediate tensor reuse mechanism that can decrease runtime by 10\%-30\% without affecting image recovery, with more significant improvements for larger-scale data. A comprehensive complexity analysis reveals that the mechanism attains a reduced computational complexity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Some aspects of neural network parameter optimization for joint inversion of gravitational and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the optimization of a neural network previously developed by the authors for the joint inversion of 3D gravitational and magnetic fields in the context of mineral exploration. The distinctive feature of this neural network is that it solves ill-posed (ill-conditioned) inverse problems. The neural network implements a special two-level algorithm. The lower level of the algorithm uses two neural networks with equivalent architectures. The first of them computes the gravitational field sources in a given domain from measurements of this field on a remote surface. The second neural network processes magnetic field measured on the same surface to find magnetic sources in the same domain. The found source distributions are used at the upper level of the algorithm to calculate their structural residual, which determines the degree of difference (closeness) of their geometries. As a result, minimizing this residual, when training a neural network at the upper level, implements a computational algorithm that yields geometrically close source distributions of different fields. The article examines in detail the possibilities of optimizing some elements of the neural networks and the algorithms used (datasets, training process, specific form of loss functions, etc.) Test calculations for model problem demonstrate high quality of joint inversion by our optimized neural networks approach. Calculations were also carried out for the joint processing of real-feald data from gravity and magnetic exploration in Jussara region, Goias State, Brazil. The article also considers the issue of determining in joint field inversion not only the geometric distribution of sources, but also their physical intensities.</description>

      <title>Data-driven dimensionally decomposed generalized polynomial chaos expansion for forward uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensionally decomposed generalized polynomial chaos expansion (DD-GPCE) efficiently performs forward uncertainty quantification (UQ) in complex engineering systems with high-dimensional random inputs of arbitrary distributions. However, constructing the measure-consistent orthonormal polynomial bases in DD-GPCE requires prior knowledge of input distributions, which is often unavailable in practice. This work introduces a data-driven DD-GPCE method that eliminates the need for such prior knowledge, extending its applicability to UQ with high-dimensional inputs. Input distributions are inferred directly from sample data using smoothed-bootstrap kernel density estimation (KDE), while the DD-GPCE framework enables KDE to handle high-dimensional inputs through low-dimensional marginal estimation. We then use the estimated input distributions to perform a whitening transformation via Monte Carlo Simulation, which enables generation of measure-consistent orthonormal basis functions. We demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method in both mathematical examples and stochastic dynamic analysis for a practical three-dimensional mobility design involving twenty random inputs. The results indicate that the proposed method produces more accurate estimates of the output mean and variance compared to the conventional data-driven approach that assumes Gaussian input distributions.</description>

      <title>Surface layers and linearized water waves: a boundary integral equation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of surface waves traveling along the boundary of a liquid medium are changed by the presence of floating plates and membranes, contributing to a number of important phenomena in a wide range of applications. Mathematically, if the fluid is only partly covered by a plate or membrane, the order of derivatives of the surface-boundary conditions jump between regions of the surface. In this work, we consider a general class of problems for infinite depth linearized surface waves in which the plate or membrane has a compact hole or multiple holes. For this class of problems, we describe a general integral equation approach, and for two important examples, the partial membrane and the polynya, we analyze the resulting boundary integral equations. In particular, we show that they are Fredholm second kind and discuss key properties of their solutions. We develop flexible and fast algorithms for discretizing and solving these equations, and demonstrate their robustness and scalability in resolving surface wave phenomena through several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>HoSGFEM: High-order stable generalized finite element method for elliptic interface problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Generalized Finite Element Method (GFEM) is an effective unfitted numerical method for handling interface problems. By augmenting the standard FEM space with an appropriate enrichment space, GFEM can accurately capture C^0 solutions across the interfaces. While numerous GFEMs for interface problems have been studied, establishing a stable high-order GFEM with optimal convergence rates and robust system conditioning remains a challenge. The highest known order of two was established by Zhang and Babu\v{s}ka (SGFEM2, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 363 (2020), 112889). In this paper, we propose a unified enrichment space construction and establish arbitrary high-order stable GFEMs (HoSGFEM) for elliptic interface problems. The main idea distinguishes itself from Zhang and Babu\v{s}ka's SGFEM2 substantially and it is twofold: a) we construct dimensionality-reduced auxiliary locally supported piecewise polynomials that satisfy the partition of unity property for elements containing interfaces; b) we construct the enrichment scheme based on d{1,(x-x_c^e),...,(y-y_c^e)^{p-1}} (d is the distance function; (x_c^e, y_c^e) is the center of the element containing interface, thus element-based) for arbitrary p-th order elements instead of d, d{1,x,y} or d{1,x,y,x^2,xy,y^2} (global functions) for p=1,2 in the literature. This idea results in an enrichment space that has a large angle with the standard FEM space, leading to the stability of the method with system condition number growing in order O(h^{-2}). We establish optimal convergence rates for HoSGFEM solutions under the proposed construction. Various numerical experiments with both straight and curved interfaces demonstrate the optimal convergence, FEM-comparable system condition number with O(h^{-2}) growth, and robustness as element boundaries approach interfaces.</description>

      <title>Rational Approximation via p-AAA on Scattered Data Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many algorithms for approximating data with rational functions are built on interpolation or least-squares approximation. Inspired by the adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm for the univariate case, the parametric adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (p-AAA) algorithm extends this idea to the multivariate setting, combining least-squares and interpolation formulations into a single effective approximation procedure. In its original formulation p-AAA operates on grid data, requiring access to function samples at every combination of discrete sampling points in each variable. In this work we extend the p-AAA algorithm to scattered data sets, without requiring uniform/grid sampling. In other words, our proposed p-AAA formulation operates on a set of arbitrary sampling points and is not restricted to a grid structure for the sampled data. Towards this goal, we introduce several formulations for rational least-squares optimization problems that incorporate interpolation conditions via constraints. We analyze the structure of the resulting optimization problems and introduce structured matrices whose singular value decompositions yield closed-form solutions to the underlying least-squares problems. Several examples illustrate computational aspects and the effectiveness of our proposed procedure.</description>

      <title>Validity of relaxation models arising from numerical schemes for hyperbolic-parabolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with relaxation models arising from numerical schemes for hyperbolic-parabolic systems. Such models are a hyperbolic system with both the hyperbolic part and the stiff source term involving a small positive parameter, and thus are endowed with complicated multiscale properties. Relaxation models are the basis of constructing corresponding numerical schemes and a critical issue is the convergence of their solutions to those of the given target systems, the justification of which is still lacking. In this work, we employ the recently proposed theory for general hyperbolic relaxation systems to validate relaxation models in numerical schemes of hyperbolic-parabolic systems. By verifying the convergence criteria, we demonstrate the convergence, and thereby the approximation validity, of five representative relaxation models, providing a solid basis for the effectiveness of the corresponding numerical schemes. Moreover, we propose a new relaxation model for the general multi-dimensional hyperbolic-parabolic system. With some mild assumptions on the system, we show that the proposed model satisfies the convergence criteria. We remark that the existing relaxation models are constructed only for a special case of hyperbolic-parabolic system, while our new relaxation model is valid for general systems.</description>

      <title>MultiLevel Variational MultiScale (ML-VMS) framework for large-scale simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the MultiLevel Variational MultiScale (ML-VMS) method, a novel approach that seamlessly integrates a multilevel mesh strategy into the Variational Multiscale (VMS) framework. A key feature of the ML-VMS method is the use of the Convolutional Hierarchical Deep Neural Network (C-HiDeNN) as the approximation basis. The framework employs a coarse mesh throughout the domain, with localized fine meshes placed only in subdomains of high interest, such as those surrounding a source. Solutions at different resolutions are robustly coupled through the variational weak form and interface conditions. Compared to existing multilevel methods, ML-VMS (1) can couple an arbitrary number of mesh levels across different scales using variational multiscale framework; (2) allows approximating functions with arbitrary orders with linear finite element mesh due to the C-HiDeNN basis; (3) is supported by a rigorous theoretical error analysis; (4) features several tunable hyperparameters (e.g., order $p$, patch size $s$) with a systematic guide for their selection. We first show the theoretical error estimates of ML-VMS. Then through numerical examples, we demonstrate that ML-VMS with the C-HiDeNN takes less computational time than the FEM basis given comparable accuracy. Furthermore, we incorporate a space-time reduced-order model (ROM) based on C-HiDeNN-Tensor Decomposition (TD) into the ML-VMS framework. For a large-scale single-track laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) transient heat transfer problem that is equivalent to a full-order finite element model with $10^{10}$ spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs), our 3-level ML-VMS C-HiDeNN-TD achieves an approximately 5,000x speedup on a single CPU over a single-level linear FEM-TD ROM.</description>

      <title>Effective numerical integration on complex shaped elements by discrete signed measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a cheap and stable approach to polynomial moment-based compression of multivariate measures by discrete signed measures. The method is based on the availability of an orthonormal basis and a low-cardinality algebraic quadrature formula for an auxiliary measure in a bounding set. Differently from other approaches, no conditioning issue arises since no matrix factorization or inversion is needed. We provide bounds for the sum of the absolute values of the signed measure weights, and we make two examples: efficient quadrature on curved planar elements with spline boundary (in view of the application to high-order FEM/VEM), and compression of QMC integration on 3D elements with complex shape.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Function Iteration Method: A New Framework for Solving Periodic Solutions of Non-linear and Non-smooth Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing accurate periodic responses in strongly nonlinear or even non-smooth vibration systems remains a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics. Existing numerical methods, such as the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM) and the Shooting Method (SM), have achieved notable success but face intrinsic limitations when applied to complex, high-dimensional, or non-smooth systems. A key bottleneck is the construction of Jacobian matrices for the associated algebraic equations; although numerical approximations can avoid explicit analytical derivation, they become unreliable and computationally expensive for large-scale or non-smooth problems. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes the Perturbation Function Iteration Method (PFIM), a novel framework built upon perturbation theory. PFIM transforms nonlinear equations into time-varying linear systems and solves their periodic responses via a piecewise constant approximation scheme. Unlike HBM, PFIM avoids the trade-off between Fourier truncation errors and the Gibbs phenomenon in non-smooth problems by employing a basis-free iterative formulation, while significantly simplifying the Jacobian computation. Extensive numerical studies, including self-excited systems, parameter continuation, systems with varying smoothness, and high-dimensional finite element models, demonstrate that PFIM achieves quadratic convergence in smooth systems and maintains robust linear convergence in highly non-smooth cases. Moreover, comparative analyses show that, for high-dimensional non-smooth systems, PFIM attains solutions of comparable accuracy with computational costs up to two orders of magnitude lower than HBM. These results indicate that PFIM provides a robust and efficient alternative for periodic response analysis in complex nonlinear dynamical systems, with strong potential for practical engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Multiscale modeling for contact problem with high-contrast heterogeneous coefficients with primary-dual formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel iterative multiscale framework for solving high-contrast contact problems of Signorini type. The method integrates the constrained energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) with a primal-dual active set strategy derived from semismooth Newton methods. First, local spectral problems are employed to construct an auxiliary multiscale space, from which energy minimizing multiscale basis functions are derived on oversampled domains, yielding a contrast-robust reduced-order approximation of the underlying partial differential equation. The multiscale bases are updated iteratively, but only at contact boundary, during the active set evolution process. Rigorous analysis is provided to establish error estimates and finite step convergence of the iterative scheme. Numerical experiments on heterogeneous media with high-contrast coefficients demonstrate that the proposed approach is both robust and efficient in capturing fine-scale features near contact boundaries.</description>

      <title>Numerical Spectrum Linking: Identification of Governing PDE via Koopman-Chebyshev Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical framework is proposed for identifying partial differential equations (PDEs) governing dynamical systems directly from their observation data using Chebyshev polynomial approximation. In contrast to data-driven approaches such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which approximate the Koopman operator without a clear connection to differential operators, the proposed method constructs finite-dimensional Koopman matrices by projecting the dynamics onto a Chebyshev basis, thereby capturing both differential and nonlinear terms. This establishes a numerical link between the Koopman and differential operators. Numerical experiments on benchmark dynamical systems confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the approach, underscoring its potential for interpretable operator learning. The framework also lays a foundation for future integration with symbolic regression, enabling the construction of explicit mathematical models directly from data.</description>

      <title>High-order Computation of Floquet Multipliers and Subspaces using Multistep Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient computation of Floquet multipliers and subspaces is essential for analyzing limit cycle in dynamical systems and periodic steady state in Radio Frequency (RF) simulation. This problem is typically addressed by solving a periodic linear eigenvalue problem, which is discretized from the linear periodic time-varying system using one-step methods. The backward Euler method offers a computationally inexpensive overall workflow but has limited accuracy. In contrast, one-step collocation methods achieve higher accuracy through over-sampling, explicit matrix construction, and condensation, thus become costly for large-scale sparse cases. We apply multistep methods to derive a periodic polynomial eigenvalue problem, which introduces additional spurious eigenvalues. Under mild smoothness assumptions, we prove that as the stepsize decreases, the computed Floquet multipliers and their associated invariant subspace converge with higher order, while the spurious eigenvalues converge to zero. To efficiently solve large-scale problems, we propose pTOAR, a memory-efficient iterative algorithm for computing the dominant Floquet eigenpairs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that multistep methods achieves high order accuracy, while its computational and memory costs are only marginally higher than those of the backward Euler method.</description>

      <title>Deep Forward-Backward Dynamic Programming Schemes for High-Dimensional Semilinear Nonlocal PDEs and FBSDE with Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new deep learning algorithm for solving high-dimensional parabolic integro-differential equations (PIDEs) and forward-backward stochastic differential equations with jumps (FBSDEJs). This novel algorithm can be viewed as an extension and generalization of the DBDP2 scheme and a dynamic programming version of the forward-backward algorithm proposed recently for high-dimensional semilinear PDEs and semilinear PIDEs, respectively. Different from the DBDP2 scheme for semilinear PDEs, our algorithm approximate simultaneously the solution and the integral kernel by deep neural networks, while the gradient of the solution is approximated by numerical differential techniques. The related error estimates for the integral kernel approximation play key roles in deriving error estimates for the novel algorithm. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical results and verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Modeling a Smooth Surface by a Constrained Biharmonic Equation with Application in Soil Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for mathematical modelling of surfaces conditioned on empirical data. It is based on solving a discrete biharmonic equation over a domain with given inner point and inner curve data. The inner curve data is used to model boundary values while the inner point data is used for modeling a load vector with the goal to generate a smooth surface. The construction of boundary data is an ill-posed problem, for which a special regularization approach is suggested.
  The method is designed for surface construction problems with a very limited amount of measured data. In the paper we apply the method by using empirical data of soil thickness and geological maps indicating exposed bedrock regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-order numerical schemes for linear stochastic heat and wave equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions, driven by additive noise. Standard Euler schemes for SPDEs are limited to an order convergence between 1/2 and 1 due to the low temporal regularity of noise. For the stochastic heat equation, a modified Crank-Nicolson scheme with proper numerical quadrature rule for the noise term in its reformulation as random PDE achieves a strong convergence rate of 3/2. For the stochastic wave equation with additive noise a corresponding approach leads to a scheme which is of order 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is impossible to recover a vector from $\mathbb{R}^m$ with less than $m$ linear measurements, even if the measurements are chosen adaptively. Recently, it has been shown that one can recover vectors from $\mathbb{R}^m$ with arbitrary precision using only $O(\log m)$ continuous (even Lipschitz) adaptive measurements, resulting in an exponential speed-up of continuous information compared to linear information for various approximation problems. In this note, we characterize the quality of optimal (dis-)continuous information that is disturbed by deterministic noise in terms of entropy numbers. This shows that in the presence of noise the potential gain of continuous over linear measurements is limited, but significant in some cases.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of discontinuous Galerkin with a high order embedded boundary treatment for linear hyperbolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedded, or immersed, approaches have the goal of reducing to the minimum the computational costs associated with the generation of body-fitted meshes by only employing fixed, possibly Cartesian, meshes over which complex boundaries can move freely. However, this boundary treatment introduces a geometrical error of the order of the mesh size that, if not treated properly, can spoil the global accuracy of a high order discretization, herein based on discontinuous Galerkin. The shifted boundary polynomial correction was proposed as a simplified version of the shifted boundary method, which is an embedded boundary treatment based on Taylor expansions to deal with unfitted boundaries. It is used to accordingly correct the boundary conditions imposed on a non-meshed boundary to compensate the aforementioned geometrical error, and reach high order accuracy. In this paper, the stability analysis of discontinuous Galerkin methods coupled with the shifted boundary polynomial correction is conducted in depth for the linear advection equation, by visualizing the eigenvalue spectrum of the high order discretized operators. The analysis considers a simplified one-dimensional setting by varying the degree of the polynomials and the distance between the real boundary and the closest mesh interface. The main result of the analysis shows that the considered high order embedded boundary treatment introduces a limitation to the stability region of high order discontinuous Galerkin methods with explicit time integration, which becomes more and more important when using higher order methods. The implicit time integration is also studied, showing that the implicit treatment of the boundary condition allows one to overcome such limitation and achieve an unconditionally stable high order embedded boundary treatment.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Navier--Stokes--Allen--Cahn (NSAC) system that governs the compressible motion of a viscous, immiscible two-phase fluid at constant temperature. Weak solutions of the NSAC system dissipate an appropriate energy functional. Based on an equivalent re-formulation of the NSAC system we propose a fully-discrete discontinuous Galerkin (dG) discretization that is mass-conservative, energy-stable, and provides higher-order accuracy in space and second-order accuracy in time. The approach relies on the approach in \cite{Giesselmann2015a} and a special splitting discretization of the derivatives of the free energy function within the Crank-Nicolson time-stepping. Numerical experiments confirm the analytical statements and show the applicability of the approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backward parabolic equations, such as the backward heat equation, are classical examples of ill-posed problems where solutions may not exist or depend continuously on the data. In this work, we study a least squares finite element method to numerically approximate solutions to such problems. We derive conditional stability estimates for the weak formulation of inhomogeneous backward parabolic equations, assuming minimal regularity of the solution. These stability results are then used to establish \emph{a priori} error bounds for our proposed method. We address key computational aspects, including the treatment of dual norms through the construction of suitable test spaces, and iterative solutions. Numerical experiments are used to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Unified Learning of the Profile Function in Discrete Keller-Segel Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified learning framework for identifying the profile function in discrete Keller-Segel equations, which are widely used mathematical models for understanding chemotaxis. Training data are obtained via either a rigorously developed particle method designed for stable simulation of high-dimensional Keller-Segel systems, or stochastic differential equations approximating the continuous Keller-Segel PDE. Our approach addresses key challenges, including data instability in dimensions higher than two and the accurate capture of singular behavior in the profile function. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive learning strategy to enhance performance. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>A grad-curl conforming virtual element method for a grad-curl problem linking the 3D quad-curl problem and Stokes system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the Stokes complex with vanishing boundary conditions and its dual complex, we reinterpret a grad-curl problem arising from the quad-curl problem as a new vector potential formulation of the three-dimensional Stokes system. By extending the analysis to the corresponding non-homogeneous problems and the accompanying trace complex, we construct a novel $\boldsymbol{H}(\operatorname{grad-curl})$-conforming virtual element space with arbitrary approximation order that satisfies the exactness of the associated discrete Stokes complex. In the lowest-order case, three degrees of freedom are assigned to each vertex and one to each edge. For the grad-curl problem, we rigorously establish the interpolation error estimates, the stability of discrete bilinear forms, and the convergence of the proposed element on polyhedral meshes. As a discrete vector potential formulation of the Stokes problem, the resulting system is pressure-decoupled and symmetric positive definite. Some numerical examples are presented to verify the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Solving Biot poroelasticity by coupling OPM Flow with the two-point stress approximation finite volume method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite volume methods are prevalent in reservoir simulation due to their mass conservation properties and their ability to handle complex grids. However, a simple and consistent finite volume method for elasticity was unavailable until the recently developed two-point stress approximation finite volume method (TPSA). In this work, we show how to couple TPSA to an established flow simulator, using OPM Flow as our primary example. Due to this choice of numerical methods, the coupling is naturally handled at the cell centers, without requiring interpolation operators. We propose a fixed stress coupling scheme and reuse algebraic multi-grid preconditioners, which are known to be effective for two-point flux finite volume methods. Numerical examples illustrate the flexibility of the approach and we showcase how the introduction of solid mechanics impacts the behavior of compartmentalized flow systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For low-frequency electromagnetic problems, where wave-propagation effects can be neglected, eddy current formulations are commonly used as a simplification of the full Maxwell's equations. In this setup, time-domain simulations, needed to capture transient startup responses or nonlinear behavior, are often computationally expensive. We propose a novel tearing and interconnecting approach for eddy currents in time-domain and investigate its scalability.</description>

      <title>A Finite Element framework for bulk-surface coupled PDEs to solve moving boundary problems in biophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider moving boundary problems for biophysics and introduce a new computational framework to handle the complexity of the bulk-surface PDEs. In our framework, interpretability is maintained by adapting the fast, generalizable and accurate structure preservation scheme in [Q. Cheng and J. Shen, \textit{Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering}, 391 (2022)]. We show that mesh distortion is mitigated by adopting the pioneering work of [B. Duan and B. Li, \textit{SIAM J. Sci. Comput.}, 46 (2024)], which is tied to an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) framework. We test our algorithms accuracy on moving surfaces with boundary for the following PDEs: advection-diffusion-reaction equations, phase-field models of Cahn-Hilliard type, and Helfrich energy gradient flows. We performed convergence studies for all the schemes introduced to demonstrate accuracy. We use a staggered approach to achieve coupling and further verify the convergence of this coupling using numerical experiments. Finally, we demonstrate broad applicability of our work by simulating state-of-the-art tests of biophysical models that involve membrane deformation.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired space-time PDE solver and dynamic mode decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to the understanding of dynamical systems. Standard approaches involving time-stepping schemes compute the solution at each time step, which becomes too costly when simulating long-term dynamics. Alternatively, space-time methods that treat the combined space-time domain simultaneously promise better stability and accuracy. Interestingly, data-driven approaches for learning and predicting dynamics, such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), also employ a combined space-time representation. However, the curse of dimensionality often limits the practical benefits of space-time methods. In this work, we investigate quantum-inspired methods for space-time approaches, both for solving PDEs and for making DMD predictions. We achieve this goal by treating both spatial and temporal dimensions within a single matrix product state (MPS) encoding. First, we benchmark our MPS space-time solver for both linear and nonlinear PDEs, observing that the MPS ansatz accurately captures the underlying spatio-temporal correlations while having significantly fewer degrees of freedom. Second, we develop an MPS-DMD algorithm to make accurate long-term predictions of nonlinear systems, with runtime scaling logarithmically in both spatial and temporal resolution. This research highlights the role of tensor networks in developing effective and interpretable models, bridging the gap between numerical methods and data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>Numerical Fragility in Transformers: A Layer-wise Theory for Explaining, Forecasting, and Mitigating Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers trained in low precision can suffer forward-error amplification. We give a first-order, module-wise theory that predicts when and where errors grow. For self-attention we derive a per-layer bound that factorizes into three interpretable diagnostics: a score-scale ratio $\kappa_{\rm score}$, a rowwise softmax sensitivity $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$, and value conditioning $\kappa(V)$. We prove a residual relaxation inequality showing that residual blocks attenuate depth-wise accumulation, and we introduce a precision- and width-aware LayerNorm indicator $\rho_{\rm LN}$ with a matching first-order bound in the $\epsilon$-dominated regime. These pieces yield a unified forward-stability bound whose right-hand side is directly estimable during training.
  On Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10 we evaluate the bound and components. (1) The combined predictor $\kappa_{\rm softmax},(1+\kappa_{\rm score}),\kappa(V),|W_O|2+\kappa{\rm eff}+C_{\rm LN}$ tracks FP32$\leftrightarrow$LP mismatches across seeds, widths, and precisions; scaling by $\epsilon_{\rm mach}$ collapses mixed-precision points. (2) The time-series maximum of $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$ acts as an early-warning signal, leading error spikes by 16-24 steps (corr. 0.65-0.82; permutation $p!\approx!10^{-3}$; Precision@K 0.89-1.00). (3) Guided by $\rho_{\rm LN}$, a small LayerNorm-$\epsilon$ tweak targeting $\rho_\star$ gives consistent stabilization (mean tail-loss $\downarrow\ \approx0.010$ at $\rho_\star!=!0.6$, cap$=10^{-2}$) with negligible overhead.
  Overall, our theory supplies actionable, unitless diagnostics that (i) explain when self-attention is fragile, (ii) forecast instability, and (iii) motivate a minimally invasive mitigation.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR): Condition-Number Control with Moment Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR)}, a simple, architecture-agnostic loss that directly optimizes layer spectra. CMR jointly controls spectral edges via a log-condition proxy and shapes the interior via Chebyshev moments, with a decoupled, capped mixing rule that preserves task gradients. We prove strictly monotone descent for the condition proxy, bounded moment gradients, and orthogonal invariance. In an adversarial ``$\kappa$-stress'' setting (MNIST, 15-layer MLP), \emph{compared to vanilla training}, CMR reduces mean layer condition numbers by $\sim\!10^3$ (from $\approx3.9\!\times\!10^3$ to $\approx3.4$ in 5 epochs), increases average gradient magnitude, and restores test accuracy ( $\approx10\%\!\to\!\approx86\%$ ). These results support \textbf{optimization-driven spectral preconditioning}: directly steering models toward well-conditioned regimes for stable, accurate learning.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Orbital Minimization Method for Neural Operator Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral decomposition of linear operators plays a central role in many areas of machine learning and scientific computing. Recent work has explored training neural networks to approximate eigenfunctions of such operators, enabling scalable approaches to representation learning, dynamical systems, and partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we revisit a classical optimization framework from the computational physics literature known as the \emph{orbital minimization method} (OMM), originally proposed in the 1990s for solving eigenvalue problems in computational chemistry. We provide a simple linear-algebraic proof of the consistency of the OMM objective, and reveal connections between this method and several ideas that have appeared independently across different domains. Our primary goal is to justify its broader applicability in modern learning pipelines. We adapt this framework to train neural networks to decompose positive semidefinite operators, and demonstrate its practical advantages across a range of benchmark tasks. Our results highlight how revisiting classical numerical methods through the lens of modern theory and computation can provide not only a principled approach for deploying neural networks in numerical simulation, but also effective and scalable tools for machine learning.</description>

      <title>A DSMC-PIC coupling method for the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical framework for the simulation of collisional plasma dynamics, based on a coupling between Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods for the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system. The approach extends previously developed DSMC techniques for the homogeneous Landau equation to the fully inhomogeneous, electromagnetic regime. The Landau collision operator is treated through a stochastic particle formulation inspired by the grazing-collision limit of the Boltzmann equation, which enables an efficient and physically consistent representation of Coulomb interactions without relying on the full Boltzmann structure. The resulting collisional solver is combined, via operator splitting, with standard PIC schemes for the Vlasov-Maxwell dynamics, providing flexibility in the choice of field discretisation and time integration. The overall method preserves the main physical invariants of the system while maintaining computational efficiency and simplicity of implementation. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the coupled DSMC-PIC approach across a wide range of collisional regimes.</description>

Abstract: We consider quantitative convergence analysis for hypocoercive dynamics such as Langevin and Lindblad equations describing classical and quantum open systems. Our goal is to provide an overview of recent results of hypocoercivity estimates based on space-time Poincare inequality, providing a unified treatment for classical and quantum dynamics. Furthermore, we also present a unified lifting framework for accelerating both classical and quantum Markov semigroups, which leads to upper and lower bounds of convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Derivative-Free Sequential Quadratic Programming for Equality-Constrained Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider solving nonlinear optimization problems with a stochastic objective and deterministic equality constraints, assuming that only zero-order information is available for both the objective and constraints, and that the objective is also subject to random sampling noise. Under this setting, we propose a Derivative-Free Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (DF-SSQP) method. Due to the lack of derivative information, we adopt a simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) technique to randomly estimate the gradients and Hessians of both the objective and constraints. This approach requires only a dimension-independent number of zero-order evaluations -- as few as eight -- at each iteration step. A key distinction between our derivative-free and existing derivative-based SSQP methods lies in the intricate random bias introduced into the gradient and Hessian estimates of the objective and constraints, brought by stochastic zero-order approximations. To address this issue, we introduce an online debiasing technique based on momentum-style estimators that properly aggregate past gradient and Hessian estimates to reduce stochastic noise, while avoiding excessive memory costs via a moving averaging scheme. Under standard assumptions, we establish the global almost-sure convergence of the proposed DF-SSQP method. Notably, we further complement the global analysis with local convergence guarantees by demonstrating that the rescaled iterates exhibit asymptotic normality, with a limiting covariance matrix resembling the minimax optimal covariance achieved by derivative-based methods, albeit larger due to the absence of derivative information. Our local analysis enables online statistical inference of model parameters leveraging DF-SSQP. Numerical experiments on benchmark nonlinear problems demonstrate both the global and local behavior of DF-SSQP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A special 2D initial conditions' domain of the equal-mass zero angular momentum planar three-body problem, which has been formerly studied, is analyzed to deepen the knowledge of the stability regions in it. The decay times in the domain are carefully computed. Four stability regions are established. 971 verified initial conditions for linearly stable periodic collisionless orbits are found. Many of these identified initial conditions are new ones. The periodic orbits of each stability region are characterized by a certain pattern in their syzygy sequences. Additional computations show that the orbits found should be considered as candidates for KAM-stable orbits.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Eigenvalue Dataset Generation via Chebyshev Subspace Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenvalue problems are among the most important topics in many scientific disciplines. With the recent surge and development of machine learning, neural eigenvalue methods have attracted significant attention as a forward pass of inference requires only a tiny fraction of the computation time compared to traditional solvers. However, a key limitation is the requirement for large amounts of labeled data in training, including operators and their eigenvalues. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel method, named Sorting Chebyshev Subspace Filter (SCSF), which significantly accelerates eigenvalue data generation by leveraging similarities between operators -- a factor overlooked by existing methods. Specifically, SCSF employs truncated fast Fourier transform sorting to group operators with similar eigenvalue distributions and constructs a Chebyshev subspace filter that leverages eigenpairs from previously solved problems to assist in solving subsequent ones, reducing redundant computations. To the best of our knowledge, SCSF is the first method to accelerate eigenvalue data generation. Experimental results show that SCSF achieves up to a $3.5\times$ speedup compared to various numerical solvers.</description>

      <title>Grassmanian Interpolation of Low-Pass Graph Filters: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-pass graph filters are fundamental for signal processing on graphs and other non-Euclidean domains. However, the computation of such filters for parametric graph families can be prohibitively expensive as computation of the corresponding low-frequency subspaces, requires the repeated solution of an eigenvalue problem. We suggest a novel algorithm of low-pass graph filter interpolation based on Riemannian interpolation in normal coordinates on the Grassmann manifold. We derive an error bound estimate for the subspace interpolation and suggest two possible applications for induced parametric graph families. First, we argue that the temporal evolution of the node features may be translated to the evolving graph topology via a similarity correction to adjust the homophily degree of the network. Second, we suggest a dot product graph family induced by a given static graph which allows to infer improved message passing scheme for node classification facilitated by the filter interpolation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Multilevel Splitting: First Application to Rare-Event Derivative Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work analyzes the computational burden of pricing binary options in rare-event settings and introduces an adaptation of the adaptive multilevel splitting (AMS) method for financial derivatives. Standard Monte Carlo is inefficient for deep out of the money binaries due to discontinuous payoffs and low exercise probabilities, requiring very large samples for accurate estimates. An AMS scheme is developed for binary options under Black-Scholes and Heston dynamics, reformulating the rare-event problem as a sequence of conditional events. Numerical experiments compare the method to Monte Carlo and to other techniques such as antithetic variables and multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) across four contracts: European digital calls and puts, and Asian digital calls and puts. Results show up to a 200-fold computational gain for deep out-of-the-money cases while preserving unbiasedness. No evidence is found of prior applications of AMS to financial derivatives. The approach improves pricing efficiency for rare-event contracts such as parametric insurance and catastrophe linked securities. An open-source Rcpp implementation is provided, supporting multiple discretizations and importance functions.</description>

      <title>Mixed Precision Training of Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploiting low-precision computations has become a standard strategy in deep learning to address the growing computational costs imposed by ever larger models and datasets. However, naively performing all computations in low precision can lead to roundoff errors and instabilities. Therefore, mixed precision training schemes usually store the weights in high precision and use low-precision computations only for whitelisted operations. Despite their success, these principles are currently not reliable for training continuous-time architectures such as neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs). This paper presents a mixed precision training framework for neural ODEs, combining explicit ODE solvers with a custom backpropagation scheme, and demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of learning tasks. Our scheme uses low-precision computations for evaluating the velocity, parameterized by the neural network, and for storing intermediate states, while stability is provided by a custom dynamic adjoint scaling and by accumulating the solution and gradients in higher precision. These contributions address two key challenges in training neural ODE: the computational cost of repeated network evaluations and the growth of memory requirements with the number of time steps or layers. Along with the paper, we publish our extendable, open-source PyTorch package rampde, whose syntax resembles that of leading packages to provide a drop-in replacement in existing codes. We demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of our scheme using challenging test cases and on neural ODE applications in image classification and generative models, achieving approximately 50% memory reduction and up to 2x speedup while maintaining accuracy comparable to single-precision training.</description>

      <title>A supervised learning scheme for computing Hamilton-Jacobi equation via density coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a supervised learning scheme for the first order Hamilton--Jacobi PDEs in high dimensions. The scheme is designed by using the geometric structure of Wasserstein Hamiltonian flows via a density coupling strategy. It is equivalently posed as a regression problem using the Bregman divergence, which provides the loss function in learning while the data is generated through the particle formulation of Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow. We prove a posterior estimate on $L^1$ residual of the proposed scheme based on the coupling density. Furthermore, the proposed scheme can be used to describe the behaviors of Hamilton--Jacobi PDEs beyond the singularity formations on the support of coupling density. Several numerical examples with different Hamiltonians are provided to support our findings.</description>

      <title>Artificial Barriers for stochastic differential equations and for construction of boundary-preserving schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the novel method of artificial barriers for scalar stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and use it to construct boundary-preserving numerical schemes for strong approximation of scalar SDEs, possibly with non-globally Lipschitz drift and diffusion coefficients, whose state-space is either bounded or half-bounded. The idea of artificial barriers is to augment the SDE with artificial barriers outside the state-space to not change the solution process, and then apply a boundary-preserving numerical scheme to the resulting reflected SDE (RSDE). This enables us to construct boundary-preserving numerical schemes that achieve the same strong convergence rate as the corresponding RSDE scheme. Based on the method of artificial barriers, we construct two boundary-preserving schemes that we call the Artificial Barriers Euler--Maruyama (ABEM) scheme and the Artificial Barriers Euler--Peano (ABEP) scheme, respectively. We provide numerical experiments for the ABEM scheme and the numerical results agree with the obtained theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Boundary-preserving weak approximation for some semilinear stochastic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a boundary-preserving numerical scheme for the weak approximation for some stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with bounded state-space. We impose regularity assumptions on the drift and diffusion coefficients only locally on the state-space. In particular, the drift and diffusion coefficients may be non-globally Lipschitz continuous and superlinearly growing. The scheme consists of a finite difference discretisation in space and a Lie--Trotter time splitting followed by exact simulation and exact integration in time. The proposed scheme converges in the weak sense of order $1/4$ in time and of order $1/2$ in space, for globally Lipschitz continuous test functions. We prove the weak convergence order in time by proving strong convergence towards a strong solution driven by a different noise process. The convergence order in space follows from known results. The boundary-preserving property is ensured by the use of Lie--Trotter time splitting followed by exact simulation and exact integration. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate the practical advantages of the proposed Lie--Trotter-Exact (LTE) scheme compared to existing schemes for SPDEs.</description>

      <title>Bayesian buckling load optimisation for structures with geometric uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimised lightweight structures, such as shallow domes and slender towers, are prone to sudden buckling failure because geometric uncertainties/imperfections can lead to a drastic reduction in their buckling loads. We introduce a framework for the robust optimisation of buckling loads, considering geometric nonlinearities and random geometric imperfections. The mean and standard deviation of buckling loads are estimated by Monte Carlo sampling of random imperfections and performing a nonlinear finite element computation for each sample. The extended system method is employed to compute the buckling load directly, avoiding costly path-following procedures. Furthermore, the quasi-Monte Carlo sampling using the Sobol sequence is implemented to generate more uniformly distributed samples, which significantly reduces the number of finite element computations. The objective function consisting of the weighted sum of the mean and standard deviation of the buckling load is optimised using Bayesian optimisation. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework are demonstrated through robust sizing optimisation of several geometrically nonlinear truss examples.</description>

      <title>On the Global Optimality of Fibonacci Lattices in the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use linear programming bounds to analyze point sets in the torus with respect to their optimality for problems in discrepancy theory and quasi-Monte Carlo methods. These concepts will be unified by introducing tensor product energies.
  We show that the canonical $3$-point lattice in any dimension is globally optimal among all $3$-point sets in the torus with respect to a large class of such energies. This is a new instance of universal optimality, a special phenomenon that is only known for a small class of highly structured point sets.
  In the case of $d=2$ dimensions it is conjectured that so-called Fibonacci lattices should also be optimal with respect to a large class of potentials. To this end we show that the $5$-point Fibonacci lattice is globally optimal for a continuously parametrized class of potentials relevant to the analysis fo the quasi-Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>Efficient QR-Based CP Decomposition Acceleration via Restructured Dimension Tree and Customized Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition is one of the most widely used tensor decomposition techniques. The conventional CP decomposition algorithm combines alternating least squares (ALS) with the normal equation. However, the normal equation is susceptible to numerical ill-conditioning, which can adversely affect the decomposition results. To mitigate this issue, ALS combined with QR decomposition has been proposed as a more numerically stable alternative. Although this method enhances stability, its iterative process involves tensor-times-matrix (TTM) operations, which typically result in higher computational costs. To reduce this cost, we propose restructured dimension tree, which increases the reuse of intermediate tensors and reduces the number of TTM operations. Compared with the standard dimension tree structure, this dimension tree structure can reduce the computational complexity of TTM operations for tensors of any order by 33\%. Additionally, we introduce a customized extrapolation strategy in the CP-ALS-QR algorithm, leveraging the unique structure of the matrix $\mathbf{Q}_0$ to further accelerate convergence. By integrating these two techniques, we propose a novel CP decomposition algorithm that significantly improves iteration efficiency, achieving up to twofold acceleration on datasets with certain specific structures. Numerical experiments on five real-world datasets show that, compared with the baseline algorithm, our proposed algorithm improves iteration efficiency while simultaneously enhancing fitting accuracy.</description>

      <title>Higher-order meshless schemes for hyperbolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the order, efficiency, stability and positivity of several meshless schemes for linear scalar hyperbolic equations. Meshless schemes are Generalised Finite Difference Methods (GFDMs) for arbitrary irregular grids in which there is no connectivity between the grid points. We propose a new MUSCL-like meshless scheme that uses a central stencil, with which we can achieve arbitrarily high orders, and compare it to existing meshless upwind schemes and meshless WENO schemes. The stability of the newly proposed scheme is guaranteed by an upwind reconstruction to the midpoints of the stencil. The new meshless MUSCL scheme is also efficient due to the reuse of the GFDM solution in the reconstruction. We combine the new MUSCL scheme with a Multi-dimensional Optimal Order Detection (MOOD) procedure to avoid spurious oscillations at discontinuities. In one spatial dimension, our fourth order MUSCL scheme outperforms existing WENO and upwind schemes in terms of stability and accuracy. In two spatial dimensions, our MUSCL scheme achieves similar accuracy to an existing WENO scheme but is significantly more stable.</description>

Abstract: We analyze an advection-diffusion-reaction problem with non-homogeneous boundary conditions that models the chromatography process, a vital stage in bioseparation. We prove stability and error estimates for both constant and affine adsorption, using the symplectic one-step implicit midpoint method for time discretization and finite elements for spatial discretization. In addition, we perform the stability analysis for the nonlinear, explicit adsorption in the continuous and semi-discrete cases. For the nonlinear, explicit adsorption, we also complete the error analysis for the semi-discrete case and prove the existence of a solution for the fully discrete case. The numerical tests validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report showcases the role of, and future directions for, the field of Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RNLA) in a selection of scientific applications. These applications span the domains of imaging, genomics and dynamical systems, and are thematically connected by needing to perform linear algebra routines on large-scale matrices (with up to quantillions of entries). At such scales, the linear algebra routines face typical bottlenecks: memory constraints, data access latencies, and substantial floating-point operation costs. RNLA routines are discussed at a high-level to demonstrate how these routines are able to solve the challenges faced by traditional linear algebra routines, and, consequently, address the computational problem posed in the underlying application. For each application, RNLA's open challenges and possible future directions are also presented, which broadly fall into the categories: creating structure-aware RNLA algorithms; co-designing RNLA algorithms with hardware and mixed-precision considerations; and advancing modular, composable software infrastructure. Ultimately, this report serves two purposes: it invites domain scientists to engage with RNLA; and it offers a guide for future RNLA research grounded in real applications.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of iterative regularization method assisted by the graph Laplacian with early stopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a data-assisted iterative regularization method for solving ill-posed inverse problems. The proposed approach, termed \texttt{IRMGL+\(\Psi\)}, integrates classical iterative techniques with a data-driven regularization term realized through an iteratively updated graph Laplacian. Our method commences by computing a preliminary solution using any suitable reconstruction method, which then serves as the basis for constructing the initial graph Laplacian. The solution is subsequently refined through an iterative process, where the graph Laplacian is simultaneously recalibrated at each step to effectively capture the evolving structure of the solution. A key innovation of this work lies in the formulation of this iterative scheme and the rigorous justification of the classical discrepancy principle as a reliable early stopping criterion specifically tailored to the proposed method. Under standard assumptions, we establish stability and convergence results for the scheme when the discrepancy principle is applied. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our method through numerical experiments utilizing four distinct initial reconstructors $\Psi$: the adjoint operator (Adj), filtered back projection (FBP), total variation (TV) denoising, and standard Tikhonov regularization (Tik). It is observed that \texttt{IRMGL+Adj} demonstrates a distinct advantage over the other initializers, producing a robust and stable approximate solution directly from a basic initial reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Stability of lattice Boltzmann schemes for initial boundary value problems in raw formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stability of one-dimensional linear lattice Boltzmann schemes for scalar hyperbolic equations with respect to boundary data. Our approach is based on the original raw algorithm on several unknowns, thereby avoiding the need for a transformation into an equivalent scalar formulation-a challenging process in presence of boundaries. To address different behaviors exhibited by the numerical scheme, we introduce appropriate notions of strong stability. They account for the potential absence of a continuous extension of the stable vector bundle associated with the bulk scheme on the unit circle for certain components. Rather than developing a general theory, complicated by the fact that discrete boundaries in lattice Boltzmann schemes are inherently characteristic, we focus on strong stability-instability for methods whose characteristic equations have stencils of breadth one to the left. In this context, we study three representative schemes. These are endowed with various boundary conditions drawn from the literature, and our theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: Rooted trees are essential for describing numerical schemes via the so-called B-series. They have also been used extensively in rough analysis for expanding solutions of singular Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). When one considers scalar-valued equations, the most efficient combinatorial set is multi-indices. In this paper, we investigate the existence of intermediate combinatorial sets that will lie between multi-indices and rooted trees. We provide a negative result stating that there is no combinatorial set encoding elementary differentials in dimension $d\neq 1$, and compatible with the rooted trees and the multi-indices aside from the rooted trees. This does not close the debate of the existence of such combinatorial sets, but it shows that it cannot be obtained via a naive and natural approach.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of Simultaneous Reconstruction of Initial Condition and Potential in Subdiffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the simultaneous identification of a spatially dependent potential and the initial condition in a subdiffusion model based on two terminal observations. The existence, uniqueness, and conditional stability of the inverse problem are established under weak regularity assumptions through a constructive fixed-point iteration approach. The theoretical analysis further inspires the development of an easy-to-implement iterative algorithm. A fully discrete scheme is then proposed, combining the finite element method for spatial discretization, convolution quadrature for temporal discretization, and the quasi-boundary value method to handle the ill-posedness of recovering the initial condition. Inspired by the conditional stability estimate, we demonstrate the linear convergence of the iterative algorithm and provide a detailed error analysis for the reconstructed initial condition and potential. The derived \textsl{a priori} error estimate offers a practical guide for selecting regularization parameters and discretization mesh sizes based on the noise level. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate and support our theoretical findings.</description>

Rather than working in the unknown source space, our semismooth Newton updates operate in the measurement (adjoint) space, which is especially efficient when the number of measurements is much smaller than the discretized source dimension. The source is then recovered via Fenchel-Rockafellar duality. Our approach substantially accelerates computation and reduces costs. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Interpolating between Optimal Transport and KL regularized Optimal Transport using R\'enyi Divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regularized optimal transport (OT) has received much attention in recent years starting from Cuturi's introduction of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularized OT. In this paper, we propose regularizing the OT problem using the family of $\alpha$-R\'enyi divergences for $\alpha \in (0, 1)$. R\'enyi divergences are neither $f$-divergences nor Bregman distances, but they recover the KL divergence in the limit $\alpha \nearrow 1$. The advantage of introducing the additional parameter $\alpha$ is that for $\alpha \searrow 0$ we obtain convergence to the unregularized OT problem. For the KL regularized OT problem, this was achieved by letting the regularization parameter $\varepsilon$ tend to zero, which causes numerical instabilities. We present two different ways to obtain premetrics on probability measures, namely by R\'enyi divergence constraints and by penalization. The latter premetric interpolates between the unregularized and the KL regularized OT problem with weak convergence of the unique minimizer, generalizing the interpolation property of KL regularized OT. We use a nested mirror descent algorithm to solve the primal formulation. Both on real and synthetic data sets R\'enyi regularized OT plans outperform their KL and Tsallis counterparts in terms of being closer to the unregularized transport plans and recovering the ground truth in inference tasks better.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of tamed theta scheme for superlinearly growing McKean-Vlasov NSDDEs driven by fractional Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the McKean-Vlasov neutral stochastic differential delay equations driven by fractional Brownian motion with super-linearly growing coefficients, where the Hurst exponent $H\in(1/2,1)$. The existence and uniqueness of the exact solution were shown by the Picard iteration. Besides, we propose a tamed theta Euler-Maruyama scheme for this equation, analyzed the moment boundness and propagation of chaos etc. Moreover, the convergence rate of the numerical scheme is established.</description>

      <title>Generic Structural Stability for $2 \times 2$ Systems of Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a proof of generic structural stability for Riemann solutions to $2 \times 2$ system of hyperbolic conservation laws in one spatial variable, without diffusive terms. This means that for almost every left and right state, shocks and rarefaction solutions of the same type are preserved via perturbations of the flux functions, the left state, and the right state. The main assumptions for this proof involve standard assumptions on strict hyperbolicity and genuine non-linearity, a technical assumption on directionality of rarefaction curves, and the regular manifold (submersion) assumption motivated by concepts in differential topology. We show that the structural stability of the Riemann solutions is related to the transversality of the Hugoniot loci and rarefaction curves in the state space. The regular manifold assumption is required to invoke a variant of a theorem from differential topology, Thom's parametric transversality theorem, to show the genericity of transversality of these curves. This in turn implies the genericity of structural stability. We then apply this theorem to two examples: the p-system and a $2 \times 2$ system governing the evolution of gravity-driven monodisperse particle-laden thin films. In particular, we illustrate how one can verify all the above assumptions for the former, and apply the theorem to different numerical and physical aspects of the system governing the latter.</description>

      <title>Affine-Invariant Global Non-Asymptotic Convergence Analysis of BFGS under Self-Concordance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish global non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for the BFGS quasi-Newton method without requiring strong convexity or the Lipschitz continuity of the gradient or Hessian. Instead, we consider the setting where the objective function is strictly convex and strongly self-concordant. For an arbitrary initial point and any arbitrary positive-definite initial Hessian approximation, we prove global linear and superlinear convergence guarantees for BFGS when the step size is determined using a line search scheme satisfying the weak Wolfe conditions. Moreover, all our global guarantees are affine-invariant, with the convergence rates depending solely on the initial error and the strongly self-concordant constant. Our results extend the global non-asymptotic convergence theory of BFGS beyond traditional assumptions and, for the first time, establish affine-invariant convergence guarantees aligning with the inherent affine invariance of the BFGS method.</description>

      <title>Deriving Transformer Architectures as Implicit Multinomial Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While attention has been empirically shown to improve model performance, it lacks a rigorous mathematical justification. This short paper establishes a novel connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial regression. Specifically, we show that in a fixed multinomial regression setting, optimizing over latent features yields solutions that align with the dynamics induced on features by attention blocks. In other words, the evolution of representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that recovers the optimal features for classification.</description>
