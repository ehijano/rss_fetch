      <title>Microscopic Fingerprint of Chiral Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral superconductors have long been theorized to break time-reversal symmetry and support exotic topological features such as Majorana modes and spontaneous edge currents, promising ingredients for quantum technologies. Although several unconventional superconductors may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, clear microscopic evidence of chiral pairing has remained out of reach. In this work, we demonstrate direct real-space signatures of chiral superconductivity in a single atomic layer of tin on Si(111). Using quasiparticle interference imaging, we detected symmetry-locked nodal and antinodal points in the Bogoliubov quasiparticle wavefunction, tightly bound to atomic point defects in the tin lattice. These nodal features, along with their surrounding texture, form a distinct real-space pattern exhibiting a clear and exclusive hallmark of chiral superconductivity. Our findings, reinforced by analytical theory and numerical simulations, offer unambiguous evidence of chiral pairing in a two-dimensional material.</description>

      <title>Strong enhancements to superconducting properties of 1D systems from metallic reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a 1D bilayer system comprised of pairing and metallic layers, the present work proves the striking power of reservoir-mediated boosting of superconductivity. Employing many-body numerics on large systems at zero and finite temperature, we unravel the complex processes by which the tuning of the metal parameters can impact the effective pairing strength as well as the long-range pair-pair-coupling mediated by the metal. It is these two processes that in turn can strongly enhance superconducting susceptibility and thermal superconducting correlation length over those of the isolated system. We show that in this way, even a 1D system can come very close to achieving superconducting long-range order.</description>

      <title>X-ray Diffraction and Electrical Transport Imaging of Superconducting Superhydride (La,Y)H10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis and characterization of (La0.9Y0.1)H10 superhydrides exhibiting coexisting cubic Fm-3m and hexagonal P63/mmc clathrate phases observed over the pressure range from 168 GPa down to 136 GPa. Using synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction imaging (XDI) at the upgraded Advanced Photon Source (APS-U), we spatially resolved micron-scale distributions of these phases, revealing structural inhomogeneity across the sample. Four-probe DC resistance measurements confirmed superconductivity, with two distinct transitions: an onset at 244 K associated with the cubic phase and a second near 220 K linked to the hexagonal phase. Notably, resistance profiles collected from different current and voltage permutations showed variations in transition width and onset temperature that correlated with the spatial phase distribution mapped by XDI. These findings demonstrate a direct connection between local structural domains and superconducting behavior. Yttrium substitution is found to influence both the phase behavior and superconducting properties of LaH10-type clathrate hydrides. More broadly, this study highlights the utility of spatially correlating structural and electrical transport measurements in materials exhibiting heterogeneity under pressure, including hydride superconductors.</description>

      <title>The Josephson effect in Fibonacci superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the Josephson effect between two proximized Fibonacci quasicrystals. A quasiperiodic modulation of the chemical potential on a superconducting substrate induces topological gaps and edge modes with energies above the superconducting gap. We reveal that these edge modes develop superconducting correlations which significantly impact the Josephson current, and we term them Fibonacci-Andreev bound states. Notably, the contribution from these edge modes can be controlled by the Fibonacci sequence arrangement, known as phason angle, and can dominate the Josephson effect over the conventional subgap Andreev bound states in short junctions. The interplay between the Josephson effect and nontrivial edge modes in quasiperiodic systems presents new opportunities for exploring exotic superconducting phenomena in quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Fermi liquid and isotropic superconductivity of Hund scenario for bilayer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments on bulk and thin film bilayer nickelate high-$T_c$ superconductors urge for clarification of their pairing mechanism. Debates exist on whether the hybridization or the Hund's coupling between the nickel $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals plays a primary role in driving the superconductivity. Here, we study the Hund scenario and make comparisons with the hybridization scenario using the same dynamic Schwinger boson approach. Our calculations reveal several key features of the Hund-driven superconductivity, including an isotropic $s$-wave gap, a lower maximum $T_c$, and Fermi liquid normal states, that differ from the hybridization-driven mechanism. We attribute these differences to their distinct low-energy dynamics. Comparison with recent experiments suggests that the Hund scenario alone is not enough to explain the bilayer nickelate superconductivity in both bulk and thin films.</description>

      <title>The gauge theory dual of the bilayer XY model with second order Josephson coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a duality transformation for a bilayer XY model where the layers are coupled by second order Josephson effect, which favors inter-layer phase difference of either $0$ or $\pi$. The model may represent a bilayer superconductor or a spin-1 ferromagnetic Bose gas in the easy-plane limit. The second order Josephson term is mapped to a U(1) gauge field, known to be trivially confining in two dimensions, and we argue that a Coulomb-gas analysis is not applicable to the dual theory. Instead, we appeal to the vast knowledge of gauge theory and infer that the only phase transition out of low-temperature ordered phase is an Ising transition driven by condensation of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ domain wall loops. The domain wall loops can be seen as a surviving vestige of single-layer vortex-anti-vortex pair, heavily deformed by the second order Josephson coupling. A theoretical or computational method that concentrates on point defects would most likely miss out on these excitations and reach erroneous results. Our dual theory offers a clear, intuitive picture of how the second order Josephson coupling induces confinement of vortices and drastically changes the physics.</description>

      <title>Andreev molecules at distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Andreev molecule states arise from hybridization of Andreev bound states in different Josephson Junctions. Extensive theoretical and experimental research concentrates on direct coherent electron coupling between the junctions: this implies the distance between the junctions is of the order of superconducting coherence length, that is, short.
  We propose and discuss the possibility to create Andreev molecules at long (in principle, arbitrary long) distance between the junctions. In this case, the hybridized states are excited quasi-particle singlets and the coupling is provided by an embedding electric circuit. To achieve a strong hybridization, one aligns the energies of the Andreev bound states with associated phase differences. In fact, a recent experiment realizes such setup.
  With circuit theory we derive the hybridization level splitting and estimate the scale of the effect. Since the phenomenon encompasses excited states, we derive and solve the associated Lindblad equation under condition of persistent resonant excitation. By analyzing the resulting dissipative dynamics we identify relevant regimes where the hybridization and resonant excitation peaks are most pronounced. The low-frequency mutual inductance of the Josephson junctions is an important signature of the molecular state and associated non-local Josephson effect. We demonstrate the peak structures for both mutual and self-inductance, and compute them in various frequency regimes.
  In an interesting common case the embedding circuit includes an oscillator, which can be used both to enhance hybridization and for state readout with two-tone spectroscopy. We derive and solve Lindblad equations for the conditions of two-tone spectroscopy to demonstrate the the readout of molecular states.</description>

      <title>Experimental and theoretical evidence of universality in superfluid vortex reconnections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimum separation between reconnecting vortices in fluids and superfluids obeys a universal scaling law with respect to time. The pre-reconnection and the post-reconnection prefactors of this scaling law are different, a property related to irreversibility and to energy transfer and dissipation mechanisms. In the present work, we determine the temperature dependence of these prefactors in superfluid helium from experiments and a numeric model which fully accounts for the coupled dynamics of the superfluid vortex lines and the thermal normal fluid component. At all temperatures, we observe a pre- and post-reconnection asymmetry similar to that observed in other superfluids and in classical viscous fluids, indicating that vortex reconnections display a universal behaviour independent of the small-scale regularising dynamics. We also numerically show that each vortex reconnection event represents a sudden injection of energy in the normal fluid. Finally we argue that in a turbulent flow, these punctuated energy injections can sustain the normal fluid in a perturbed state, provided that the density of superfluid vortices is large enough.</description>

      <title>Quasi-$\Phi_0$-periodic supercurrent at quantum Hall transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combination of superconductivity and quantum Hall (QH) effect is regarded as a key milestone in advancing topological quantum computation in solid-state systems. Recent quantum interference studies suggest that QH edge states can effectively mediate a supercurrent across high-quality graphene weak links. In this work we report the observation of a supercurrent associated with transitions between adjacent QH plateaus, where transport paths develop within the compressible two-dimensional bulk. We employ a back-gated graphene Josephson junction, comprising high-mobility CVD-grown graphene encapsulated in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) and contacted by Nb leads. Superconducting pockets are detected persisting beyond the QH onset, up to 2.4 T, hence approaching the upper critical field of the Nb contacts. We observe an approximate $\Phi_0=h/2e$ periodicity of the QH-supercurrent as a function of the magnetic field, indicating superconducting interference in a proximitized percolative phase. These results provide a promising experimental platform to investigate the transport regime of percolative supercurrents, leveraging the flexibility of van der Waals devices.</description>
