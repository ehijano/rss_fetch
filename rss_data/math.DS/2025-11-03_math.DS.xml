      <title>Seasonal Forcing Dominated Dynamics of a piecewise smooth Ghil-Zaliapin-Thompson ENSO model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ghil-Zaliapin-Thompson (GZT) model, a scalar delay differential equation with periodic forcing and time-delayed feedback, captures key features of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. Numerical studies of the GZT model have revealed stable period-one orbits under strong forcing and locked, quasiperiodic, or even chaotic regimes under weaker forcing, but its analytical treatment remains challenging. To bridge this gap, we propose a piecewise smooth version of the GZT model with piecewise constant delayed feedback and continuous periodic forcing. For this piecewise smooth GZT model we explicitly construct solutions of initial value problems, and study the existence and properties of periodic orbits of period one. By studying the symmetries and possible phases of periodic solutions we are able to construct period-one solutions and the regions of parameter space in which they exist. We show that the stability of these orbits is governed by a linear mapping from which we find the Floquet multipliers for the periodic orbit and also the bifurcation curve along which these orbits lose stability. We show that for most values of the delay this occurs at a torus bifurcation, but that for small delays a fold bifurcation of period one orbits occurs. We then compare these analytical results with numerical continuation of the GZT model, showing that they align very closely.</description>

      <title>Periodic Points of Hamiltonian Diffeomorphisms Equal to Nondegenerate Linear Maps at Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on symplectic Euclidean spaces that are equal to non-degenerate linear maps at infinity. Under the assumption that there exists an isolated homologically nontrivial fixed point satisfying the twist condition, we prove the existence of infinitely many simple periodic points. More precisely, if such a diffeomorphism has only finitely many fixed points, then it admits simple periodic points with arbitrarily large prime periods.</description>

      <title>Topological and Metric Pressure for Singular Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of rescaled metric pressure and rescaled topological pressure for flows by considering three types of rescaled Bowen balls, which take the flow velocity and time reparametrization into account. This approach effectively eliminates the influence of singularities. It is demonstrated that defining both metric pressure and topological pressure via several distinct Bowen balls is equivalent. Furthermore, under the assumptions that $\log \|X(x)\|$ is integrable and that $\mu(\mathrm{Sing}(X))=0$, we prove Katok's formula of pressure. We establish a partial variational principle that relates the rescaled metric pressure and the rescaled topological pressure.</description>

      <title>Variational principle for neutralized packing pressure on subsets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of neutralized packing pressures and neutralized measure-theoretic pressures on subsets for a finitely generated free semigroup action. Let $X$ be a compact metric space and $\mathcal{G}$ be a finite family of continuous self-maps on $X$. We consider the semigroup $G$ generated by $\mathcal{G}$ on $X$. We show that the variational principle between the neutralized packing pressures $P^{P}_{\mathcal{G}}(Z,f)$ and the neutralized measure--theoretic upper pressures $\overline{P}_{\mu,{\mathcal{G}} }(Z,f)$ for a given continuous function $f$ and a compact subset $Z \subset X$:
  $$P^{P}_{\mathcal{G}}(Z,f)=\lim_{\varepsilon \to 0}\sup \{ \overline{P}_{\mu,\mathcal{G} }(Z,f,\varepsilon):\mu \in M(X), \ \mu(Z)=1 \}.$$</description>

      <title>Bifurcation analysis for a SIRS model with a nonlinear incidence rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the main purpose is to explore an SIRS epidemic model with a general nonlinear incidence rate $f(I)S=\beta I(1+\upsilon I^{k-1})S$ ($k&gt;0$). We analyzed the existence and stability of equilibria of the epidemic model. Local bifurcation theory is applied to explore the rich variety of dynamical behavior of the model. Normal forms of the epidemic model are derived for different types of bifurcation, including Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation, Nilpotent focus bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation. The first four focal values are computed to determine the codimension of the Hopf bifurcation, which can be undergo some limit cycles. Some numerical results and simulations are presented to illustrate these theoretical results.</description>

      <title>From pathological to paradigmatic: A retrospective on Eremenko and Lyubich's entire functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article surveys the impact of Eremenko and Lyubich's paper ''Examples of entire functions with pathological dynamics'', published in 1987 in the Journal of the LMS. Through a clever extension and use of classical approximation theorems, the authors constructed examples exhibiting behaviours previously unseen in holomorphic dynamics. Their work laid foundational techniques and posed questions that have since guided a good part of the development of transcendental dynamics.</description>

      <title>Beyond real blow-up: Masuda detours and complex holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For real $\mathbf{b}$, consider quadratic heat equations like \begin{equation*} \mathbf{w}_t=\mathbf{w}_{\boldsymbol{\xi}\boldsymbol{\xi}} + \mathbf{b}(\boldsymbol{\xi})\,\mathbf{w}^2 \end{equation*} on $\boldsymbol{\xi}\in(0,\pi)$ with Neumann boundary conditions. For $\mathbf{b}$=1, pioneering work by Ky\^uya Masuda in the 1980s aimed to circumvent PDE blow-up, which occurs in finite real time, by a detour which ventures through complex time. Naive projection onto the first two Galerkin modes $\mathbf{w}=x+y \cos\boldsymbol{\xi}$ leads us to an ODE caricature. As in the PDE, spatially homogeneous solutions $y=0\neq x\in\mathbb{R}$ starting at $x_0$ blow up at finite real time $t=T=1/x_0$.
  In the spirit of Masuda, we extend real analytic ODE solutions to complex time, and to real 4-dimensional $(x,y)\in\mathbb{C}^2$, to circumvent the real blow-up singularity at $t=T$. We therefore study complex foliations of general polynomial ODEs for $(x,y)\in\mathbb{C}^2$, in projective compactifications like $u=1/x,\ z=y/x$, including their holonomy at blow-up $u=0$. We obtain linearizations, at blow-up equilibria of Poincar\'e and Siegel type, based on spectral nonresonance. We discuss the consequences of rational periodic nonresonance, and of irrational quasiperiodic nonresonance of Diophantine type, for iterated Masuda detours in the ODE caricature. We conclude with some comments on global aspects, PDEs, discretizations, and other applications.</description>

      <title>Higher-order phase reduction for delay-coupled oscillators beyond the phase-shift approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network interactions between dynamical units are often subject to time delay. We develop a phase reduction method for delay-coupled oscillator networks. The method is based on rewriting the delay-differential equation as an ordinary differential equation coupled with a transport equation, expanding in the coupling strength, and solving the resulting equations order-by-order. This approach yields an approximation of the finite-dimensional phase dynamics to arbitrary order. While in the first-order approximation the time delay acts as a phase shift as expected, the higher-order phase reduction generally displays a less trivial dependence on the delay. In particular, exploiting second-order phase reduction, we prove the existence of a region of bistability in the synchronization dynamics of two delay-coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators.</description>

      <title>Pointwise convergence of ergodic averages along quadratic bracket polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a pointwise convergence result for ergodic averages modeled along orbits of the form $(n\lfloor n\sqrt{k}\rfloor)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, where $k$ is an arbitrary positive rational number with $\sqrt{k}\not\in\mathbb{Q}$. Namely, we prove that for every such $k$, every measure-preserving system $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu,T)$ and every $f\in L^{\infty}_{\mu}(X)$, we have that \[ \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nf(T^{n\lfloor n\sqrt{k}\rfloor}x)\quad\text{exists for $\mu$-a.e. $x\in X$.} \] Notably, our analysis involves a curious implementation of the circle method developed for analyzing exponential sums with phases $(\xi n \lfloor n\sqrt{k}\rfloor)_{1\le n\le N}$ exhibiting arithmetical obstructions beyond rationals with small denominators, and is based on the Green and Tao's result on the quantitative behaviour of polynomial orbits on nilmanifolds. For the case $k=2$ such a circle method was firstly employed for addressing the corresponding Waring-type problem by Neale, and their work constitutes the departure point of our considerations.</description>

      <title>Ergodic averages for sparse corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for the study of the limiting behavior of multiple ergodic averages with commuting transformations when all iterates are given by the same sparse sequence; this enables us to partially resolve several longstanding problems. First, we address a special case of the joint intersectivity question of Bergelson, Leibman, and Lesigne by giving necessary and sufficient conditions under which the multidimensional polynomial Szemer\'edi theorem holds for length-three patterns. Second, we show that for two commuting transformations, the Furstenberg averages remain unchanged when the iterates are taken along sparse sequences such as $[n^c]$ for a positive noninteger $c$, advancing a conjecture of the first author. Lastly, we extend Chu's result on popular common differences in linear corners to polynomial and Hardy corners. Our toolbox includes recent degree lowering and seminorm smoothing techniques, the machinery of magic extensions of Host, and novel structured extensions motivated by works of Tao and Leng. Combined, these techniques reduce the analysis to settings where the Host-Kra theory of characteristic factors and equidistribution on nilmanifolds yield a family of striking identities from which our main results follow.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Dependence of the Pierrehumbert Flow's Mixing Rate on the Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantitatively study the mixing rate of randomly shifted alternating shears on the torus. This flow was introduced by Pierrehumbert '94, and was recently shown to be exponentially mixing. In this work, we quantify the dependence of the exponential mixing rate on the flow amplitude. Our approach is based on constructing an explicit Lyapunov function and a coupling trajectory for the associated two-point Markov chain, together with an application of the quantitative Harris theorem.</description>

      <title>FMint-SDE: A Multimodal Foundation Model for Accelerating Numerical Simulation of SDEs via Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and accurate simulation of dynamical systems is a fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Traditional numerical integrators often face a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, while existing neural network-based approaches typically require training a separate model for each case. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel multi-modal foundation model for large-scale simulations of differential equations: FMint-SDE (Foundation Model based on Initialization for stochastic differential equations). Based on a decoder-only transformer with in-context learning, FMint-SDE leverages numerical and textual modalities to learn a universal error-correction scheme. It is trained using prompted sequences of coarse solutions generated by conventional solvers, enabling broad generalization across diverse systems. We evaluate our models on a suite of challenging SDE benchmarks spanning applications in molecular dynamics, mechanical systems, finance, and biology. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a superior accuracy-efficiency tradeoff compared to classical solvers, underscoring the potential of FMint-SDE as a general-purpose simulation tool for dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the following text we show if $X$ is an Alexandroff space, then $f:X\to Y$ has closed graph if and only if it has constant closed value on each connected component of $X$. Moreover, if $X$ an Alexandroff space and $f:X\to Y$ has closed graph, then $f:X\to Y$ is continuous. As a matter of fact, the number of maps which have closed graph from Alexandroff space $X$ to a topological space $Y$ depends just on the the number of connected components of $X$ and the number of closed points of $Y$.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of perturbed gradient flow systems on hypergraphs: A perspective towards nonequilibrium physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article serves to concisely review the link between gradient flow systems on hypergraphs and information geometry which has been established within the last five years. Gradient flow systems describe a wealth of physical phenomena and provide powerful analytical technquies which are based on the variational energy-dissipation principle. Modern nonequilbrium physics has complemented this classical principle with thermodynamic uncertaintly relations, speed limits, entropy production rate decompositions, and many more. In this article, we formulate these modern principles within the framework of perturbed gradient flow systems on hypergraphs. In particular, we discuss the geometry induced by the Bregman divergence, the physical implications of dual foliations, as well as the corresponding infinitesimal Riemannian geometry for gradient flow systems. Through the geometrical perspective, we are naturally led to new concepts such as moduli spaces for perturbed gradient flow systems and thermodynamical area which is crucial for understanding speed limits. We hope to encourage the readers working in either of the two fields to further expand on and foster the interaction between the two fields.</description>

      <title>Borel Combinatorics of Schreier Graphs of $\mathbb{Z}$-actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Borel combinatorics of Schreier graphs of $\mathbb{Z}$-actions with arbitrary finite generating sets. We formulate the Borel combinatorics in terms of existence of Borel equivariant maps from $F(2^{\mathbb{Z}})$ to subshifts of finite type. We then show that the Borel combinatorics and the continuous combinatorics coincide, and both are decidable. This is in contrast with the case of $\mathbb{Z}^2$-actions. We then turn to the problem of computing Borel chromatic numbers for such graphs. We give an algorithm for this problem which runs in exponential time. We then prove some bounds for the Borel chromatic numbers and give a formula for the case where the generating set has size 4.</description>

      <title>The memory-dependent FPK equation for fractional Gaussian noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to explore non-Markovian dynamics of nonlinear dynamical systems subjected to fractional Gaussian noise (FGN) and Gaussian white noise (GWN). A novel memory-dependent Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (memFPK) equation is developed to characterize the probability structure in such non-Markovian systems. The main challenge in this research comes from the long-memory characteristics of FGN. These features make it impossible to model the FGN-excited nonlinear dynamical systems as finite dimensional GWN-driven Markovian augmented filtering systems, so the classical FPK equation is no longer applicable. To solve this problem, based on fractional Wick-It\^o-Skorohod integral theory, this study first derives the fractional It\^o formula. Then, a memory kernel function is constructed to reflect the long-memory characteristics from FGN. By using fractional It\^o formula and integration by parts, the memFPK equation is established. {Importantly, the proposed memFPK equation is not limited to specific forms of drift and diffusion terms, making it broadly applicable to a wide class of nonlinear dynamical systems subjected to FGN and GWN.} Due to the historical dependence of the memory kernel function, a Volterra adjustable decoupling approximation is used to reconstruct the memory kernel dependence term. This approximation method can effectively solve the memFPK equation, thereby obtaining probabilistic responses of nonlinear dynamical systems subjected to FGN and GWN excitations. Finally, some numerical examples verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a locally integrable function $f:(a,b) \to \mathbb R$ must be affine if its mean oscillation, considered as a function of intervals, can be extended to a locally finite Borel measure. In particular, we show that any function $f$ satisfying the integro-differential identity $|Df|(I)=4\text{osc}(f,I)$ for all intervals $I \subset {(a,b)}$ must be affine.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic curvature via Jacobi-Maupertuis and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the setting of electromagnetic systems, we propose a new definition of electromagnetic Ricci curvature, naturally derived via the classical Jacobi-Maupertuis reparametrization from the recent works of Assenza [IMRN, 2024] and Assenza, Marshall Reber, Terek [Communications in Mathematical Physics, 2025]. On closed manifolds, we show that if the magnetic force is nowhere vanishing and the potential is sufficiently small in the $C^2$ norm, then this Ricci curvature is positive for energies close to the maximum value of the potential $e_0$. As a main application, under these assumptions, we extend the existence of contractible closed orbits at energy levels near $e_0$ from almost every to everywhere.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for interacting particle systems on random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study weakly interacting diffusion processes on random graphs. Our main focus is on the properties of the mean-field limit and, in particular, on the nonuniqueness and bifurcation structure of stationary states. By extending classical bifurcation analysis to include multichromatic interaction potentials and random graph structures, we explicitly identify bifurcation points and relate them to the spectral properties of the graphon integral operator. In addition, we develop a self-consistency formulation of stationary states that recovers the primary critical threshold and reveals secondary bifurcations along non-uniform branches. Furthermore, we characterize the resulting McKean-Vlasov PDE as a gradient flow with respect to a suitable metric. In addition, we provide strong evidence that (minus) the interaction energy of the interacting particle system serves as a natural order parameter. In particular, beyond the transition point and for multichromatic interactions, we observe an energy cascade that is strongly linked to dynamical metastability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Kepler billiard with zero-energy in the plane defined inside a smooth closed connected simple curve which intersects all focused parabola at at most two points. {We show that} if has an invariant curve consisting of $2$-periodic orbits and there exists a $C^{1}$-first integral with non-vanishing gradient in the region between the invariant curve and the boundary curve, then the system is defined actually inside an ellipse with the Kepler center occupying one of the foci. This statement is obtained as a simple ``translation'' of the theorem of Bialy-Mironov with Levi-Civita transformation.</description>

Abstract: We consider the ways minimal sets of flows in $S^3$ may be embedded. We prove that given any $C^2$ flow on $S^3$ with positive entropy, there is an uncountable collection $\mathcal{M}$ of topologically distinct minimal sets such that for each $M\in \mathcal{M}$ there are infinitely many embedded copies of $M$ in the flow, each copy with a distinct knot type, thus extending work of Franks and Williams for periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>On Sets of Periodic Orbit Lengths in Finitely Presented Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify the sets of natural numbers $n$ for which certain dynamical systems $(X,f)$ on a compact metric space $X$ have a periodic point of (least) period $n$. Interest in this question dates back to Sharkovskii's theorem for continuous maps on intervals of the real line, but it also ties to checkable conditions for Krieger's embedding theorem for symbolic dynamical systems. Given a system for which the logarithmic derivative of the Artin-Mazur zeta function is rational, we use the Skolem-Mahler-Lech theorem to classify for which $n$ the system has a periodic point of (not necessarily least) period $n$. Moreover, we build on work on finitely presented (FP) systems and their relationship to symbolic dynamics to classify the set of least periods, that is periodic orbit lengths, for arbitrary FP systems, extending a known classification for shifts of finite type. We also provide several constructions to realize any such least period sets.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow structure for some nonlocal diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study ``nonlocal diffusion equations'' of the form \[ \partial_{t}\frac{d\rho_{t}}{d\pi}(x)+\int_{X}\left(\frac{d\rho_{t}}{d\pi}(x)-\frac{d\rho_{t}}{d\pi}(y)\right)\eta(x,y)d\pi(y)=0\qquad(\dagger) \] where $X$ is either $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ or $\mathbb{T}^{d}$, $\pi$ is a probability distribution on $X$, and $\eta(x,y)$ is a ``transition kernel'' which may be singular as $x\rightarrow y$. For a suitable notion of weak solutions which we discuss below, we show that solutions to these nonlocal diffusion equations can be interpreted as gradient flows of the relative entropy with respect to a certain nonlocal Wasserstein-type metric defined in terms of $\eta$ and $\pi$. These ``nonlocal Wasserstein metrics'' endow the space of probability measures on $X$ with a formal Riemannian structure, thereby providing for us a nonlocal analogue of the \emph{Otto calculus} originally developed in the context of the 2-Wasserstein metric. The class of equations $(\dagger)$ includes a family of ``nonlocal Fokker-Planck equations'', which are thus identified as nonlocal Wasserstein gradient flows of the relative entropy, analogously with the usual Fokker-Planck equation and the $W_{2}$ metric.
  The gradient flow structure we provide allows us to deduce: existence and uniqueness of solutions to ($\dagger$) in a suitable class of weak solutions; stability of solutions in the sense of evolutionary $\Gamma$-convergence, with respect to perturbations of initial condition, reference measure $\pi$, and transition kernel $\eta$; sufficient conditions for exponential convergence to equilibrium, in terms of a nonlocal analogue of the log-Sobolev inequality; as well as the consistency of a finite-volume-type spatial discretization scheme in the $\mathbb{T}^{d}$ case.</description>

      <title>On-Manifold Low-Thrust Rephasing of Quasi-Periodic Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A bi-level optimal control framework is introduced to solve the low-thrust re-phasing problem on quasi-periodic invariant tori in multi-body environments where deviations away from the torus during maneuver are considered unsafe or irresponsible. It is shown for a large class of mechanical systems that conformity to the torus manifold during periods of non-zero control input is infeasible. The most feasible trajectories on the torus surface are generated through the minimization of fictitious control input in the torus space using phase space control variables mapped via the torus function. These reference trajectories are then transitioned to the phase space both through a minimum tracking error homotopy and minimum time patched solutions. Results are compared to torus agnostic low-thrust transfers using measures of fuel consumption, cumulative torus error, and coast time spent on the torus during maneuver. Modifications to the framework are made for the inclusion of quasi-periodically forced dynamical systems. Lastly, minimum time recovery trajectories with free final torus conditions expose the disparity between the proposed framework and torus agnostic approaches. Examples are drawn from the circular and elliptical restricted three-body problems.</description>

      <title>Hankel Singular Value Regularization for Highly Compressible State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks using state space models as layers are well suited for long-range sequence tasks but can be challenging to compress after training. We use that regularizing the sum of Hankel singular values of state space models leads to a fast decay of these singular values and thus to compressible models. To make the proposed Hankel singular value regularization scalable, we develop an algorithm to efficiently compute the Hankel singular values during training iterations by exploiting the specific block-diagonal structure of the system matrices that we use in our state space model parametrization. Experiments on Long Range Arena benchmarks demonstrate that the regularized state space layers are up to 10$\times$ more compressible than standard state space layers while maintaining high accuracy.</description>
