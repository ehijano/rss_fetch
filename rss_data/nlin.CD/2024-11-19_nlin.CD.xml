      <title>Computer-aided analysis of high-dimensional Glass networks: periodicity, chaos, and bifurcations in a ring circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glass networks model systems of variables that interact via sharp switching. A body of theory has been developed over several decades that, in principle, allows rigorous proof of dynamical properties in high dimensions that is not normally feasible in nonlinear dynamical systems. Previous work has, however, used examples of dimension no higher than 6 to illustrate the methods. Here we show that the same tools can be applied in dimensions at least as high as 20. An important application of Glass networks is to a recently-proposed design of a True Random Number Generator that is based on an intrinsically chaotic electronic circuit. In order for analysis to be meaningful for the application, the dimension must be at least 20. Bifurcation diagrams show what appear to be periodic and chaotic bands. Here we demonstrate that the analytic tools for Glass networks can be used to rigorously show where periodic orbits are lost, and the types of bifurcations that occur there. The main tools are linear algebra and the stability theory of Poincar\'e maps. All main steps can be automated, and we provide computer code. The methods reviewed here have the potential for many other applications involving sharply switching interactions, such as artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Chaos and Extended Self-Similarity of Bose Einstein Condensates in a 1D Harmonic Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spatiotemporal chaos in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) confined by a 1D harmonic trap using Gross-Pitaevskii equation simulations. The chaos arises from nonlinear mixing of ground and excited states, confirmed by positive Lyapunov exponents. By sampling the density field at intervals matching the center-of-mass oscillation period, we analyze the density structure function. Both spatial and temporal density structure functions reveal Kolmogorov-like scaling through extended self-similarity (ESS). Our findings suggest that ESS and density structure functions provide experimentally accessible tools to explore spatiotemporal chaos and turbulence-like behavior in BECs.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Remote Synchronization: An Experimental Approach with Nonlinear Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates remote synchronization in arbitrary network clusters of coupled nonlinear oscillators, a phenomenon inspired by neural synchronization in the brain. Employing a multi-faceted approach encompassing analytical, numerical, and experimental methodologies, we leverage the Master Stability Function (MSF) to analyze network stability. We provide experimental evidence of remote synchronization between two clusters of nonlinear oscillators, where oscillators within each cluster are also remotely connected. This observation parallels the thalamus-mediated synchronization of neuronal populations in the brain. An electronic circuit testbed, supported by nonlinear ODE modeling and LT Spice simulation, was developed to validate our theoretical predictions. Future work will extend this investigation to encompass diverse network topologies and explore potential applications in neuroscience, communication networks, and power systems.</description>

      <title>The topology of a chaotic attractor in the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Birman-Williams theorem gives a connection between the collection of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) contained within a chaotic attractor and the topology of that attractor, for three-dimensional systems. In certain cases, the fractal dimension of a chaotic attractor in a partial differential equation (PDE) is less than three, even though that attractor is embedded within an infinite-dimensional space. Here we study the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky PDE at the onset of chaos. We use two different dimensionality-reduction techniques -- proper orthogonal decomposition and an autoencoder neural network -- to find two different mappings of the chaotic attractor into three dimensions. By finding the image of the attractor's UPOs in these reduced spaces and examining their linking numbers, we construct templates for the branched manifold which encodes the topological properties of the attractor. The templates obtained using two different dimensionality reduction methods are equivalent. The organization of the periodic orbits is identical and consistent symbolic sequences for low-period UPOs are derived. While this is not a formal mathematical proof, this agreement is strong evidence that the dimensional reduction is robust, in this case, and that an accurate topological characterization of the chaotic attractor of the chaotic PDE has been achieved.</description>

      <title>Self-trapping phenomenon, multistability and chaos in open anisotropic Dicke dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate semiclassical dynamics of a coupled atom-photon interacting system described by a dimer of anisotropic Dicke model in the presence of photon loss, exhibiting a rich variety of non-linear dynamics. Based on symmetries and dynamical classification, we characterize and chart out various dynamical phases in a phase diagram. A key feature of this system is the multistability of different dynamical states, particularly the coexistence of various superradiant phases as well as limit cycles. Remarkably, this dimer system manifests self-trapping phenomena, resulting in a photon population imbalance between the cavities. Such a self-trapped state arises from a saddle-node bifurcation, which can be understood from an equivalent Landau-Ginzburg description. Additionally, we identify a unique class of oscillatory dynamics self-trapped limit cycle, hosting self-trapping of photons. The absence of stable dynamical phases leads to the onset of chaos, which is diagnosed using the saturation value of the decorrelator dynamics. Moreover, the self-trapped states can coexist with chaotic attractor, which may have intriguing consequences in quantum dynamics. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</description>
