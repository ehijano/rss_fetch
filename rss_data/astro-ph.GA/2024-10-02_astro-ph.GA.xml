      <title>Reconstructing the Assembly of Massive Galaxies. III: Quiescent Galaxies Loose Angular Momentum as They Evolve in a Mass-dependent Fashion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of stellar kinematics of a sample of 952 massive quiescent galaxies with $M_*&gt;10^{10.5}M_\odot$ at $0.6&lt;z&lt;1$. Utilizing spatially integrated spectroscopy from the LEGA-C survey, we focus on the relationship between the observed integrated stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma^\prime_{star}$) and the morphological axial ratio ($q$), and its variation with the stellar age and mass of quiescent galaxies. For the youngest quiescent galaxies, regardless of stellar mass, $\sigma^\prime_{star}$ decreases with increasing $q$, a trend that is consistent with a system having significant rotation and hence suggests that massive galaxies still retain significant amount of angular momentum in the aftermath of quenching. As they continue to evolve, the variation of the $\sigma^\prime_{star}$-$q$ relationship depends on stellar mass. For quiescent galaxies with $M_*&lt;10^{11.3}M_\odot$, $\sigma^\prime_{star}$ decreases with $q$ in all stellar-age bins, suggesting that the quiescent populations of this mass regime retain significant rotation even long time after quenching. In contrast, for more massive quiescent galaxies with $M_*&gt;10^{11.3}M_\odot$, the relationship between $\sigma^\prime_{star}$ and $q$ becomes significantly flattened with increasing stellar age. This indicates that, as the very massive galaxy populations continue to evolve after quenching, angular momentum gradually reduces, which eventually transforms them into velocity-dispersion supported systems. We suggest that incoherent, continuous merging and accretion events onto the galaxies are the main drivers of the observed mass-dependent, posting-quenching dynamical evolution, because more massive galaxies are more likely to undergo such interactions. We are witnessing the early formation epoch of fast and slow rotators at $z \sim 0.8$, when the Universe was only half of its age nowadays.</description>

      <title>An Investigation Into The Selection and Colors of Little Red Dots and Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a large number of compact sources at $z &gt; 4$ with blue UV slopes and extremely red rest-frame optical slopes have been found in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) extragalactic surveys. As a subsample of these sources, commonly called ``little red dots'' (LRDs), have been spectroscopically observed to host a broad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), they have been the focus of multiple recent studies in an attempt to understand the origin of their UV and optical emission. Here, we assemble a sample of 123 LRDs from the literature along with spectroscopic and photometric JWST-identified samples of AGNs to compare their colors and spectral slopes. We find that while obscured AGNs at $z &lt; 6$ have highly dissimilar colors to LRDs, unobscured AGNs at $z &lt; 6$ span a wide range of colors, with only a subsample showing colors similar to LRDs. At $z &gt; 6$, the majority of the unobscured AGNs that have been found in these samples are LRDs, but this may be related to the fact that these sources are at large bolometric luminosities. Because LRDs occupy a unique position in galaxy color space, they are more straightforward to target, and the large number of broad-line AGNs that do not have LRD colors and slopes are therefore underrepresented in many spectroscopic surveys because they are more difficult to pre-select. Current LRD selection techniques return a large and disparate population, including many sources having $2-5\mu$m colors impacted by emission line flux boosting in individual filters.</description>

      <title>Crimson Behemoth: a Massive Clumpy Structure Hosting a Dusty AGN at $z=4.91$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current paradigm for the co-evolution of galaxies and their supermassive black holes postulates that dust-obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) represent a transitional phase towards a more luminous and unobscured state. However, our understanding of dusty AGNs and their host galaxies at early cosmic times is inadequate due to observational limitations. Here, we present JWST observations of CID-931, an X-ray-detected AGN at a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\rm spec}=4.91$. Multiband NIRCam imaging from the COSMOS-Web program reveals an unresolved red core, similar to JWST-discovered dusty AGNs. Strikingly, the red core is surrounded by at least eight massive star-forming clumps spread over $1.\!\!^{\prime\prime}6 \approx 10~{\rm kpc}$, each of which has a stellar mass of $10^9-10^{10}M_\odot$ and $\sim0.1-1~{\rm kpc}$ in radius. The whole system amounts to $10^{11}M_\odot$ in stellar mass, higher than typical star-forming galaxies at the same epoch. In this system, gas inflows and/or complex merger events may trigger clump formation and AGN activity thus leading to the rapid formation of a massive galaxy hosting a supermassive black hole. Future follow-up observations will provide new insights into the evolution of the galaxy-black hole relationship during such transitional phases in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Untangling Stellar Components of Galaxies: Evaluation of Dynamical Decomposition Methods in Simulated Galaxies with GalaxyChop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy formation is intrinsically connected to the distinct evolutionary processes of disk and spheroidal systems, which are the fundamental stellar components of galaxies. Understanding the mutual dynamical interplay and co-evolution of these components requires a detailed dynamical analysis to allow for a disentanglement between them. We introduce JEHistogram, a new method for the dynamical decomposition of simulated galaxies into disk and spheroidal stellar components, utilizing the angular momentum and energy of star particles. We evaluate its performance against five previously established methods using a sample of equilibrium galaxies with stellar masses in the range $10^{10} \leq M_\mathrm{gal}/M_\odot \leq 10^{12}$. Our assessment involves several metrics, including the completeness and purity of stellar particle classification, scale lengths, mass density profiles, velocity dispersion, and rotational velocity profiles. While all methods approximate the properties of the original components, such as mass fractions and density or velocity profiles, JEHistogram demonstrates a better accuracy, particularly in the inner regions of galaxies where component overlap complicates separation. Additionally, we apply JEHistogram to a Milky Way-like galaxy from the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, showcasing its capability to derive properties like size, mass, velocity, color, and age of dynamically defined disk and spheroidal components. All dynamical decomposition methods analyzed are publicly accessible through the Python package GalaxyChop.</description>

      <title>Metallicity calibrations based on auroral lines from PHANGS-MUSE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a chemical analysis of selected HII regions from the PHANGS-MUSE nebular catalogue. Our intent is to empirically re-calibrate strong-line diagnostics of gas-phase metallicity, applicable across a wide range of metallicities within nearby star-forming galaxies. To ensure reliable measurements of auroral line fluxes, we carried out a new spectral fitting procedure whereby only restricted wavelength regions around the emission lines of interest are taken into account: this assures a better fit for the stellar continuum. No prior cuts to nebulae luminosity were applied to limit biases in auroral line detections. Ionic abundances of O+, O++, N+, S+, and S++ were estimated by applying the direct method. We integrated the selected PHANGS-MUSE sample with other existing auroral line catalogues, appropriately re-analysed to obtain a homogeneous dataset. This was used to derive strong-line diagnostic calibrations that span from 12+log(O/H) = 7.5 to 8.8. We investigate their dependence on the ionisation parameter and conclude that it is likely the primary cause of the significant scatter observed in these diagnostics. We apply our newly calibrated strong-line diagnostics to the total sample of HII regions from the PHANGS-MUSE nebular catalogue, and we exploit these indirect metallicity estimates to study the radial metallicity gradient within each of the 19 galaxies of the sample. We compare our results with the literature and find good agreement, validating our procedure and findings. With this paper, we release the full catalogue of auroral and nebular line fluxes for the selected HII regions from the PHANGS-MUSE nebular catalogue. This is the first catalogue of direct chemical abundance measurements carried out with PHANGS-MUSE data.</description>

      <title>The AURORA Survey: An Extraordinarily Mature, Star-forming Galaxy at $z\sim 7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the properties of a massive, large, dusty, metal-rich, star-forming galaxy at z_spec=6.73. GOODSN-100182 was observed with JWST/NIRSpec as part of the AURORA survey, and is also covered by public multi-wavelength HST and JWST imaging. While the large mass of GOODSN-100182 (~10^10 M_sun) was indicated prior to JWST, NIRCam rest-optical imaging now reveals the presence of an extended disk (r_eff~1.5 kpc). In addition, the NIRSpec R~1000 spectrum of GOODSN-100182 includes the detection of a large suite of rest-optical nebular emission lines ranging in wavelength from [OII]3727 up to [NII]6583. The ratios of Balmer lines suggest significant dust attenuation (E(B-V)_gas=0.40+0.10/-0.09), consistent with the red rest-UV slope inferred for GOODSN-100182 (beta=-0.50+/-0.09). The star-formation rate based on dust-corrected H-alpha emission is log(SFR(H-alpha)/ M_sun/yr)=2.02+0.13/-0.14, well above the z~7 star-forming main sequence in terms of specific SFR. Strikingly, the ratio of [NII]6583/H-alpha emission suggests almost solar metallicity, as does the ratio ([OIII]5007/H-beta)/([NII]6583/H-alpha) and the detection of the faint [FeII]4360 emission feature, whereas the [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 ratio suggests roughly 50% solar metallicity. Overall, the excitation and ionization properties of GOODSN-100182 more closely resemble those of typical star-forming galaxies at z~2-3 rather than z~7. Based on public spectroscopy of the GOODS-N field, we find that GOODSN-100182 resides within a significant galaxy overdensity, and is accompanied by a spectroscopically-confirmed neighbor galaxy. GOODSN-100182 demonstrates the existence of mature, chemically-enriched galaxies within the first billion years of cosmic time, whose properties must be explained by galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Increased Burstiness at High Redshift in Multi-Physics Models Combining Supernova Feedback, Radiative Transfer and Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study star formation variability, or burstiness, as a method to constrain and compare different galaxy formation models at high redshift using the Azahar simulation suite. The models range from magneto-hydrodynamics with a magneto-thermo-turbulent prescription for star formation (iMHD) to more sophisticated setups incorporating radiative transfer (RTiMHD) and cosmic ray physics (RTnsCRiMHD). Analysing a sample of galaxies at redshifts $z=4-10$, we find that the RTnsCRiMHD model exhibits more regular star formation periodicity compared to iMHD and RTiMHD, as revealed by the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. While the RTiMHD model captures a notable degree of stochasticity in star formation without cosmic rays, RTnsCRiMHD galaxies display even greater scatter in the burst intensity and in the scatter around the star-forming main sequence. To evaluate the burstiness in RTnsCRiMHD against observations, we generate a mock spectrum during a mini-quenching event at $z=7.5$. This spectrum aligns well with the low-mass quiescent galaxy JADES-GS-z7-01-QU observed at $z=7.3$, though some discrepancies attributed to stellar metallicity hint at a composite spectrum. Our findings highlight the importance of including complex physical processes like cosmic rays and radiative transfer in simulations to accurately capture the bursty nature of star formation in high-redshift galaxies. Future JWST observations, particularly regarding the scatter around the star-forming main sequence, have the potential to refine and guide the next generation of galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>The distant Milky Way halo from the Southern hemisphere: Characterization of the LMC-induced dynamical-friction wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infall of the LMC into the Milky Way's halo impacts the distribution of stars and dark matter in our Galaxy. Mapping the observational consequences of this encounter can inform us about the properties of both galaxies, details of their interaction, and possibly even distinguish between different dark matter models. N-body simulations predict large-scale density asymmetries in the Galactic halo both in baryonic and dark matter due to the passage of the LMC, with the overdensity directly trailing its current orbit through the Southern hemisphere known as the wake. Using the VIRCAM and DECam instruments, we collected wide-field deep near-infrared and optical photometry in four fields chosen to cover the region of the sky expected to span most of the predicted density contrast of the wake. We identify more than 400 stars comprising two different tracers, near main sequence turn-off stars and red giants, that map the distant halo between $\sim 60$ - $100$ kpc, and use them to derive stellar halo densities as a function of position in the sky and Galactocentric radius. We detect (1) a break in the radial density profile of halo stars at 70 kpc that has not been seen in halo studies done from the North, and (2) a clear halo overdensity that starts also at 70 kpc and exhibits a density contrast that increases steadily when moving across the sky into the predicted current location of the LMC wake. If identifying this overdensity with the LMC wake, the peak density contrast we measure is more pronounced than in all available models of the LMC infall, which would indicate the need for a more massive LMC and/or with a different orbit than presently favored. Alternatively, contamination from unidentified substructure may be biasing our detections, so wider-area surveys with similar depth would be needed for confirmation.</description>

      <title>SILCC -- VIII: The impact of far-ultraviolet radiation on star formation and the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star formation in the multiphase interstellar medium to quantify the impact of non-ionising far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation. This study is carried out within the framework of the \textsc{Silcc Project}. It incorporates the radiative transfer of ionising radiation and self-consistent modelling of variable FUV radiation from star clusters. Near young star clusters, the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) can reach values of $G_0 \approx 10^4$ (in Habing units), far exceeding the canonical solar neighbourhood value of $G_0 = 1.7$. However, our findings suggest that FUV radiation has minimal impact on the integrated star formation rate compared to other feedback mechanisms such as ionising radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae. Only a slight decrease in star formation burstiness, related to increased photoelectric heating efficiency by the variable FUV radiation field, is detectable. Dust near star-forming regions can be heated up to 60 K via the photoelectric (PE) effect, showing a broad temperature distribution. PE heating rates for variable FUV radiation models show higher peak intensities but lower average heating rates than static ISRF models. Simulations of solar neighbourhood conditions without stellar winds or ionising radiation but with self-consistent ISRF and supernovae show high star formation rates $\sim10^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}$, contradicting expectations. Our chemical analysis reveals increased cold neutral medium volume-filling factors (VFF) outside the vicinity of stellar clusters with a variable ISRF. Simultaneously, the thermally unstable gas is reduced, and a sharper separation of warm and cold gas phases is observed. The variable FUV field also promotes a diffuse molecular gas phase with VFF of $\sim5-10$~per cent.</description>

      <title>Compact and High Excitation Molecular Clumps in the Extended Ultraviolet Disk of M83</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended ultraviolet (XUV) disks of nearby galaxies show ongoing massive star formation, but their parental molecular clouds remain mostly undetected despite searches in CO(1-0) and CO(2-1). The recent detection of 23 clouds in the higher excitation transition CO(3-2) within the XUV disk of M83 requires an explanation. We test the hypothesis: the clouds in XUV disks have a clump-envelope structure similar to those in Galactic star-forming clouds, having star-forming dense clumps (or concentrations of multiple clumps) at their centers, which predominantly contribute to the CO(3-2) emission, surrounded by less-dense envelopes, where CO molecules are photo-dissociated due to the low-metallicity environment there. We utilize new high-resolution ALMA CO(3-2) observations of a subset (11) of the 23 clouds in the XUV disk. We confirm the compactness of the CO(3-2)-emitting dense clumps (or their concentrations), finding clump diameters below the spatial resolution of 6-9~pc. This is similar to the size of the dense gas region in the Orion A molecular cloud, the local star-forming cloud with massive star formation. The dense star-forming clumps are common between normal and XUV disks. This may also indicate that once the cloud structure is set, the process of star formation is governed by the cloud internal physics rather than by external triggers. This simple model explains the current observations of the clouds with ongoing massive star formation, although it may require some adjustment, e.g., including an effect of cloud evolution, for a general scenario of star formation in molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>CLASSY XI: Tracing Neutral Gas Properties using UV Absorption Lines and 21-cm Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations from JWST are revolutionizing our understanding of the high-z galaxies that drove reionization and the mechanisms by which they accomplished it. To fully interpret these observations, we must be able to diagnose how properties of the interstellar medium (ISM; e.g., column density, covering fraction, outflow velocity) directly relate to the absorption features produced. Using the high-S/N and high-resolution FUV spectra of 45 nearby star-forming galaxies from CLASSY, we present the largest uniform, simultaneous characterization of neutral and low-ionization state (LIS) interstellar UV absorption lines (OI, SiII, SII, CII, AlII) across a wide range of galaxy properties. We also present 21-cm HI observations for 35 galaxies, multiple of which are gas-poor or non-detected, possibly indicating the onset of a post-starburst phase. We find that our simultaneous 1-component Voigt profile fits are capable of accurately modeling the LIS absorption for ~75% of galaxies, mitigating challenges associated with saturation, infilling, and degeneracies. While the most massive galaxies require additional components, our 1-component fits return average properties of the absorbing gas and follow the scaling relations described by a single gas cloud. We explore connections between LIS absorption and direct tracers of the neutral ISM (OI, Ly-alpha, HI 21-cm), finding that CII most closely traces the neutral gas trends while other ions exhibit weaker correlations. Given the challenges with directly observing HI at higher-z, we demonstrate that LIS absorption can be a powerful means to study the neutral ISM and present empirical relationships for predicting neutral gas properties.</description>

      <title>Discovering Large-Scale Structure at $2&lt;z&lt;5$ in the C3VO Survey</title>

Abstract: The Charting Cluster Construction with VUDS and ORELSE (C3VO) survey is an ongoing imaging and spectroscopic campaign aiming to map out the growth of structure up to $z\sim5$ and was born from the combination of the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS) and the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey. As we previously accomplished with the ORELSE survey, we apply our technique known as Voronoi tessellation Monte-Carlo (VMC) mapping to search for serendipitous galaxy overdensities at $2&lt;z&lt;5$ in the three C3VO fields. We also apply the same technique to mock observations of simulated galaxies with properties derived from the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) semi-analytic model (SAM) in order to judge the effectiveness of our as a function of redshift, total mass, and fraction of spectroscopic redshifts. We find typical completeness and purity values of the order 30-50%, with a strong dependence on mass and redshift, with values as high as $\sim$80% and $\sim$70%, respectively, in the best-case scenario for $\log (M_{z=0}/M_{\odot}) &gt; 14$. In the C3VO fields, we were able to recover many of the previously known structures in the literature as well as find hundreds of new overdensity candidates, once again demonstrating the powerful capabilities of VMC mapping when applied to wide-field optical and infrared galaxy evolution surveys at ever higher redshifts.</description>

      <title>Does the HCN/CO ratio trace the fraction of gravitationally-bound gas? II. Variations in CO and HCN Emissivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model emissivities of the HCN and CO $J=1-0$ transitions using measured properties of clouds found in normal star forming galaxies and more extreme systems. These models are compared with observations of HCN and CO $J=1-0$ transitions. We combine these model emissivities with predictions of gravoturbulent models of star formation, explore the impact of excitation and optical depth on CO and HCN emission, and assess if observed HCN/CO ratios track the fraction of gravitationally-bound dense gas, $f_\mathrm{grav}$, in molecular clouds. Our modeled HCN/CO ratios and emissivities are consistent with measurements from observations. CO emission shows a range of optical depths across different environments, from optically thick in normal galaxies to moderately optically thin in extreme systems. HCN is only moderately optically thick, with significant subthermal excitation in both normal and extreme galaxies. We find an anticorrelation between HCN/CO and $f_\mathrm{grav}$ as predicted by gravoturbulent models of star formation. Instead this ratio tracks gas at moderate densities ($n&gt;10^{3.5}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$), which is below the standard dense gas threshold of $n&gt;10^{4.5}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Variations in CO emissivity depend strongly on optical depth, due to variations in the dynamics of the cloud gas. HCN emissivity depends more strongly on excitation, and thus does not directly track variations in CO emissivity. We conclude that a single line ratio, such as HCN/CO, will not consistently track the fraction of gravitationally-bound, star-forming gas if the critical density for star formation varies in molecular clouds. This work highlights important uncertainties that need to be considered when observationally applying an HCN conversion factor in order to estimate the dense (i.e. $n&gt;10^{4.5}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$) gas content in nearby galaxies.</description>

      <title>Galactic center G objects as dust-enshrouded stars near the supermassive black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we revisit the model of a dust-enshrouded star orbiting a low-luminosity galactic nucleus (Zajacek et al. 2014, 2016, 2017). Although it is quite challenging for dust to survive in hot X-ray-emitting plasma surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBHs), we now have an observational evidence that compact dusty objects or ``G'' objects can approach the SMBH in the Galactic center (Sgr A*) on the scale of a few 1000 gravitational radii. Since there are about ten G objects in the Galactic center, it is more likely that they are dust-enshrouded stars whose gaseous-dusty envelopes are stable within the corresponding tidal (Hill) radii of the order of a few astronomical units. Such a length-scale is consistent with their infrared broad-band spectral energy distributions. Broad emission lines, in particular Br-gamma recombination line, can be interpreted to arise within the accretion stream from the circumstellar envelopes forming a compact disc that is truncated by the stellar magnetic field. Alternatively, they could also be associated with circumstellar accretion-disc outflows as well as the material within a denser bow shock ahead of the star. In comparison with the line origin in the photoionized envelopes that can generally be tidally stretched, the scenario involving the circumstellar accretion-disc inflow or outflow can ensure that the line luminosity is rather stable, except for the viewing-angle effects. We speculate about the origin of dust-enshrouded stars that could be young stellar objects or binary-merger products.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Weak AGNs from Super-Eddington Accretion onto Infant Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple model for the X-ray weakness of JWST-selected broad-line AGNs is proposed under the assumption that the majority of these sources are fed at super-Eddington accretion rates. In these conditions, the hot inner corona above the geometrically thin disk that is responsible for the emission of X-rays in "normal" AGNs will be embedded instead in a funnel-like reflection geometry. The coronal plasma will Compton upscatter optical/UV photons from the underlying thick disk as well as the surrounding funnel walls, and the high soft-photon energy density will cool down the plasma to temperatures in the range 30-40 keV. The resulting X-ray spectra are predicted to be extremely soft, with power-law photon indices Gamma=2.8-4.0, making high-z super-Eddington AGNs largely undetectable by Chandra.</description>

      <title>Discovery of interstellar 1-cyanopyrene: a four-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon in TMC-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are thought to be the most abundant class of molecules in space, yet their interstellar lifecycle is poorly understood due to difficulties detecting individual PAHs. Here, we present the discovery of 1-cyanopyrene, a 4-ring PAH, in the dense cloud TMC-1 using the 100-m Green Bank Telescope. We derive an abundance of ~1.52 x 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, estimating that pyrene accounts for up to 0.03-0.3% of the carbon in TMC-1 and up to 1% within comets. Our findings agree with analysis of pyrene from asteroid Ryugu, which suggests a cold, interstellar origin. The abundance indicates pyrene is an "island of stability" in interstellar PAH chemistry, and suggests that the carbon supplied to planetary systems, carried by PAHs, originates in cold clouds.</description>

      <title>Detections of interstellar 2-cyanopyrene and 4-cyanopyrene in TMC-1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most ubiquitous compounds in the universe, accounting for up to ~25% of all interstellar carbon. Since most unsubstituted PAHs do not possess permanent dipole moments, they are invisible to radio astronomy. Constraining their abundances relies on the detection of polar chemical proxies, such as aromatic nitriles. We report the detection of 2- and 4-cyanopyrene, isomers of the recently detected 1-cyanopyrene. We find that these isomers are present in an abundance ratio of ~2:1:2, which mirrors the number of equivalent sites available for CN addition. We conclude that there is evidence that the cyanopyrene isomers formed by direct CN addition to pyrene under kinetic control in hydrogen-rich gas at 10 K and discuss constraints on the H/CN ratio for PAHs in TMC-1.</description>

      <title>Energy equipartition in Globular Clusters through the eyes of dynamical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational encounters drive globular clusters toward energy equipartition, mass segregation and evaporation altering structural, spatial and kinematic features. We determine the dynamical state of a few globular clusters by means of a multi-mass King-like dynamical model, focusing on the energy equipartition degree and its relation with model parameters. We fit the observed velocity dispersion, as derived from HST proper motion data, as a function of the stellar mass $\sigma(m)$, to estimate the parameter $\Phi_0$, a measure of the gravitational potential well. The same fit is repeated by means of the Bianchini relation, providing the equipartition mass $m_\mathrm{eq}$. The relationship between $\Phi_0$ and $m_\mathrm{eq}$ has been studied and the structural properties, such as concentration $c$, number of core relaxation timescales $N_\mathrm{core}$ and core radius $r_\mathrm{c}$, are discussed. To obtain an independent estimate of $\Phi_0$, we fit observed surface brightness profiles by using the predicted surface density and a mass-luminosity relation from isochrones. The quality of the fits on $\sigma(m)$ obtained by means of our dynamical model is comparable to those obtained with the Bianchini function. Nonetheless, when the Bianchini function is used to fit the projected velocity dispersion, the resulting degree of equipartition is underestimated. On the contrary, our approach provides the equipartition degree at any radial or projected distance by means of $\Phi_0$. As a result, a cluster in a more advanced dynamical state shows a larger $\Phi_0$, as well as larger $N_\mathrm{core}$ and $c$, while $r_\mathrm{c}$ decreases. The estimates of $\Phi_0$ obtained by fitting surface brightness profiles result compatible at $2\sigma$ confidence level with those from internal kinematics, although further investigation of statistical and systematic errors is required.</description>

      <title>Astraeus X: Indications of a top-heavy initial mass function in highly star-forming galaxies from JWST observations at z&gt;10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered an abundance of $z&gt;10$ galaxies bright in the ultraviolet (UV) that has challenged traditional theoretical models at high redshifts. Recently, various new models have emerged to address this discrepancy by refining their description of star formation. Here we investigate whether modifications to the stellar initial mass function (IMF) alone can reproduce the $z&gt;10$ UV luminosity functions (UV LFs) when the star formation rate is used as a proxy for the fraction of massive stars. We incorporate an Evolving IMF into the {\sc astraeus} galaxy evolution and reionisation simulation framework, which becomes increasingly top-heavy as the gas density in a galaxy rises above a given threshold. Our implementation accounts for the IMF's effects on supernova (SN) feedback, metal enrichment, and the UV and ionising emissivities. For this Evolving IMF model, we find that (i) the maximum UV luminosity enhancement is twice as large in massive galaxies ($\Delta M_\mathrm{UV}\simeq2.6$) than those where star formation is strongly limited by SN feedback ($\Delta M_\mathrm{UV}\simeq1.3$); (ii) it successfully reproduces the observed UV LFs at $z=5-15$; (iii) galaxies with top-heavy IMFs exhibit the highest star formation rates, driven by their location in local density peaks, which facilitates higher gas accretion rates; (iv) the $1\sigma$ variances in the UV luminosity are only slightly higher compared to when assuming a Salpeter IMF, but the $2\sigma$ variances are significantly increased by a factor of $1.4-2$ boosting the abundance of UV-bright galaxies at $z&gt;10$; (v) reionisation begins earlier with more extended large ionised regions and fewer smaller ones during its initial stages, though these differences diminish at lower redshifts, leading to a similar end of reionisation at $z\simeq5.6$.}</description>

      <title>Reconstructing galaxy star formation histories from COSMOS2020 photometry using simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to reconstruct the full posterior distribution of the star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies from broad-band photometry. Our method combines simulation-based inference (SBI) using a neural network trained with SFHs and photometry from the {\sc Horizon-AGN} hydrodynamical cosmological simulation. We apply it to reconstruct SFHs using COSMOS2020 photometry at redshift $0&lt;z&lt;3$. We are able to accurately estimate the SFH and quantify the uncertainty on simulated data, with an unbiased posterior mean and well calibrated credible intervals. Our SFHs are in broad agreement with independent literature measurements The SFHs of galaxies as a function of location in the $\mathrm{NUV}-r$ versus $r-J$ diagram are in agreement with expectations. We extract summary statistics to quantify the shape of the SFH, number of peaks, and formation redshift. The slopes of the SFHs of passive galaxies show only a weak trend with stellar mass at $z&lt;1.35$ but a significant scatter, indicating that other factors than mass could drive the suppression of star-formation. Nevertheless, star-forming galaxies show a clear mass-dependent SFH, with lower-mass galaxies undergoing more vigorous recent star-formation. Low-mass galaxies have more peaks in their mass assembly histories than high-mass ones. At a given mass, we find many different formation redshifts, but for passive galaxies the mass dependency of formation redshifts is weak. Most passive galaxies with stellar mass $\log M_*/M_\odot &gt; 9$ had a first event of mass assembly around $z\sim 3$, independent of mass. This work represents a pilot study for the future analysis of the \textit{Euclid} Deep fields that will reach similar depths in alike set of photometric bands, but with over an order-of-magnitude larger area, opening the possibility of deriving SFHs for millions of galaxies in a robust manner.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning solutions to singular problems: from special functions to spherical accretion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singular regular points often arise in differential equations describing physical phenomena such as fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and gravitation. Traditional numerical techniques often fail or become unstable near these points, requiring the use of semi-analytical tools, such as series expansions and perturbative methods, in combination with numerical algorithms; or to invoke more sophisticated methods. In this work, we take an alternative route and leverage the power of machine learning to exploit Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a modern approach to solving differential equations with singular points. PINNs utilize deep learning architectures to approximate solutions by embedding the differential equations into the loss function of the neural network. We discuss the advantages of PINNs in handling singularities, particularly their ability to bypass traditional grid-based methods and provide smooth approximations across irregular regions. Techniques for enhancing the accuracy of PINNs near singular points, such as adaptive loss weighting, are used in order to achieve high efficiency in the training of the network. We exemplify our results by studying four differential equations of interest in mathematics and gravitation -- the Legendre equation, the hypergeometric equation, the solution for black hole space-times in theories of Lorentz violating gravity, and the spherical accretion of a perfect fluid in a Schwarzschild geometry.</description>

      <title>Where has all the $r$-process gone? Timescales for GRB-Kilonovae to Enrich their Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron star (NS) mergers are currently the only observed source of r-process production in the Universe. Yet, it is unclear how much r-process mass from these mergers is incorporated into star-forming gas to enrich stars. This is crucial to consider as all other r-process mass estimates in the Universe beyond Earth are based on stellar r-process abundances. Here, we explore the extent to which merger location and host galaxy properties affect the incorporation of r-process elements into star-forming gas, and quantify an ``enrichment" timescale to account for this process. To put this timescale in context, we analyze a population of 12 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with probable associations to r-process kilonovae (GRB-KNe) and 74 short GRBs without claimed KNe, including new non-parametric star formation histories for the GRB-KN hosts. We find enrichment timescales for this sample are between ~7 Myr-1.6 Gyr, suggesting that environmental enrichment is delayed from NS merger occurrence. Moreover, we find a correlation between the amount of environmental enrichment from a single event and increasing host specific star formation rate (sSFR), and little correlation with stellar mass and GRB galactocentric offset. Environments with low sSFRs (&lt;10^-10.5 yr^-1), which comprise 18% of short GRB hosts and the host of GW170817, will have little to no capacity for enrichment. Our results indicate that not all r-process from NS mergers enriches star-forming gas, and instead some is lost to the CGM or IGM. Future studies should consider these losses to understand the total contribution from NS mergers to the Universe's r-process budget.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel, model-independent technique for fitting the cross-component of weak lensing shear, $\gamma_\times$, along a line of sight by combining kinematic and photometric measurements of a single lensed galaxy. Rather than relying on parametric models, we fit for the shear parameter that best transforms the velocity field to restore its underlying symmetries, while also incorporating photometric data for the change in position angle due to shear. We first validate our technique with idealized mock data, exploring the method's response to variations in shear, position angle, inclination, and noise. On this idealized mock data, our combined kinematic and photometric model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional parametric or kinematic-only approaches. Subsequently, we apply our method to a dataset of 358 halos from the Illustris TNG simulations, achieving a notable reduction in the uncertainty of $\gamma_\times$ to 0.039, marking a substantial improvement over previous analysis of the dataset with a parametric model. Finally, we introduce an outlier rejection method based on Moran's I-test for spatial autocorrelation. Identifying and filtering out halos with spatially correlated residuals reduces the overall uncertainty to 0.028. Our results underscore the efficacy of combining kinematic and photometric data for weak lensing studies, providing a more precise and targeted measurement of shear along an individual line of sight.</description>

      <title>Improved Empirical Backgrounds for JWST NIRISS Image/WFSS Data Reduction</title>

Abstract: The Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a versatile instrument for collecting imaging and wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) data for surveys of galaxy clusters, emission-line galaxies, stellar populations, and more. Dispersed zodiacal light imprints distinct structures on space-based near-infrared imaging and WFSS observations, necessitating careful subtraction during JWST NIRISS data reduction. As of 2024-09-24 NIRISS WFSS calibration backgrounds introduce significant spatially-dependent artifacts, up to 5% of the overall background level, which can severely affect data quality and following astronomical analysis. Notably, there are no existing backgrounds for NIRISS imaging data which also show systematic artifacts, such as the `light saber' effect. In this work, we present improved empirical JWST NIRISS imaging and WFSS backgrounds derived from all available public data in the F115W, F150W, and F200W filters. We demonstrate that our empirical backgrounds provide a more accurate representation of the background structure in NIRISS imaging and WFSS data than existing reference files, mitigating the impact of spatially-dependent artifacts. Our empirical backgrounds are publicly available and can be used to improve the quality of JWST NIRISS imaging and WFSS data reduction.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Amplification during Stellar Collisions between Low-Mass Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00148v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blue straggler stars in stellar clusters are a subset of stars that are bluer and appear younger than other cluster members, seemingly straggling behind in their evolution. They offer a unique opportunity to understand the stellar dynamics and populations within their hosts. In the collisional formation scenario, a persistent challenge is the excessive angular momentum in the collision product. The consequent significant mass loss during transition to a stable state leads to a star with too low a mass to be a blue straggler, unless it spins down efficiently. While many proposed spin-down mechanisms involve boosted angular momentum loss via magnetic braking within the collision product, the existence or strength of these magnetic fields has not been confirmed. Here, we report three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of collisions between two low-mass main-sequence stars and investigate magnetic field amplification. Magnetic field energy is amplified by a factor of $10^{8}-10^{10}$, resulting in the magnetic field strength of $10^{7}-10^{8}$G at the core of the collision product, independent of collision parameters. The surface magnetic field strengths have increased up to $10-10^{4}$ G. In addition, a distinctly flattened, rotating gas structure appears around the collision products in off-axis collisions, which may be a hint of possible disk formation. Such significant magnetic amplification and potential disk formation suggest the possibility of efficient spin-down of collision products via magnetic braking and magnetic disk locking, which can result in their appearance as blue stragglers.</description>

      <title>Inner structure of cold and warm dark matter halos from particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the number of apocenter passages $p$ and the radial action $J_r$ of each particle, we characterize the phase-space structure within the multi-stream regions of cold and warm dark matter halos in cosmological $N$-body simulations. Building on previous work by Enomoto et al. (2024), we analyze the radial density profiles of particles classified by $p$ and $J_r$. We find that the profiles consistently follow a double power-law structure, independent of the dark matter model or halo mass. The inner profile exhibits a $\rho \propto r^{-1}$ behavior, which is consistent with previous studies. Notably, this characteristics persist across both classification schemes. In contrast, the outer power-law profiles display distinct behaviors depending on the classification. While particles classified by $p$ exhibit a steeper slope, ranging from $-6$ to $-8$, those classified by $J_r$ follow a common slope of approximately $-3.5$. Overall, the amplitude of the double power-law profiles varies between simulations for different dark matter models, but this variation can be attributed to statistical differences in the concentration of halos across the models.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ly$\alpha$ Emission from Diffuse Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00450v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ly$\alpha$ emission has emerged as a powerful tool for probing diffuse gas within the large-scale structure of the universe. In this paper, we investigate cosmic Ly$\alpha$ emission by post-processing cosmological simulations from \texttt{IllustrisTNG} and \texttt{THESAN} project. Specifically, we calculate the Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies, circum-galactic medium (CGM) and inter-galactic medium (IGM) across various redshifts. Our results show that IGM alone is significantly under the current observational upper limits. Meanwhile, CGM overshoots the observed galaxy contribution at $z \lesssim 0.5$ indicating that either the escape fraction for the inner CGM is less than unity or the current photoionization equilibrium treatment with an approximate self-shielding prescription is less accurate. The galaxy component also overshoots at low redshift, indicating that the escape fraction has strong evolution caused by an evolving halo mass function and dust growth distribution, that agrees with observationally inferred escape fractions. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the Ly$\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas (CGM+IGM) peaked at $z \sim 4$ and diminishes toward lower redshift. The Ly$\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas mainly originates through the collisional excitation of hot plasma. By comparing models with observation, our predicted Ly$\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas remains $\sim 6$ times fainter than the observed cosmic Ly$\alpha$ emission at $z=1-3$. However, future large telescopes may hold great promise to detect Ly$\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas toward $z&gt;3$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Hubble and matter density parameters with and without modelling the CMB anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider constraints on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$ from: (i) the age of the Universe based on old stars and stellar populations in the Galactic disc and halo (Cimatti &amp; Moresco 2023); (ii) the turnover scale in the matter power spectrum, which tells us the cosmological horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality (Philcox et al. 2022); and (iii) the shape of the expansion history from supernovae (SNe) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) with no absolute calibration of either, a technique known as uncalibrated cosmic standards (UCS; Lin, Chen, &amp; Mack 2021). A narrow region is consistent with all three constraints just outside their $1\sigma$ uncertainties. Although this region is defined by techniques unrelated to the physics of recombination and the sound horizon then, the standard $Planck$ fit to the CMB anisotropies falls precisely in this region. This concordance argues against early-time explanations for the anomalously high local estimate of $H_0$ (the 'Hubble tension'), which can only be reconciled with the age constraint at an implausibly low $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$. We suggest instead that outflow from the local KBC supervoid (Keenan, Barger, &amp; Cowie 2013) inflates redshifts in the nearby universe and thus the apparent local $H_0$. Given the difficulties with solutions in the early universe, we argue that the most promising alternative to a local void is a modification to the expansion history at late times, perhaps due to a changing dark energy density.</description>

      <title>The Pristine survey -- XXIII. Data Release 1 and an all-sky metallicity catalogue based on Gaia DR3 BP/RP spectro-photometry</title>

Abstract: We used the spectro-photometric information of ~219 million stars from Gaia's DR3 to calculate synthetic, narrow-band, metallicity-sensitive CaHK magnitudes that mimic the observations of the Pristine survey, a survey of photometric metallicities of Milky Way (MW) stars that has been mapping &gt;6,500 deg^2 of the northern sky with CFHT since 2015. These synthetic magnitudes were used for an absolute recalibration of the deeper Pristine photometry and, combined with broadband Gaia information, synthetic and Pristine CaHK magnitudes were used to estimate photometric metallicities over the whole sky. The resulting metallicity catalogue is accurate down to [Fe/H]~-3.5 and is particularly suited for the exploration of the metal-poor MW ([Fe/H]&lt;-1.0). We make available here the catalogue of synthetic CaHK_syn magnitudes for all stars with BP/RP information in Gaia DR3, as well as an associated catalogue of more than ~30 million photometric metallicities for high S/N FGK stars. This paper further provides the first public data release of the Pristine catalogue in the form of higher quality recalibrated Pristine CaHK magnitudes and photometric metallicities for all stars in common with the BP/RP spectro-photometric information in Gaia DR3. When available, the much deeper Pristine data greatly enhance the quality of the derived metallicities, in particular at the faint end of the catalogue (G_BP &gt; 16). Combined, both photometric metallicity catalogues include more than two million metal-poor star candidates ([Fe/H]_phot&lt;-1.0) as well as more than 200,000 and ~8,000 very and extremely metal-poor candidates ([Fe/H]_phot&lt;-2.0 and &lt;-3.0, respectively). Finally, we show that these metallicity catalogues can be used efficiently, among other applications to hunt for the most metal-poor stars, and to study how the structure of the MW varies with metallicity.</description>

      <title>ODIN: Improved Narrowband Ly$\alpha$ Emitter Selection Techniques for $z$ = 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lyman-Alpha Emitting galaxies (LAEs) are typically young, low-mass, star-forming galaxies with little extinction from interstellar dust. Their low dust attenuation allows their Ly$\alpha$ emission to shine brightly in spectroscopic and photometric observations, providing an observational window into the high-redshift universe. Narrowband surveys reveal large, uniform samples of LAEs at specific redshifts that probe large scale structure and the temporal evolution of galaxy properties. The One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) utilizes three custom-made narrowband filters on the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to discover LAEs at three equally spaced periods in cosmological history. In this paper, we introduce the hybrid-weighted double-broadband continuum estimation technique, which yields improved estimation of Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths. Using this method, we discover 6032, 5691, and 4066 LAE candidates at $z =$ 2.4, 3.1, and 4.5 in the extended COSMOS field ($\sim$9 deg$^2$). We find that [O II] emitters are a minimal contaminant in our LAE samples, but that interloping Green Pea-like [O III] emitters are important for our redshift 4.5 sample. We introduce an innovative method for identifying [O II] and [O III] emitters via a combination of narrowband excess and galaxy colors, enabling their study as separate classes of objects. We present scaled median stacked SEDs for each galaxy sample, revealing the overall success of our selection methods. We also calculate rest-frame Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths for our LAE samples and find that the EW distributions are best fit by exponential functions with scale lengths of $w_0$ = 53 $\pm$ 1, 65 $\pm$ 1, and 59 $\pm$ 1 Angstroms, respectively.</description>

      <title>Complex Velocity Structure of Nebular Gas in Active Galaxies Centred in Cooling X-ray Atmospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: [OII] emission maps obtained with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) are presented for four galaxies centered in cooling X-ray cluster atmospheres. Nebular emission extending tens of kpc is found in systems covering a broad range of atmospheric cooling rates, cluster masses, and dynamical states. Abell 262's central galaxy hosts a kpc-scale disk. The nebular gas in RXJ0820.9+0752 is offset and redshifted with respect to the central galaxy by $10-20$ kpc and 150 km s$^{-1}$, respectively. The nebular gases in PKS 0745-191 and Abell 1835 are being churned to higher velocity dispersion by X-ray bubbles and jets. The churned gas is enveloped by larger scale, lower velocity dispersion (quiescent) nebular emission. The mean line-of-sight speeds of the churned gas, quiescent gas, and the central galaxy each differ by up to $\sim 150$ km s$^{-1}$; nebular speeds upward of $800$ km s$^{-1}$ are found. Gases with outwardly-rising speeds upward of several hundred km s$^{-1}$ are consistent with being advected behind and being lifted by the rising bubbles. The peculiar motion between the galaxy, nebular gas, and perhaps the hot atmosphere from which it presumably condensed is affecting the bubble dynamics, and may strongly affect thermally unstable cooling, the dispersal of jet energy, and the angular momentum of gas accreting onto the galaxies and their nuclear black holes.</description>

Abstract: We describe new ultra-deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec PRISM and grating spectra for the galaxies JADES-GS-z11-0 ($z_{\mathrm{spec}} = 11.122^{+0.005}_{-0.003}$) and JADES-GS-z13-0 ($z_{\mathrm{spec}} = 13.20^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$), the most distant spectroscopically-confirmed galaxy discovered in the first year of JWST observations. The extraordinary depth of these observations (75 hours and 56 hours, respectively) provides a unique opportunity to explore the redshifts, stellar properties, UV magnitudes, and slopes for these two sources. For JADES-GS-z11-0, we find evidence for multiple emission lines, including [\ion{O}{2}]$\lambda\lambda3726,3729$\AA and [\ion{Ne}{3}$]\lambda3869$\AA, resulting in a spectroscopic redshift we determine with 94\% confidence. We present stringent upper limits on the emission line fluxes and line equivalent widths for JADES-GS-z13-0. At this spectroscopic redshift, the Lyman-$\alpha$ break in JADES-GS-z11-0 can be fit with a damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber with $\log{(N_\mathrm{HI}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2})} = 22.42^{+0.093}_{-0.120}$. These results demonstrate how neutral hydrogen fraction and Lyman-damping wings may impact the recovery of spectroscopic redshifts for sources like these, providing insight into the overprediction of the photometric redshifts seen for distant galaxies observed with JWST. In addition, we analyze updated NIRCam photometry to calculate the morphological properties of these resolved sources, and find a secondary source $0.3^{\prime\prime}$ south of JADES-GS-z11-0 at a similar photometric redshift, hinting at how galaxies grow through interactions in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Efficient formation of a massive quiescent galaxy at redshift 4.9</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the established framework of structure formation, galaxies start as systems of low stellar mass and gradually grow into far more massive galaxies. The existence of massive galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe, suggested by recent observations, appears to challenge this model, as such galaxies would require highly efficient conversion of baryons into stars. An even greater challenge in this epoch is the existence of massive galaxies that have already ceased forming stars. However, robust detections of early massive quiescent galaxies have been challenging due to the coarse wavelength sampling of photometric surveys. Here we report the spectroscopic confirmation with the James Webb Space Telescope of the quiescent galaxy RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 at redshift $z=4.90$, 1.2 billion years after the Big Bang. Deep stellar absorption features in the spectrum reveal that the galaxy's stellar mass of $10^{11}\,M_\odot$, corroborated by the mass implied by its gas kinematics, formed in a short $200\,$Myr burst of star formation, after which star formation activity dropped rapidly and persistently. According to current galaxy formation models, systems with such rapid stellar mass growth and early quenching are too rare to plausibly occur in the small area probed spectroscopically with JWST. Instead, the discovery of RUBIES-EGS-QG-1 implies that early massive quiescent galaxies can be quenched earlier or exhaust gas available for star formation more efficiently than currently assumed.</description>

      <title>JADES: Spectroscopic Confirmation and Proper Motion for a T-Dwarf at 2 Kiloparsecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08781</link>

Abstract: Large area observations of extragalactic deep fields with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have provided a wealth of candidate low-mass L- and T-class brown dwarfs. The existence of these sources, which are at derived distances of hundreds of parsecs to several kiloparsecs from the Sun, has strong implications for the low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function, and the link between stars and planets at low metallicities. In this letter, we present a JWST/NIRSpec PRISM spectrum of brown dwarf JADES-GS-BD-9, confirming its photometric selection from observations taken as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. Fits to this spectrum indicate that the brown dwarf has an effective temperature of 800-900K (T5 - T6) at a distance of $1.8 - 2.3$kpc from the Sun, with evidence of the source being at low metallicity ([M/H] $\leq -0.5$). Finally, because of the cadence of JADES NIRCam observations of this source, we additionally uncover a proper motion between the 2022 and 2023 centroids, and we measure a proper motion of $20 \pm 4$ mas yr$^{-1}$ (a transverse velocity of 214 km s$^{-1}$ at 2.25 kpc). At this predicted metallicity, distance, and transverse velocity, it is likely that this source belongs either to the edge of the Milky Way thick disk or the galactic halo. This spectral confirmation demonstrates the efficacy of photometric selection of these important sources across deep extragalactic JWST imaging.</description>

      <title>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission in the Central Regions of Three Seyferts the Implication for Underlying Feedback Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze JWST MIRI/MRS IFU observations of three Seyferts and showcase the intriguing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission characteristics in regions of $\sim 500\,\rm pc$ scales over or around their active galactic nuclei (AGN). Combining the model predictions and the measurements of PAH features and other infrared emission lines, we find that the central regions containing a high fraction of neutral PAHs with small sizes, e.g., those in ESO137-G034, are in highly heated environments, due to collisional shock heating, with hard and moderately intense radiation fields. Such environments are proposed to be associated with inhibited growth or preferential erosion of PAHs, decreasing the average PAH size and the overall abundance of PAHs. We additionally find that the central regions containing a high fraction of ionized PAHs with large sizes, e.g., those in MCG-05-23-016, are likely experiencing severe photo-ionization because of the radiative effects from the radiative shock precursor besides the AGN. The severe photo-ionization can contribute to the ionization of all PAHs and further destruction of small PAHs. Overall, different Seyferts, even different regions in the same galaxy, e.g., those in NGC\,3081, can contain PAH populations of different properties. Specifically, Seyferts that exhibit similar PAH characteristics to ESO137-G034 and MCG-05-23-016 also tend to have similar emission line properties to them, suggesting that the explanations for PAH characteristics of ESO137-G034 and MCG-05-23-016 may also apply generally. These results have promising application in the era of JWST, especially in diagnosing different (i.e., radiative, and kinetic) AGN feedback modes.</description>

      <title>Point Spread Function Deconvolution Using a Convolutional Autoencoder for Astronomical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major issue in optical astronomical image analysis is the combined effect of the instrument's point spread function (PSF) and the atmospheric seeing that blurs images and changes their shape in a way that is band and time-of-observation dependent. In this work we present a very simple neural network based approach to non-blind image deconvolution that relies on feeding a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) input images that have been preprocessed by convolution with the corresponding PSF and its regularized inverse, a method which is both conceptually simple and computationally less intensive. We also present here, a new approach for dealing with limited input dynamic range of neural networks compared to the dynamic range present in astronomical images.</description>

      <title>Systematic Collapse of the Accretion Disc Across the Supermassive Black Hole Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure of the accretion flow onto supermassive black holes (SMBH) is not well understood. Standard disc models match to zeroth order in predicting substantial energy dissipation within optically-thick material producing a characteristic strong blue/UV continuum. However they fail at reproducing more detailed comparisons to the observed spectral shapes along with their observed variability. Based on stellar mass black holes within our galaxy, accretion discs should undergo a transition into an X-ray hot, radiatively inefficient flow, below a (mass scaled) luminosity of $\sim 0.02\,L_{\rm{Edd}}$. While this has been seen in limited samples of nearby low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) and a few rare changing-look AGN, it is not at all clear whether this transition is present in the wider AGN population across cosmic time. A key issue is the difficulty in disentangling a change in spectral state from increased dust obscuration and/or host galaxy contamination, effectively drowning out the AGN emission. Here we use the new eROSITA eFEDS Survey to identify unobscured AGN from their X-ray emission, matched to excellent optical imaging from Subaru's Hyper Suprime-Cam; allowing the subtraction of the host galaxy contamination. The resulting, uncontaminated, AGN spectra reveal a smooth transition from a strongly disc dominated state in bright AGN, to the collapse of the disc into an inefficient X-ray plasma in the low luminosity AGN, with the transition occurring at $\sim 0.02\,L_{\rm{Edd}}$; revealing fundamental aspects of accretion physics in AGN.</description>

      <title>Ba Enrichment in Gaia MS+WD Binaries: Tracing $s$-Process Element Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A large population of intermediate-separation binaries, consisting of a main-sequence (MS) star and a white dwarf (WD), has recently emerged from Gaia's third data release (DR3), posing challenges to current models of binary evolution. Here we examine the $s$-process element abundances in these systems using data from GALAH DR3. Following refined sample analysis with parameter estimates based on GALAH spectra, we find a distinct locus where enhanced $s$-process elements depend on both the WD mass and metallicity, consistent with loci identified in previous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) nucleosynthesis studies with higher $s$-process yields. Notably, these enhanced abundances show no correlation with the systems' orbital parameters, supporting a history of accretion in intermediate-separation MS+WD systems. Consequently, our results form a direct observational evidence of a connection between AGB masses and $s$-process yields. We conclude by showing that the GALAH DR3 survey includes numerous Ba dwarf stars, within and beyond the mass range covered in our current sample, which can further elucidate $s$-process element distributions in MS+WD binaries.</description>

      <title>Validation of Gaia DR3 orbital and acceleration solutions with hierarchical triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using data from Gaia DR3, we construct a sample of 14,791 gravitationally bound wide pairs in which one of the components is an unresolved binary with an astrometric orbital or acceleration solution. These systems are hierarchical triples, with inner binary separations of order $1$ au, and outer separations of $100$-$100,000$ au. Leveraging the fact that the inner binary and outer tertiary should have nearly identical parallaxes, we use the sample to calibrate the parallax uncertainties for orbital and acceleration binary solutions. We find that the parallax uncertainties of orbital solutions are typically underestimated by a factor of $1.3$ at $G&gt;14$, and by a factor of $1.7$ at $G = 8$-$14$. The true parallax uncertainties are nevertheless a factor of $\sim 10$ smaller than those of the single-star astrometric solutions for the same sources. The parallax uncertainties of acceleration solutions are underestimated by larger factors of $2$-$3$ but still represent a significant improvement compared to the sources' single-star solutions. We provide tabulated uncertainty inflation factors for astrometric binary solutions and make the catalog of hierarchical triples publicly available.</description>

      <title>Millimetre observations of the S-type AGB star $\chi$ Cygni: variability of the emission of the inner envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New observations are presented of millimetre line emissions of the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of AGB star $\chi$ Cygni using the recently upgraded NOEMA array. $\chi$ Cygni is an S-type Mira variable, at the border between oxygen-rich and carbon-rich, that has been observed for over 40 years to display features giving evidence for the strong role played by pulsation-associated shock waves in the generation of its wind. The new observations give evidence for a bright H$^{12}$CN(3-2) line emission confined to the very close neighbourhood of the star, however significantly more extended in 2024 than in 2023. Interpretation of such variability in terms of maser emission is considered but found to raise significant unanswered questions. Moreover, other unexpected features are observed in the very close neighbourhood of the star, including low Si$^{16}$O(6-5)/Si$^{17}$O(6-5), $^{28}$SiO(5-4)/$^{29}$SiO(5-4) and $^{12}$CO(2-1)/$^{13}$CO(2-1) line emission ratios. Possibly confirming the important role played by shocks, we discuss a measurement of the SiO(5-4)/SiO(6-5) emission ratio, evidence for a recent mass ejection particularly enhanced in the north-western red-shifted octant of the circumstellar envelope, leaving a depression of emission in its wake, and patterns of enhanced CO(2-1) line-emission suggesting an interpretation in terms of episodic outflows enhanced over solid angles associated with the surface of convective cells and on a time scale of a few decades. Unravelling the mechanisms underlying such newly observed features is very challenging and confirmation of the reported observations with improved sensitivity and angular resolution would be highly welcome. Observation of SiO maser emission in the ($\nu$=1,$J$=6-5) transition is reported for the first time.</description>
