      <title>HiAER-Spike Software-Hardware Reconfigurable Platform for Event-Driven Neuromorphic Computing at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present HiAER-Spike, a modular, reconfigurable, event-driven neuromorphic computing platform designed to execute large spiking neural networks with up to 160 million neurons and 40 billion synapses - roughly twice the neurons of a mouse brain at faster than real time. This system, assembled at the UC San Diego Supercomputer Center, comprises a co-designed hard- and software stack that is optimized for run-time massively parallel processing and hierarchical address-event routing (HiAER) of spikes while promoting memory-efficient network storage and execution. The architecture efficiently handles both sparse connectivity and sparse activity for robust and low-latency event-driven inference for both edge and cloud computing. A Python programming interface to HiAER-Spike, agnostic to hardware-level detail, shields the user from complexity in the configuration and execution of general spiking neural networks with minimal constraints in topology. The system is made easily available over a web portal for use by the wider community. In the following, we provide an overview of the hard- and software stack, explain the underlying design principles, demonstrate some of the system's capabilities and solicit feedback from the broader neuromorphic community. Examples are shown demonstrating HiAER-Spike's capabilities for event-driven vision on benchmark CIFAR-10, DVS event-based gesture, MNIST, and Pong tasks.</description>

      <title>Flexi-NeurA: A Configurable Neuromorphic Accelerator with Adaptive Bit-Precision Exploration for Edge SNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic accelerators promise unparalleled energy efficiency and computational density for spiking neural networks (SNNs), especially in edge intelligence applications. However, most existing platforms exhibit rigid architectures with limited configurability, restricting their adaptability to heterogeneous workloads and diverse design objectives. To address these limitations, we present Flexi-NeurA -- a parameterizable neuromorphic accelerator (core) that unifies configurability, flexibility, and efficiency. Flexi-NeurA allows users to customize neuron models, network structures, and precision settings at design time. By pairing these design-time configurability and flexibility features with a time-multiplexed and event-driven processing approach, Flexi-NeurA substantially reduces the required hardware resources and total power while preserving high efficiency and low inference latency. Complementing this, we introduce Flex-plorer, a heuristic-guided design-space exploration (DSE) tool that determines cost-effective fixed-point precisions for critical parameters -- such as decay factors, synaptic weights, and membrane potentials -- based on user-defined trade-offs between accuracy and resource usage. Based on the configuration selected through the Flex-plorer process, RTL code is configured to match the specified design. Comprehensive evaluations across MNIST, SHD, and DVS benchmarks demonstrate that the Flexi-NeurA and Flex-plorer co-framework achieves substantial improvements in accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency. A three-layer 256--128--10 fully connected network with LIF neurons mapped onto two processing cores achieves 97.23% accuracy on MNIST with 1.1~ms inference latency, utilizing only 1,623 logic cells, 7 BRAMs, and 111~mW of total power -- establishing Flexi-NeurA as a scalable, edge-ready neuromorphic platform.</description>

      <title>J3DAI: A tiny DNN-Based Edge AI Accelerator for 3D-Stacked CMOS Image Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents J3DAI, a tiny deep neural network-based hardware accelerator for a 3-layer 3D-stacked CMOS image sensor featuring an artificial intelligence (AI) chip integrating a Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based accelerator. The DNN accelerator is designed to efficiently perform neural network tasks such as image classification and segmentation. This paper focuses on the digital system of J3DAI, highlighting its Performance-Power-Area (PPA) characteristics and showcasing advanced edge AI capabilities on a CMOS image sensor. To support hardware, we utilized the Aidge comprehensive software framework, which enables the programming of both the host processor and the DNN accelerator. Aidge supports post-training quantization, significantly reducing memory footprint and computational complexity, making it crucial for deploying models on resource-constrained hardware like J3DAI. Our experimental results demonstrate the versatility and efficiency of this innovative design in the field of edge AI, showcasing its potential to handle both simple and computationally intensive tasks. Future work will focus on further optimizing the architecture and exploring new applications to fully leverage the capabilities of J3DAI. As edge AI continues to grow in importance, innovations like J3DAI will play a crucial role in enabling real-time, low-latency, and energy-efficient AI processing at the edge.</description>
