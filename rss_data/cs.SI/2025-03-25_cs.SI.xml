      <title>Why do Opinions and Actions Diverge? A Dynamic Framework to Explore the Impact of Subjective Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Socio-psychological studies have identified a common phenomenon where an individual's public actions do not necessarily coincide with their private opinions, yet most existing models fail to capture the dynamic interplay between these two aspects. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel agent-based modeling framework that integrates opinion dynamics with a decision-making mechanism. More precisely, our framework generalizes the classical Hegselmann-Krause model by combining it with a utility maximization problem. Preliminary results from our model demonstrate that the degree of opinion-action divergence within a population can be effectively controlled by adjusting two key parameters that reflect agents' personality traits, while the presence of social network amplifies the divergence. In addition, we study the social diffusion process by introducing a small number of committed agents into the model, and identify three key outcomes: adoption of innovation, rejection of innovation, and the enforcement of unpopular norms, consistent with findings in socio-psychological literature. The strong relevance of the results to real-world phenomena highlights our framework's potential for future applications in understanding and predicting complex social behaviors.</description>

      <title>Measuring Vogue in American Sociology (2011-2020)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the social dynamics of knowledge production in American sociology. Departing from traditional approaches focused on citations, co-authorship, and faculty hiring, we introduce a method capturing the dynamics of networks inferred from text to explore which ideas gain traction (a.k.a vogue). Drawing on sociology doctoral dissertations and journal abstracts, we trace the movement of word pairs between peripheral and core semantic networks to uncover dominant themes and methodological trajectories. Our findings demonstrate that regional location and institutional prestige play critical roles in shaping the production and adoption of research trends across 114 sociology PhD-granting institutions in the United States. We show that applied research topics, such as crime and health, despite being perceived as less prestigious than theoretically oriented subjects, serve as the primary driving force behind the emergence and diffusion of trends within the discipline. This work sheds light on the institutional mechanisms that govern knowledge production, demonstrating that sociology's intellectual landscape is not dictated by simple top-down diffusion from elite institutions but is instead structured by the contextual and institutional factors that facilitate specialization and segmentation.</description>

      <title>Emotional Multifaceted Feedback on AI Tool Use in EFL Learning Initiation: Chain-Mediated Effects of Motivation and Metacognitive Strategies in an Optimized TAM Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study specifically investigates the initiation phase of EFL learners' engagement with AI tools, focusing on how technology acceptance constructs perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), and perceived self-efficacy (PSE) influence learning resilience. Drawing on an optimized Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and integrating constructs from positive psychology, the study examines the chain-mediated effects of learning motivation (LM) and metacognitive strategies (MS) on resilience outcomes, operationalized through optimism (OP), psychological resilience (PR), and growth mindset (GM). A survey of first-year English majors (N = 730) was conducted, and structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the data. The findings indicate that favorable perceptions of AI tools are significantly associated with enhanced LM and MS, which in turn positively impact resilience measures. These results suggest that the interplay between technology acceptance and internal regulatory processes is vital in shaping EFL learners' early experiences with AI-assisted learning. Practical implications for educators and researchers are discussed, with an emphasis on promoting user-friendly and effective AI environments to support the development of adaptive learning behaviors.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Influence Campaigns: Nudging under Bounded Confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influence campaigns in online social networks are often run by organizations, political parties, and nation states to influence large audiences. These campaigns are employed through the use of agents in the network that share persuasive content. Yet, their impact might be minimal if the audiences remain unswayed, often due to the bounded confidence phenomenon, where only a narrow spectrum of viewpoints can influence them. Here we show that to persuade under bounded confidence, an agent must nudge its targets to gradually shift their opinions. Using a control theory approach, we show how to construct an agent's nudging policy under the bounded confidence opinion dynamics model and also how to select targets for multiple agents in an influence campaign on a social network. Simulations on real Twitter networks show that a multi-agent nudging policy can shift the mean opinion, decrease opinion polarization, or even increase it. We find that our nudging based policies outperform other common techniques that do not consider the bounded confidence effect. Finally, we show how to craft prompts for large language models, such as ChatGPT, to generate text-based content for real nudging policies. This illustrates the practical feasibility of our approach, allowing one to go from mathematical nudging policies to real social media content.</description>

      <title>Rise of the Community Champions: From Reviewer Crunch to Community Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Academic publishing is facing a crisis driven by exponential growth in submissions and an overwhelmed peer review system, leading to inconsistent decisions and a severe reviewer shortage. This paper introduces Panvas, a platform that reimagines academic publishing as a continuous, community-driven process. Panvas addresses these systemic failures with a novel combination of economic incentives (paid reviews) and rich interaction mechanisms (multi-dimensional ratings, threaded discussions, and expert-led reviews). By moving beyond the traditional accept/reject paradigm and integrating paper hosting with code/data repositories and social networking, Panvas fosters a meritocratic environment for scholarly communication and presents a radical rethinking of how we evaluate and disseminate scientific knowledge. We present the system design, development roadmap, and a user study plan to evaluate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Characterising Higher Order Interactions in Mobility Networks Using Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding human mobility is essential for applications ranging from urban planning to public health. Traditional mobility models such as flow networks and colocation matrices capture only pairwise interactions between discrete locations, overlooking higher-order relationships among locations (i.e., mobility flow among two or more locations). To address this, we propose co-visitation hypergraphs, a model that leverages temporal observation windows to extract group interactions between locations from individual mobility trajectory data. Using frequent pattern mining, our approach constructs hypergraphs that capture dynamic mobility behaviors across different spatial and temporal scales. We validate our method on a publicly available mobility dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in analyzing city-scale mobility patterns, detecting shifts during external disruptions such as extreme weather events, and examining how a location's connectivity (degree) relates to the number of points of interest (POIs) within it. Our results demonstrate that our hypergraph-based mobility analysis framework is a valuable tool with potential applications in diverse fields such as public health, disaster resilience, and urban planning.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining Directed Networks with Ergodic Sets Preserving Diffusive Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ergodic sets, subsets of nodes of the networks that are dynamically disjoint from the rest of the network (i.e. that can never be reached or left following to the network dynamics). We connect their definition to purely structural considerations of the network and study some of their basic properties. We study numerically the presence of such structures in a number of synthetic network models and in classes of networks from a variety of real-world applications, and we use them to present a compression algorithm that preserve the random walk diffusive dynamics of the original network.</description>

      <title>Z-REx: Human-Interpretable GNN Explanations for Real Estate Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transparency and interpretability are crucial for enhancing customer confidence and user engagement, especially when dealing with black-box Machine Learning (ML)-based recommendation systems. Modern recommendation systems leverage Graph Neural Network (GNN) due to their ability to produce high-quality recommendations in terms of both relevance and diversity. Therefore, the explainability of GNN is especially important for Link Prediction (LP) tasks since recommending relevant items can be viewed as predicting links between users and items. GNN explainability has been a well-studied field, existing methods primarily focus on node or graph-level tasks, leaving a gap in LP explanation techniques.
  This work introduces Z-REx, a GNN explanation framework designed explicitly for heterogeneous link prediction tasks. Z-REx utilizes structural and attribute perturbation to identify critical sub-structures and important features while reducing the search space by leveraging domain-specific knowledge. In our experimentation, we show the efficacy of Z-REx in generating contextually relevant and human-interpretable explanations for ZiGNN, a GNN-based recommendation engine, using a real-world real-estate dataset from Zillow Group, Inc. We also compare Z-REx to State-of-The-Art (SOTA) GNN explainers to show Z-REx's superiority in producing high-quality human-interpretable explanations.</description>

      <title>Potentials and Limitations of Large-scale, Individual-level Mobile Location Data for Food Acquisition Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding food acquisition is crucial for developing strategies to combat food insecurity, a major public health concern. The emergence of large-scale mobile location data (typically exemplified by GPS data), which captures people's movement over time at high spatiotemporal resolutions, offer a new approach to study this topic. This paper evaluates the potential and limitations of large-scale GPS data for food acquisition analysis through a case study. Using a high-resolution dataset of 286 million GPS records from individuals in Jacksonville, Florida, we conduct a case study to assess the strengths of GPS data in capturing spatiotemporal patterns of food outlet visits while also discussing key limitations, such as potential data biases and algorithmic uncertainties. Our findings confirm that GPS data can generate valuable insights about food acquisition behavior but may significantly underestimate visitation frequency to food outlets. Robustness checks highlight how algorithmic choices-especially regarding food outlet classification and visit identification-can influence research results. Our research underscores the value of GPS data in place-based health studies while emphasizing the need for careful consideration of data coverage, representativeness, algorithmic choices, and the broader implications of study findings.</description>

      <title>The emojification of sentiment on social media: Collection and analysis of a longitudinal Twitter sentiment dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media, as a means for computer-mediated communication, has been extensively used to study the sentiment expressed by users around events or topics. There is however a gap in the longitudinal study of how sentiment evolved in social media over the years. To fill this gap, we develop TM-Senti, a new large-scale, distantly supervised Twitter sentiment dataset with over 184 million tweets and covering a time period of over seven years. We describe and assess our methodology to put together a large-scale, emoticon- and emoji-based labelled sentiment analysis dataset, along with an analysis of the resulting dataset. Our analysis highlights interesting temporal changes, among others in the increasing use of emojis over emoticons. We publicly release the dataset for further research in tasks including sentiment analysis and text classification of tweets. The dataset can be fully rehydrated including tweet metadata and without missing tweets thanks to the archive of tweets publicly available on the Internet Archive, which the dataset is based on.</description>

      <title>Approximating Spanning Centrality with Random Bouquets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spanning Centrality is a measure used in network analysis to determine the importance of an edge in a graph based on its contribution to the connectivity of the entire network. Specifically, it quantifies how critical an edge is in terms of the number of spanning trees that include that edge. The current state-of-the-art for All Edges Spanning Centrality~(AESC), which computes the exact centrality values for all the edges, has a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(mn^{3/2})$ for $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. This makes the computation infeasible even for moderately sized graphs. Instead, there exist approximation algorithms which process a large number of random walks to estimate edge centralities. However, even the approximation algorithms can be computationally overwhelming, especially if the approximation error bound is small. In this work, we propose a novel, hash-based sampling method and a vectorized algorithm which greatly improves the execution time by clustering random walks into {\it Bouquets}. On synthetic random walk benchmarks, {\it Bouquets} performs $7.8\times$ faster compared to naive, traditional random-walk generation. We also show that the proposed technique is scalable by employing it within a state-of-the-art AESC approximation algorithm, {\sc TGT+}. The experiments show that using Bouquets yields more than $100\times$ speed-up via parallelization with 16 threads.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the inference of ratings and rankings in complex networks using discrete exterior calculus on higher--order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inference of rankings plays a central role in the theory of social choice, which seeks to establish preferences from collectively generated data, such as pairwise comparisons. Examples include political elections, ranking athletes based on competition results, ordering web pages in search engines using hyperlink networks, and generating recommendations in online stores based on user behavior. Various methods have been developed to infer rankings from incomplete or conflicting data. One such method, HodgeRank, introduced by Jiang {\em et al.}~[Math. Program. {\bf 127}, 203 (2011)], utilizes Hodge decomposition of cochains in higher--order networks to disentangle gradient and cyclical components contributing to rating scores, enabling a parsimonious inference of ratings and rankings for lists of items. This paper presents a systematic study of HodgeRank's performance under the influence of quenched disorder and across networks with complex topologies generated by four different network models. The results reveal a transition from a regime of perfect retrieval of true rankings to one of imperfect retrieval as the strength of the quenched disorder increases. A range of observables are analyzed, and their scaling behavior with respect to the network model parameters is characterized. This work advances the understanding of social choice theory and the inference of ratings and rankings within complex network structures.</description>

      <title>Who is the root in a syntactic dependency structure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The syntactic structure of a sentence can be described as a tree that indicates the syntactic relationships between words. In spite of significant progress in unsupervised methods that retrieve the syntactic structure of sentences, guessing the right direction of edges is still a challenge. As in a syntactic dependency structure edges are oriented away from the root, the challenge of guessing the right direction can be reduced to finding an undirected tree and the root. The limited performance of current unsupervised methods demonstrates the lack of a proper understanding of what a root vertex is from first principles. We consider an ensemble of centrality scores, some that only take into account the free tree (non-spatial scores) and others that take into account the position of vertices (spatial scores). We test the hypothesis that the root vertex is an important or central vertex of the syntactic dependency structure. We confirm that hypothesis and find that the best performance in guessing the root is achieved by novel scores that only take into account the position of a vertex and that of its neighbours. We provide theoretical and empirical foundations towards a universal notion of rootness from a network science perspective.</description>
