      <title>Stratified Pseudobundles and Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric Quantization is a term used to describe a wide collection of techniques dating back to the 1960s in the work of Kirillov, Kostant, and Souriau, which take symplectic manifolds and produce complex vector spaces. The name comes from the natural interpretation of symplectic manifolds as the phase spaces of classical mechanical systems and complex vector spaces as the natural domains of wave functions in quantum mechanics. In this thesis, I extend the classical framework of Geometric Quantization to handle a class of singular spaces called Symplectic Stratified Spaces, which date back to the work of Sjamaar and Lerman in the 1990s. As part of this work, I develop the theory of stratified pseudobundles to serve as singular replacements for important auxiliary information in Geometric Quantization: prequantum line bundles and polarizations. I then use this formalism to provide [Q,R]=0 results for singular quotients of toric manifolds and cotangent bundles. I also provide an example of singular Geometric Quantization that does not arise from singular reduction.</description>

      <title>Open $r$-spin theory in genus one, and the Gelfand-Dikii wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the $g=1$ sector of the open $r$-spin theory, that is, an open $r$-spin theory on the moduli space of cylinders. This is the second construction of a $g&gt;0$ open intersection theory, which includes descendents (the first is the all genus construction of the intersection theory on moduli of open Riemann surfaces with boundaries [23,30], whose $g=1$ case equals to the $r=2$ case of our construction). Unlike the construction of [30], in order to construct the $r$-spin cylinder theory we had to overcome the foundational problem of dimension jump loci, which in analogous closed theories has been treated using virtual fundamental class techniques, that are currently absent in the open setting. For this reason our construction is much more involved, and relies on the point insertion technique developed in [31,32].
  We prove that the open $g=1$ potential equals, after a coordinate change, to the $g=1$ part of the Gelfand-Dikii wave function, thus confirming a conjecture of [7]. We also prove that our $g=1$ intersection numbers satisfy a $g=1$ recursion, also predicted in [7,15]. This recursion is the $g=1$ analogue of Solomon's famous $g=0$ Open WDVV equation [25], with descendents, and is also the universal $g=1$ recursion for $F$-Cohomological field theories [1]. Again, this is first geometric construction which is not the $g=1$ sector of [23,30], proven to satisfy this universal recursion.</description>

      <title>The point insertion technique and open $r$-spin theories I: moduli and orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13185v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The papers [3,1,4,10] constructed an intersection theory on the moduli space of $r$-spin disks, and proved it satisfies mirror symmetry and relations with integrable hierarchies. That theory considered only disks with a single boundary state. In this work, we initiate the study of more general $r$-spin surfaces. We define graded $r$-spin surfaces with multiple internal and boundary states, together with their moduli spaces.
  In genus zero, the disk case, we define the associated open Witten bundle and prove that it is canonically oriented relative to the moduli space. We also describe a gluing construction for moduli spaces along boundaries, show that it lifts to the Witten bundle and relative cotangent line bundles, and that the result remains canonically relatively oriented.
  We then study the genus-one cylinder case. Here foundational difficulties arise because the Witten "bundle" is no longer an orbifold vector bundle. We resolve this by removing strata with incorrect fibre dimension, obtaining an orbibundle on the complement. The gluing method extends to genus one, and we prove that the Witten bundle again admits a canonical relative orientation.
  In the sequel [20], we construct a family of $\lfloor r/2\rfloor$ intersection theories in genus-zero indexed by $\mathfrak h\in\{0,\ldots,\lfloor r/2\rfloor-1\}$, where the $\mathfrak h$-th theory has $\mathfrak h+1$ boundary states, and compute their intersection numbers. The case $\mathfrak h=0$ recovers the theory of [3,1].
  In the sequel [21], restricting to the $\mathfrak h=0$ case, we construct an intersection theory on the moduli space of $r$-spin cylinders and show that its potential yields, after a change of variables, the genus-one part of the $r$th Gelfand-Dikii wave function, proving the genus-one case of the main conjecture of [4].</description>

      <title>Lattice points in polytope boundaries and formal geometric quantization of singular Calabi Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the number of lattice points in the boundary of a positive integer dilate of a Delzant integral polytope is a polynomial in the dilation parameter, analogous to the Ehrhart polynomial giving the number of lattice points in a lattice polytope. We give an explicit formula for this polynomial, analogous to the formula of Khovanskii-Pukhlikov for the Ehrhart polynomial. These counting polynomials satisfy a lacunarity principle, the vanishing of alternate coefficients, quite unlike the Ehrhart polynomial. We show that formal geometric quantization of singular Calabi Yau hypersurfaces in smooth toric varieties gives this polynomial, in analogy with the relation of the Khovanskii-Pukhlikov formula to the geometric quantization of toric varieties. The Atiyah-Singer theorem for the index of the Dirac operator gives a moral argument for the lacunarity of the counting polynomial. We conjecture that similar formulas should hold for arbitrary simple integral polytope boundaries.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Legendre Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Legendre transformation in a geometric way based on the procedure of the Legendrian lift. This approach allows us to understand some interesting properties of it, in particular, the reason for the appearance of singularities of dual curves. Also we consider application of the Legendre transformation to the Clairaut differential equation. Finally, we say a few words class of contact transformations and present an infinite group of contact transformations different from the Legendre transformation.
  Keywords: Legendre transformation, duality, contact transformation, contact structure, pedal curve, singular point, Clairaut equation</description>
