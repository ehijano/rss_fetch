      <title>A weak regularity lemma for polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A regularity lemma for polynomials provides a decomposition in terms of a bounded number of approximately independent polynomials. Such regularity lemmas play an important role in numerous results, yet suffer from the familiar shortcoming of having tower-type bounds or worse. In this paper we design a new, weaker regularity lemma with strong bounds. The new regularity lemma in particular provides means to quantitatively study the curves contained in the image of a polynomial map, which is beyond the reach of standard methods.
  Applications include strong bounds for a problem of Karam on generalized rank, as well as a new method to obtain upper bounds for fan-in parameters in arithmetic circuits. For example, we show that if the image of a polynomial map $\mathbf{P} \colon \mathbb{F}^n \to \mathbb{F}^m$ of degree $d$ does not contain a line, then $\mathbf{P}$ can be computed by a depth-$4$ homogeneous formula with bottom fan-in at most $d/2$ and top fan-in at most $(2m)^{C(d)}$ (with $C(d)=2^{(1+o(1))d}$). Such a result was previously known only with at least a tower-type bound on the top fan-in. One implication of our work is a certain ``barrier'' to arithmetic circuit lower bounds, in terms of the smallest degree of a polynomial curve contained in the image of the given polynomial map.</description>

      <title>Decomposing the Automorphism group of the surreal numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the automorphism group of the field of surreal numbers. Our main structure theorem presents a decomposition of this group into a product of five significant factors. Using the representation of surreal numbers as generalized power series via their Conway normal form, we apply results on Hahn fields and groups from the literature in order to obtain this decomposition. Moreover, we provide explicit descriptions of the individual factors enabling us to construct automorphisms on the field of surreal numbers from simpler components. We then extend our study to strongly linear automorphisms in connection to derivations, as well as automorphisms that preserve further exponential structure on the surreals.</description>

      <title>Bernstein-Sato theory modulo $p^m$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For fixed prime integer $p &gt; 0$ we develop a notion of Bernstein-Sato polynomial for polynomials with $\mathbb{Z} / p^m$-coefficients, compatible with existing theory in the case $m = 1$. We show that the ``roots" of such polynomials are rational and we show that the negative roots agree with those of the mod-$p$ reduction. We give examples to show that, surprisingly, roots may be positive in this context. Moreover, our construction allows us to define a notion of ``strength" for roots by measuring $p$-torsion, and we show that ``strong" roots give rise to roots in characteristic zero through mod-$p$ reduction.</description>
