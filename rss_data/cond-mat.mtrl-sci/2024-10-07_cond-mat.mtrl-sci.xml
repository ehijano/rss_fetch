      <title>Manganese oxide-functionalized graphene sponge electrodes for electrochemical chlorine-free disinfection of tap water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-cost reduced graphene oxide sponges functionalized with manganese oxide were used as electrodes for the disinfection of Escherichia coli in water. Manganese oxide was doped with amino groups MnxOyNH2 to strengthen the bond with the graphene coating and improve the electrochemical stability of the sponge. The Mn II and Mn III incorporated into the graphene coating favored the formation of oxygen vacancies and enhanced the electric and catalytic properties of the anode. Electrooxidation of real tap water at 29 A m2 resulted in 2.2 log removal of E. coli. After storing the treated samples for 18 h at 25 and 37 {\deg}C, the removal of E. coli increased to 3.3 and 4.6 log, respectively, demonstrating the irreparable damage to the bacterial cells via low-voltage electroporation, and the key role of storage temperature in their further inactivation. The energy consumption of the system treating real low conductivity tap water was 1.2-1.6 kWh m-3. Finally, experiments with intermittent current suggest the contribution of the pseudo-capacitance of the graphene sponge to electrochemical disinfection during the OFF periods. This study demonstrates the feasibility of manganese oxide-functionalized graphene sponges for the chlorine-free disinfection of water.</description>

      <title>Magnon spectroscopy in the electron microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The miniaturisation of transistors is approaching its limits due to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics are being developed, which leverage the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study and control spin wave propagation at the nano- and atomic scales a key challenge. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to probe spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant lengthscales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by such local features. Here, we show the first experimental detection of bulk magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy. By employing high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel direct electron detectors optimized for low acceleration voltages, we successfully overcome the challenges posed by weak signals and identify magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons, exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks an important milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the future development of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Driving the Berry phase anomalous Hall effect in a noncollinear antiferromagnet by domain manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of anomalous Hall effects (AHE) in antiferromagnets presents an intriguing phenomenon with potential spintronic device applications due to their ultrafast switching dynamics. Mn3NiN antiperovskite stands out as a promising candidate owing to its noncollinear antiferromagnetism. In this study, we report a significant AHE observed in epitaxial Mn3NiN thin films below the N\'eel temperature, comparable to those observed in typical ferromagnets. Through a combination of magnetometry, neutron diffraction and ab-initio data analyses, we propose that the substantial AHE can be attributed to the non-vanishing Berry curvature arising from the {\Gamma}4g-type spin structure, coupled with uncompensated magnetic domains featuring a weak canted moment. This coupling, due to robust antiferromagnetic domains, enables deterministic detection and switching of AHE via the application of a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-controlled orbital Hall effect in IrO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discovery of orbital currents in several material platforms including light element metals has opened new possibilities for exploring novel transport phenomena and applications to spin-orbitronic devices. These orbital currents, similar to spin currents, have the ability to generate torque on adjacent magnetic layers, opening a new avenue for efficient spintronic devices. However, separating spin and orbital currents has been one of the major challenges. Here, we show evidence for large conventional as well as unconventional spin and orbital currents in IrO$_2$ and disentangle them by crystal symmetry. We study the anisotropic spin and orbital Hall effects in IrO$_2$ (001), (100), and (111) orientations and find unconventional z-polarized orbital torques using angular spin torque ferromagnetic resonance of IrO$_2$/Ni heterostructures, which are in agreement regarding the relative signs with theoretical calculations of spin and orbital Hall conductivity. This work provides a promising route towards highly efficient low power spintronic and orbitronic devices in oxide heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Self-Assembly of a halogenated organic molecule on the Si(111) $\surd$3$\times$$\surd$3-Ag surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the self-assembly of halogen-based organic molecules on a passivated silicon surface. The room temperature adsorption of 2,4,6-tris(4-iodophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (TIPT) on the Si(111)-$\surd$3$\times$$\surd$3-Ag surface is described. The adsorption is investigated primarily by room-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density-functional theoretical (DFT) calculations. The experimental results is a dramatic example of how the substrate can influence the overall structure of the self-assembly. With increasing dose, the TIPT monomers form supramolecular structures defined by a two monomer, 2.07 $\pm$ 0.05 nm by 1.83 $\pm$ 0.05 nm rectangular cell. The unit cell is characterized by zig-zag rows of molecules aligned \pm13{\deg} from the high symmetry directions of the $\surd$3-Ag substrate. The 2.07 nm dimension along the zig-zag rows is very similar to self-assembled TIPT networks observed on HOPG, however the 1.83 nm dimension is extended considerably and commensurate with the $\surd$3-Ag substrate. The epitaxial relationship between the overlayer and the substrate, and the commensurate inter-row spacing indicate significant molecule-substrate interactions. In fact, DFT calculations of free standing TIPT hexamers reveal that increasing the inter row spacing comes at little energy cost. Experiments also indicate that the formation of supramolecular TIPT domains is extremely sensitive to the quality of the underlying $\surd3$-Ag reconstruction. Point defects in the $\surd3$-Ag reconstruction ultimately restricts the extent of the observed domains.</description>

      <title>Predicting macroscopic properties of amorphous monolayer carbon via pair correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing the structure-property relationship in amorphous materials has been a long-term grand challenge due to the lack of a unified description of the degree of disorder. In this work, we develop SPRamNet, a neural network based machine-learning pipeline that effectively predicts structure-property relationship of amorphous material via global descriptors. Applying SPRamNet on the recently discovered amorphous monolayer carbon, we successfully predict the thermal and electronic properties. More importantly, we reveal that a short range of pair correlation function can readily encode sufficiently rich information of the structure of amorphous material. Utilizing powerful machine learning architectures, the encoded information can be decoded to reconstruct macroscopic properties involving many-body and long-range interactions. Establishing this hidden relationship offers a unified description of the degree of disorder and eliminates the heavy burden of measuring atomic structure, opening a new avenue in studying amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Ordering of Interstitial Iron Atoms and Local Structural Distortion Induced by Iron Polycomplex in Fe1+yTe1-xSex as Seen via Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we meticulously investigated the intrinsic chemical heterogeneity of Fe1+yTe, Fe1+yTe0.8Se0.2, and Fe1+yTe0.5Se0.5. Comprehensive analysis reveals the presence of interstitial iron atoms (Feint) across all samples, pre-dominantly occupying the 2c site of the P4/nmm space group. Moreover, a superstructure phase characterized by a wave vector q = 2/5a + 1/2c, originating from the ordering of Feint, is distinctly observable in the parent compound Fe1+yTe. In this scenario, the Feint atoms interact with adjacent Fe atoms, forming iron polycomplex and leading to an evident distortion of the FeTe4 tetrahedral. Experimental results further demonstrate effective suppression of Feint concentration and ordering through appropriate Se substitution; notably, Fe1+yTe0.5Se0.5 manifests the lowest concentration of Feint atoms. Our findings additionally indicate that Se substitution is random, and nanoscale phase separation induced by Te/Se chemical heterogeneity is commonly observed within Fe1+yTe1-xSex crystals.</description>

      <title>Ferrovalley Physics in Stacked Bilayer Altermagnetic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an emerging magnetic phase, altermagnets with compensated magnetic order and non-relativistic spin-splitting have attracted widespread attention. Currently, strain engineering is considered to be an effective method for inducing valley polarization in altermagnets, however, achieving controllable switching of valley polarization is extremely challenging. Herein, combined with tight-binding model and first-principles calculations, we propose that interlayer sliding can be used to successfully induce and effectively manipulate the large valley polarization in altermagnets. Using Fe2MX4 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se or Te) family as examples, we predict that sliding induced ferrovalley states in such systems can exhibit many unique properties, including the linearly optical dichroism that is independent of spin-orbit coupling, and the anomalous valley Hall effect. These findings imply the correlation among spin, valley, layer and optical degrees of freedom that makes altermagnets attractive in spintronics, valleytronics and even their crossing areas.</description>

      <title>A simple method to find temporal overlap between THz and x-ray pulses using x-ray-induced carrier dynamics in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray-induced carrier dynamics in silicon and gallium arsenide were investigated through intensity variations of transmitted terahertz (THz) pulses in the pico to microsecond time scale with x-ray free-electron laser and synchrotron radiation. We observed a steep reduction in THz transmission with a picosecond scale due to the x-ray-induced carrier generation, followed by a recovery on a nano to microsecond scale caused by the recombination of carriers. The rapid response in the former process is applicable to a direct determination of temporal overlap between THz and x-ray pulses for THz pump-x-ray probe experiments with an accuracy of a few picoseconds.</description>

      <title>Noncollinear ferrielectricity and hydrogen-induced ferromagnetic polar half-metallicity in MnO$_3$Cl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collinear dipole orders such as ferroelectricity and antiferroelectricity have developed rapidly in last decades. While, the noncollinear dipole orders are rarely touched in solids. Noncollinear dipole orders can provide a route to realize ferrielectricity. Based on first-principles calculations, an inorganic molecular crystal MnO$_3$Cl has been demonstrated to own intrinsic noncollinear ferrielectricity, which originates from the stereo orientations of polar molecules. The large negative piezoelectricity effect ($d_{33}\sim-27$ pC/N) is also predicted. A strong light absorption and moderate optical anisotropy are found for this molecular crystal in the ultraviolet light window. Additionally, by electron doping via hydrogen intercalation, a ferromagnetic polar half-metals can be obtained. Our study here provide a material platform to explore the intriguing physics of noncollinear ferrielectricity and potential applications in devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has suggested that nanoconfined water may exhibit superionic proton transport at lower temperatures and pressures than bulk water. Using first-principles-level simulations, we study the role of nuclear quantum effects in inducing this superionicity in nanoconfined water. We show that nuclear quantum effects increase the ionic conductivity of nanoconfined hexatic water, leading to superionic behaviour at lower temperatures and pressures than previously thought possible. Our work suggests that superionic water may be accessible in graphene nanocapillary experiments.</description>

      <title>Ge epitaxy at ultra-low growth temperatures enabled by a pristine growth environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Germanium (Ge), the next-in-line group-IV material, bears great potential to add functionality and performance to next-generation nanoelectronics and solid-state quantum transport based on silicon (Si) technology. Here, we investigate the direct epitaxial growth of two-dimensional high-quality crystalline Ge layers on Si deposited at ultra-low growth temperatures ($T_{Ge} = 100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}-350^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$) and pristine growth pressures ($\lesssim 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{mbar}$). First, we show that $T_{Ge}$ does not degrade the crystal quality of homoepitaxial Ge/Ge(001) by comparing the point defect density using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. Subsequently, we present a systematic investigation of the Ge/Si(001) heteroepitaxy, varying the Ge coverage (${\theta}_{Ge}$, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 nm) and $T_{Ge}$ ($100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $300^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, in increments of $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$) to assess the influence of these parameters on the layer's structural quality. Atomic force microscopy revealed a rippled surface topography with superimposed grainy features and the absence of three-dimensional structures, such as quantum dots. Transmission electron microscopy unveiled pseudomorphic, grains of highly crystalline growth separated by defective domains. Thanks to nanobeam scanning x-ray diffraction measurements, we were able to evidence the lattice strain fluctuations due to the ripple-like structure of the layers. We conclude that the heteroepitaxial strain contributes to the formation of the ripples, which originate from the kinetic limitations of the ultra-low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Boosting the transparency of metallic SrNbO3 through Ti doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, various materials have been developed to reduce the reliance of industries on Indium, a primary component of transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) used in the current generation of devices. The leading candidates for indium free TCOs are strontium vanadates, niobates and molybdates -- strongly correlated perovskite systems that exhibit high intrinsic electrical conductivity and optimal transparency. In this work, we focus on the strontium niobate thin films and manipulate its optical conductivity by Ti doping, which shifts the plasma frequency and reduces electronic correlations. This allows us to achieve a low resistance for Ti doped SNO thin films, while maintaining a high transparency in the visible spectrum. We obtain the optimal figure-of-merit (FOM) of 10.3 ($10^{-3}\Omega^{-1}$) for $x = 0.3$. This FOM significantly outperforms the optoelectronic capabilities of Tin-doped Indium oxide (ITO) and several other proposed transparent conductor materials. Our research paves the way for designing the next generation of transparent conductors, guided by insights from density-functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of high-power computing and electronic technologies, understanding thermal conductivity in materials has become increasingly important. This study presents a novel method called the Space-Projected Thermal Conductivity (SPTC) that can predict thermal activity at the atomic scale, leveraging the Green-Kubo thermal transport equations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on crystalline and amorphous carbon-based structures, paracrystalline and amorphous silicon, and grain boundaries in silicon-germanium alloys. The results highlight the potential of our method to provide new insights into the thermal behavior of materials, offering a promising avenue for materials design and performance optimization.</description>

      <title>Band alignment study of the Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$TaO$_2$N / H$_2$O interface for photoelectrochemical devices and Hydrogen production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen is one of the most promising candidates for clean energy production. Photoelectrochemical devices look promising for the decomposition of the water molecule into 2H$_2$ + O$_2$. Oxynitrides, like the solid solution Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$O$_2$N, are good candidates due to the low band gap that lies into the maximum zone of the solar radiation spectrum. A necessary condition for the photoelectrochemical process to work without a bias voltage is that the minimum of the semiconductor conduction band must be more positive than the reduction potential H$^+$ to H$_2$, whereas the maximum of the semiconductor valence band must be more negative than the oxidation potential of H$_2$O to O$_2$. Thus, band alignment studies in interfaces of semiconductors with water become of great importance. They present several subtleties, as different or simplistic modelling will result in few decimes of eV difference that would lead to a wrong prediction in the alignment. So, to find a trustful method is desirable. In this work, first principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) in the all electron and the pseudopotential approaches have been performed for the analysis of the band alignment in Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$O$_2$N /H$_2$O interfaces. A detailed study of the modelling of the surface, supercells, and interface with water molecules was done. Experimental data were taken for the structures and photoelectrochemical behaviour and well reproduced by the methodology implemented. The analysis carried out led to theoretical results compatible with the experimental results: the calculations show that the Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$O$_2$N /H$_2$O is suitable for photoelectrochemical applications, and the partial substitution of Sr by Ca enables the gap and alignment tuning thus enhancing the complex performance.</description>

      <title>Magnetization reversal and direct observation of magnetic domains on FePt thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ferromagnetic thin films, the presence of an out-of-plane component of the magnetic anisotropy may induce a transition from planar to stripe-like magnetic domains above a critical thickness, $t_c$. Because of the changes in the domain structure, important changes in the magnetization reversal mechanisms are observed. We present the analysis of the magnetization reversal in FePt thin films, where this phenomenon is observed, through the experimental observation of magnetic domains by magneto-optic Kerr effect microscopy. The observed reversal mechanisms are strongly dependent on the thickness of the sample. For $t&lt;t_c$, the reversal process is a combination of domain wall movement and rotation of domains. Meanwhile, for $t&gt;t_c$, the stripe-domain structure determines the magnetization reversal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We applied synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction in a diamond anvil cell at 48-51 GPa and first-principles theoretical calculations to study the crystal structure of solid atomic iodine at high pressure. We report the synthesis of two phases of atomic iodine at 48-51 GPa via laser heating of I-N2 mixtures. Unlike the familiar monatomic I4/mmm structure, which consists of crystallographically equivalent atoms, a new Pm-3n structure is of inclusion type, featuring two distinct kinds of atoms: a central detached one and peripheral ones forming the linear chains. Moreover, we observe crystallization of the familiar high-pressure face centered cubic (fcc) structure, albeit at much lower pressures compared to cold compressed iodine. The discovery of Pm-3n structure in iodine marks an important step in understanding of the pressure induced phase transition sequence in halogens.</description>

      <title>Identifying Independent Components and Internal Process Order Parameters in Nonequilibrium Multicomponent Nonstoichiometric Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In CALPHAD-type thermodynamic databases, nonstoichiometric compounds are typically described by sublattice models where the sublattice site fractions represent the occupation probability of different atomic, ionic or defect species on different sublattices. Here, we develop a general procedure and corresponding linear algebra tools for converting the sublattice site fractions to a combination of independent component compositions and internal process order parameters describing the extent of internal atomic exchange, electronic redox and defect generation reactions. We apply them to a number of nonstoichiometric phases in thermodynamic databases and literature. The general procedure can be applied to constructing thermodynamic databases in terms of internal process order parameters for nonstoichiometric phases in multicomponent systems such as high-entropy oxides and alloys, which can be utilized to model their kinetics of nonequilibrium processes and microstructure evolution.</description>

      <title>Constrained B-Spline Based Everett Map Construction for Modeling Static Hysteresis Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a simple and robust method to construct a B-spline based Everett map, for application in the Preisach model of hysteresis, to predict static hysteresis behavior. Its strength comes from the ability to directly capture the Everett map as a well-founded closed-form B-spline surface expression, while also eliminating model artifacts that plague Everett map based Preisach models. Contrary to other works, that applied numerical descriptions for the Everett map, the presented approach is of completely analytic nature. In this work the B-spline surface fitting procedure and the necessary set of constraints are explained. Furthermore, the B-spline based Everett map is validated by ensuring that model artifacts were properly eliminated. Additionally, the model was compared with four benchmark excitations. Namely, a degaussing signal, a set of first-order reversal curves, an arbitrary excitation with high-order reversal curves, and a PWM like signal. The model was able to reproduce all benchmarks with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength topological interface modes in a multilayered vibroacoustic metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic and rigorous analytical approach, based on the transfer matrix methodology, to study the existence, evolution, and robustness of subwavelength topological interface states in practical multilayered vibroacoustic phononic lattices. These lattices, composed of membrane-air cavity unit cells, exhibit complex band structures with various bandgaps, including Bragg, band-splitting induced, local resonance, and plasma bandgaps. Focusing on the challenging low-frequency range and assuming axisymmetric modes, we show that topological interface states are confined to Bragg-like band-splitting induced bandgaps. Unlike the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, the vibroacoustic lattice exhibits diverse topological phase transitions across infinite bands, enabling broadband, multi-frequency vibroacoustics in the subwavelength regime. We establish three criteria for the existence of these states: the Zak phase, surface impedance, and a new reflection coefficient concept, all derived from transfer matrix components. Notably, we provide an explicit expression for the exact location of topological interface states within the band structure, offering insight for their predictive implementation. We confirm the robustness of these states against structural variations and identify delocalization as bandgaps narrow. Our work provides a complete and exact analytical characterization of topological interface states, demonstrating the effectiveness of the transfer matrix method. Beyond its analytical depth, our approach provides a useful framework and design tool for topological phononic lattices, advancing applications such as efficient sound filters, waveguides, noise control, and acoustic sensors in the subwavelength regime. Its versatility extends beyond the vibroacoustic systems, encompassing a broader range of phononic and photonic crystals with repetitive inversion-symmetric unit cells.</description>

      <title>Resolving Polarization Switching Pathways of Sliding Ferroelectricity in Trilayer 3R-MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the pathways of polarization switching in 2D sliding ferroelectrics with multiple internal interfaces is crucial for understanding the switching mechanism and for enhancing their performance in memory-related applications. However, distinguishing the rich configurations of various stacking from a coexistence of polarization domains has remained challenging. In this investigation, we employ optical techniques to resolve the stacking degeneracy in a trilayer 3R-MoS2 across several polarization switching cycles. Through a comprehensive analysis of the unique excitonic response exhibited by different layers, we unveil multiple polarization switching pathways that are determined by the sequential release of domain walls initially pinned at various interfaces within the trilayer, providing an understanding of the switching mechanism in multilayered sliding ferroelectrics. Our study not only reveals the intricate dynamics of polarization switching, but also underscores the crucial role of controlling domain walls, pinning centers, and doping levels, offering new insights for enhancing the applications of these materials in sensing and computing.</description>

      <title>Exchange striction induced thermal Hall effect in van der Waals antiferromagnet MnPS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal Hall effect has emerged as an ideal probe for investigating topological phenomena of charge-neutral excitation. Notably, it reveals crucial aspects of spin-lattice couplings that have been difficult to access for decades. However, the exchange striction mechanism from a lattice-induced change in exchange interaction has often been ignored in thermal Hall experiments. MnPS3 can offer a platform to study exchange striction on the thermal Hall effect due to its significant spin-lattice coupling and field-induced non-collinear spin configuration. Our thermal transport data show distinct temperature and field dependence of longitudinal thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{xx}$) and thermal Hall effect ($\kappa_{xy}$). By using detailed theoretical calculation, we found that the inclusion of the exchange striction is essential for a better description of both $\kappa_{xx}$ and $\kappa_{xy}$. Our result demonstrates the importance of the exchange striction mechanism for a complete understanding of the magnon-phonon-driven thermal Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Correlation Effects on Coupled Electronic and Structural Properties of Doped Rare-Earth Trihydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth trihydrides ($R$H$_3$) exhibit intriguing coupled electronic and structural properties as a function of doping, hydrogen vacancies, and thermodynamic conditions. Theoretical studies of these materials typically rely on density functional theory (DFT), including the use of small supercells that may underestimate strong correlation effects and structural distortions which in turn may influence their metallicity. Here, we elucidate the roles of lattice distortions and correlation effects on the electronic properties of pristine and doped $R$H$_3$ by adopting DFT+U and Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. Linear-response constrained DFT (LR-cDFT) methods find Hubbard U $\approx 2$ eV for $R_d$ orbitals and U$\approx 6$ eV for H$_s$/N$_p$ orbitals. The small U on Lu$_d$ orbitals is consistent with QMC calculations on LuH$_3$ and LuH$_{2.875}$N$_{0.125}$. In pure face-centered-cubic (FCC) $R$H$_3$ ($R$=Lu,Y), neither DFT nor DFT+U with the self-consistently determined U is enough to create a band gap, however a supercell with hydrogen distortions creates a small gap whose magnitude increases when performing DFT+U with self-consistently determined U values. Correlation effects, in turn, have a moderate influence on the coupled structural and electronic properties of doped RH$_3$ compounds and may be important when considering the competition between structural distortions and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Rapid optimization in high dimensional space by deep kernel learning augmented genetic algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploration of complex high-dimensional spaces presents significant challenges in fields such as molecular discovery, process optimization, and supply chain management. Genetic Algorithms (GAs), while offering significant power for creating new candidate spaces, often entail high computational demands due to the need for evaluation of each new proposed solution. On the other hand, Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) efficiently navigates the spaces of preselected candidate structures but lacks generative capabilities. This study introduces an approach that amalgamates the generative power of GAs to create new candidates with the efficiency of DKL-based surrogate models to rapidly ascertain the behavior of new candidate spaces. This DKL-GA framework can be further used to build Bayesian Optimization (BO) workflows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through the optimization of the FerroSIM model, showcasing its broad applicability to diverse challenges, including molecular discovery and battery charging optimization.</description>

Abstract: We explore the structural signatures of excitations in amorphous materials with the atomic cluster expansion (ACE), a universal and complete linear basis of descriptors of the atomic environment. Body-orderd linear classifiers are constructed that distinguish between active and inactive particles in three different model glass formers, in which structural relaxation occurs either through spontaneous thermal activation or by simple shear. We find that in binary mixtures, maximum prediction accuracy is already achieved with very few two-body correlations, while a polymer glass requires both two- and three-body correlations. Trends are robust across both activation mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the disorder properties of two-dimensional hole gases in Ge/SiGe heterostructures grown on Ge wafers, using thick SiGe barriers to mitigate the influence of the semiconductor-dielectric interface. Across several heterostructure field effect transistors we measure an average maximum mobility of $(4.4 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{6}~\mathrm{cm^2/Vs}$ at a saturation density of $(1.72 \pm 0.03) \times 10^{11}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, corresponding to a long mean free path of $(30 \pm 1)~\mathrm{\mu m}$. The highest measured mobility is $4.68 \times 10^{6}~\mathrm{cm^2/Vs}$. We identify uniform background impurities and interface roughness as the dominant scattering mechanisms limiting mobility in a representative device, and we evaluate a percolation-induced critical density of $(4.5 \pm 0.1)\times 10^{9} ~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. This low-disorder heterostructure, according to simulations, may support the electrostatic confinement of holes in gate-defined quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the chemical potential disorder in the topological insulator (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy under ultra-high vacuum and down to 1.7 K to study the local variations of the chemical potential on the surface of the topological insulator (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films (thickness 7 - 30 nm) with varying Sb-concentration $x$, to gain insight into the charge puddles formed in thin films of a compensated topological insulator. We found that the amplitude of the potential fluctuations, $\Gamma$, is between 5 to 14 meV for quasi-bulk conducting films and about 30 - 40 meV for bulk-insulating films. The length scale of the fluctuations, $\lambda$, was found to span the range of 13 - 54 nm, with no clear correlation with $\Gamma$. Applying a magnetic field normal to the surface, we observe the condensation of the two-dimensional topological surface state into Landau levels and find a weak but positive correlation between $\Gamma$ and the spectral width of the Landau-level peaks, which suggests that quantum smearing from drift motion is the source of the Landau level broadening. Our systematic measurements give useful guidelines for realizing $(\mathrm{Bi}_{1-x}\mathrm{Sb}_x)_2\mathrm{Te}_3$ thin films with an acceptable level of potential fluctuations. In particular, we found that $x\approx 0.65$ realizes the situation where $\Gamma$ shows a comparatively small value of 14 meV and the Dirac point lies within $\sim$10 meV of the Fermi energy.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical investigation of the influence of electron-magnon scattering processes on the ultrafast demagnetization in itinerant ferromagnets. In the framework of a ferromagnetic model system, we compute the spin-dependent dynamics of electrons in itinerant Bloch states including electron-magnon and electron-electron scattering. Our approach includes both electron-magnon and electron-electron scattering processes on an equal footing. While the former process flips the electronic spin accompanied by the creation or destruction of a magnons, the latter exchanges electronic angular momentum with the lattice due to the influence of spin-orbit coupling. We show that the interplay of the two different scattering mechanisms leads to the creation of magnons and a transfer of angular momentum to the lattice that, for a realistic choice of the electron-magnon interaction and excitation conditions, is considerably more efficient than spin-orbit assisted electron-electron scattering alone. This process of magnon creation and spin-lattice coupling constitutes an essentially non-equilibrium microscopic scenario for the ultrafast demagnetization process in itinerant ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>An energy-dependent broadening of Rashba-like spin splitting in Au2Sb surface alloy with periodic structural defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06183v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we report a novel AuSb 2D superstructure on Au(111) that shows agreements and discrepancies to the expected electronic features of the ideal 2D surface alloys with $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ periodicity. Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we find a spin splitting of the alloy bands with antiparallel spin polarization, stemming from Rashba spin-orbit coupling. However, the observed Rashba bands are significantly broadened. Taking advantage of the good agreement between the experimental results and DFT calculations, we determine that the broadening of the Rashba band is due to the perturbations from the 3-pointed-star-shaped defects acting as nonresonant impurities in the Au2Sb superstructure. These periodic defects can shift the energy position of the Rashba band without breaking the in-plane rotational symmetry and mirror symmetry, which suggests that introducing periodic defects into a Rashba SOC system possesses a great potential in engineering the spin-dependent properties of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Insights into Chemical and Structural Order at Planar Defects in a Functional Oxide Using Multislice Electron Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Switchable order parameters in ferroic materials are essential for functional electronic devices, yet disruptions of the ordering can take the form of planar boundaries or defects that exhibit distinct properties. Characterizing the structure of these boundaries is challenging due to their confined size and three-dimensional nature. Here, a chemical anti-phase boundary in the highly ordered double perovskite \ce{Pb2MgWO6} is investigated using multislice electron ptychography. The boundary is revealed to be inclined along the electron beam direction with a finite width of chemical intermixing. Additionally, regions at and near the boundary exhibit antiferroelectric-like displacements, contrasting with the predominantly paraelectric matrix. Spatial statistics and density functional theory calculations further indicate that despite their higher energy, chemical anti-phase boundaries form due to kinetic constraints during growth, with extended antiferroelectric-like distortions induced by the chemically frustrated environment in the proximity of the boundary. The three-dimensional imaging provides critical insights into the interplay between local chemistry and the polar environment, elucidating the role of anti-phase boundaries and their associated confined structural distortions and offering new opportunities for engineering ferroic thin films.</description>

      <title>Towards Verifying Exact Conditions for Implementations of Density Functional Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is used extensively in the computation of electronic properties of matter, with various applications. Approximating the exchange-correlation (XC) functional is the key to the Kohn-Sham DFT approach, the basis of most DFT calculations. The choice of this density functional approximation (DFA) depends crucially on the particular system under study, which has resulted in the development of hundreds of DFAs. Though the exact density functional is not known, researchers have discovered analytical properties of this exact functional. Furthermore, these exact conditions are used when designing DFAs. We present XCVerifier, the first approach for verifying whether a DFA implementation satisfies the DFT exact conditions. XCVerifier was evaluated on five DFAs from the popular Libxc library and seven exact conditions from recent work. XCVerifier was able to verify or find violations for a majority of the DFA/condition pairs, demonstrating the feasibility of using formal methods to verify DFA implementations.</description>

      <title>Cross Validation in Stochastic Analytic Continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Analytic Continuation (SAC) of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) imaginary-time correlation function data is a valuable tool in connecting many-body models to experimentally measurable dynamic response functions. Recent developments of the SAC method have allowed for spectral functions with sharp features, e.g. narrow peaks and divergent edges, to be resolved with unprecedented fidelity. Often times, it is not known what exact sharp features, if any, are present \textit{a priori}, and, due to the ill-posed nature of the analytic continuation problem, multiple spectral representations may be acceptable. In this work, we borrow from the machine learning and statistics literature and implement a cross validation technique to provide an unbiased method to identify the most likely spectrum amongst a set obtained with different spectral parameterizations and imposed constraints. We demonstrate the power of this method with examples using imaginary-time data generated by QMC simulations and synthetic data generated from artificial spectra. Our procedure, which can be considered a form of model selection, can be applied to a variety of numerical analytic continuation methods, beyond just SAC.</description>
