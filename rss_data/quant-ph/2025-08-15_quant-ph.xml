      <title>Approximating Entanglement Based on Abstract Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is a fundamental property of quantum systems, essential for non-trivial quantum programs. Identifying when qubits become entangled is critical for circuit optimization, and for arguing for the correctness of quantum algorithms. This paper presents a static analysis method for approximating entanglement by extending an already existing abstract interpretation, thus avoiding the exponential slowdown of an exact analysis. The approach is shown to be sound and an implementation is provided in Standard ML with linear-time scalability.</description>

      <title>On the role of overparametrization in Quantum Approximate Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms have emerged as a cornerstone of contemporary quantum algorithms research. While they have demonstrated considerable promise in solving problems of practical interest, efficiently determining the minimal quantum resources necessary to obtain such a solution remains an open question. In this work, inspired by concepts from classical machine learning, we investigate the impact of overparameterization on the performance of variational algorithms. Our study focuses on the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) -- a prominent variational quantum algorithm designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. We investigate if circuit overparametrization is necessary and sufficient to solve such problems in QAOA, considering two representative problems -- MAX-CUT and MAX-2-SAT. For MAX-CUT we observe that overparametriation is both sufficient and (statistically) necessary for attaining exact solutions, as confirmed numerically for up to $20$ qubits. In fact, for MAX-CUT on 2-regular graphs we show the necessity to be exact, based on the analytically found optimal depth. In sharp contrast, for MAX-2-SAT, underparametrized circuits suffice to solve most instances. This result highlights the potential of QAOA in the underparametrized regime, supporting its utility for current noisy devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit simulation with a local time-dependent variational principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical simulations of quantum circuits are vital for assessing potential quantum advantage and benchmarking devices, yet they require sophisticated methods to avoid the exponential growth of resources. Tensor network approaches, in particular matrix product states (MPS) combined with the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, currently dominate large-scale circuit simulations. These methods scale efficiently when entanglement is limited but suffer rapid bond dimension growth with increasing entanglement and handle long-range gates via costly SWAP insertions. Motivated by the success of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) in many-body physics, we reinterpret quantum circuits as a series of discrete time evolutions, using gate generators to construct an MPS-based circuit simulation via a local TDVP formulation. This addresses TEBD's key limitations by (1) naturally accommodating long-range gates and (2) optimally representing states on the MPS manifold. By diffusing entanglement more globally, the method suppresses local bond growth and reduces memory and runtime costs. We benchmark the approach on five 49-qubit circuits: three Hamiltonian circuits (1D open and periodic Heisenberg, 2D 7x7 Ising) and two algorithmic ones (quantum approximate optimization, hardware-efficient ansatz). Across all cases, our method yields substantial resource reductions over standard tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art for circuit simulation and enabling advances across quantum computing, condensed matter, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Majorana braiding simulations with projective measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize the key ingredients required for universal topological quantum computation using Majorana zero modes in networks of topological superconductor nanowires. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of both sparse and dense logical qubit encodings, and on the transitions between them via projective parity measurements. Combined with hybridization, these operations extend the computational capabilities beyond braiding alone and enable universal gate sets. In addition to outlining the theoretical foundations-including the algebra of Majorana operators, along with the stabilizer formalism-we introduce an efficient numerical method for simulating the time-dependent dynamics of such systems. This method, based on the time dependent Pfaffian formalism, allows for the classical simulation of realistic device architectures that incorporate braiding, projective measurements, and disorder. The result is a semi-pedagogical overview and computational toolbox designed to support further exploration of topological quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Projective Measurements: Topological Quantum Computing with an Arbitrary Number of Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological quantum computing promises intrinsic fault tolerance by encoding quantum information in non-Abelian anyons, where quantum gates are implemented via braiding. While braiding operations are robust against local perturbations, a critical yet often overlooked challenge arises when scaling beyond two qubits: the naive extension of braiding based gates fails to support even the full Clifford group. To overcome this limitation, we incorporate projective measurements that enable transitions between different qubit encodings, thus restoring computational universality. We perform many-body simulations of braiding dynamics augmented with measurement-based switching, explicitly preparing the Bell state and GHZ state for systems of two and five qubits, respectively. Furthermore, we execute a random unitary circuit on five qubits, achieving a fidelity exceeding 99%. We analyze the circuit's robustness by studying its fidelity dependence on total braid duration and static potential disorder. Our results show that the fidelity remains above 99% for moderate disorder, underscoring the intrinsic fault tolerance of the architecture. Finally, we demonstrate a random circuit on a ten qubit system to showcase the scalability of our techniques.</description>

      <title>Exploring the topology of a non-Hermitian superconducting qubit using shortcuts to adiabaticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum systems described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian exhibit rich dynamics due to the topology of their complex energy spectrum. By encircling an exceptional point degeneracy, this topology allows for topological state transport, chiral geometric phases, and eigenvalue braiding. To access these topological features, it is desirable to drive the system adiabatically. However, adiabatic transport in a system with complex spectrum is conventionally only possible for the eigenstate whose eigenenergy has the lowest loss. Previous experiments have demonstrated such adiabatic evolution for the quantum state with relative gain, yet observed a breakdown in adiabaticity for quantum states with relative loss. In this work, we harness a shortcut to adiabaticity -- counterdiabatic driving -- to avoid the effects of loss while maintaining trajectories that follow the instantaneous eigenstates in significantly shorter timescales. We experimentally investigate the robustness of this control method using a superconducting transmon circuit with engineered dissipation. We observe that counterdiabatic driving stabilizes quasistatic transport and preserves the complex energy spectrum's topology.</description>

      <title>Generation of a CW anti-bunched photon field from a thin-film PPLN waveguide by two-photon interference with a weak coherent state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An anti-bunched photon field is produced from a thin-film ppln waveguide by mixing the on-chip two-photon state with a weak but matched coherent state. This is achieved by taking out the two-photon part of the coherent state via a destructive two-photon interference with the on-chip two-photon state. We achieve a photon rate of 100 kHz with a g2-value of 0.35. This anti-bunched light field will have applications in high-resolution quantum imaging such as long baseline quantum telescopy for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a quantum circuit synthesis framework for simulating the unitary time evolution under a subclass of symmetric Toeplitz Hamiltonians by decomposing them into specific diagonal matrices $M_k$. These matrices are then classified, to achieve significant simplification, into, $M_k$ when $k$ is a power of two, and congruence classes with constant coefficients. Finally, we construct the explicit quantum circuit for the one-dimensional discrete Poisson equation. This research was conducted under the supervision of Benoit Valiron during a Master's internship.</description>

      <title>Metrological power of single-qubit dynamical Casimir effect in circuit QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nonstationary circuit QED system described by the quantum Rabi model, in which an artificial two-level atom with a tunable transition frequency is coupled to a single-mode resonator. We focus on regimes where the external modulation takes the form $\sin[\eta(t) t]$, with the modulation frequency $\eta(t)$ varying slowly and linearly in time near $2\nu$ and $4\nu$, $\nu$ being the resonator frequency. Starting from the vacuum state, we numerically compute the Quantum Fisher Information for single-mode phase and displacement estimation, showing that it significantly exceeds the classical limits for the same average photon number, even in the presence of dissipation. Thus, appropriate parametric modulation of the qubit not only simulates the dynamical Casimir effect but also enables the generation of nonclassical states of light that offer a metrological advantage over classical states of equivalent energy.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved certification of frequency-bin entanglement over multi-mode channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-bin entangled photons can be efficiently produced on-chip which offers a scalable, robust and low-footprint platform for quantum communication, particularly well-suited for resource-constrained settings such as mobile or satellite-based systems. However, analyzing such entangled states typically requires active and lossy components, limiting scalability and multi-mode compatibility. We demonstrate a novel technique for processing frequency-encoded photons using linear interferometry and time-resolved detection. Our approach is fully passive and compatible with spatially multi-mode light, making it suitable for free-space and satellite to ground applications. As a proof-of-concept, we utilize frequency-bin entangled photons generated from a high-brightness multi-resonator source integrated on-chip to show the ability to perform arbitrary projective measurements over both single- and multi-mode channels. We report the first measurement of the joint temporal intensity between frequency-bin entangled photons, which allows us to certify entanglement by violating the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, with a measured value of $|S|=2.32\pm0.05$ over multi-mode fiber. By combining time-resolved detection with energy-correlation measurements, we perform full quantum state tomography, yielding a state fidelity of up to $91\%$. We further assess our ability to produce non-classical states via a violation of time-energy entropic uncertainty relations and investigate the feasibility of a quantum key distribution protocol. Our work establishes a resource-efficient and scalable approach toward the deployment of robust frequency-bin entanglement over free-space and satellite-based links.</description>

      <title>Light Storage and Retrieval in an Atomic Tripod System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly-efficient quantum memories are essential for advancing quantum information processing technologies, including scalable quantum computing and quantum networks. We experimentally demonstrate a light storage and retrieval protocol in a tripod system using an ensemble of laser-cooled $^{87}$Rb atoms. The tripod system, which consists of three ground states and an excited state, offers rich dynamics: its use to coherently store and retrieve a weak probe pulse in the $^{87}$Rb $F=1$ ground state manifold leads to the interference of two spin-wave excitations during storage time that translate to an interference in the peak intensity of the retrieved probe pulse. Our work shows that these interferences, which manifest when varying the pulse sequence or energy level structure, can be controlled experimentally by varying the storage time, optical phase, and magnetic field strength. Theoretical simulations exhibit excellent agreement with the experimental results. This work demonstrates the rich dynamics and versatile capabilities of atomic tripod systems for light storage and retrieval, with key advantages over conventional $\Lambda$-systems, highlighting the potential of atomic tripod systems for applications in quantum information processing, quantum synchronization, and atomic memory protocols.</description>

      <title>Boundary-induced Phases in the Dissipative Dicke Lattice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superradiant phase transition in the dissipative Dicke lattice model, driven by on-site collective atom-photon interactions and inter-site photon hopping, is a cornerstone of nonequilibrium quantum many-body physics. However, little is still known about the influence of boundaries in experimental achievable systems of finite size. Here we investigate the dissipative superradiant phase transition in the Dicke lattice model with a small number of sites and reveal a striking sensitivity of this model to the nature of the boundary conditions. Specifically, we find that under open boundary conditions a whole zoo of superradiant phases with broken translational symmetry appears, which is not observed in the corresponding infinite lattice system. Our results demonstrate the crucial influence of boundary effects on the stationary phases of dissipative lattice models, which offers intriguing new opportunities for studying these phenomena in near term experimental realizations of such models in quantum optics and circuit QED.</description>

      <title>Unified Construction of Genuine Multipartite Entanglement Measures Based on Geometric Mean and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) is an important resource in quantum information processing. We systematically study the measures of GME based on the geometric mean of bi-partition entanglements and present a unified construction of GME measures, which gives rise to the widely used GME measures including GME concurrence, the convex-roof extended negativity of GME, the geometric measure of entanglement of GME. Our GME measures satisfy the desirable conditions such as scalability and smoothness. Moreover, we provide fidelity-based analytical lower bounds for our GME measures. Our bounds are tight and can be estimated experiment friendly without requiring quantum state tomography. Furthermore, we apply our results to study the dynamics of GME. We identify an initial condition that influences the sudden death of genuine quadripartite entanglement under individual non-Markovian processes. The GME of Dirac particles with Hawking radiation in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Quantum Wavefront Correction via Machine Learning for Satellite-to-Earth CV-QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art free-space continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols use phase reference pulses to modulate the wavefront of a real local oscillator at the receiver, thereby compensating for wavefront distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence. It is normally assumed that the wavefront distortion in these phase reference pulses is identical to the wavefront distortion in the quantum signals, which are multiplexed during transmission. However, in many real-world deployments, there can exist a relative wavefront error (WFE) between the reference pulses and quantum signals, which, among other deleterious effects, can severely limit secure key transfer in satellite-to-Earth CV-QKD. In this work, we introduce novel machine learning-based wavefront correction algorithms, which utilize multi-plane light conversion for decomposition of the reference pulses and quantum signals into the Hermite-Gaussian (HG) basis, then estimate the difference in HG mode phase measurements, effectively eliminating this problem. Through detailed simulations of the Earth-satellite channel, we demonstrate that our new algorithm can rapidly identify and compensate for any relative WFEs that may exist, whilst causing no harm when WFEs are similar across both the reference pulses and quantum signals. We quantify the gains available in our algorithm in terms of the CV-QKD secure key rate. We show channels where positive secure key rates are obtained using our algorithms, while information loss without wavefront correction would result in null key rates.</description>

      <title>Saturable Quantum Speed Limits for Imaginary-Time Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a Geometric quantum speed limit (QSL) for imaginary-time evolution, where the dynamics is governed by a non-unitary Schr\"{o}dinger equation. By introducing a cost function based on the angular distance between the normalized evolving state and the initial state, we obtain a lower bound on the evolution time expressed as the ratio between this angle and the time-averaged energy dispersion. Our bound is analytical, general, and applicable to arbitrary time-independent Hamiltonians. We analytically evaluate this bound for two physically motivated cases. First, we apply it to a two-level system and derive an expression for the minimal time. Second, we analyze the imaginary-time version of Grover search problem and rigorously reproduce the well-known logarithmic scaling $T=\mathcal{ O}(\log N)$ within our QSL framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several theories that attempt to unify quantum theory and gravitational theory assume that space has an observable limiting resolution related to the Planck length, denoted by $\sqrt{\beta_0}L_p$. Quantum mechanically, this concept derives a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) and the corresponding modified commutator. The prediction and observation of GUP-induced new physics, as well as the quantitative measurement of the value of $\beta_0$, may provide substantial support for the establishment of quantum gravity theory. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive quantum framework for measuring GUP at low energy scales by utilizing the interference-induced bright-dark mode effect of oscillators in an optomechanical system. The nonlinearity induced by GUP will be amplified by the bright mode dynamics, and then be quantitatively read out by the noise spectrum of the dark mode. The measurement limit resolution of the scheme is not constrained by the quality factor of the oscillator. Under experimentally achievable parameters, the measurement resolution has been shown to reach $\beta_{\text{NL,lim}}=10^{-16.75}$, which is $10$ orders of magnitude lower than the electroweak level.</description>

      <title>Teleportation Fidelity of Binary Tree Quantum Repeater Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea of average of maximum teleportation fidelities was introduced in [1] to measure the capability of the network to act as a resource for distributed teleportation between any pair of nodes. Binary tree network, being a subclass of Cayley tree network, is a significant topological structure used for information transfer in a hierarchical sense. In this article, we consider four types of binary tree repeater networks (directed and undirected, asymmetric and symmetric) and obtain the analytical expressions of the average of the maximum teleportation fidelities for each of these binary tree networks. Our work investigates the role of directionality and symmetry in this measure. Like [1], here also we have used simple Werner state-based models and are able to identify the parameter ranges for which these networks can show quantum advantage. We explore the role of maximally entangled states in the network to enhance the quantum advantage. We explore the large $N$ (nodes) scenario for each of these networks and find out the limiting value of the average of the maximum teleportation fidelity for each of these networks. We also include the scenarios when the Werner state parameters for each link are different and chosen from a uniform distribution. According to our analysis, the directed symmetric binary tree is the most beneficial topology in this context. Our results pave the way to identify the resourceful network in transmitting quantum information.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional autocompensating discrete modulation CV-QKD protocol in optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a high-dimensional discrete modulated CV-QKD protocol, with dimension 2N , in optical fibers, where N is the number of optical modes. We use N-dimensional product states of weak coherent states that undergo perturbations along optical fibers and that are cancelled in a passive way (autocompensation) and then measured by a standard balanced homodyne detection. We analyze the security of this high-dimensional protocol when an intercept and resend attack is implemented with simultaneous homodyne measurement in both quadratures and the resulting secure key gains are calculated showing a significative increase with dimension.</description>

      <title>System design and realisation towards optimising secure key bits in free space QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is rapidly transitioning from cutting-edge laboratory research to real-world deployment in established communication networks. Although QKD promises future-proof security, practical challenges stil exist due to imperfections in physical devices. Many protocols offer strong security guarantees, but their implementation can be complex and difficult. To bridge this gap, we present a practical and systematic framework for implementing QKD, focused on the BB84 protocol but designed with broader applicability in mind. The article includes key concepts for device calibration, synchronisation,optical alignment, and key post-processing. We outline a simple algorithm for key sifting that is easily implementable in hardware. Our results highlight the importance of selecting the temporal window to optimise both the key rate and the quantum bit error rate (QBER). In addition, we show that random sampling of the sifted key bits for error estimation yields more reliable results than sequential sampling. We also integrate the Entrapped Pulse Coincidence Detection (EPCD) protocol to boost key generation rates, further enhancing performance. Although our work focuses on BB84, the techniques and practices outlined are general enough to support a wide range of QKD protocols. This makes our framework a valuable tool for both research and real-world deployment of secure quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>Reservoir-Engineered Mechanical Cat States with a Driven Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic quantum superpositions, such as mechanical Schr\"odinger cat states, are central to emerging quantum technologies in sensing and bosonic error-correcting codes. We propose a scheme to generate such states by coupling a nanomechanical resonator to a coherently driven two-level system via both transverse and longitudinal interactions. Driving the qubit at twice the oscillator frequency activates resonant two-phonon exchange processes, enabling coherent conversion of drive energy into phonon pairs and their dissipative stabilization. Starting from the full time-dependent Hamiltonian, we derive an effective master equation for the mechanical mode by perturbative elimination of the lossy qubit. The reduced dynamics feature engineered two-phonon loss and a coherent squeezing term, which together drive the resonator into a deterministic Schr\"odinger-cat state. Our approach requires only a single driven qubit and no auxiliary cavity, offering a scalable and experimentally accessible route to macroscopic quantum superpositions in circuit-QED and related platforms.</description>

      <title>Variational Time Evolution Compression for Solving Impurity Models on Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is a useful tool to analyze models of strongly correlated fermions like the Hubbard model. In DMFT, the lattice of the model is replaced by a single impurity site embedded in an effective bath. The resulting single impurity Anderson model (SIAM) can then be solved self-consistently with a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm. This procedure involves repeatedly preparing the ground state on a quantum computer and evolving it in time to measure the Greens function. We here develop an approximation of the time evolution operator for this setting by training a Hamiltonian variational ansatz. The parameters of the ansatz are obtained via a variational quantum algorithm that utilizes a small number of time steps, given by the Suzuki- Trotter expansion of the time evolution operator, to guide the evolution of the parameters. The resulting circuit has constant depth for the time evolution and is significantly shallower than a comparable Suzuki-Trotter expansion.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Exponential Mixed Frequency Growth through Frequency Selection and Dimensional Separation in Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To leverage the potential computational speedup of quantum computing (QC), research in quantum machine learning (QML) has gained increasing prominence. Angle encoding techniques in QML models have been shown to generate truncated Fourier series, offering asymptotically universal function approximation capabilities. By selecting efficient feature maps (FMs) within quantum circuits, one can leverage the exponential growth of Fourier frequencies for improved approximation. In multi-dimensional settings, additional input dimensions induce further exponential scaling via mixed frequencies. In practice, however, quantum models frequently fail at regression tasks. Through two white-box experiments, we show that such failures can occur even when the relevant frequencies are present, due to an insufficient number of trainable parameters.
  In order to mitigate the double-exponential parameter growth resulting from double-exponentially growing frequencies, we propose frequency selection and dimensional separation as techniques to constrain the number of parameters, thereby improving trainability. By restricting the QML model to essential frequencies and permitting mixed frequencies only among feature dimensions with known interdependence, we expand the set of tractable problems on current hardware. We demonstrate the reduced parameter requirements by fitting two white-box functions with known frequency spectrum and dimensional interdependencies that could not be fitted with the default methods. The reduced parameter requirements permit us to perform training on a noisy quantum simulator and to demonstrate inference on real quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Enhanced multiphoton ionization driven by quantum light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in nanoscale and microscale photon-pair sources have enabled quantum-light-matter interactions in regimes where standard approximations, such as the paraxial limit, break down. Identifying quantum advantages in these domains requires a unified, first-principles framework that treats arbitrary quantum states of light and realistic material systems without restrictive assumptions. Here, we present a fully relativistic, beyond-paraxial theory of multiphoton ionization driven by quantum light, incorporating the full spatial structure and correlations of the field alongside material properties. As a case study, we apply the formalism to resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) of neutral sodium atoms by momentum-entangled photons. We predict cross-section enhancements of several orders of magnitude compared to coherent light, arising entirely from non-paraxial effects and vanishing in the paraxial limit. The enhancement is strongly channel-dependent, with odd multipole transitions benefiting most from favorable parity and interference conditions. The predicted enhancement is accessible with current state-of-the-art photonic and atomic technologies, highlighting a promising avenue for exploiting quantum light in high-precision ionization and spectroscopy experiments.</description>

      <title>Simulating Mass-Dependent Decoherence in Quantum Computers: Baseline Signatures for Testing Gravity-Induced Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum computing simulation study of mass-dependent decoherence models inspired by Penrose's gravity-induced collapse hypothesis. According to objective reduction (OR) theory, quantum superpositions become unstable when the gravitational self-energy difference between branches exceeds a certain threshold, leading to a collapse time $\tau \approx \hbar / E_G$. In this work, we implement a mass-dependent dephasing noise channel, $p(m) = 1 - e^{-k m^{\alpha}}$, within the Qiskit AerSimulator, where $m$ is a proxy for the effective mass of a superposition, mapped to circuit parameters such as the number of entangled qubits or branch size. We apply this model to three canonical quantum computing experiments: GHZ state parity measurements, branch-mass entanglement tests, and Grover's search to generate distinctive collapse signatures that differ qualitatively from constant-rate dephasing. The resulting patterns serve as a baseline reference: if future hardware experiments exhibit the same scaling trends under ideal isolation, this could indicate a contribution from mass-dependent collapse processes. Conversely, deviation toward constant-noise behaviour would suggest the absence of such gravitationally induced effects. Our results provide a reproducible protocol and reference for using quantum computers as potential testbeds for probing fundamental questions in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Information-Inspired Ansatz for Variational Quantum Eigensolver Algorithm: Applications to Atomic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum information-inspired ansatz for the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and demonstrate its efficacy in calculating ground-state energies of atomic systems. Instead of adopting a heuristic approach, we start with an approximate multi-qubit target state and utilize two quantum information-theoretic quantities, i.e., von Neumann entropy and quantum mutual information, to construct our ansatz. The quantum information encoded in the target state helps us to design unique blocks and identify qubit pairs that share maximum quantum correlations among them in the multi-qubit system, thereby enabling us to deterministically place two-qubit entanglers in the suitably constructed parametrized quantum circuit. We find that our approach has the advantage of reduced circuit depth compared to the unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) ansatz (the gold standard for VQE), and yet yields accurate results. To test the performance of our ansatz, we apply it to compute ground-state energies of atomic systems. We find that for up to 12 qubits (or 12 spin orbitals) noiseless calculation, the proposed ansatz yields energies with 99.99% accuracy relative to the complete active space configuration interaction values, while utilizing only two blocks, which contain at most 99% fewer 2-qubit gates than the UCC ansatz.</description>

      <title>Routing and Wavelength Assignment with Minimal Attack Radius for QKD Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can distribute keys with guaranteed security but remains susceptible to key exchange interruption due to physical-layer threats, such as high-power jamming attacks. To address this challenge, we first introduce a novel metric, namely Maximum Number of Affected Requests (maxNAR), to quantify the worst-case impact of a single physical-layer attack, and then we investigate a new problem of Routing and Wavelength Assignment with Minimal Attack Radius (RWA-MAR). We formulate the problem using an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model and propose a scalable heuristic to efficiently minimize maxNAR. Our approach incorporates key caching through Quantum Key Pools (QKPs) to enhance resilience and optimize resource utilization. Moreover, we model the impact of different QKD network architectures, employing Optical Bypass (OB) for optical switching of quantum channels and Trusted Relay (TR) for secure key forwarding. Moreover, a tunable parameter is designed in the heuristic to guide the preference for OB or TR, offering enhanced adaptability and dynamic control in diverse network scenarios. Simulation results confirm that our method significantly outperforms the baseline in terms of security and scalability.</description>

      <title>Interference between non-overlapping waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical mechanics and electromagnetism, interference occurs when two or more waves overlap at the same point in spacetime. However, the advent of quantum electrodynamics (QED) and its remarkable success in describing light-matter interactions at the microscopic level invites us to reconsider whether interference-like effects could arise even when the waves do not physically overlap. In this work, we extend the notion of wave interference to a novel and unconventional regime. Building upon the fundamental description of interference in terms of the interaction with the observer [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 133603 (2025)], we demonstrate that interference-like phenomena can emerge when two independent fields interact with a single detector at different locations in Minkowski space. We begin by developing a theoretical model in which a spatially extended atom simultaneously couples to two distant fields. We then propose an experimentally feasible implementation using superconducting circuits, where a giant artificial atom interacts with two independent resonators. Our findings open new directions for exploring interference in quantum systems and suggest new possibilities for optical quantum technologies, including the realization of atom-transparent devices controlled by spatially separated laser fields.</description>

      <title>Direct Nuclear-Level Qubits using Trapped Th-229 Ions: A Platform for Entanglement and Universal Quantum Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy isomeric transition in Thorium-229 offers a unique interface between nuclear and atomic physics, presenting a resource for quantum technologies that is notably resilient to environmental decoherence. While early experiments focused on nuclei in solid-state crystals, the recent advent of a continuous-wave vacuum ultraviolet laser at 148.4~nm now enables direct coherent control of individual trapped Th-229 ions. Building on this breakthrough, we present a theoretical framework for utilizing trapped Th-229^{3+} ions as high-fidelity nuclear-level qubits, wherein quantum state preparation, single-qubit control, and entangling operations based on nuclear energy levels can all be efficiently realized. We analyze a scheme to generate entanglement between the nuclear isomeric states of two ions through phonon-mediated coupling, driven by optimized red- and blue-detuned laser sideband pulses. Our analysis, grounded in realistic experimental parameters, also demonstrates that high-fidelity entanglement is achievable, leveraging the nucleus's intrinsically long coherence times. These results provide a practical roadmap for developing nuclear-based quantum information processors and suggest that entangled nuclear-level qubits could potentially unlock new frontiers in precision metrology.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Guided Cluster Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the ground state of Ising spin glasses is notoriously difficult due to disorder and frustration. Often, this challenge is framed as a combinatorial optimization problem, for which a common strategy employs simulated annealing, a Monte Carlo (MC)-based algorithm that updates spins one at a time. Yet, these localized updates can cause the system to become trapped in local minima. Cluster algorithms (CAs) were developed to address this limitation and have demonstrated considerable success in studying ferromagnetic systems; however, they tend to encounter percolation issues when applied to generic spin glasses.
  In this work, we introduce a novel CA designed to tackle these challenges by leveraging precomputed two-point correlations, aiming solve combinatorial optimization problems in the form of Max-Cut more efficiently. In our approach, clusters are formed probabilistically based on these correlations. Various classical and quantum algorithms can be employed to generate correlations that embody information about the energy landscape of the problem. By utilizing this information, the algorithm aims to identify groups of spins whose simultaneous flipping induces large transitions in configuration space with high acceptance probability -- even at low energy levels -- thereby escaping local minima more effectively.
  Notably, clusters generated using correlations from the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm exhibit high acceptance rates at low temperatures. These acceptance rates often increase with circuit depth, accelerating the algorithm and enabling more efficient exploration of the solution space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential application of quantum annealing to address the protein structure problem. To this end, we compare several proposed ab initio protein folding models for quantum computers and analyze their scaling and performance for classical and quantum heuristics. Furthermore, we introduce a novel encoding of coordinate based models on the tetrahedral lattice, based on interleaved grids. Our findings reveal significant variations in model performance, with one model yielding unphysical configurations within the feasible solution space. Furthermore, we conclude that current quantum annealing hardware is not yet suited for tackling problems beyond a proof-of-concept size, primarily due to challenges in the embedding. Nonetheless, we observe a scaling advantage over our in-house simulated annealing implementation, which, however, is only noticeable when comparing performance on the embedded problems.</description>

      <title>On the Derivation of Equations of Motion from Symmetries in Quantum-Mechanical Systems via Heisenberg's Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the construction of equations of motion based on symmetries in quantum-mechanical systems, using Heisenberg's uncertainty principle as a minimal foundation. From canonical operators, two spaces of conjugate operators are constructed, along with a third space derived from the former, which includes the ``Symmetry-Dilation'' operator. When this operator commutes with the main equation of motion, it defines the set of observables compatible with a complete basis of operators (symmetry generators), organized into a Lie algebra dependent on Heisenberg's uncertainty principle within Minkowski spacetime. Furthermore, by requiring the dilation operator to commute with the central operator, the wavefunction is constrained, thereby constructing known structures. Specific cases are derived -- relativistic, non-relativistic, and a lesser-studied case: ``ultra-relativistic (Carroll-Schr\"odinger)''. Our work may open new avenues for understanding and classifying symmetries in quantum mechanics, as well as offer an alternative method for deriving equations of motion and applying them to complex scenarios involving exotic particles.</description>

      <title>Deciding Whether a C-Q Channel Preserves a Bit is QCMA-Complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that deciding whether a classical-quantum (C-Q) channel can exactly preserve a single classical bit is QCMA-complete. This "bit-preservation" problem is a special case of orthogonality-constrained optimization tasks over C-Q channels, in which one seeks orthogonal input states whose outputs have small or large Hilbert-Schmidt overlap after passing through the channel. Both problems can be cast as biquadratic optimization with orthogonality constraints. Our main technical contribution uses tools from matrix analysis to give a complete characterization of the optimal witnesses: computational basis states for the minimum, and |+&gt;, |-&gt; over a single basis pair for the maximum. Using this characterization, we give concise proofs of QCMA-completeness for both problems.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning in Classical and Quantum Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific progress is tightly coupled to the emergence of new research tools. Today, machine learning (ML)-especially deep learning (DL)-has become a transformative instrument for quantum science and technology. Owing to the intrinsic complexity of quantum systems, DL enables efficient exploration of large parameter spaces, extraction of patterns from experimental data, and data-driven guidance for research directions. These capabilities already support tasks such as refining quantum control protocols and accelerating the discovery of materials with targeted quantum properties, making ML/DL literacy an essential skill for the next generation of quantum scientists. At the same time, DL's power brings risks: models can overfit noisy data, obscure causal structure, and yield results with limited physical interpretability. Recognizing these limitations and deploying mitigation strategies is crucial for scientific rigor. These lecture notes provide a comprehensive, graduate-level introduction to DL for quantum applications, combining conceptual exposition with hands-on examples. Organized as a progressive sequence, they aim to equip readers to decide when and how to apply DL effectively, to understand its practical constraints, and to adapt AI methods responsibly to problems across quantum physics, chemistry, and engineering.</description>

      <title>Measurement Incompatibility Based In-equivalence Between Bell and Network Nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a well-known fact that measurement incompatibility is a necessary resource to generate nonlocal correlations in usual Bell scenario that typically involves single quantum source. We can provide with some contrasting findings if we consider connected structure of multiple quantum sources. Precisely, we demonstrate that non n-locality can be detected in standard quantum network even when only a single party performs incompatible measurements. More interestingly, for any finite n greater than 2, non n-local correlations can be generated in any standard linear n-local network when all the parties perform compatible measurements. Such an observation is topology specific as one of the parties must perform incompatible measurement to exhibit non n-locality in any non-linear network endowed with star topology. However, we observe that in any non-standard network(all sources independent and nonlocal), to generate genuine non n-local correlations, all the parties must perform incompatible measurements. Such a finding is intuitive as more resource is required to generate stronger form of quantum non-classicality. We also demonstrate that merely providing resource of measurement incompatibility to all the parties is not sufficient for non n-locality detection in any quantum network</description>

      <title>Quantum Otto Heat Engine based on the Dicke-Stark Model under Infinite-Time and Finite-Time Thermodynamic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Otto heat engine that employs a finite-size Dicke-Stark model as the working substance. In the extended coherent state space, the complete energy spectrum and eigenstates of this model are obtained through numerical calculations. Within the infinite-time and finite-time thermodynamics frameworks, we investigate the effects of the Stark field strength, coupling strength, adiabatic stroke time, isochoric stroke time, and number of atoms in the DS model on the heat engine's output work, efficiency, and power. The results show that the maximum values of the output work and efficiency appear near the coupling strength corresponding to the superradiant phase transition point. Regulating the Stark field strength can tune the energy level structure of the system and the superradiant phase transition, effectively reducing entropy generation and quantum friction during nonequilibrium evolution of the system's states and thereby significantly increasing the engine's output work, efficiency, and power. Asymmetric heat engines, where the two isochoric strokes have different Stark field strengths and stroke times, are more conducive to optimizing the heat engine's performance. Additionally, in the DS model, an increase in the number of atoms is also beneficial for increasing the heat engine's output work and efficiency. The results of this paper facilitate the design of high-performance quantum heat engines.</description>

      <title>Magic tricycles: efficient magic state generation with finite block-length quantum LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of high-fidelity non-Clifford (magic) states is an essential subroutine for universal quantum computation, but imposes substantial space-time overhead. Magic state factories based on high rate and distance quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) codes equipped with transversal non-Clifford gates can potentially reduce these overheads significantly, by circumventing the need for multiple rounds of distillation and producing a large number of magic states in a single code-block. As a step towards realizing efficient, fault-tolerant magic state distillation, we introduce a class of finite block-length quantum LDPC codes which we name tricycle codes, generalizing the well-known bicycle codes to three homological dimensions. These codes can support constant-depth physical circuits that implement logical CCZ gates between three code blocks. We show that these tricycle codes enable magic state generation with single-shot state-preparation and error correction, leading to a deterministic low-overhead distillation protocol without requiring post-selection. Numerical simulations of specific codes confirm robust performance under circuit-level noise with a Belief-Propagation+Order-Statistics Decoder (BPOSD), demonstrating a high circuit-noise threshold of $&gt;0.4\%$. Finally, we construct optimal depth syndrome extraction circuits for tricycle codes and present a protocol for implementing them efficiently on a reconfigurable neutral atom array platform.</description>

      <title>Decoded Quantum Interferometry Under Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) is a recently proposed quantum optimization algorithm that exploits sparsity in the Fourier spectrum of objective functions, with the potential for exponential speedups over classical algorithms on suitably structured problems. While highly promising in idealized settings, its resilience to noise has until now been largely unexplored. To address this, we conduct a rigorous analysis of DQI under noise, focusing on local depolarizing noise. For the maximum linear satisfiability problem, we prove that, in the presence of noise, performance is governed by a noise-weighted sparsity parameter of the instance matrix, with solution quality decaying exponentially as sparsity decreases. We demonstrate this decay through numerical simulations on two special cases: the Optimal Polynomial Intersection problem and the Maximum XOR Satisfiability problem. The Fourier-analytic methods we develop can be readily adapted to other classes of random Pauli noise, making our framework applicable to a broad range of noisy quantum settings and offering guidance on preserving DQI's potential quantum advantage under realistic noise.</description>

      <title>Programmable few-atom Bragg scattering and ground-state cooling in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By integrating tweezer arrays with a high-cooperativity ring cavity with chiral atom-cavity coupling, we demonstrate highly directional Bragg scattering from a programmable number of atoms. Through accurate control of the interatomic distance, we observe a narrowing-down of the Bragg peak as we increase the atom number one by one. The observed high-contrast Bragg interference is enabled by cavity sideband cooling of both the radial and axial motions to near the ground state with phonon occupation numbers below 0.17 and 3.4, respectively. This new platform that integrates strong and controlled atom-light coupling into atomic arrays enables applications from programmable quantum optics to quantum metrology and computation.</description>

      <title>Parity Cross-Resonance: A Multiqubit Gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a native three-qubit entangling gate that exploits engineered interactions to realize control-control-target and control-target-target operations in a single coherent step. Unlike conventional decompositions into multiple two-qubit gates, our hybrid optimization approach selectively amplifies desired interactions while suppressing unwanted couplings, yielding robust performance across the computational subspace and beyond. The new gate can be classified as a cross-resonance gate. We show it can be utilized in several ways, for example, in GHZ triplet state preparation, Toffoli-class logic demonstrations with many-body interactions, and in implementing a controlled-ZZ gate. The latter maps the parity of two data qubits directly onto a measurement qubit, enabling faster and higher-fidelity stabilizer measurements in surface-code quantum error correction. In all these examples, we show that the three-qubit gate performance remains robust across Hilbert space sizes, as confirmed by testing under increasing total excitation numbers. This work lays the foundation for co-designing circuit architectures and control protocols that leverage native multiqubit interactions as core elements of next-generation superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Entangled Polariton States in the Visible and Mid-Infrared Spectral Ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement generation in polariton systems is fundamentally constrained by high losses and decoherence, which typically outweigh polariton nonlinearities. Here, we propose a conceptually different approach that uses optomechanical interactions, rather than polariton-polariton interactions, to generate entangled polaritons. Our double-resonant scheme relies on strong exciton-phonon coupling, found in both inorganic and molecular semiconductors, enabling room-temperature generation of spectrally disparate photon pairs. The quantum coherent and delocalized nature of polariton states inside an optical cavity ensures efficient single-mode outcoupling and allows for unconditional quantum state preparation--not relying on any post-selection or projective measurements. When conditioned on exciton-polariton emission, single phonon-polariton states can be prepared that subsequently yield bright, heralded single-photon emission in the mid-IR. We introduce a double-resonant optomechanical platform that enables scalable, room-temperature quantum polaritonics without relying on conventional excitonic nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Scalable platform for qudit-based quantum computing using polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model of a scalable qudit-based quantum processor that uses rotational degrees of freedom of polar molecules. Entangling gates between qudits are implemented via moving molecule in optical traps by exploiting dipole-dipole interactions to mediate coherent coupling. We develop encoding schemes that map single qubits (d=2) into qudits of dimensions 2 &lt;= d &lt;= 5, and pairs of qubits into higher-dimensional qudits with d=4, 5. This approach enables the realization of a universal set of quantum gates. In particular, we exploit additional levels that are present in the d=3 and d=5 qudits, which allows one to simplify the decomposition of multiqubit gates. We then analyze the relevant experimental parameters to realize our schemes with SrF and 87Rb133Cs molecules. The proposed approach offers a promising route towards scalable and versatile quantum information processing with multilevel systems, which can be potentially realized using currently available experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>QB Ground State Energy Estimation Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground State Energy Estimation (GSEE) is a central problem in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics, demanding efficient algorithms to solve complex electronic structure calculations. This work introduces a structured benchmarking framework for evaluating the performance of both classical and quantum solvers on diverse GSEE problem instances. We assess three prominent methods -- Semistochastic Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction (SHCI), Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), and Double-Factorized Quantum Phase Estimation (DF QPE) -- ighlighting their respective strengths and limitations. Our results show that fully optimized SHCI achieves near-universal solvability on the benchmark set, DMRG excels for low-entanglement systems, and DF QPE is currently constrained by hardware and algorithmic limitations. However, we observe that many benchmark Hamiltonians are drawn from datasets tailored to SHCI and related approaches, introducing a bias that favors classical solvers. To mitigate this, we propose expanding the benchmark suite to include more challenging, strongly correlated systems to enable a more balanced and forward-looking evaluation of solver capabilities. As quantum hardware and algorithms improve, this benchmarking framework will serve as a vital tool for tracking progress and identifying domains where quantum methods may surpass classical techniques. The QB-GSEE benchmark repository is openly available at https://github.com/isi-usc-edu/qb-gsee-benchmark [1]. By maintaining a scalable and open resource, we aim to accelerate innovation in computational quantum chemistry and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>A Classical Quadratic Speedup for Planted $k$XOR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent work of Schmidhuber et al (QIP, SODA, &amp; Phys. Rev. X 2025) exhibited a quantum algorithm for the noisy planted $k$XOR problem running quartically faster than all known classical algorithms. In this work, we design a new classical algorithm that is quadratically faster than the best previous one, in the case of large constant $k$. Thus for such $k$, the quantum speedup of Schmidhuber et al. becomes only quadratic (though it retains a space advantage). Our algorithm, which also works in the semirandom case, combines tools from sublinear-time algorithms (essentially, the birthday paradox) and polynomial anticoncentration.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Quantization of Electrodynamics and Linearized Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified stochastic framework in which a velocity- and helicity-reversing Poisson process gives rise to the Telegrapher's equation. Analytic continuation to the complex plane results in Dirac-like evolution equations for electromagnetic and linearized gravitational fields. A small but nonzero mass parameter is essential to enable helicity reversals. Yet, the correct massless wave equations are recovered as the physically relevant massless limit is approached smoothly, with the singular point excluded from the construction. Remarkably, probability does not enter as an external postulate as in the Born rule in standard quantum mechanics -- but is intrinsic to the stochastic process. This probabilistic structure becomes embedded in the wave fields through a natural rescaling by the Planck length.</description>

      <title>Comparison of D-Wave Quantum Annealing and Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Sampling from a Probability Distribution of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch, the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Transient Absorption Study of Coherent Hole Oscillation in Ar+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the observation, characterization, and control of the electron dynamics in ionized argon atoms. We utilized an intense mid-infrared (MIR) pulse to create a coherent superposition of the spin-orbit split ground state of the ion. A weak extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulse then probes the hole oscillation through time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. We investigated several 3p to nd transitions accessible with our XUV high harmonics which show a 23fs beat corresponding to the energy separation between the initially populated states. The experimental attosecond transient absorption signals for different pathways were simulated using detailed TDSE simulations and perturbative analytic calculations. The analysis of phase relations between the oscillations reveals important information about transition dipole moments in the system. In addition, we employed another strong MIR pulse to achieve transient control over the absorption by inducing Stark shifts of the states without affecting the electronic coherences.</description>

Abstract: There are new detector proposals and R&amp;D that utilize quantum enhancements not previously adopted. Examples include superconducting quantum sensors, atom interferometry, and quantum spin sensors. They are mainly motivated by industrial applications toward quantum computing, secure quantum communication systems, and high-sensitivity sensors. Given the excellent potential of the new quantum measurement systems, there are also new proposals to apply them in particle physics and cosmology. In this review, I survey currently available and emerging quantum technologies and their applications.

      <title>Visualizing intense laser field driven electron dynamics in a multielectron molecule: dynamic electron localization, bonding properties and multiple ionization bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents results and discussion of electron dynamics in molecules in which intense ultrafast pulse drives multiphoton ionization, high harmonic generation, and charge resonance due to the Rabbi flopping in the regime of Charge Resonance Enhanced Ionization (CREI) for the ground state molecular nitrogen cation. We show how ionization rates oscillate with oscillations of envelope reflecting modulation of the population of the excited molecular orbital. We observe the increase in ionization due to mechanisms analogous to Charge Resonance Enhanced Ionization (CREI) and also uncover also the time periods of suppressed ionization. Electronic flux calculations illustrate these changes and help reveal multiple ionization bursts which are for the first time reported for a multielectron non-stretched/ non-dissociating molecule. Furthermore, we discuss the effects of ultrafast intense laser pulses on the bonding properties of a nitrogen molecular ion in these conditions through detailed analysis of electron density and electron density differences, time-dependent average local energy, and time-dependent electron localization function. We illustrate the main characteristics of changes of the electron density that leads to laser induced dynamics of bonding and how the standard criteria lead to the transient properties of double, triple, and lone pair bonding characteristics.</description>

      <title>Characterization of non-planar ring oscillators at a wavelength of 1064 nm for high precision metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-stable laser light is essential for high-precision interferometric measurements, in particular for the next generation of gravitational wave detectors, where high power lasers with unprecedented low power and frequency noise are demanded. Since the seed laser for high-power laser system has a large influence on the overall noise characteristics, the use of the lowest noise seed laser is beneficial. This study compares a newly developed seed laser, based on a non-planar ring oscillator (NPRO) design, at a wavelength of 1064 nm with two commercial NPROs and shows that the new laser exhibits ten times lower power and frequency noise. This noise advantage is retained even after subsequent amplification to 40 W.</description>

Abstract: We report precision measurements of the lateral component of the oscillating magnetic field reflected from a copper plate, which is fully determined by s-polarized evanescent waves. The measurement data are compared with theoretical predictions of classical electrodynamics using the dielectric permittivity of copper as given by the Drude model. It is shown that these predictions are excluded by the measurement data which means that the currently used Drude model does not provide a complete description of the electromagnetic response of metals for s-polarized evanescent waves. The critical importance of this result for several fields of condensed matter physics and optics dealing with evanescent waves, including the Casimir effect, is discussed.</description>

      <title>Feedback stabilization of a nanoparticle at the intensity minimum of an optical double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop and analyze adaptive feedback control strategies to stabilize and confine a nanoparticle at the unstable intensity minimum of an optical double-well potential. The resulting stochastic optimal control problem for a noise-driven mechanical particle in a nonlinear optical potential must account for unavoidable experimental imperfections such as measurement nonlinearities and slow drifts of the optical setup. To address these issues, we simplify the model in the vicinity of the unstable equilibrium and employ indirect adaptive control techniques to dynamically follow changes in the potential landscape. Our approach leads to a simple and efficient Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller that can be implemented on fast and cost-effective FPGAs, ensuring accessibility and reproducibility. We demonstrate that this strategy successfully tracks the intensity minimum and significantly reduces the nanoparticle's residual state variance, effectively lowering its center-of-mass temperature. While conventional optical traps rely on confining optical forces in the light field at the intensity maxima, trapping at intensity minima mitigates absorption heating, which is crucial for advanced quantum experiments. Since LQG control naturally extends into the quantum regime, our results provide a promising pathway for future experiments on quantum state preparation beyond the current absorption heating limitation, like matter-wave interference and tests of the quantum-gravity interface.</description>

      <title>AEGISS -- Atomic orbital and Entropy-based Guided Inference for Space Selection -- A novel semi-automated active space selection workflow for quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The selection of a balanced active space is a critical step in multi-reference quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for systems with strong electron correlation. Likewise, active space selection is a key to unlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry. Albeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully automated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a wide range of molecular systems.
  In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum computational frameworks.
  Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave transport devices, such as amplifiers, frequency converters, and nonreciprocal devices, are essential for modern communication, signal processing, and sensing applications. Of particular interest are traveling wave setups, which offer excellent gain and bandwidth properties. So far, the conceptual design of those devices has relied on human ingenuity. This makes it difficult and time-consuming to explore the full design space under a variety of constraints and target functionalities. In our work, we present a method which automates this challenge. By optimizing the discrete and continuous parameters of periodic coupled-mode lattices, our approach identifies the simplest lattices that achieve the target transport functionality, and we apply it to discover new schemes for directional amplifiers, isolators, and frequency demultiplexers. Leveraging automated symbolic regression tools, we find closed analytical expressions that facilitate the discovery of generalizable construction rules. Moreover, we utilize important conceptual connections between the device transport properties and non-Hermitian topology. The resulting structures can be implemented on a variety of platforms, including microwave, optical, and optomechanical systems. Our approach opens the door to extensions like the artificial discovery of lattice models with desired properties in higher dimensions or with nonlinear interactions.</description>

      <title>Generating Compilers for Qubit Mapping and Routing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers promise to solve important problems faster than classical computers, potentially unlocking breakthroughs in materials science, chemistry, and beyond. Optimizing compilers are key to realizing this potential, as they minimize expensive resource usage and limit error rates. A critical compilation step is qubit mapping and routing (QMR), which finds mappings from circuit qubits to qubits on a target device and plans instruction execution while satisfying the device's connectivity constraints. The challenge is that the landscape of quantum architectures is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving. Given this diversity, hundreds of papers have addressed the QMR problem for different qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error correction schemes.
  We present an approach for automatically generating qubit mapping and routing compilers for arbitrary quantum architectures. Though each QMR problem is different, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use to formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a domain-specific language, Marol, for specifying QMR problems-for example, the well-studied NISQ mapping and routing problem requires only 12 lines of Marol. We demonstrate that QMR problems, defined in Marol, can be solved with a powerful parametric solver that can be instantiated for any Marol program. We evaluate our approach through case studies of important QMR problems from prior and recent work, covering noisy and fault-tolerant quantum architectures on all major hardware platforms. Our thorough evaluation shows that generated compilers are competitive with handwritten, specialized compilers in terms of runtime and solution quality. We envision that our approach will simplify development of future quantum compilers as new quantum architectures continue to emerge.</description>

Abstract: Predicting the behavior of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) is important as their use becomes more widespread in fields ranging from quantum computing to quantum remote sensing. Here, we present a vortex crossing theory of photon detection which provides a unified definition of system detection efficiency and dark count rates. Our approach quantitatively captures the plateau region of system detection efficiency for NbN and WSi based SNSPDs. We concurrently predict the temperature dependence of dark count rates and the intrinsic timing jitter of SNSPDs. We extensively benchmark our model against various experiments to aid in the design of the next generation of SNSPDs.</description>

      <title>Concentration-Free Quantum Kernel Learning in the Rydberg Blockade</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum kernel methods (QKMs) offer an appealing framework for machine learning on near-term quantum computers. However, QKMs generically suffer from exponential concentration, requiring an exponential number of measurements to resolve the kernel values, with the exception of trivial (i.e., classically simulable) kernels. Here we propose a QKM that is free of exponential concentration, yet remains hard to simulate classically. Our QKM utilizes the weak ergodicity-breaking many-body dynamics in the Rydberg blockade of coherently driven neutral atom arrays. We demonstrate the fundamental properties of our QKM by analytically solving an approximate toy model of its underpinning quantum dynamics, as well as by extensive numerical simulations on randomly generated datasets. We further show that the proposed kernel exhibits effective learning on real data. The proposed QKM can be implemented in current neutral atom quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Gauging the variational optimization of projected entangled-pair states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) constitute a powerful variational ansatz for capturing ground state physics of two-dimensional quantum systems. However, accurately computing and minimizing the energy expectation value remains challenging, in part because the impact of the gauge degrees of freedom that are present in the tensor network representation is poorly understood. We analyze the role of gauge transformations for the case of a U(1)-symmetric PEPS with point group symmetry, thereby reducing the gauge degrees of freedom to a single class. We show how gradient-based optimization strategies exploit the gauge freedom, causing the tensor network contraction to become increasingly inaccurate and to produce artificially low variational energies. Furthermore, we develop a gauge-fixed optimization strategy that largely suppresses this effect, resulting in a more robust optimization. Our study underscores the need for gauge-aware optimization strategies to guarantee reliability of variational PEPS in general settings.</description>

      <title>Introducing CQ: A C-like API for Quantum Accelerated HPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present CQ, a specification for a C-like API for quantum accelerated HPC, as well as CQ-SimBE, a reference implementation of CQ written in C99, and built on top of the statevector simulator QuEST. CQ focuses on enabling the incremental integration of quantum computing into classical HPC codes by supporting runtime offloading from languages such as C and Fortran. It provides a way of describing and offloading quantum computations which is compatible with strictly and strongly typed compiled languages, and gives the programmer fine-grained control over classical data movement. The CQ Simulated Backend (CQ-SimBE) provides both a way to demonstrate the usage and utility of CQ, and a space to experiment with new features such as support for analogue quantum computing. Both the CQ specification and CQ-SimBE are open-source, and available in public repositories.</description>

      <title>Random Permutation Circuits are Quantum Chaotic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random permutation circuits were recently introduced as minimal models for local many-body dynamics that can be interpreted both as classical and quantum. Standard indicators of chaos such as damage spreading, show that these systems exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions in the classical setting. Here, we address their quantum chaoticity by studying the time evolution of local operator entanglement (LOE). We show that the behaviour of LOE in random permutation circuits depends on the dimension of the local configuration space q. When q = 2, i.e. the circuits act on qubits, random permutations are Clifford and the LOE of any local operator is bounded by a constant, indicating that they are not truly chaotic. On the other hand, when the dimension of the local configuration space exceeds two, the LOE grows linearly in time. We prove this in the limit of large dimensions and present numerical evidence that a three-dimensional local configuration space is sufficient for a linear growth of LOE. Our findings highlight that quantum chaos can be produced by essentially classical dynamics. Moreover, we show that LOE can be defined also in the classical realm and put it forward as a universal indicator chaos, both quantum and classical.</description>

      <title>The Algebra of the Pseudo-Observables I: Why Quantum Mechanics is the ultimate description of Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05633</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.05633v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the first of several parts introducing a new powerful algebra: the algebra of the pseudo-observables. This is a C*-algebra whose set is formed by formal expressions involving observables. The algebra is constructed by applying the Occam's razor principle, in order to obtain the minimal description of physical reality. Proceeding in such a manner, every aspect of quantum mechanics acquires a clear physical interpretation or a logical explanation, providing, for instance, in a natural way the reason for the structure of complex algebra and the matrix structure of the formulation of Werner Heisenberg of quantum mechanics. Last but not least, the very general hypotheses assumed, allow one to state that quantum mechanics is the unique minimal description of physical reality.</description>

      <title>Towards Fully Passive Time-Bin Quantum Key Distribution over Moving Free-Space Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Encoding quantum information in photonic time-bin states is typically considered impractical for moving free-space quantum communication due to the difficulties with phase stabilization of distant quantum time-bin interferometers and turbulence of free-space channels. We demonstrate a novel approach using reference frame independent time-bin quantum key distribution that completely avoids the need for active relative phase stabilization while simultaneously overcoming a highly multi-mode channel without any active mode filtering. This scheme enables passive, self-compensating time-bin quantum communication without any mode filtering, mode sorting, adaptive optics, active basis selection, or active phase alignment. We realize a proof-of-concept demonstration using hybrid polarization and time-bin entangled photons that demonstrates a sustained asymptotic secure key rate greater than 0.07 bits/coincidence over a 15m multi-mode fiber optical channel and showing entanglement correlations over a moving 38.5dB loss free-space channel, including system losses. The scheme simplifies the use of time-bin encoding and can be readily applied over various spatially multi-mode and fluctuating channels involving rapidly moving platforms, including airborne and satellite systems.</description>

      <title>Estimating Eigenenergies from Quantum Dynamics: A Unified Noise-Resilient Measurement-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01858v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground state energy estimation in physical, chemical, and materials sciences is one of the most promising applications of quantum computing. In this work, we introduce a new hybrid approach that finds the eigenenergies by collecting real-time measurements and post-processing them using the machinery of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). From the perspective of quantum dynamics, we establish that our approach can be formally understood as a stable variational method on the function space of observables available from a quantum many-body system. We also provide strong theoretical and numerical evidence that our method converges rapidly even in the presence of a large degree of perturbative noise, and show that the method bears an isomorphism to robust matrix factorization methods developed independently across various scientific communities. Our numerical benchmarks on spin and molecular systems demonstrate an accelerated convergence and a favorable resource reduction over state-of-the-art algorithms. The DMD-centric strategy can systematically mitigate noise and stands out as a leading hybrid quantum-classical eigensolver.</description>

      <title>Optical readout of a superconducting qubit using a piezo-optomechanical transducer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06026v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors have made significant progress in size and computing potential. However, the practical cryogenic limitations of operating large numbers of superconducting qubits are becoming a bottleneck for further scaling. Due to the low thermal conductivity and the dense optical multiplexing capacity of telecommunications fiber, converting qubit signal processing to the optical domain using microwave-to-optics transduction would significantly relax the strain on cryogenic space and thermal budgets. Here, we demonstrate optical readout of a superconducting transmon qubit through an optical fiber connected via a coaxial cable to a fully integrated piezo-optomechanical transducer. Using a demolition readout technique, we achieve a single shot readout fidelity of 81%. Our results illustrate the benefits of piezo-optomechanical transduction for low-dissipation operation of large quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Certified algorithms for equilibrium states of local quantum Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting observables in equilibrium states is a central yet notoriously hard question in quantum many-body systems. In the physically relevant thermodynamic limit, certain mathematical formulations of this task have even been shown to result in undecidable problems. Using a finite-size scaling of algorithms devised for finite systems often fails due to the lack of certified convergence bounds for this limit. In this work, we design certified algorithms for computing expectation values of observables in the equilibrium states of local quantum Hamiltonians, both at zero and positive temperature. Importantly, our algorithms output rigorous lower and upper bounds on these values. This allows us to show that expectation values of local observables can be approximated in finite time, contrasting related undecidability results. When the Hamiltonian is commuting on a 2-dimensional lattice, we prove fast convergence of the hierarchy at high temperature and as a result for a desired precision $\varepsilon$, local observables can be approximated by a convex optimization program of quasi-polynomial size in $1/\varepsilon$.</description>

Abstract: Lagrangians can differ by a total derivative without altering the equations of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is in general true both classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can lead to different physical predictions. We then discuss the criterion that allows one to choose between such Lagrangians. Further, starting from the appropriate QED Lagrangian, we derive the master equation for the non-relativistic electron interacting with thermal photons upto second order in the interactions. This case study lends further phenomenological support to our proposed criterion.</description>

      <title>Kirkwood-Dirac representations beyond quantum states (and their relation to noncontextuality)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kirkwood-Dirac representations of quantum states are increasingly finding use in many areas within quantum theory. Usually, representations of this sort are only applied to provide a representation of quantum states (as complex functions over some set). We show how standard Kirkwood-Dirac representations can be extended to a fully compositional representation of all of quantum theory (including channels, measurements and so on), and prove that this extension satisfies the essential features of functoriality (namely, that the representation commutes with composition of channels), linearity, and quasistochasticity. Interestingly, the representation of a POVM element is uniquely picked out to be the collection of weak values for it relative to the bases defining the representation. We then prove that if one can find any Kirkwood-Dirac representation that is everywhere real and nonnegative for a given experimental scenario or fragment of quantum theory, then the scenario or fragment is consistent with the principle of generalized noncontextuality, a key notion of classicality in quantum foundations. We also show that the converse does not hold: even if one verifies that all Kirkwood-Dirac representations (as defined herein) of an experiment require negativity or imaginarity, one cannot generally conclude that the experiment witnesses contextuality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is one of the most exciting potential applications of quantum technology. While under intensive studies, the training process of quantum machine learning is relatively ambiguous and its quantum advantages are not very completely explained. Here we investigate the training process of quantum neural networks from the perspective of Fourier analysis. We empirically propose a frequency principle for parameterized quantum circuits that preferentially train frequencies within the primary frequency range of the objective function faster than other frequencies. We elaborate on the frequency principle in a curve fitting problem by initializing the parameterized quantum circuits as low, medium, and high-frequency functions and then observing the convergence behavior of each frequency during training. We further explain the convergence behavior by investigating the evolution of residues with quantum neural tangent kernels. Moreover, the frequency principle is verified with the discrete logarithmic problem for which the quantum advantage is provable. Our work suggests a new avenue for understanding quantum advantage from the training process.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian Approach to the Lindbladian Dynamics of a Locally Purified Tensor Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor networks offer a valuable framework for implementing Lindbladian dynamics in many-body open quantum systems with nearest-neighbor couplings. In particular, a tensor network ansatz known as the Locally Purified Density Operator employs the local purification of the density matrix to guarantee the positivity of the state at all times. Within this framework, the dissipative evolution utilizes the Trotter-Suzuki splitting, yielding a second-order approximation error. However, due to the Lindbladian dynamics' nature, employing higher-order schemes results in non-physical quantum channels. In this work, we leverage the gauge freedom inherent in the Kraus representation of quantum channels to improve the splitting error. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem on the Riemannian manifold of isometries and find a solution via the second-order trust-region algorithm. We validate our approach using two nearest-neighbor noise models and achieve an improvement of orders of magnitude compared to other positivity-preserving schemes. In addition, we demonstrate the usefulness of our method as a compression scheme, helping to control the exponential growth of computational resources, which thus far has limited the use of the locally purified ansatz.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of Dynamical Decoupling for (Almost) Any Spin-Boson Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling is a technique aimed at suppressing the interaction between a quantum system and its environment by applying frequent unitary operations on the system alone. In the present paper, we analytically study the dynamical decoupling of a two-level system coupled with a structured bosonic environment initially prepared in a thermal state. We find sufficient conditions under which dynamical decoupling works for such systems, and, most importantly, we find bounds for the convergence speed of the procedure. Our analysis is based on a new Trotter theorem for multiple Hamiltonians and involves a rigorous treatment of the evolution of mixed quantum states via unbounded Hamiltonians. A comparison with numerical experiments shows that our bounds reproduce the correct scaling in various relevant system parameters. Furthermore, our analytical treatment allows for quantifying the decoupling efficiency for boson baths with infinitely many modes, in which case a numerical treatment is unavailable.</description>

Abstract: Though known to be present, the accessibility of spacelike vacuum entanglement capable of being a fundamental resource for quantum information processing has remained in question at distances beyond the scale of vacuum fluctuations in massive fields. For a broad subclass of physical many-body mixed Gaussian states, including the free scalar field vacuum, the logarithmic negativity is here shown to be a necessary and sufficient measure of entanglement and to be entirely accessible by pairs of single-mode detectors in the continuum. By deriving exact and optimal detection profiles, entanglement resources in the massive field are demonstrated to be available at all distances.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Unitary Coupled Cluster Wave Functions on Quantum Hardware: Error Bound and Resource-Efficient Optimizer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the projective quantum eigensolver (PQE) approach to optimizing unitary coupled cluster wave functions on quantum hardware, as introduced in arXiv:2102.00345. The projective quantum eigensolver is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm which, by optimizing a unitary coupled cluster wave function, aims at computing the ground state of many-body systems. Instead of trying to minimize the energy of the system like the variational quantum eigensolver, PQE uses projections of the Schrodinger equation to efficiently bring the trial state closer to an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. In this work, we provide a mathematical study of the algorithm. We derive a bound relating off-diagonal coefficients (residues) of the Hamiltonian to the energy error of the algorithm and the overlap achieved by the obtained wavefunction. These bounds not only give formal guarantees to PQE, but they also allow us to formulate a well-informed convergence criterion for residue-based optimizers. We then study the classical optimization itself and derive convergence guarantees under certain conditions. We propose a new residue-based optimizer, with numerical evidence of the superiority of this new approach for H$_4$, H$_6$, BeH$_2$ and LiH dissociation curves over both the optimization introduced in arXiv:2102.00345 and VQE optimized using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method.</description>

      <title>Quantum fault tolerance with constant-space and logarithmic-time overheads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a model of fault-tolerant quantum computation with quick and noiseless polyloglog-time auxiliary classical computation, we construct a fault tolerance protocol with constant-space and $\widetilde{O}(\log N)$-time overhead, where $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides sub-polylog factors. Our construction utilizes constant-rate quantum locally testable codes (qLTC), new fault-tolerant gadgets on qLTCs and qLDPC codes, and a new analysis framework. In particular, 1) we develop a new simple and self-contained construction of magic state distillation for qubits using qudit quantum Reed-Solomon codes with $(\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})^{\gamma}$ spacetime overhead, where $\gamma \rightarrow 0$. 2) We prove that the recent family of almost-good qLTCs of Dinur-Lin-Vidick admit parallel single-shot decoders against adversarial errors of weight scaling with the code distance. 3) We develop logical state preparation and logical gate procedures with $\widetilde{O}(1)$-spacetime overhead on qLTCs. 4) To combine these ingredients, we introduce a new framework of fault tolerance analysis called the weight enumerator formalism. The framework permits easy formal composition of fault-tolerant gadgets, so we expect it to be of independent interest. Our work gives the lowest spacetime overhead to date, which, for the first time, matches that of classical fault tolerance up to sub-polylog factors. We conjecture this is optimal up to sub-polylog factors.</description>

      <title>Relation between equilibrium quantum phase transitions and dynamical quantum phase transitions in two-band systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) is an important concept in nonequilibrium critical phenomena; however, its relation to the equilibrium quantum phase transition (EQPT) remains obscure. Substantial evidence has suggested that quenching across the underlying equilibrium phase boundary is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for the existence of the DQPT. In this work, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of DQPTs in two-band systems by introducing the quench fidelity, which is defined as the fidelity between the ground-state wave functions of the prequench and postquench Hamiltonian, and elaborate it by taking the one-dimensional anisotropic XY model as an example. The relation between EQPTs and DQPTs is analyzed in detail in terms of the quench fidelity.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement of bipartite squeezed states generated by holomorphic Hermite functions of two complex variables is investigated using phase-space approach based on the Wigner distribution function. Orthogonality of the holomorphic Hermite functions implies the relationship between certain real parameter associated with the non-rotational measure in the Bargmann space and the squeezing parameter. The mutual relation between squeezing and entanglement is elucidated with the help of Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose criterion formulated in the phase-space version for continuous-variable systems. The quantitative characteristics of the entanglement is determined using the log-negativity criterion. The oscillator-like model of a two-particle quantum-mechanical system is developed to illustrate the presented findings.</description>

      <title>Simulating lossy and partially distinguishable quantum optical circuits: theory, algorithms and applications to experiment validation and state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To understand quantum optics experiments, we must perform calculations that consider the principal sources of noise, such as losses, spectral impurity and partial distinguishability. In both discrete and continuous variable systems, these can be modeled as mixed Gaussian states over multiple modes. The modes are not all resolved by photon-number measurements and so require calculations on coarse-grained photon-number distribution. Existing methods can lead to a combinatorial explosion in the time complexity, making this task unfeasible for even moderate sized experiments of interest. In this work, we prove that the computation of this type of distributions can be done in exponential time, providing a combinatorial speedup. We develop numerical techniques that allow us to determine coarse-grained photon number distributions of Gaussian states, as well as density matrix elements of heralded non-Gaussian states prepared in the presence of spectral impurity and partial distinguishability. These results offer significant speed-up and accuracy improvements to validation tests of both Fock and Gaussian boson samplers that rely on binned probability distributions. Moreover, they pave the way to a more efficient simulation of realistic photonic circuits, unlocking the ability to perform exact calculations at scales which were previously out of reach. In addition to this, our results, including loop Hafnian master theorems, may be of interest to the fields of combinatorics and graph theory.</description>

Abstract: Quantum synchronization has been a subject of intensive research in the last decade. In this work, we propose a quantum Li\'enard system whose classical equivalent features two limit cycles to one of which the system will converge. In the quantum case, both limit cycles coexist in a single steady state. Each of these limit cycles localizes to a distinct phase if coupled to an external drive: one quantum state can thus be assigned two phases. Furthermore, coupling two such oscillators leads to the simultaneous appearance of synchronization and a synchronization blockade. To shed light on this apparent paradoxical result, we introduce finer measures of quantum synchronization.</description>

Abstract: Imaging thermal sources naturally yields Gaussian states at the receiver, raising the question of whether Gaussian measurements can perform optimally in quantum imaging. In this work, we establish no-go theorems on the performance of Gaussian measurements for imaging thermal sources in the limit of mean photon number per temporal mode $\epsilon \to 0$ or source size $L \to 0$. We show that non-Gaussian measurements can outperform any Gaussian measurement in the scaling of the estimation variance with $\epsilon$ (or $L$). We also present several examples to illustrate the no-go results.</description>

Abstract: Quantum statistics dictate how particles exchange and correlate-but in two-dimensional systems, these rules extend beyond bosons and fermions to anyons, quasiparticles with continuously tunable exchange phases. Here, we develop a Lindblad framework for anyonic oscillators and show that fractional statistics enable statistical control of decoherence in open quantum systems. By varying the anyonic phase and environmental correlations, we demonstrate tunable mode protection, identify exceptional points in the dissipative spectrum, and reveal temperature-dependent coherence bifurcations. Using coherent multidimensional spectroscopy as a probe, we show that statistical phases leave distinct fingerprints in the third-order response, opening new routes to detect and manipulate topological excitations. These results establish the exchange phase as a functional control parameter for engineering dissipation-resilient quantum states.</description>

      <title>Assessing Teleportation of Logical Qubits in a Distributed Quantum Architecture under Error Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing is facing challenges in terms of scaling to thousands of qubits and implementing quantum error correction (QEC). Scaling efforts focus on connecting multiple smaller quantum devices (nodes) in a distributed manner. Non-local CNOTs and teleportation of quantum states become important operations as they enable computation between different nodes in a distributed architecture. For physical qubits, today's high quantum network noise rates prevent the execution of distributed operations with useful accuracy. By employing QEC, we show that non-local operations and teleportation of logical qubits between nodes are feasible under Surface Code and qLDPC encodings with very low logical error rates (LER), even with network noise in near-term regimes. We use circuit-level simulations to assess physical and network noise regimes ranging from $10^{-1}$ to $10^{-6}$. This is a wider range than typically studied in circuit level simulations, understanding the behavior of QEC codes in these regimes is necessary for achieving accurate computation. Our simulations give evidence that transversal distributed operations may carry significantly lower LER than lattice surgery. Importantly, we also find that the LER of our distributed operations decreases exponentially as QEC code distance increases, proving the feasibility of executing large algorithms on distributed quantum computers. Our results indicate that non-local CNOTs can be carried out with a logical error rate of $10^{-12}$ for a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$ and ebit noise of $10^{-2}$. Teleportations realized with the same logical error rate under a physical error rate of $3 \times 10^{-4}$ and ebit noise of $3 \times 10^{-3}$.</description>

Abstract: Stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs) probe the non-stabilizerness (or magic) of many-body systems and quantum computers. Here, we introduce the mutual von-Neumann SRE and magic capacity, which can be efficiently computed in time $O(N\chi^3)$ for matrix product states (MPSs) of bond dimension $\chi$. We find that mutual SRE characterizes the critical point of ground states of the transverse-field Ising model, independently of the chosen local basis. Then, we relate the magic capacity to the anti-flatness of the Pauli spectrum, which quantifies the complexity of computing SREs. The magic capacity characterizes transitions in the ground state of the Heisenberg and Ising model, randomness of Clifford+T circuits, and distinguishes typical and atypical states. Finally, we make progress on numerical techniques: we design two improved Monte-Carlo algorithms to compute the mutual $2$-SRE, overcoming limitations of previous approaches based on local update. We also give improved statevector simulation methods for Bell sampling and SREs with $O(8^{N/2})$ time and $O(2^N)$ memory, which we demonstrate for $24$ qubits. Our work uncovers improved approaches to study the complexity of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Robustness Enhancement of Universal Noncyclic Geometric Gates via Evolution Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noncyclic geometric gates aim to overcome the stringent constraints of conventional cyclic conditions and enhance the flexibility in evolution choice. Conceptually, they can also avoid the error problems arising from the violation of cyclicity, thus holding significance for improving the fault tolerance of quantum gates. However, current research on noncyclic geometric gates lacks a comprehensive exploration of their flexibility in evolution choice and validation of their effectiveness in resilience against multiple error sources present in practical quantum systems. In this paper, we systematically evaluate all noncyclic evolution conditions, elucidate their corresponding potential geometric trajectories, and identify optimal conditions for enhancing gate robustness by quantifying the resilience of constructed noncyclic geometric gates against universal systematic errors and residual crosstalk error. The optimized gates demonstrate significant robustness advantages over representative dynamical Rabi gates and conventional cyclic geometric gates. Furthermore, we validate the physical feasibility of high-fidelity noncyclic geometric gates in superconducting quantum circuits, with focused investigation into the impacts of intrinsic leakage errors and decoherence effects. Therefore, this work establishes a critical foundation for robust gate implementation toward practical fault-tolerant quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Is Quantum Optimization Ready? An Effort Towards Neural Network Compression using Adiabatic Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum optimization is the most mature quantum computing technology to date, providing a promising approach towards efficiently solving complex combinatorial problems. Methods such as adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) have been employed in recent years on important optimization problems across various domains. In deep learning, deep neural networks (DNN) have reached immense sizes to support new predictive capabilities. Optimization of large-scale models is critical for sustainable deployment, but becomes increasingly challenging with ever-growing model sizes and complexity. While quantum optimization is suitable for solving complex problems, its application to DNN optimization is not straightforward, requiring thorough reformulation for compatibility with commercially available quantum devices. In this work, we explore the potential of adopting AQC for fine-grained pruning-quantization of convolutional neural networks. We rework established heuristics to formulate model compression as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, and assess the solution space offered by commercial quantum annealing devices. Through our exploratory efforts of reformulation, we demonstrate that AQC can achieve effective compression of practical DNN models. Experiments demonstrate that adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) not only outperforms classical algorithms like genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning in terms of time efficiency but also excels at identifying global optima.</description>

Abstract: Time crystals are classified into discrete time crystals and continuous time crystals based on whether they spontaneously break time-translation symmetry. Continuous-time crystals do not require external driving. By introducing AdS/CFT duality to time crystals, we derive their thermodynamic limit and find that in strongly correlated many-body systems such as a 3D optical lattice(ions or tweezer in supplemental materials), cooperative many-body tunneling enables time crystals to oscillate spontaneously. In strongly correlated quantum systems driven by many-body cooperative tunneling, we discover a universal scaling law governing the time-crystalline phase transition at a critical temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a reformulation of quantum adiabatic theory in terms of an emergent electromagnetic framework, emphasizing the physical consequences of geometric structures in parameter space. Contrary to conventional approaches, we demonstrate that a Berry electric field naturally arises in systems with dynamic Hamiltonian, when the full time-dependent wavefunction is used to define the gauge potentials. This surprising result bridges the gap between static and dynamical formulations and leads to a deeper understanding of how gauge structures manifest in quantum systems. Building on this, we construct Berry Maxwell equations by analogy with classical electrodynamics, defining Berry electric and magnetic fields as derivatives of scalar and vector potentials obtained from the full quantum state. We verify these equations explicitly and derive field-theoretic identities such as generalized continuity and vorticity relations. This field-based formulation reveals the topological charges, monopole structures, and gauge currents that underlie parameter space, and clarifies how Berry curvature corrections enter dynamical quantities like expectation values and particle velocities. Our results establish a new regime of emergent electromagnetism in parameter space, unifying time-independent and time-dependent geometric phases within a covariant formalism. The implications extend to quantum transport, polarization, and topological classification of phases, providing a robust and generalizable framework for quantum systems driven by adiabatic or nonadiabatic evolution.</description>

Abstract: The compression of quantum circuits is a foundational challenge for near-term quantum computing, yet the principles governing circuit stability remain poorly understood. We investigate this problem through a large-scale numerical analysis of 300 structurally-uniform circuits across 10, 12, and 14 qubits. Despite their macroscopic uniformity, we find that each ensemble universally bifurcates into distinct robust and fragile classes. We solve the puzzle of this emergent bifurcation, demonstrating that its origin is not structural, but is instead encoded in the statistical properties of the gate rotation parameters. Fragile circuits consistently exhibit a universal signature of ``statistical brittleness,'' characterized by low parameter variability and a scarcity of small-angle gates. We uncover the underlying physical mechanism for this phenomenon: Paradoxical Importance where smaller-angle gates are counter-intuitively more critical to the circuit's function, an effect most pronounced in fragile circuits. This reliance on fine-tuning explains why statistically brittle circuits are uniquely vulnerable to failure under compression. These findings establish a new framework for engineering resilient quantum algorithms, shifting the focus from macroscopic structure to the microscopic statistical properties of a circuit's parameters.</description>

Abstract: In conventional exchange-only (EO) spin qubit demonstrations, quantum gates have been implemented using sequences of individually pulsed pairwise exchange interactions with only one exchange coupling active at a time. Alternatively, multiple non-commuting exchange interactions can be pulsed simultaneously, reducing circuit depths and providing protection against leakage. We demonstrate high-fidelity quantum control of an always-on exchange-only (AEON) qubit, operated using simultaneous exchange pulses in a triangular quantum dot (QD) array. We use blind randomized benchmarking to characterize the performance of the full AEON single-qubit Clifford gate set, achieving an average Clifford gate fidelity $F_{\rm C1}$ = 99.86%. Extensions of this work may enable more efficient EO two-qubit entangling gates as well as the implementation of native $i$-Toffoli gates in Loss-DiVincenzo single-spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Energy-speed relationship of quantum particles challenges Bohmian mechanics"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their recent paper [Nature 643, 67 (2025)], Sharaglazova et al. report an optical microcavity experiment yielding an "energy-speed relationship" for quantum particles in evanescent states, which they infer from the observed population transfer between two coupled waveguides. The authors argue that their findings challenge the validity of Bohmian particle dynamics because, according to the Bohmian guiding equation, the velocities in the classically forbidden region would be zero. In this note, we explain why this claim is false and the experimental findings are in perfect agreement with Bohmian mechanics. We also clarify why the operationally defined speeds reported in the paper are unrelated to particle velocities in the sense described by Bohmian mechanics. In contrast to other recent replies, our analysis relies solely on the standard Bohmian guidance equation for single particles.</description>

      <title>Composable Quantum Fault-Tolerance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proving threshold theorems for fault-tolerant quantum computation is a burdensome endeavor with many moving parts that come together in relatively formulaic but lengthy ways. It is difficult and rare to combine elements from multiple papers into a single formal threshold proof, due to the use of different measures of fault-tolerance. In this work, we introduce composable fault-tolerance, a framework that decouples the probabilistic analysis of the noise distribution from the combinatorial analysis of circuit correctness, and enables threshold proofs to compose independently analyzed gadgets easily and rigorously. Within this framework, we provide a library of standard and commonly used gadgets such as memory and logic implemented by constant-depth circuits for quantum low-density parity check codes and distillation. As sample applications, we explicitly write down a threshold proof for computation with surface code and re-derive the constant space-overhead fault-tolerant scheme of Gottesman using gadgets from this library. We expect that future fault-tolerance proofs may focus on the analysis of novel techniques while leaving the standard components to the composable fault-tolerance framework, with the formal proof following the intuitive ``napkin math'' exactly.</description>

      <title>Can randomly structured metasurfaces be used for quantum tomography of high-dimensional spatial qudits?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing the density matrix of the quantum state of photons through a tomographically complete set of measurements, known as quantum state tomography, is an essential task in nearly all applications of quantum science and technology, from quantum sensing to quantum communications. Recent advances in optical metasurfaces enable the design of ultra-thin nanostructured optical elements performing such state tomography tasks, promising greater simplicity, miniaturization, and scalability. However, reported metasurfaces on this goal were limited to a small Hilbert dimension, e.g., polarization qubits or spatial qudits with only a few states. When scaling up to higher-dimensional qudit tomography problems, especially those involving spatial qudits, a natural question arises: whether a metasurface with randomized nanostructures is sufficient to perform such qudit tomography, achieving optimal conditions. In this work, we attempt to answer this question through a set of numerical experiments with random metasurfaces, utilizing large-scale simulations of over 11,000 distinct metasurfaces each exceeding 200 wavelengths in size. We show that with sufficient redundancy in the number of detectors, random metasurfaces perform reasonably well in quantum photonic spatial qudit tomography encoded in Hermite-Gaussian states for up to approximately 10 states. Furthermore, we discuss additional considerations for optimizing metasurfaces in multi-photon cases. Our work opens a pathway toward computationally efficient, miniaturized, and error-tolerant quantum measurement platforms.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Based Quantum Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce measurement-based quantum diffusion models that bridge classical and quantum diffusion theory through randomized weak measurements. The measurement-based approach naturally generates stochastic quantum trajectories while preserving purity at the trajectory level and inducing depolarization at the ensemble level. We address two quantum state generation problems: trajectory-level recovery of pure state ensembles and ensemble-average recovery of mixed states. For trajectory-level recovery, we establish that quantum score matching is mathematically equivalent to learning unitary generators for the reverse process. For ensemble-average recovery, we introduce local Petz recovery maps for states with finite correlation length and classical shadow reconstruction for general states, both with rigorous error bounds. Our framework establishes Petz recovery maps as quantum generalizations of reverse Fokker-Planck equations, providing a rigorous bridge between quantum recovery channels and classical stochastic reversals. This work enables new approaches to quantum state generation with potential applications in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Defining classical and quantum chaos through adiabatic transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01927v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formalism which defines chaos in both quantum and classical systems in an equivalent manner by means of \textit{adiabatic transformations}. The complexity of adiabatic transformations which preserve classical time-averaged trajectories (quantum eigenstates) in response to Hamiltonian deformations serves as a measure of chaos. This complexity is quantified by the (properly regularized) fidelity susceptibility. Physically this measure quantifies long time instabilities of physical observables due to small changes in the Hamiltonian of the system. Our exposition clearly showcases the common structures underlying quantum and classical chaos and allows us to distinguish integrable, chaotic but non-thermalizing, and ergodic/mixing regimes. We apply the fidelity susceptibility to a model of two coupled spins and demonstrate that it successfully predicts the universal onset of chaos, both for finite spin $S$ and in the classical limit $S\to\infty$. Interestingly, we find that finite $S$ effects are anomalously large close to integrability.</description>

      <title>Entanglement area law and Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem in long-range interacting systems, and symmetry-enforced long-range entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish multiple interrelated, fundamental results in quantum many-body systems that can have long-range interactions. For a sufficiently long quantum spin chain, we first show that if the multi-spin interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as their ranges increase and the Hamiltonian is gapped, then the ground states satisfy the entanglement area law, even if there is a ground state degeneracy due to a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry. This area law also holds for certain excited states. Second, if such a long-range interacting Hamiltonian has an anomalous symmetry, then the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem applies, i.e., the Hamiltonian cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state. If the Hamiltonian contains only 2-spin interactions, these results hold when the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, with $r$ the distance between the two interacting spins. Third, we show that pure states with an anomalous symmetry, which may not be a ground state of any natural Hamiltonian, must be long-range entangled. The symmetries we consider include on-site internal symmetries combined with lattice translation symmetries, and they can also extend to purely internal but non-on-site symmetries. Moreover, these internal symmetries can be discrete or continuous. We explore the applications of these results through various examples.</description>

      <title>Slowly generated anomalously large nuclear field in bulk n-AlGaAs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigated the formation and relaxation dynamics of nuclear spin polarization in three Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As bulk samples with different aluminum concentrations $x$ of 0.00, 0.05, and 0.15. The time-resolved Kerr rotation technique was primarily used. The samples with $x$ = 0.15 and 0.05 exhibited anomalously large nuclear magnetic fields BN exceeding 1 T, approximately twice the applied magnetic field. Further investigations revealed that BN formation occurred in two-stages, a rapid initial rise followed by a gradual increase toward a saturation value. Relaxation measurements revealed that the relaxation time of BN was longer for AlGaAs than for GaAs. The comparison of the results obtained under strong and weak magnetic fields indicated the suppression of quadrupole-induced relaxation. We modified the dynamics model of nuclear spin polarization and explained the two-stage formation and the accompanying large BN in AlGaAs bulks.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping, Autonomous Testing, and Initialization System for Si/SiGe Multi-quantum Dot Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices have become central to advancements in spin-based quantum computing. However, the increasing complexity of modern QD devices makes calibration and control -- particularly at elevated temperatures -- a bottleneck to progress, highlighting the need for robust and scalable autonomous solutions. A major hurdle arises from trapped charges within the oxide layers, which induce random offset voltage shifts on gate electrodes, with a standard deviation of approximately 83~\si{\milli\volt} of variation within state-of-the-art present-day devices. Efficient characterization and tuning of large arrays of QD qubits depend on choices of automated protocols. Here, we introduce a physically intuitive framework for a bootstrapping, autonomous testing, and initialization system (BATIS) designed to streamline QD device evaluation and calibration. BATIS navigates high-dimensional gate voltage spaces, automating essential steps such as leakage testing, formation of all current channels, and gate characterization in the presence of trapped charges. For forming the current channels, BATIS follows a non-standard approach that requires a single set of measurements regardless of the number of channels. Demonstrated at $1.3$~\si{\kelvin} on a quad-QD Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ device, BATIS eliminates the need for deep cryogenic environments during initial device diagnostics, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing setup times. By requiring only minimal prior knowledge of the device architecture, BATIS represents a platform-agnostic solution, adaptable to various QD systems, which bridges a critical gap in QD autotuning.</description>

      <title>The Birth of Quantum Mechanics: A Historical Study Through the Canonical Papers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13630v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the historical development of the theory of quantum mechanics between 1900 and 1927 by chronological examination of the foundational papers and ideas. Beginning with Planck's introduction of energy quantisation in blackbody radiation, we follow the emergence of Einstein's light quanta hypothesis, Bohr's atomic model, and the statistical implications of indistinguishable particles. Special emphasis is placed on the transition from the Old Quantum Theory to modern quantum mechanics, particularly through Heisenberg's matrix mechanics and Schr\"{o}dinger's wave mechanics. This study aims to provide a structured historical account, offering insights into the conceptual transformations that led to quantum mechanics while making the development accessible to physicists, historians of science, and advanced students interested in the origins of modern quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Symmetries, Conservation Laws and Entanglement in Non-Hermitian Fermionic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems feature steady-state entanglement transitions driven by the competition between unitary dynamics and dissipation. In this work, we reveal the fundamental role of conservation laws in shaping this competition. Focusing on translation-invariant non-interacting fermionic models with U(1) symmetry, we present a theoretical framework to understand the structure of the steady-state of these models and their entanglement content based on two ingredients: the nature of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and the constraints imposed on the steady-state single-particle occupation by the conserved quantities. These emerge from an interplay between Hamiltonian symmetries and initial state, due to the non-linearity of measurement back-action. For models with complex energy spectrum, we show that the steady state is obtained by filling single-particle right eigenstates with the largest imaginary part of the eigenvalue. As a result, one can have partially filled or fully filled bands in the steady-state, leading to an entanglement entropy undergoing a filling-driven transition between critical sub volume scaling and area-law, similar to ground-state problems. Conversely, when the spectrum is fully real, we provide evidence that local observables can be captured using a diagonal ensemble, and the entanglement entropy exhibits a volume-law scaling independently on the initial state, akin to unitary dynamics. We illustrate these principles in the Hatano-Nelson model with periodic boundary conditions and the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, uncovering a rich interplay between the single-particle spectrum and conservation laws in determining the steady-state structure and the entanglement transitions. These conclusions are supported by exact analytical calculations and numerical calculations relying on the Faber polynomial method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of trajectories in harmonic oscillator systems equipped with a point, absolutely continuous, or singular measure. As demonstrated in [30], infinite-dimensional linear flows of countable oscillator systems exhibit a new class of trajectory behavior. Specifically, these trajectories are non-periodic, and their projections onto any four-dimensional symplectic subspace fail to be dense in the corresponding projection of the invariant torus. Such trajectories do not arise in finite-dimensional systems, are non-generic for countable oscillator systems, but become generic in the continual case. We prove that for a countable harmonic oscillator system, every point on a non-degenerate invariant torus is a non-wandering point of the flow. In contrast, for a continual system with an absolutely continuous measure, all points on such a torus are wandering. Furthermore, for continual systems with a singular measure, we establish sufficient conditions on the measure and torus that rule out the existence of both transitive trajectories and non-wandering points. As an application, we exhibit a class of singular Bernoulli measures satisfying these conditions.</description>

Abstract: Relativistic, quantum electrodynamics, as well as non-adiabatic corrections and couplings, are computed for the b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$ and c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ electronic states of the helium dimer. The underlying Born-Oppenheimer potential energy curves are converged to 1 ppm ($1:10^6$) relative precision using a variational explicitly correlated Gaussian approach. The quantum nuclear motion is computed over the b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ (and B $^1\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-C $^1\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$) 9-(12-)dimensional electronic-spin subspace coupled by non-adiabatic and relativistic (magnetic) interactions. The electron's anomalous magnetic moment is also included; its effect is expected to be visible in high-resolution experiments. The computed rovibronic energy intervals are in excellent agreement with available high-resolution spectroscopy data, including the rovibronic b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-state fine structure. Fine-structure splittings are also predicted for the c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ levels, which have not been fully resolved experimentally, yet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how low-frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs), originating from distant astrophysical or cosmological sources, can induce purely quantum geometric phases in mesoscopic optomechanical systems. These phases represent subtle imprints with no classical counterpart, going beyond standard dynamical or Berry-type contributions that admit Hannay-angle analogues. Such ultra-weak waves couple to the motion of a mechanical mirror and generate distinctive phase shifts in the system's quantum state that cannot arise in any classical description. To access this effect, we propose a Ramsey-type interferometric protocol in which the photon-number states of a quantized optical mode become entangled with the mirror's center-of-mass motion, enabling a direct readout of the LFGW-induced geometric phase. This framework establishes a distinctly quantum approach for probing low-frequency gravitational wave modes, offering an alternative to conventional detection strategies based on spacetime strain.</description>

      <title>Exact Sum Rules and Zeta Generating Formulas from the ODE/IM correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate exact sum rules (ESRs) and zeta generating formulas (ZGFs) for quantum mechanics defined by the ${\cal PT}$-symmetric potential $V_{\cal PT}(x) = x^{2K} (ix)^\varepsilon$ with $K,\varepsilon \in \mathbb{N}$, as well as the Hermitian potential $V_{\cal H}(x) = x^{2 K}$ with $K \in {\mathbb N} + 1$, based on the fusion relations of the $A_{2M-1}$ T-system in the framework of the ODE/IM correspondence. In this setup, the fusion relations on the integrable model (IM) side correspond to recurrence relations among quantization conditions on the ordinary differential equation (ODE) side, which we reformulate in terms of spectral zeta functions (SZFs), $\zeta_n(s) = \sum_{\alpha \in {\mathbb N}_0} E_{n,\alpha}^{-s}$, where $n$ denotes the fusion label. The ESRs yield algebraic relations among SZFs at fixed $n$, while the ZGFs establish explicit functional mappings between SZFs at different fusion labels. These structures are governed by a selection rule depending on both $M$ and $n$, induced in general by the combination of the structure of the Chebyshev polynomials appearing in the fusion relations and the $\mathbb{Z}_{2M+2}$ Symanzik rotational symmetry. Our results provide a novel spectral interpretation of the T-system in integrable models and point toward hidden algebraic structures governing global spectral data in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and Hermitian quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive physical and optical investigation of InGaN nanowires (NWs) designed to address the challenges posed by the green gap region. We conduct a detailed analysis of the morphology, structure, and optical characteristics of the NWs using characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, and confocal scanning microscopy. Notably, increasing the indium concentration causes a redshift in emission and alters the luminescence properties across different segments of NWs. Our findings provide valuable insight into the correlation between indium compositional nonuniformity and the optical emission properties of NWs. These insights contribute to optimizing the growth condition, color accuracy, and enhancing optical efficiency of NWs, highlighting their potential for next generation high-performance LEDs and optoelectronics devices.</description>
