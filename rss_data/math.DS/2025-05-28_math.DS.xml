      <title>Rigorous computation of expansion in one-dimensional dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an effective algorithmic method and its software implementation for rigorous numerical computation of a lower bound for uniform expansion in one-dimensional dynamics. The approach is based on interval arithmetic and efficient graph algorithms. We discuss and illustrate the effectiveness of our method and apply it to the quadratic map family.</description>

      <title>Stability and Bifurcation in a Discrete Phytoplankton-Zooplankton Model with Holling-Type Toxic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a discrete-time phytoplankton-zooplankton model that incorporates a linear predator functional response alongside a Holling-type toxin distribution. Both Holling type II and type III cases are considered, and we derive conditions on the model parameters that guarantee the existence of positive fixed points. We classify all fixed points and analyze their global stability. Furthermore, we establish the occurrence of a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation at the positive fixed point. Theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations, which illustrate the dynamic behavior of the system</description>

      <title>Synchronization Phenomenon in Three-Time-Scale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates synchronization phenomena in networks of coupled oscillators governed by three-time-scale dynamical systems exhibiting canard dynamics. A mathematical framework has been developed to analyze the synchronization of fast variables across heterogeneous systems, deriving a sufficient condition for the synchronization error to fall below a specified threshold within the minimum linger time. This condition accounts for coupling strength, heterogeneity, and time-scale separation, ensuring stable oscillatory behavior in the network. The result, supported by rigorous mathematical analysis, advances the understanding of synchronization in complex multi-time-scale systems.</description>

      <title>Markov processes associated to fractal branch groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The author introduced recently a new natural construction which associates a measure-preserving dynamical system to any fractal profinite group. Here, we investigate these measure-preserving dynamical systems under the extra assumption on the groups to be branch. First, we compute their $f$-invariant, a measure-conjugacy invariant introduced by Bowen, and show that they are Markov processes over free semigroups in the sense of Bowen. Secondly, we show that fractal branch profinite groups with the same Hausdorff dimension and whose associated measure-preserving dynamical systems have the same $f$-invariant yield isomorphic Markov processes.</description>

      <title>All fractional Shapiro steps in the RSJ model with two Josephson harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization between the internal dynamics of the superconducting phase in a Josephson junction (JJ) and an external ac signal is a fundamental physical phenomenon, manifesting as constant-voltage Shapiro steps in the current-voltage characteristic. Mathematically, this phase-locking effect is captured by the Resistively Shunted Junction (RSJ) model, an important example of a nonlinear dynamical system. The standard RSJ model considers an overdamped JJ with a sinusoidal (single-harmonic) current-phase relation (CPR) in the current-driven regime with a monochromatic ac component. While this model predicts only integer Shapiro steps, the inclusion of higher Josephson harmonics is known to generate fractional Shapiro steps. In this paper, we show that only two Josephson harmonics in the CPR are sufficient to produce all possible fractional Shapiro steps within the RSJ framework. Using perturbative methods, we analyze amplitudes of these fractional steps. Furthermore, by introducing a phase shift between the two Josephson harmonics, we reveal an asymmetry between positive and negative fractional steps - a signature of the Josephson diode effect.</description>

      <title>Semi-Explicit Neural DAEs: Learning Long-Horizon Dynamical Systems with Algebraic Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the promise of scientific machine learning (SciML) in combining data-driven techniques with mechanistic modeling, existing approaches for incorporating hard constraints in neural differential equations (NDEs) face significant limitations. Scalability issues and poor numerical properties prevent these neural models from being used for modeling physical systems with complicated conservation laws. We propose Manifold-Projected Neural ODEs (PNODEs), a method that explicitly enforces algebraic constraints by projecting each ODE step onto the constraint manifold. This framework arises naturally from semi-explicit differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), and includes both a robust iterative variant and a fast approximation requiring a single Jacobian factorization. We further demonstrate that prior works on relaxation methods are special cases of our approach. PNODEs consistently outperform baselines across six benchmark problems achieving a mean constraint violation error below $10^{-10}$. Additionally, PNODEs consistently achieve lower runtime compared to other methods for a given level of error tolerance. These results show that constraint projection offers a simple strategy for learning physically consistent long-horizon dynamics.</description>

      <title>Circles and line segments as independence attractors of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By an independent set in a simple graph $G$, we mean a set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices in $G$. The independence polynomial of $G$ is defined as $I_G(z)=a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2+\cdots+a_\alpha z^{\alpha}$, where $a_i$ is the number of independent sets in $G$ with cardinality $i$ and $\alpha$ is the cardinality of a largest independent set in $G$, known as the independence number of $G$. Let $G^m$ denote the $m$-times lexicographic product of $G$ with itself. The independence attractor of $G$, denoted by $\mathcal{A}(G)$, is defined as $\mathcal{A}(G) = \lim_{m\rightarrow \infty} \{z: I_{G^m}(z)=0\}$, where the limit is taken with respect to the Hausdorff metric on the space of all compact subsets of the plane. This paper deals with independence attractors that are topologically simple. It is shown that $\mathcal{A}(G)$ can never be a circle. If $\mathcal{A}(G)$ is a line segment then it is proved that the line segment is $[-\frac{4}{k}, 0]$ for some $k \in \{1, 2, 3, 4 \}$. Examples of graphs with independence number four are provided whose independence attractors are line segments.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study a class of non-effectively hyperbolic operators vanishing of order 2 on a manifold, on a sub-region of which the spectral structure of the Hamilton map changes type. Suitable normal symplectic coordinates are found together with an analysis of the Hamilton system associated to the principal symbol and a factorization result, preparing the operator for a microlocal energy estimate, is finally proven.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Anosov flows on hyperbolic L-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ there is a hyperbolic L-space with $n$ pseudo-Anosov flows, no two of which are orbit equivalent. These flows have no perfect fits and are thus quasigeodesic. In addition, our flows admit positive Birkhoff sections, which we argue implies that they give rise to $n$ universally tight contact structures whose lifts to any finite cover are non-contactomorphic. This argument involves cylindrical contact homology together with the work of Barthelm\'e, Frankel, and Mann on the reconstruction of pseudo-Anosov flows from their closed orbits. These results answer more general versions of questions posed by Calegari and Min--Nonino.</description>

      <title>Spike-Adding Mechanisms in a Three-Timescale System: Insights from the FitzHugh-Nagumo Model with Periodic Forcing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the spike-adding mechanism in a class of three-dimensional fast-slow systems with three distinct timescales, inspired by the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model driven by periodic input. First, we numerically generate a spike-adding diagram for the FHN model by varying the frequency and amplitude of the input, revealing that as the frequency decreases and the amplitude increases, the number of spikes within each burst grows. We demonstrate that a similar spike-adding structure occurs in the more realistic, periodically forced Morris-Lecar neuronal model. Next, we apply methods from geometric singular perturbation theory to compute critical and super-critical manifolds of the fast-slow system. We use them to characterize the emergence of new burst-spikes in the FHN model, when the periodic forcing resembles a low frequency-band brain rhythm. We then describe how the uncovered spike-adding mechanism defines the boundaries that separate regions with different spike counts in the parameter space.</description>

Abstract: We give a proof of an extension of the Hartman-Grobman theorem to nonhyperbolic but asymptotically stable equilibria of vector fields. Moreover, the linearizing topological conjugacy is (i) defined on the entire basin of attraction if the vector field is complete, and (ii) a $C^{k\geq 1}$-diffeomorphism on the complement of the equilibrium if the vector field is $C^k$ and the underlying space is not $5$-dimensional. We also show that the $C^k$ statement in the $5$-dimensional case is equivalent to the $4$-dimensional smooth Poincar\'{e} conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Linear relations, defined as submodules of the direct sum of two modules, can be viewed as objects that carry dynamical information and reflect the inherent uncertainty of sampled dynamics. These objects also provide an algebraic structure that enables the definition of subtle invariants for dynamical systems. In this paper, we prove that linear relations defined on modules of finite length are shift equivalent to bijective mappings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a compact negatively curved space, we develop a notion of thermodynamic formalism and apply it to study the space of quasi-morphisms of its fundamental group modulo boundedness. We prove that this space is Banach isomorphic to the space of Bowen functions corresponding to the associated Gromov geodesic flow, modulo a weak notion of Livsic cohomology.
  The results include that each such unbounded quasi-morphism is associated with a unique invariant measure for the flow, and this measure uniquely characterizes the cohomology class. As a consequence, we establish the Central Limit Theorem for any unbounded quasi-morphism with respect to Markov measures, the invariance principle, and the Bernoulli property of the associated equilibrium state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.09771v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the existence and uniqueness of random periodic solutions for stochastic differential equations (SDEs), where the drift terms involved need not to be uniformly dissipative. On the one hand, via the reflection coupling approach, we investigate the existence of random periodic solutions in the sense of distribution for SDEs without memory, where the drifts are merely dissipative at long distance. On the other hand, via the synchronous coupling strategy, we establish respectively the existence of pathwise random periodic solutions for functional SDEs with a finite time lag and an infinite time lag, in which the drifts are only dissipative on average rather than uniformly dissipative with respect to the time parameters.</description>

Abstract: Analyzing the long-term behavior of high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems remains a significant challenge. While the Koopman operator framework provides a powerful global linearization tool, current methods for approximating its spectral components often face theoretical limitations and depend on predefined dictionaries. Residual Dynamic Mode Decomposition (ResDMD) advanced the field by introducing the \emph{spectral residual} to assess Koopman operator approximation accuracy; however, its approach of only filtering precomputed spectra prevents the discovery of the operator's complete spectral information, a limitation known as the `spectral inclusion' problem. We introduce ResKoopNet (Residual-based Koopman-learning Network), a novel method that directly addresses this by explicitly minimizing the \emph{spectral residual} to compute Koopman eigenpairs. This enables the identification of a more precise and complete Koopman operator spectrum. Using neural networks, our approach provides theoretical guarantees while maintaining computational adaptability. Experiments on a variety of physical and biological systems show that ResKoopNet achieves more accurate spectral approximations than existing methods, particularly for high-dimensional systems and those with continuous spectra, which demonstrates its effectiveness as a tool for analyzing complex dynamical systems.</description>
