      <title>New entropy, thermodynamics of apparent horizon and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we consider new nonadditive entropy of the apparent horizon $S_K=S_{BH}/(1+\gamma S_{BH})$ with $S_{BH}$ being the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy. This is an alternative of the R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies, that allow us by utilizing the holographic principle to develop of a new model of holographic dark energy. When $\gamma\rightarrow 0$ our entropy becomes the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy $S_{BH}$. The generalized Friedmann's equations for Friedmann--Lema\^{i}tre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) space-time for the barotropic matter fluid with $p=w\rho$ were obtained. We compute the dark energy pressure $p_D$, density energy $\rho_D$ and the deceleration parameter corresponding to our model. From the second modified Friedmann's equation a dynamical cosmological constant was obtained. We show that at some model parameters $w$ and $\beta$ there are two phases, universe acceleration and deceleration or the phase of the eternal inflation. Thus, our model, by virtue of the holographic principle, can describe the universe inflation and late time of the universe acceleration. The holographic dark energy model with the generalized entropy of the apparent horizon can be of interest for new cosmology.</description>

      <title>Coupling Light Waves to Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that gravitational waves, upon interacting with co-propagating electromagnetic radiation, induce distinctive sidebands on the modulated light, thereby providing a detectable signature of their presence. Employing a covariant coupled-wave framework, we envision gravitational waves as phase-insensitive ``luminal moving gratings'' and derive phase-matching conditions that articulate such an interaction whilst conserving both energy and momentum. Besides preserving the directional signature of gravitational waves, the coupling imposes no coherence requirements, hence enabling possibilities for exploiting cosmic microwave background radiation. Although detection at low frequencies is constrained by the requirement of long interaction lengths, advances in laser technology are poised to enable high-frequency gravitational wave detection, potentially unveiling insights into the primordial spacetime ripples traversing the cosmos since the inflationary epoch.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian formalism in the theory of relativistic vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lagrangian formalism is used to derive covariant equations that are suitable for use in continuously distributed matter in curved spacetime. Special attention is given to theoretical representation, in which the Lagrangian and its derivatives are directly involved. The obtained results, including equation for metric, equation of motion, equations for fields, are applied to purely vector fields. As a consequence, formulas are determined for calculating the basic quantities necessary to describe physical systems. In this case, not only the pressure field and the acceleration field are taken into account, but also the electromagnetic and gravitational fields outside the matter, which contribute to the four-momentum and to the four-dimensional angular momentum pseudotensor of each system. It is shown that the canonical representation of the angular momentum pseudotensor is its representation with covariant indices. The radius-vector of the center of momentum of a physical system is determined in covariant form.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Behavior of Resonant Frequencies in Cylindrical Samples for Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) is a non-destructive technique for assessing the elastic and anelastic properties of materials by analyzing the frequencies of free vibrations in samples with known geometry. This paper explores the asymptotic behavior of eigenfrequencies in samples with cylindrical geometry. Extending prior research on cuboid samples, our study represents another step toward characterizing asymptotic behavior in arbitrarily shaped samples. While our findings are specific to cylindrical geometries, they are particularly relevant since many RUS samples adopt this shape. Furthermore, we present results on computing derivatives of Zernike polynomials, which may enhance the efficiency of resonant frequency calculations in the RUS method.</description>
