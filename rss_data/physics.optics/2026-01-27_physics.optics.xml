      <title>Non-uniform modal power distribution caused by disorder in multimode fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of modal crosstalk in multimode fibers is investigated using four different experimental and numerical approaches. Results converge to demonstrate that the fiber disorder alone is capable of generating steady states characterized by non-uniform modal power distributions, which promote the lower-order modes at the expenses of the higher-order ones and are properly described by a weighted Bose-Einstein law.</description>

      <title>Remote dispersion scan: transformer-network retrieval of ultrafast pulses after non-linear propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and rapid characterization of broadband electric fields is essential for all ultrafast applications and remains an active field of research. In this work, we introduce remote dispersion scan, a transformer neural network enabled dispersion scan based pulse characterization method that can characterize femtosecond laser pulses. A local scan of the non-linear spectral phase before several linear and nonlinear processes, including amplification, compression, and self phase modulation, allows for the field retrieval remotely at the interaction region. We show that the reconstruction accuracy obtained from a single measurement of the fundamental and second harmonic is comparable to that of a full two dimensional scan. We confirm the technique experimentally by compressing a 300 W, 1.3 ps, 1030 nm pulse in a hollow core fiber to 100 fs and measuring the fundamental and second harmonic spectra while scanning the second order phase in a pulse shaper before power amplification. These results establish a simple, robust, alignment insensitive live-view pulse reconstruction modality.</description>

      <title>Exceptional-point-like Sensing near Hermitian Critical Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-Hermitian system at an exceptional point (EP), a specific critical point (CP) associated with the parity-time symmetric phase transition, exhibits a sublinear response to perturbation and promise unprecedented sensitivity beyond the linear-response Hermitian sensors, so far operating at the diabolic points (DP). Despite great advancements, its sensitivity enhancement is fundamentally limited by the divergent Petermann factor, intrinsically rooted in the non-Hermitian eigenvector degeneracy, and practically by the system complexity. Here, we report the CP-resulting square-root response to the refractive index change and enhanced sensitivity in a simple chiral Hermitian cavity without phase transitions. Because of the inherent eigenvector orthogonality, this CP-based Hermitian sensor exhibits an EP-like response and enhanced sensitivity, breaking the Petermann-factor limit of sensitivity in non-Hermitian counterparts. This work paves the way towards exploring the Hermitian CPs for ultrasensitive sensing outperforming both the EP- and DP-based sensors.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Volumetric Optical Chirality through 2D-3D Structural Design Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular dichroism (CD) sensing plays a pivotal role in probing molecular chirality in biomedical sciences. However, engineering superchiral electromagnetic fields that can reliably amplify the faint signatures of chiral analytes remains profoundly challenging. Central to this difficulty is the need to balance two competing demands: maximizing the enhancement of chiral fields while maintaining a sufficiently large interaction volume for effective molecular interrogation. Here, we introduce a figure of merit (FOM) that captures the enhancement and spatial coverage of superchiral fields to benchmark different chiral-field configurations. We examine the effects of helix-geometry evolution on the FOM, including 2D to 3D chirality induction, winding-number escalation, helical-order enhancement, and transverse dilation. By tuning these structural degrees of freedom, the sensing volume can be enlarged without compromising the distribution and enhancement strength of fields. The optimized triple-strand helix markedly enhanced the analyte CD signal, yielding a FOM of 2.43*10^10 nm3, which surpassed prior 2D and 3D configurations by over an order of magnitude. The proposed FOM exhibits a strong linear correlation (R^2 = 0.9256) with the analyte CD signal. Our findings provide a systematic design framework for 3D chiral structures and a robust metric for assessing their chiroptical sensing performance, particularly in scenarios involving clusters of randomly oriented small molecules or a large chiral molecule.</description>

      <title>Classical Petermann Factor as a Measure of Quantum Squeezing in Photonic Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic time crystals realize a continuum of momentum-resolved SU(1,1) parametric amplifiers. We show that a classical quantity, the Petermann factor of the effective Floquet Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) dynamical matrix, sets the scale of their quantum noise. In stable bands it fixes the Bogoliubov mixing and the vacuum quasiparticle population, while in momentum gaps it sets the photon-number prefactor and enhances the squeezing dynamics, with the Floquet growth rate setting the time scale. This converts classical measurements of mode nonorthogonality into quantitative predictions for squeezing and photon generation, and offers a compact design parameter for engineering quantum resources in two-mode BdG platforms.</description>

      <title>Suspended thin-film lithium niobate modulator for broadband mid-infrared light modulation and frequency comb generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mid-infrared (MIR) spectral regime is central to applications including remote sensing, precision spectroscopy, higher harmonic generation, and free-space optical communication. However, coherent and broadband MIR modulation remains challenging owing to high optical loss, limited bandwidth, and large drive voltages in existing platforms. Here, we overcome these challenges by deploying a suspended thin-film lithium-niobate (TFLN) based electro-optic (EO) platform co-designed with high-performance traveling-wave microwave (MW) electrodes. We demonstrate a record-low Vpi,DC of 2.3 to 4.3 V over a broadband MIR bandwidth from 2.4 to 3.6 um, and a 2.7 dB EO bandwidth of 40 GHz (extracted 3 dB bandwidth of 50 GHz), yielding a figure of merit of 17.4 GHz/V, more than an order of magnitude higher than the state of the art. We demonstrate, for the first time, high-frequency Vpi,MW of 4.5 to 6.5 V in the 25 to 35 GHz range, and frequency-agile MIR EO frequency comb generation with a 10 dB optical bandwidth over 0.8 THz using a suspended phase modulator of 4 cm active modulation length. We further validate the platform in a free-space optical communication link. Our results establish a monolithic MIR photonic platform capable of powerful EO modulation and spectral synthesis, and represent a significant step toward reconfigurable MIR sensing and communication systems on chip.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal Dichalcogenides Multijunction Solar Cells Toward the Multicolor Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and other van der Waals semiconductors enable transfer-printed, lattice-mismatch--free stacking of many photovoltaic junctions (N), motivating a re-examination of multijunction detailed-balance limits under realistic material and optical constraints. Here we develop an unlimited-junction detailed-balance framework for split-spectrum, multi-terminal vdW multijunction solar cells and apply it to a conservative TMD bandgap window (1.0-2.1 eV). Dynamic-programming optimization shows that the accessible bandgap window imposes a large-N efficiency limit: under full concentration, unconstrained ladders approach 84.5% at N=50, whereas the TMD window plateaus near 63.4%. This plateau is set by photons outside the gaps, so radiative quality and optics dominate beyond five junctions for realistic transfer-printed stacks. We identify an experimentally achievable N=5 ladder Eg~(2.10,1.78,1.50,1.24,1.00) eV and map each rung to candidate vdW/TMD absorbers. Using reciprocity and luminescence thermodynamics, we quantify penalties from finite external radiative efficiency, two-sided emission, and luminescent coupling, and we introduce the upward-emitted luminescence power as a computable entropy-loss proxy. Incorporating excitonic absorptance and nanophotonic thickness bounds yields practical thickness and light-management targets for transfer-printed stacks. Finally, inserting an idealized nonreciprocal multijunction model into the reciprocity-optimized ladders provides conservative headroom estimates, consistent with negligible benefit for single junctions but measurable gains for multijunction TMD stacks.</description>

      <title>Emission of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond shaped by topological photonic waveguide modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the ability to integrate single photon emitters into photonic architectures improves, so does the need to characterize and understand their interaction. Here, we use a scanning diamond nanocrystal to investigate the interplay between the emission of room-temperature nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers and a proximal topological waveguide. In our experiments, NVs serve as local, spectrally broad light sources which we exploit to characterize the waveguide bandwidth as well as the correspondence between light injection site and directionality of wave propagation. Further, we find that near-field coupling to the waveguide influences the spectral shape and ellipticity of the NV photoluminescence, hence allowing us to reveal nanostructured light fields with a spatial resolution defined by the nanoparticle size. Our results expand on the sensing modalities afforded by color centers, and portend novel opportunities in the development of on-chip, quantum optics devices leveraging topological photonics to best manipulate and readout single-photon emitters.</description>

      <title>Dual Flat-Bands of Bound State in the Continuum and Radiative Mode via TE-TM Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general symmetry-controlled mechanism is proposed for realizing dual flat-bands of bound state in the continuum (BIC) and its radiative counterpart in photonic crystal slabs. By breaking the vertical mirror symmetry of slab, inter-polarization coupling between TE-like and TM-like modes is activated, while intra-polarization coupling among modes within the same polarization class is simultaneously preserved. The cooperative action of these two coupling channels gives rise to the concurrent flattening of both the BIC-hosting band and the radiative band, resulting in a dual flat-band system with strongly contrasting quality (Q) factors. An effective two-step coupling model is constructed to capture the essential physics and show that the emergence of the flat bands is governed by geometric tuning rather than accidental degeneracies. The mechanism is shown to be generic with respect to polarization and material platform, enabling dual flat-band states in both low- and high-index systems, with substantially enhanced angular bandwidths in the latter. These finding establish a unified route for flat-band photonic engineering and provide a robust platform for angle-tolerant resonant photonic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Residual neural-field ptychography for dose-efficient electron, X-ray, and optical nanoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ptychography spans from sub-angstrom to meter scales yet suffers from convergence instability and excessive data redundancy. Here we introduce self-correcting residual neural fields as a dose-efficient framework for electron, X-ray, and optical ptychography. Unlike approaches that split complex fields, our complex-valued architecture employs holomorphic phasor activation e^i{\omega}z to preserve intrinsic phase-amplitude coupling. We reformulate reconstruction as residual learning, where the network learns only corrections to physical priors rather than complete wavefields. By embedding the physical model as a differentiable layer within the network, we enable end-to-end automatic differentiation where experimental parameters are jointly corrected alongside the neural fields. We validate our scheme across conventional, near-field, coded, and Fourier ptychography and achieve record-breaking lensless resolution of 244-nm linewidth with visible light. Extending to electron wavelengths, we reveal synaptic connectivity in brain sections with superior performance over conventional approaches. Our framework provides a solution for high-throughput, dose-efficient nanoscopy across the electromagnetic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-assisted balanced-injection synchronization for turbulence-resilient long-haul chaotic free-space link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical chaotic synchronization between coupled nonlinear lasers underpins most chaos-based applications, including complex laser network dynamics, secure communication, key distribution, and reinforcement learning. In free-space links, however, chaotic synchronization is highly vulnerable to stochastic fluctuation induced by atmospheric turbulence, which results in temporal injection imbalances at symmetric receivers and triggers intermittent desynchronization. Here, we introduce a full Poincar\'e vector beam-enabled balanced-injection synchronization (BIS) mechanism, which passively mitigates coupling fluctuations and preserves injection symmetry through a complementary metasurface pair, without requiring any channel estimation or active control. Over a 3.2 km urban link under moderately strong turbulence, BIS suppresses coupling power fluctuations by a factor of 4.6 (from 0.4511 to 0.0975). It eliminates desynchronization events and increases the high-quality synchronization probability from 58.6% to 91.0%. This enables a record-high bit rate-distance product of 720 Gbps \cdot km, reducing communication interruption probability by up to 77% compared to Gaussian beam transmission. Our innovative strategy bridges the gap between nanophotonics and engineering optics, offering a new insight into advancing next-generation LiDAR, secure communication, and integrated sensing and communication systems in turbulent environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent perfect absorption (CPA)-the time-reversed operation of lasing at threshold-relies on finely tuned interference and is intrinsically fragile to disorder and structural imperfections. Whether absorption can be endowed with topological protection, by analogy to topological lasing, has remained an open question. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a topological antilaser: the time-reversed counterpart of a topological laser, in which chiral edge modes of a photonic lattice enable perfect light absorption protected by topology. Using a nonreciprocal microwave network with low intrinsic loss, we show that the topological antilaser preserves near-unity absorption under strong disorder, and, unlike conventional antilasers, remains functional for arbitrary placements of dissipation and input ports, even when the lattice is strongly perturbed. This robustness arises from the disorder-immune propagation and stable spatial profile of the topological edge modes. Our results establish topologically protected absorption as the missing counterpart of topological lasing, opening new directions for studying robust energy dissipation, wave control, and coherent-absorption-based detection technologies.</description>

      <title>Partitionable Diffractive Neural Networks for Multifunctional Optical Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffractive neural network (DNN), which can perform machine learning tasks based on the light propagation and diffraction, has recently emerged as a promising optical computing paradigm due to its high parallel processing speed and low power consumption nature. However, existing diffractive network architectures face challenges in implementing functional reconfiguration. Once a diffractive neural network is fabricated, its functionality is fixed. Deploying such systems for different tasks typically requires reconstructing the entire physical setup, which significantly compromises hardware efficiency in practical applications. In this work, we propose the multifunctional partitionable diffractive neural networks (PDNNs) that can generate networks with additional capabilities by stacking multiple sub-modules with independent functions in the horizontal direction. Each submodule functions as an independent diffractive network capable of performing specific imaging or classification tasks. When these submodules are combined, they can form a new network with additional functionalities. Moreover, assembling these submodules in different configurations enables structures with diverse functions. This powerful PDNN framework demonstrates remarkable advantages in flexibility and reconfigurability for multitask operations, opening a new pathway for realizing multifunctional and integrated optical artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>Extended Self-similarity in Multimode Optical Fiber Speckles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended Self-Similarity (ESS) is a widely used tool for uncovering universal power-law scaling in systems dominated by nonlinear interactions. This work demonstrates that ESS scaling can also emerge in a system governed by purely linear physics: the propagation of coherent light in a multimode fiber. The system produces complex speckle patterns arising solely from deterministic linear mode interference. We analyze the intensity structure functions of these speckles and observe a robust extended scaling range. The measured scaling exponents align with the classical Kolmogorov scaling exponents. This finding establishes that the statistical signatures captured by ESS are not exclusive to nonlinear systems, revealing a broader applicability of this scaling framework to complex linear systems.</description>

Abstract: High-resolution lithographic techniques are often limited by low volumetric throughput, since there is no universal and scalable manufacturing process that can produce 3D metasurfaces. In this work, we demonstrate a high-speed holographic 3D printing platform based on spatiotemporal beam shaping, exceeding the repetition rate while keeping the resolution high. The system integrates a femtosecond laser source with a spectral pulse compressor and a beam shaper to project uniform, axially confined light fields to project patterns directly on the advanced photoresists using a Digital Micromirror Device DMD. We investigate the process window for rapid polymerization, optimizing the photoinitiator choice to eliminate thermal crosstalk at high repetition rates. Using this setup, we achieve a production throughput of more than a million voxels per second with sub-micron resolution below 400 nm. The system's reliability is validated through the fabrication of large-area woodpile-like lattices and uniform micropillar arrays, establishing a workflow for scalable manufacturing of micro-optical components.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of Optimized Ternary Mirror Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the first experimental realization of multi-material dielectric mirror coatings designed through a multi-objective optimization algorithm to simultaneously minimize thermal noise and optical losses. We validate this design strategy by fabricating and characterizing two distinct ternary systems: a SiNx -based proof-of-concept and a Ti:GeO2 -based system targeting lower optical losses. The performance of the SiN x coating shows remarkable agreement with predictions, demonstrating a noise amplitude spectral density reduction of 0.82 with respect to current reference coatings, and validating our design-to-fabrication pipeline. The Ti:GeO2 -based system achieves the crucial goal of sub-ppm absorption; its measured thermal noise, however, is higher than the theoretically predicted level of 0.71, extrapolated from single-layer material characterization. A dedicated tolerance analysis confirms that this discrepancy is not attributable to random thickness errors, emphasizing that further studies of the manufacturing process are needed to fully exploit this combination of materials. This work establishes a robust methodology for producing complex, high-performance optical coatings tailored for precision experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide several diagrams for the graphical determination of certain elements of a Gaussian beam based on prior knowledge of other elements. For example, these diagrams allow us to determine the plane of the beam waist and the Rayleigh range from knowledge of two wavefronts constituting the beam, or to determine the size of the light spot on a given wavefront. We also present a simple method for determining the waist position and the Rayleigh range of the image of a Gaussian beam formed by a lens.</description>

      <title>Video-rate mid-infrared imaging in the molecular fingerprint region via nanosecond non-degenerate two-photon absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-degenerate two-photon absorption (NTA) offers an attractive route for wide-field mid-infrared (MIR) imaging by mapping long wavelength information into the spectral detection windows of mature near-infrared detector technologies. However, existing NTA implementations rely almost exclusively on complex, large-footprint femtosecond laser systems, severely limiting practicality and scalability. Here, we demonstrate an NTA imaging platform that replaces the ultrafast laser with a compact nanosecond mid-IR source coupled to a high-definition indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) camera. Operating in the nanosecond regime removes stringent temporal-overlap requirements, dramatically simplifying system architecture while preserving high nonlinear sensitivity. Using this approach, we achieve chemically selective, wide-field imaging deep into the mid-IR molecular fingerprint region and demonstrate, for the first time, video-rate NTA imaging in this spectrally rich regime. By combining relaxed alignment constraints, compact excitation, and high-speed fingerprint-region imaging, this work establishes nanosecond NTA as a practical and scalable foundation for next-generation mid-IR chemical imaging.</description>

      <title>Laser interferometry as a robust neuromorphic platform for machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for implementing an optical neural network using only linear optical resources, namely field displacement and interferometry applied to coherent states of light. The nonlinearity required for learning in a neural network is realized via an encoding of the input into phase shifts allowing for far more straightforward experimental implementation compared to previous proposals for, and demonstrations of, $\textit{in situ}$ inference. Beyond $\textit{in situ}$ inference, the method enables $\textit{in situ}$ training by utilizing established techniques like parameter shift rules or physical backpropagation to extract gradients directly from measurements of the linear optical circuit. We also investigate the effect of photon losses and find the model to be very resilient to these.</description>

      <title>Physics-Integrated Inference for Signal Recovery in Non-Gaussian Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-performance room-temperature sensing is often limited by non-stationary $1/f$ fluctuations and non-Gaussian stochasticity. In spintronic devices, thermally activated N\'eel switching creates heavy-tailed noise that masks weak signals, defeating linear filters optimized for Gaussian statistics. Here, we introduce a physics-integrated inference framework that decouples signal morphology from stochastic transients using a hierarchical 1D CNN-GRU topology. By learning the temporal signatures of N\'eel relaxation, this architecture reduces the Noise Equivalent Differential Temperature (NEDT) of spintronic Poisson bolometers by a factor of six (233.78 mK to 40.44 mK), effectively elevating room-temperature sensitivity toward cryogenic limits. We demonstrate the framework's universality across the electromagnetic and biological spectrum, achieving a 9-fold error suppression in Radar tracking, a 40\% uncertainty reduction in LiDAR, and a 15.56 dB SNR enhancement in ECG. This hardware-inference coupling recovers deterministic signals from fluctuation-dominated regimes, enabling near-ideal detection limits in noisy edge environments.</description>

      <title>Pulse-driven photonic transitions and nonreciprocity in space-time modulated metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-varying photonic systems open new possibilities for controlling light, enabling photonic time crystals, time reflection and refraction, frequency conversion, synthetic gauge fields, optical nonreciprocity, among others. These effects emerge from the dynamic modulation of optical properties, which can mediate photonic transitions between eigenstates of different frequencies and/or wavevectors. To achieve such transitions, conventional approaches rely on periodic modulation schemes that demand ultrafast modulation rates and continuous energy input, posing significant practical challenges at optical frequencies. Here, we demonstrate that periodic-modulation-driven photonic transitions within the radiation continuum can be effectively mimicked using a single-period ultrafast pulse modulation, eliminating the need for sustained continuous modulation. By leveraging dispersion engineering in metasurfaces to tailor the density of states in the radiation continuum, we achieve controlled frequency transitions and theoretically demonstrate strong nonreciprocity for free-space waves as a key application. Our findings may guide future experimental research on time-varying photonics using materials such as transparent conductive oxides and semiconductors, expanding the possibilities for ultrafast and reconfigurable optical technologies. More broadly, our work may establish a practical and energy-efficient framework for dynamic photonic systems, with potential applications ranging from spatio-temporal wavefront manipulation to photonic computing and ultrafast signal processing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A kind of asymmetric transmission (AT) device based on bilayer silicon arrays (BSA) nanostructure is theoretically explored, which achieves high forward transmissivity and suppressed backward transmissivity for broadband by simply adjusting the parameters of the structure. The structure consists of two silicon cylinder arrays, one on the SiO2 substrate and the other embedded in the substrate. Particularly, three AT devices with different configurations are designed, which exhibit broadband AT with high isolation ratios in the wavelength ranges of 685-807 nm, 866-1029 nm, and 1285-1536 nm, respectively. A comprehensive analysis of the BSA structure's performance across different array periods highlights its potential for broadband optical applications, such as optical isolation and multi-channel optical sensors.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Electromagnetic Surrogate Solver Through Dissipative Relaxation Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In neural-network surrogate solvers for electromagnetic simulations, accurately modeling resonant phenomena remains a central challenge. High-amplitude resonances generate strongly localized field patterns that appear as outlier samples, deviating significantly from the general distribution of non-resonant cases, leading to instability and degraded predictive performance. To address this, we introduce dissipative relaxation transfer learning (DIRTL), a data-efficient training framework that integrates transfer learning with loss-regularized optimization principles from high-Q photonics. DIRTL first pretrains the model on data generated with a small fictitious material loss, which broadens sharp resonant modes and suppresses extreme field amplitudes. This smoothing of the response landscape enables the model to learn global modal features more effectively. The pretrained model is subsequently fine-tuned on the target lossless dataset containing the true high-amplitude resonances, allowing stable adaptation based on the pretrained information. Applied to both the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and UNet architectures, DIRTL yields substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, including up to a two-fold error reduction for the FNO variant. Furthermore, DIRTL exhibits robustness across diverse training conditions and supports strong multi-task performance, underscoring the generalizability and flexibility of the pretrained core. Altogether, these results establish DIRTL as a physically grounded and architecture-agnostic curriculum for enhancing the reliability of machine-learning-based electromagnetic surrogate solvers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces provide a unique platform for efficient harmonic generation and optical wavefront manipulation at the nanoscale. While several approaches are available for performing wavefront shaping, the one exploiting geometric phase streamlines significantly the design and fabrication process. It has been recently shown that, in III-V semiconductor alloys, the rotation of the crystal axes affects the phase and amplitude of second-harmonic generation (SHG) induced by circularly polarized light [1]. Based on this notion, we fabricated and characterized two aluminum gallium arsenide metasurfaces displaying the versatility of the geometric phase design approach through nonlinear beam steering and structured-light generation on the harmonic field.</description>

      <title>A Field-Weighted model for Surface Layer Characterization using Single Channel Intensity Interrogation SPR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the difficulty of characterizing the surface layer rigorously, especially the thickness and refractive index (RI) in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology, we propose a field-weighted analysis method. This approach enables simultaneous quantitative determination of RI for the bulk solution and the surface layer. This study utilizes the aluminum-based Kretschmann structure with the intensity interrogation technique. We construct the field-weighted model governed by the evanescent field penetration depth to decompose the SPR reflected intensity into the bulk and surface responses. Experiments are conducted using bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution to form a surface adsorbed protein layer, and different concentrations of BSA are tested. Results show that the separated surface response fits well with the Langmuir formula, representing a significant improvement over the untreated SPR signal. The bulk and surface responses are then incorporated into the field-weighted model to determine the RI values of the bulk BSA solution and the surface adsorbed BSA layer at various concentrations. The experimental results of BSA solution match the Abbe refractometer measurements with a maximum error 0.0004 in RI, while the results of the adsorbed BSA layer, both the RI and thickness, aligned well with reported parameters for a single BSA layer. This method eliminates the stage rotation in the common angular interrogation SPR technique and complicated optical design and nano-fabrication in the nano-optics sensing schemes, making it suitable for compact, low-cost SPR platforms for practical applications needing surface layer characterization.</description>

      <title>Phase conjugated master oscillator fiber power amplifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-power narrow-linewidth fiber lasers are fundamentally limited by stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), which constrains further power scaling while maintaining spectral linewidth. Traditional mitigation techniques, such as active phase modulation, often introduce trade-offs among complexity, cost, and spectral brightness. In this study, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel all-optical approach for spectral linewidth manipulation and SBS suppression using optical phase conjugation (OPC). By leveraging nonlinear spectral broadening followed by phase conjugation, this method enables sophisticated linewidth narrowing in fiber amplifier, resulting in narrow linewidth output and enhanced SBS threshold. Using a low-cost fiber oscillator as the seed source, we achieve a spectral compression ratio exceeding 3 times. This method not only eliminates the need for complex electro-optic modulation systems but also provides a pathway toward simpler, high-brightness fiber laser systems. Our findings underscore the viability of OPC as a transformative tool for nonlinearity management and power scaling in high-performance fiber laser architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter introduces the fundamental principles of gravitational wave detectors in a simple and comprehensive manner. Because these instruments aim for extremely high sensitivity, it is essential to understand their various noise sources, how such noise couples to the detector output, and the strategies used to mitigate them. These noises contributions are computed in the frame of the Virgo detector and a sensitivity curve is calculated. Although a simplified layout of a gravitational wave detector is considered, it takes into account the most dominant effects and yields in a sensitivity estimate close to the what is observed in real detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This computational study investigates lateral optical forces in asymmetric dielectric nanostructures, focusing on their connection to resonant light-matter interactions. We examine isosceles triangular motifs that exhibit two distinct types of optical force response under plane wave illumination. Through parameter-space analysis, we identify stable zones where optical forces remain consistent and switching bands where forces change abruptly as parameters are altered. The observed force spectra show characteristic asymmetric lineshapes, suggesting Fano-resonance behavior. Eigenfrequency analysis confirms these effects arise from interference between discrete eigenmodes and continuum propagation states, with the eigenmode Q-factors correlating with transition sharpness. These findings provide insights into how structural geometry influences optical forces through resonant effects, offering guidance for designing optically-driven systems where controlled optical force responses are desired.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical self-organization of highly-ordered granular ensemble of optical solitons through collective motions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-organizations of ordered patterns in far-from-equilibrium many-body systems host fundamental importance in many disciplines. Meanwhile, complex systems often feature hierarchical structures with distinct scales for different layers, enabling high-level effective dynamics without exhaustive tracking of all possible degrees of freedoms. In this work, we report a study of the self-organization dynamics of highly-ordered soliton ensembles in a high-harmonic mode-locked fiber lasers through collective motions driven by nonlocal optomechanical interactions and local collisions, which exhibit a series of universal characteristics reminiscent of phase transitions. Moreover, the multi-soliton laser-field can be coarsely grained as a granular ensemble of limit-cycle oscillators with simple interaction rules derived from fine-scale physics. The self-organization of the multitude of solitons in the mode-locked laser cavity can then be mapped into a low-dimensional dynamic model that essentially reproduced the emergent process. Our work affords a conceptual framework for understanding the complex structure formation in nonlinear laser systems, and may help to design ultrafast lasers by exploiting universal principles of collective motions.</description>

      <title>Uncooled Poisson Bolometer for High-Speed Event-Based Long-wave Thermal Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-based vision provides high-speed, energy-efficient sensing for applications such as autonomous navigation and motion tracking. However, implementing this technology in the long-wave infrared remains a significant challenge. Traditional infrared sensors are hindered by slow thermal response times or the heavy power requirements of cryogenic cooling. Here, we introduce the first event-based infrared detector operating in a Poisson-counting regime. This is realized with a spintronic Poisson bolometer capable of broadband detection from 0.8-14$\mu\text{m}$. In this regime, infrared signals are detected through statistically resolvable changes in stochastic switching events. This approach enables room-temperature operation with high timing resolution. Our device achieves a maximum event rate of 1,250 Hz, surpassing the temporal resolution of conventional uncooled microbolometers by a factor of 4. Power consumption is kept low at 0.2$\mu$W per pixel. This work establishes an operating principle for infrared sensing and demonstrates a pathway toward high-speed, energy-efficient, event-driven thermal imaging.</description>

      <title>Hybrid integrated narrow linewidth laser with external distributed optical feedback from a silicon strip waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: External optical feedback via Rayleigh scattering from an integrated microresonator or an optical fiber has been demonstrated to significantly narrow the intrinsic linewidth of semiconductor lasers. Wavelength matching between the lasing cavity and the external high-Q microresonator is required to accumulate Rayleigh scattering based optical feedback. Optical fiber can provide Rayleigh scattering based optical feedback for any lasing wavelength. However, optical fibers hundreds of meters or even kilometers long are required for the accumulation of Rayleigh scattering based optical feedback, hindering the integration of narrow linewidth lasers. Here, we present an integrated scheme that collects distributed feedback signal with weak wavelength dependence by exploiting surface radiation in a silicon waveguide. The effects of waveguide width on the intensities of the surface radiation and distributed optical feedback signal are first numerically analyzed by introducing a collection coefficient. Numerical calculations show that a 1 {\mu}m-wide strip waveguide yields optimal performance for excitation and collection of distributed optical feedback, which is also experimentally verified by measuring the feedback signal with an optical frequency-domain reflectometry. Benefitting from the enhanced distributed optical feedback that is 34.72 dB higher than that in a single-mode fiber, the hybrid integrated laser demonstrates an intrinsic linewidth of 1.52 kHz, a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of 74.71 dB, and a frequency noise of 24.44 Hz2/Hz. Furthermore, within a maximum allowable wavelength tuning range of 2.342 nm, the linewidth narrowing ratio depends little on the wavelength for all the waveguides with different widths.</description>

      <title>Broadband tunable narrow-linewidth laser based on scattering-enhanced fiber covering E-S-C-L bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates a broadband tunable narrow-linewidth laser based on scattering-enhanced fiber, covering the E-S-C-L wavelength bands from 1337.47 nm to 1631.39 nm, with a total tuning span of 293.92 nm. The laser employs two semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) centered at 1420 nm and 1550 nm, which are connected into a single ring resonator via polarization multiplexing. Wavelength selection and tunability is realized using an ultra-broadband tunable filter based on a blazed grating. To suppress side longitude modes, an 18-meter-long femtosecond-laser-empowered random scattering fiber is utilized inside the cavity as a feedback medium, yielding an output linewidths between 1.54 kHz and 2.61 kHz. Benefited from the fast response of the galvanometer mirror and short relaxation time of SOAs, wavelength switching time is less than 1 ms under different tuning channels among the wavelength range of near 300 nm. The stable single-longitude-mode operation is maintained across the entire tuning range. The exceptionally broad tuning range and high spectral purity of the laser endow it with significant application potentials across a wide range of fields.</description>

      <title>Spin-redirection Berry phase with planar rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric or Berry phases are fundamental manifestations that appear in many areas of physics. They arise from the geometry of the space describing the properties of multi-component wave fields. An important example for electromagnetic waves is the spin-redirection Berry phase associated with the evolution of the spin direction. Because this effect has traditionally been studied in isotropic media where the spin is aligned with the ray trajectory, it has become commonly assumed that this spin-redirection Berry phase requires nonplanar rays. Here we show that a spin-redirection phase can in fact arise along a planar ray if the spin evolves along the ray. We expose this effect through the singular example of a moving unmagnetized plasma, and demonstrate how this behavior can more generally arise from a finite transverse spin. In identifying this new spin-redirection mechanism our work not only provides the tools to discover additional manifestations of SOIs in nature, but also uncovers supplemental degrees of freedom to harness SOIs to control light.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of photon pairs via quantum interference between second- and third-order quantum nonlinear processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genuine quantum interference between independent nonlinear processes of different order provides a route to coherent control that cannot be reduced to a classical field interference. Here we present an all-optical analogue of coherent carrier injection by exploiting interference between second- and third-order quantum nonlinear processes in an integrated photonic platform. Photon pairs generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion and spontaneous four-wave mixing coherently contribute to the same final two-photon state, resulting in a phase-dependent modulation of both the generation rate and the spectral structure of the emitted biphoton state. We illustrate the features of such interference and how it can be used to shape biphoton wavefunctions and their quantum correlations. These results identify interference between nonlinear processes of different order as a distinct form of coherent quantum control within quantum nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>On-chip control of the coherence matrix of four-mode partially coherent light: rank, entropy, and modal Stokes parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially coherent light offers salutary capabilities in optical information processing that cannot be matched by coherent light. To date, this `coherence advantage' has been confirmed in proof-of-principle optical communications protocols using bulk optics. Taking full advantage of such opportunities necessitates processing multimode partially coherent light in integrated photonics platforms that alone provide the requisite stability for cascaded operations on a large scale. Here we demonstrate on-chip manipulation of four-mode partially coherent light described by a $4\times4$ Hermitian coherence matrix. Starting with generic maximally incoherent light, we utilize an on-chip hexagonal mesh of Mach-Zehnder interferometers to perform all the unitary and non-unitary tasks that are critical for realizing structured coherence: controlling the coherence rank (the number of non-zero eigenvalues of the coherence matrix); tuning the field entropy; molding the structure of the coherence matrix via $4\times4$ unitary transformations constructed out of sequences of $2\times2$ unitaries acting on pairs of modes; and tomographic reconstruction of the coherence matrix by measuring the modal Stokes parameters associated with Kronecker Pauli matrices. These results confirm the scalability of utilizing $2\times2$ on-chip building blocks for the synthesis and reconstruction of high-dimensional coherence matrices, and provide a decisive step towards large-scale on-chip manipulation of massively moded partially coherent light for applications in optical information processing.</description>

      <title>Plasma Decay of Nanosecond Pulsed Laser-Produced Ar and Ar-H2O Sparks at Atmospheric Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved diagnostics were applied to investigate free-electron properties in nanosecond laser-produced discharges sustained at atmospheric pressure in Ar and in Ar with 3% H2O. The discharges were generated using 23 ns, 1064 nm laser pulses. Broadband plasma imaging and laser Thomson scattering were combined with optical emission spectroscopy, with particular emphasis on Stark broadening of the Halpha and Hbeta lines. The plasma exhibited a bright emission that persisted for up to 30--40 us after breakdown, followed by a very weak glow lasting up to 19 ms. Peak electron number density of about 2 x 10^17 cm-3 and electron temperature of about 7 eV were measured. Excellent agreement between both techniques was obtained for absolute electron number densities. The inferred temporal decay of free electrons is consistent with processes dominated by ambipolar expansion and two- and three-body electron-ion recombination. These results provide benchmark data for modeling nanosecond laser discharges and demonstrate the reliability of combining Thomson scattering with Stark broadening in atmospheric laser sparks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the estimation of dephasing-induced decoherence in continuous-variable quantum systems using non-Gaussian probe states. By purifying the open system, we identify optimal probes, specifically squeezed cat and symmetric squeezed compass states, via quantum Fisher information. These results are in agreement with numerical simulation. In settings where the intra-cavity field is inaccessible and standard measurements are impractical, utilizing an ancilla approach where a qubit traverses or interacts with the cavity field, leading to measurement of the qubit, hence allowing estimation of the dephasing rate via Wigner function reconstruction or less costly marginal distribution.</description>

      <title>Coherent Amplifier-Empowered Quantum Interferometer: Preserving Sensitivity and Quantum Advantage under High Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum interferometers offer phase measurement capabilities that surpass the standard quantum limit (SQL), with phase sensitivity and quantum enhancement factor serving as key performance metrics. However, practical implementations face severe degradation of both metrics due to unavoidable losses, representing the foremost challenge in advancing quantum interferometry toward real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent-amplifier-empowered quantum interferometer. The coherent amplifier dramatically suppresses the decay of both sensitivity and quantum enhancement under high-loss conditions, maintaining phase sensitivity beyond the original SQL even for losses exceeding 90%. Using an injected 4.2 dB squeezed-vacuum state in experimental demonstration, our scheme reduces the quantum enhancement degradation under 90% loss from 3.7 dB in a conventional quantum interferometer (CQI) to only 1.5 dB. More importantly, the phase sensitivity degradation under the same loss is limited to 4.0 dB, markedly outperforming the 11.2 dB degradation observed in a CQI. This improvement is enabled by the coherent amplifier's phase-sensitive photon amplification and its protection of the quantum state. This breakthrough in amplifier-empowered quantum interferometry overcomes the critical barrier to practical deployment, enabling robust quantum-enhanced measurements in lossy environments.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Mechanical Fingerprints for THz Sensing of 'Hidden' Nanoparticles in Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy holds transformative potential for non-invasive sensing, yet characterizing individual nanoparticles in complex biological environments remains challenging due to the far-field diffraction limit. While near-field dipolar theory is well established, its application to characterizing/identifying nanoparticles immersed in complex media at THz frequencies is largely unexplored.
  This work utilizes numerical simulations of magneto-optical (MO) heterodimers -- comprising n-doped Indium Antimonide (n-InSb) and isotropic or birefringent particles (e.g., SiO2, GaSe) -- under counter-propagating, circularly polarized THz illumination. We demonstrate that while far-field observables like absorption cross-sections are often dominated by the MO-active particle, mechanical variables-specifically induced binding forces and spin/orbital torques-exhibit superior sensitivity for detecting "hidden" neighboring components. Because these mechanical signatures depend directly on near-field interactions, they provide higher information density regarding interparticle coupling.
  Key findings reveal material-specific spectral "hotspots" and "zeros" that serve as robust calibration markers even within dispersive biological surrogates. We show that the spin torque on non-MO particles is significantly modified by MO-neighbor proximity, a phenomenon controllable via static magnetic fields. Furthermore, these variables exhibit high angular sensitivity in perpendicular configurations. Our results provide a roadmap for using optomechanical signatures as high-resolution detectors for in-vivo diagnostics, signal transduction, and low-energy nanocircuit control.</description>

      <title>Atom-light hybrid interferometer for atomic sensing with quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum memories feature a reversible conversion of optical fields into long-lived atomic spin waves, and are therefore ideal for operating as sensitive atomic sensors. However, up to now, atom-light interferometers have lacked an efficient approach to exploit their ultimate atomic sensing performance, since an extra optical delay line is required to compensate for the memory time. Here, we report a new protocol that records the photocurrent via heterodyne mixing with a stable local oscillator. The obtained complex quadrature amplitude that carries information imprinted on its phase by an external magnetic field, is successfully recovered from the interference patterns between the light and the atomic spin wave, without the stringent requirement of having them overlap in time. Our results reveal that the sensitivity scales favorably with the lifetime of the quantum memory. Our work may have important applications in building distributed quantum networks through quantum memory-assisted atom-light interferometers.</description>

      <title>Giant Resonant Enhancement of Photoinduced Dynamical Cooper Pairing, far above $T_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pump-probe experiments performed on $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$ have unveiled both optical and transport signatures of metastable light-induced superconductivity up to room temperature, far above $T_c$. Recent experiments have uncovered that excitation in the vicinity of $50 ~\textrm{meV}$ enables the observation of high temperature light-induced superconductivity at significantly lower fluences. Inspired by these experiments we develop a mechanism which can explain such a giant resonant enhancement of light-induced superconductivity. Within a minimal non-linear Holstein model, we show that resonantly driving optical Raman modes leads to a time-dependent electron-phonon coupling. Such a coupling then modulates the effective electron-electron attraction, with the strongest modulations occurring when the drive is resonant with the phonon frequency. These dynamical modulations of the pairing interactions lead to Floquet-BCS instabilities at temperatures far exceeding equilibrium $T_c$, as observed in experiments. We conclude by discussing the implications of our general analysis on the $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$ experiments specifically and suggesting experimental signatures of our mechanism.</description>

      <title>Symmetry analysis and multipole classification of eigenmodes in electromagnetic resonators for engineering their optical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.11411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resonator is one of the main building blocks of a plethora of photonic and microwave devices from nanolasers to compact biosensors and magnetic resonance scanners. The symmetry of the resonators is tightly related to their mode structure and multipole content which determines the linear and non-linear response of the resonator. Here, we develop the algorithm for the classification of eigenmodes in resonators of the simplest shapes depending on their symmetry group. For each type of mode, we find its multipole content. As an illustrative example, we apply the developed formalism to the analysis of dielectric triangular prism and demonstrate the formation of high-Q resonances originated due to suppression of the scattering through the main multipole channel. The developed approach one to engineer, predict, and explain scattering phenomena and optical properties of resonators and meta-atoms basing only on their symmetry without the need for numerical simulations and it can be used for the design of new photonic and microwave devices.</description>

      <title>Polarization-independent deterministic mode localization in a photonic lantern</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08595v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent interference in multimode photonic systems underpins scalable, high-fidelity control for beam shaping, power delivery, and signal processing, yet most existing approaches rely on bulky adaptive optics or polarization-sensitive waveguides. Here, we demonstrate an all-fiber, polarization-independent coherent mode-recombination scheme that deterministically localizes Gaussian-like spots with a Gaussian similarity index up to 0.95 at three distinct positions on the multimode facet of a commercial three-mode graded-index photonic lantern (PL). The device coherently combines the lantern's individual outputs using piezoelectric phase shifters and a reciprocal Faraday-mirror feedback loop, which enforces polarization reciprocity and eliminates alignment sensitivity. This configuration achieves near-unity (100%) relative mode-conversion efficiency, three-spot switching, and long-term stability with sub-micron centroid drift ($0.55\mu m$) without active feedback. The phase-locked profiles maintain high Gaussian correspondence, strong spatial confinement, and high single-mode coupling efficiency, demonstrating robustness under laboratory-scale perturbations. Numerical simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimental recombination dynamics and further establish scalability through six-mode commercial-lantern modeling. The polarization-insensitive, compact, and low-loss architecture establishes PLs as practical engines for coherent beam forming and deterministic spatial localization, enabling turbulence-resilient beam delivery, reconfigurable mode-division multiplexing, biomedical imaging and sensing, and quantum photonics, while reducing system complexity and preserving efficiency.</description>

      <title>Phased-Array Laser Power Beaming from Cislunar Space to the Lunar Surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10855v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent, end-to-end framework for laser power beaming from cislunar orbits to the lunar surface. The model links on-orbit generation (solar arrays and wall-plug to optical), terrain-masked visibility and range, beam propagation with realistic divergence and jitter, and surface conversion with thermal and dust limits, returning delivered daily energy. Baseline loads for early polar activities (habitat survival, mobility, comm/nav, pilot ISRU) set target W h/day and are used consistently in scaling laws and design maps. A near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) to a Shackleton-rim site provides a worked example: for a 2 m-class phased array at 1064 nm the reference geometry yields ~0.6-0.8 kW h/day to a 1m$^2$ receiver (about 28 W averaged over the day). We place this result in context by comparing on the same daily-energy metric to surface photovoltaics (PV) with storage and to compact fission, and by showing how delivered energy scales nearly linearly with transmit power and as $D_{\rm eff}^2$ via encircled-energy capture, with a multiplicative gain from visibility (constellations). The same framework indicates practical regimes already within reach: e.g., a 10 m effective-aperture optical phased array at $P_{\rm tx}=100$ kW delivers ~30-50 kW h/day at polar sites with typical single-orbiter visibility, as quantified by the delivered-energy and sizing maps. Thus, laser beaming is mass-competitive where darkness or permanent shadow forces deep storage for PV, or where distributed and duty-cycled users can amortize a shared transmitter; compact fission retains advantage for continuous multi-kW baseload at fixed sites.</description>

      <title>Dipole-quadrupole model and multipole analysis of resonant membrane metasurfaces</title>

Abstract: Membrane-metasurfaces, formed by periodic arrangements of holes in a dielectric layer, are gaining attention for their easier manufacturing via subtractive techniques, unnecessity of substrates, and access to resonant near-fields. Despite their practical relevance, their theoretical description remains elusive. Here, we present a semi-analytical dipole-quadrupole model for the multipole analysis of numerically-obtained reflection and transmission spectra in metasurfaces excited at arbitrary angles. Dipole models are generally sufficient to study traditional metasurfaces made of solid nanostructures. However, the inclusion of electric and magnetic quadrupoles is necessary to study membrane-metasurfaces, which offer an ideal platform to showcase our method. We demonstrate the importance of choosing the optimal position of a symmetric membrane-metasurface's unit cell to ensure the sufficiency of the dipole-quadrupole approximation. We show that our formalism can explain complex phenomena arising from inter-multipole interference, including lattice anapole and generalized Kerker effects, Fano resonances, and quasi-bound states in the continuum. We also present the applicability of the method to membrane-metasurfaces with non-centrosymmetric unit cells (e.g., conical holes and surface voids). By enabling a deeper insight into the coupling mechanisms leading to the formation of local and collective resonances, our method expands the electromagnetics toolbox to study, understand, and design conventional and membrane-metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Ligand Engineering for Precise Control of Ultrathin CsPbI3 Nanoplatelet Superlattices for Efficient Light-Emitting Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11107</link>

Abstract: Strongly-confined perovskite nanoplatelets (PeNPLs) offer opportunities not found in conventional isotropic nanocubes, especially in producing linearly polarized light, as well as enhancing outcoupling through control over the transition dipole moment. But this requires ultrathin nanoplatelets with three or fewer monolayers of PbI6 octahedra across the thickness, which are challenging to synthesise uniformly, and their luminescence is strongly affected by surface defects. Together, these limit the performance of ultrathin PeNPLs in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, we address these challenges with an ancillary ligand engineering strategy. We demonstrate that ligands with phosphoryl functional groups strongly bind to the perovskite surface, while having an organic backbone that is not sterically bulky ensures high ligand density. By modulating nucleation and growth, these ancillary ligands lead to monodisperse PeNPLs that stack more uniformly when self-assembled into superlattices, with suppressed agglomeration. As a result, from edge-up PeNPL superlattices, we achieve enhanced degree of polarization, while from face-down PeNPL superlattices, we achieve enhanced outcoupling that results in LEDs with 13.1% external quantum efficiency, the highest reported for ultrathin PeNPL LEDs. This work establishes ancillary ligand-induced synthesis as a decisive route to achieve uniform nanoplatelets with robust orientation control, enabling full utilization of the multifunctionality of anisotropic PeNPLs.</description>

      <title>van de Hulst Essay: Geometric-phase portrayal of electromagnetic scattering by a three-dimensional object in free space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of geometric phase was applied to initiate the geometric-phase portrayal of electromagnetic scattering by a three-dimensional object in free space. Whereas the incident electromagnetic field is that of an arbitrarily polarized plane wave, the direction-dependent far-zone scattering amplitude is used to define direction-dependent Stokes parameters for the scattered field. Both symmetric and asymmetric Poincar\'e spinors are formulated to characterize the polarization states of incident plane wave and the far-zone scattering amplitude, and two different geometric phases are defined therefrom. Density plots of both geometric phases were calculated for six different homogeneous isotropic spheres with different linear constitutive properties and boundary conditions: dielectric-magnetic spheres (non-dissipative and dissipative), impedance spheres, perfect electrically conducting spheres, charged dielectric-magnetic spheres, dielectric-magnetic spheres with topologically insulating surface states, and isotropic chiral spheres. The incident plane waves were taken to be linearly and circularly polarized, for the sake of illustration. Numerical results revealed that geometric-phase density plots possess significantly richer features than their counterparts for the differential scattering efficiency. The geometric-phase portrayals exhibit enhanced sensitivity to changes in the size and composition of the scatterer, the boundary conditions, and the incident polarization state, suggesting promise for inverse-scattering problems.</description>

      <title>Electronic analogue of Fourier optics with mass-less Dirac fermions scattered by quantum dot lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of electron optics exploits the analogy between the movement of electrons or charged quasiparticles, primarily in two-dimensional materials subjected to electric and magnetic (EM) fields and the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a dielectric medium with varied refractive index. We significantly extend this analogy by introducing an electronic analogue of Fourier optics dubbed as Fourier electron optics (FEO) with massless Dirac fermions (MDF), namely the charge carriers of single-layer graphene under ambient conditions, by considering their scattering from a two-dimensional quantum dot lattice (TDQDL) treated within Lippmann-Schwinger formalism. By considering the scattering of MDF from TDQDL with a defect region, as well as the moir\'{e} pattern of twisted TDQDLs, we establish an electronic analogue of Babinet's principle in optics. Exploiting the similarity of the resulting differential scattering cross-section with the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, we construct a dictionary for such FEO. Subsequently, we evaluate the resistivity of such scattered MDF using the Boltzmann approach as a function of the angle made between the direction of propagation of these charge-carriers and the symmetry axis of the dot-lattice, and Fourier analyze them to show that the spatial frequency associated with the angle-resolved resistivity gets filtered according to the structural changes in the dot lattice, indicating wider applicability of FEO of MDF.</description>

      <title>Two remote counting events induced by a single photon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13545v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Einstein's thought experiment that a single quantum particle diffracted after a pinhole could in principle produce an action in two or several places on a hemispherical imaging screen, here we explore theoretically the possibility to simultaneously detect the action of a single photon at two remote places. This is considered in a cascade quantum system composed of two spatially distant cavities each coupled to a qubit in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We show that a single-photon pulse incident on the two cavities can simultaneously excite the two remote qubits and lead to two subsequent single-photon detection events even when the separation between them is comparable to the spatial length of the photon pulse. Our results not only uncover new facets of photons at a fundamental level but also have practical applications, such as the generation of remote entanglement by a single photon through a dissipative channel which is otherwise unattainable in the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Polarization entanglement and qubit error rate dependence on the exciton-phonon coupling in self-assembled quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03413v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarization-entangled photons are key resources for a wide range of protocols in quantum computation and quantum key distribution. Achieving a near-unity degree of polarization entanglement is essential for minimizing qubit error rates in secure key distribution. In this work, we theoretically investigate polarization-entangled photon pairs generated via a quantum-dot radiative cascade embedded in a micropillar cavity. To account for the unavoidable exciton-phonon interactions in the quantum dot-cavity system, we develop a polaron master-equation framework and examine its impact on the degree of entanglement and the resulting qubit error rate. We derive analytical expressions for phonon-induced incoherent scattering rates and show that one-photon incoherent processes dominate, leading to a substantial reduction of entanglement. We further demonstrate that at elevated phonon-bath temperatures, cavity-mediated effects, such as cross-coupling between exciton states, ac Stark shifts, and multiphoton emission, are significantly suppressed due to phonon-induced renormalization of the cavity coupling strength and the Rabi frequency. Finally, we analyze a BBM92 quantum key distribution protocol and study the evolution of the qubit error rate as a function of the phonon-bath temperature.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Characterization of the Vacuum Beam Guide and Its Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proposed vacuum beam guide (VBG) represents a transformative advance in quantum channel technology, guaranteeing an ultra-low level of attenuation and a broad transmission linewidth, which offers an unprecedented quantum capacity, exceeding Tera-qubits per second on a continental scale. However, the stability of the VBG in terms of interferometry remains unexamined. To address this gap, we have developed a comprehensive noise budget for sources of phase noise in the VBG, highlighting its capabilities for precision interferometry. This model facilitates a comprehensive characterization of the VBG as a photonic quantum channel, thereby allowing a detailed investigation of its potential. Our theoretical analysis finds no technical or fundamental blockers for a VBG and predicts its expected performance in a wide range of quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Airy Beamforming for Radiative Near-Field MU-XL-MIMO: Overcoming Half-Space Blockage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The move to next-generation wireless communications with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) brings the communications into the radiative near-field (RNF) region, where distance-aware focusing is feasible. However, high-frequency RNF links are highly vulnerable to blockage in indoor environments dominated by half-space obstacles (walls, corners) that create knife-edge shadows. Conventional near-field focused beams offer high gain in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios but suffer from severe energy truncation and effective-rank collapse in shadowed regions, often necessitating the deployment of auxiliary hardware such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to restore connectivity. We propose a beamforming strategy that exploits the auto-bending property of Airy beams to mitigate half-space blockage without additional hardware. The Airy beam is designed to ``ride'' the diffraction edge, accelerating its main lobe into the shadow to restore connectivity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Green's function-based RNF multi-user channel model that analytically reveals singular-value collapse behind knife-edge obstacles; (ii) an Airy analog beamforming scheme that optimizes the bending trajectory to recover the effective channel rank; and (iii) an Airy null-steering method that aligns oscillatory nulls with bright-region users to suppress interference in mixed shadow/bright scenarios. Simulations show that the proposed edge-riding Airy strategy achieves a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement of over 20 dB and restores full-rank connectivity in shadowed links compared to conventional RNF focusing, virtually eliminating outage in geometric shadows and increasing multi-user spectral efficiency by approximately 35\% under typical indoor ELAA configurations. These results demonstrate robust RNF multi-user access in half-space blockage scenarios without relying on RIS.</description>

      <title>Distance-Independent Atmospheric Refraction Correction for Accurate Retrieval of Fireball Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of fireball direction is essential for retrieving trajectories and velocities. Errors in these measurements have significant implications, affecting the calculated pre-impact orbit, influencing mass estimates, and impacting the accuracy of dark flight simulations, where applicable. Here we implement a new atmospheric refraction correction technique that addresses a significant aspect previously overlooked in the field of meteor science. Traditional refraction correction techniques, originally designed for objects positioned at infinite distances, tend to overcompensate when applied to objects within the Earth's atmosphere. To rectify this issue, our study introduces the concept of the atmospheric refraction delta z correction technique, involving the artificial elevation of the observer site height above sea level. We utilize analytically derived formulas for the delta z correction in conjunction with commonly used refraction models, validating these results against a numerical solution that traces light rays through the atmosphere. This ray-tracing model is applied to finely meshed atmospheric layers, yielding precise correction values. We evaluate multiple sources of error in order to quantify the achievable accuracy of the proposed method. Our approach (1) enables the determination of fireball positions with improved astrometric accuracy, (2) removes the explicit dependence on the fireball distance from the observer or its height above Earth's surface within the limits imposed by realistic atmospheric variability, and (3) simplifies meteor data processing by providing a robust framework for analyzing low-elevation fireball observations, for which atmospheric refraction is significant and is automatically corrected by the method. As a result of this work, we provide open, publicly accessible software for calculating the delta z correction.</description>
