      <title>Convective scalar transport from spherical drops in complex shearing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the scalar transport rate, as characterized by the Nusselt number\,($Nu$), from a neutrally buoyant spherical drop in an ambient linear flow, in the absence of inertia and in the strong convection limit. This corresponds to the regime $Re \ll 1, Pe \gg 1$, where $Re$ and $Pe$ are the Reynolds and P\'eclet numbers, and denote the ratios of the diffusive and convective time scales associated with momentum and scalar transport. The focus is on the exterior problem, with the drop-phase transport resistance assumed negligible, and the scalar field being a constant on the drop surface. While $Nu \propto Pe^{\frac{1}{2}}$ for $Pe \gg 1$, owing to the transport occurring across a thin $O(a Pe^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ boundary layer\,($a$ being the drop radius), the proportionality factor in this relation depends sensitively on ambient flow geometry via the surface-streamline topology. Unlike a rigid sphere, a variety of surface-streamline topologies can drive transport across the boundary layer at widely differing rates. In contrast to earlier studies which almost exclusively focus on axisymmetric ambient flows, we calculate $Nu$ for a pair of non-axisymmetric linear flow families: (i) 3D extensional flows with aligned vorticity and (ii) Axisymmetric extensional flows with inclined vorticity, using a non-orthogonal surface-streamline aligned coordinate system. Taken together, the families span the entire gamut of surface-streamline topologies in the space of incompressible linear flows. Independent numerical simulations of the interior problem reveal the emergence of an $O(aPe^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ boundary layer beneath the drop surface, driven by chaotic streamlines, pointing to the possibility of $Nu \propto Pe^{\frac{1}{2}}$ for the conjugate problem, for sufficiently large $Pe$.</description>

      <title>Wind-turbine wake effects on the rate of accumulation of fatigue damage in overhead conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guidance relating to the safe distance within which overhead conductors (OHCs) should not be built with respect to a wind turbine, and vice versa, varies from country to country. In the United Kingdom the recommendation is that OHCs are not installed within three rotor diameters (3D) of wind turbines due to concerns over wake-induced fatigue. To assess the physical basis for this recommendation, wind-tunnel experiments were conducted using a scaled wind turbine placed upstream of an instrumented conductor, in conditions representative of forested terrain. The conductor was equipped with distributed fibre-optic strain sensing based on Rayleigh backscattering, providing spatially resolved measurements at 2.6 mm resolution. Three conductor heights and four turbine-conductor spacings were tested, together with a no-turbine baseline, while maintaining a constant incident wind speed of 7 m/s. The results identify a critical region near the clamp where mean strain is maximised. Neither mean nor fluctuating strain at this location increased substantially due to the presence of the turbine wake. Strain fluctuations were dominated by aeolian vibration, with the wake increasing vibration amplitude whilst reducing its characteristic frequency. Rainflow counting fatigue analysis shows that damage accumulation depends strongly on conductor height. While fatigue damage rates increase when the conductor is fully immersed in the wake, reduced damage rates are observed for lower heights and closer spacings. These results suggest that, under forested atmospheric conditions, conductor-turbine separations smaller than the current 3D guidance may be feasible provided the conductor is not fully immersed in the turbine wake.</description>

      <title>Fully Turbulent Wakes at Low Reynolds Numbers: the Case of the Thin Flat Plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the wake flow past a thin two-dimensional flat plate normal to the uniform stream and demonstrate that this flow is turbulent already at a relatively low Reynolds number of $Re = 400$. This is achieved by performing a careful comparison of the results of a DNS of this flow with experimental measurements of wake flows in the same geometric configuration at the Reynolds numbers of $Re=12500, 19700$. This comparison reveals that the distribution of several key quantities, including the mean velocity, Reynolds stresses and different effects contributing to the transport of the turbulent kinetic energy, are, up to measurement uncertainty, the same in these flows. Moreover, the wake flow at $Re = 400$ also features energy spectra characteristic of turbulent flows with intermittency detected in the distributions of the fluctuating strain and rotation rates. In contrast, these features are absent from the results of the DNS of the wake flow at $Re = 150$ where the distribution of the key quantities is also fundamentally different. These results show that the path to transition to turbulence in the wake past a thin flat plate is different from that in the wakes of canonical (i.e., circular or square) cylinders. We also identify possible physical mechanisms that may be responsible for these differences.</description>

      <title>Gravity Wave Interactions in the Stratocumulus-Topped Boundary Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the breakup propensity of the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer (STBL) interacting with gravity waves using large-eddy simulation with a uniform vertical grid of $5$ m and horizontal spacing of $30$ m. A radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) state is constructed to enforce stationarity in the STBL, and the gravity waves are introduced via a vertical momentum forcing mimicking a packet of plane waves. A nondimensionalization involving the inversion height and mean horizontal base wind as length and velocity scales is proposed to provide a framework to analyze the forcing parameter space. The magnitude of the scaled forcing amplitude ($\mathcal{A}$) is critical in understanding various STBL breakup conditions. Classification of breakup was based on the reduction of the liquid water path for each forced STBL case. We found that breakup did not occur for $\mathcal{A}&lt;1$ and observed modest reductions in cloud for $1&lt;\mathcal{A}&lt;2$, but the deck recovered to the stationary state slowly after the single-period forcing ceased. Fixing $\mathcal{A}\sim 2$ showed that forcings with longer duration and wider locality promote breakup. However, when the forcing is a linear combination of waves of two different periods, the percentage of cleared cloud dramatically increases, though recovery of RCE is still observed in some cases. $\mathcal{A}\geq2.5$ marks a critical threshold by which the STBL breaks up entirely and remains patchy. We further explore the connection between these bulk breakup results and the turbulent state by examining energy budgets and the anisotropy induced by the forcing.</description>

      <title>Flocking and mesoscale turbulence in three-dimensional active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the three-dimensional turbulence in a minimal model of an active fluid--the Toner-Tu-Swift-Hohenburg equation. For small activity, we observe bacterial turbulence, while for large activity, we uncover hitherto unexplored regime of a turbulent flock where a global order coexists with turbulence. We present a simple closure model that predicts the turbulent flock and also qualitatively explains the transition to the bacterial turbulence regime via a transcritical bifurcation.</description>

      <title>DDFKs: Fluid Simulation with Dynamic Divergence-Free Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid simulations based on memory-efficient spatial representations like implicit neural spatial representations (INSRs) and Gaussian spatial representation (GSR), where the velocity fields are parameterized by neural networks or weighted Gaussian functions, has been an emerging research area. Though advantages over traditional discretizations like spatial adaptivity and continuous differentiability of these spatial representations are leveraged by fluid solvers, solving the time-dependent PDEs that governs the fluid dynamics remain challenging, especially in incompressible fluids where the divergence-free constraint is enforced. In this paper, we propose a grid-free solver Dynamic Divergence-Free Kernels (DDFKs) for incompressible flows based on divergence-free kernels (DFKs). Each DFK is incorporated with a matrix-valued radial basis function and a vector-valued weight, yielding a divergence-free vector field. We model the continuous flow velocity as the sum of multiple DFKs, thus enforcing incompressibility while being able to preserve different level of details. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method achieves comparable accuracy, robustness, ability to preserve vortices, time and memory efficiency and generality across diverse phenomena to state-of-the-art methods using memory-efficient spatial representations, while excels at maintaining incompressibility. Though our first-order solver are slower than fluid solvers with traditional discretizations, our approach exhibits significantly lower numerical dissipation due to reduced discretization error. We demonstrate our method on diverse incompressible flow examples with rich vortices and various solid boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Cavitation Dynamics in Venturi-Type Microchannels: Experimental Observations and Numerical Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavitation in fluids can severely hinder the efficiency of the associated flows. This undesired phenomenon is strongly influenced by local flow conditions, flow orientation, proximity to boundaries and liquid/gas properties at saturation. When liquid flow is severely constricted and cavitation occurs, diverging microchannels can suppress vapor formation through effective pressure recovery; however, the behavior of such microchannels under different geometric and operating conditions remains unclear. This work combines experimental data and computational modeling to elucidate the intricate flow dynamics of cavitation-induced phase change of refrigerant (R134a) flow in a Venturi-type microchannel. Full-field numerical simulations are carried out using the interPhaseChangeFoam solver in OpenFOAM, with the model coefficients being validated against experimental data obtained with an identical system. The effects of flow rate, channel opening angle, and inlet cross-sectional geometry are explored with a focus on pressure drop, velocity distribution, and cavitation characteristics, including vapor fraction. The results highlight the roles of flow velocity, orifice-to-channel width ratio, orifice size, and channel divergence angle on overall pressure drop. A channel opening angle of 12 degrees minimizes pressure drop, in contrast with conventional single-phase Venturi geometries where the optimal opening angle typically lies between 5 and 7 degrees. The study underscores that the cavitation number, including its sign, serves as a critical quantitative indicator of cavitation severity where increasingly negative values correspond to intensified vapor generation in microscale constrictions. By identifying the relationships between operating conditions &amp; cavitation phenomena, this work provides a framework for understanding and optimizing microchannel designs under conditions prone to cavitation.</description>

      <title>Quantum reinforcement learning-based active flow control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active flow control remains a significant challenge due to the high-dimensional, nonlinear nature of fluid dynamics. Quantum machine learning may prove effective in addressing these issues, given that quantum computing possesses superiority over traditional computing in some extend. Thus, this study developed a quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) based active flow control framework, integrating variational quantum circuits (VQCs) with the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to learn a real time controller. Firstly, we tested the QRL in a CartPole problem. The QRL shows parameter efficiency and enhanced learning capability, indicating VQC acts as promising candidates for advancing RL, particularly in scenarios requiring both computational efficiency and robust performance. The active control of flow past a square circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of 100 was tested via QRL. Our hybrid architecture encodes high-dimensional flow states into a quantum policy network, which generates continuous blowing/suction actions on the cylinder surface, and thus suppress the vortex shedding to achieve drag reduction. Numerical simulations demonstrate the QRL successfully reduces the mean drag and attenuates lift oscillations. Flow field analysis confirms that QRL control effectively suppresses large-scale vortex shedding, leading to a narrower wake compared to the uncontrolled baseline. These results validate the potential of quantum-enhanced learning for tackling complex fluid dynamics problems. The proposed QRL framework establishes a promising blueprint for quantum-AI accelerated solutions in aerospace design, energy-efficient turbomachinery, and other applications involving sophisticated fluid-structure interactions.</description>

      <title>Scalar Dispersion from Wall-Mounted Cylinders at Large Reynolds Number: Plume Transitions and Regime Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive experimental investigation of scalar dispersion from the free end of wall-mounted cylindrical obstacles immersed in a large-Reynolds-number turbulent boundary layer. A key focus is the characterization of transition behavior between distinct dispersion regimes: elevated plumes (EP), ground-level plumes (GLP), and ground-level sources (GLS). Experiments systematically vary the primary and secondary aspect ratios ($AR_1, AR_2$) and the velocity ratio ($ r$) to explore their effects on the evolution of scalar plumes. Plume classification is governed by the non-dimensional parameter $\tilde{h}_s / \delta_{cz}$, which quantifies the progressive interaction between the plume and the ground. Here, $\tilde{h}_s$ denotes the effective source height and $\delta_{cz}$, the vertical plume half-width. Detailed concentration measurements demonstrate that the EP--GLP--GLS transitions substantially modify both vertical and lateral dispersion characteristics. The measurements reveal systematic departures from classical dispersion-coefficient scaling. To assess the capability of existing models under these conditions, the experimentally determined dispersion coefficients are used to evaluate the Gaussian Dispersion Model (GDM) and a Wall Similarity Model (WSM). The GDM captures general trends but deviates in specific regimes, whereas the WSM offers improved representation under GLS conditions. The resulting dataset, grounded in systematic laboratory measurements, establishes a critical benchmark for validating numerical simulations and informing the development of next-generation predictive models. Finally, leveraging these results, a concise data-informed predictive framework is introduced that captures the EP--GLP--GLS transitions and provides first-order estimates of ground-level concentration across geometric and momentum-ratio parameter space.</description>

      <title>Beyond secondary instability: on the emergence of finite-amplitude waves in G\"ortler vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G\"ortler vortices developing over a concave wall support rapidly oscillating wavelike disturbances through secondary instabilities. Although experiments indicate that the finite-amplitude evolution of these waves acts as a precursor to turbulence transition, accurate and efficient prediction has remained out of reach. We overcome this limitation by using the Parabolised Coherent Structures (PCS) method of Song &amp; Deguchi (2025), which incorporates the nonlinear vortex-wave interaction into a standard spatial-marching approach. Our computations successfully reproduce the wave amplitude and displacement thickness observed in the widely known experiments of Swearingen &amp; Blackwelder (1987).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attempts to disentangle shear-flow turbulence often focus on identifying relatively simple solutions, such as travelling waves or periodic orbits. We show, however, that capturing multiscale features requires considering states at least as complex as quasi-time-periodic solutions. Approximations of these states can be computed efficiently using a quasi-linear model, consistent with the large-Reynolds-number asymptotic analysis. The quasi-linear structure is key to producing multiscale critical layers that generate vortices obeying Taylor frozen-flow hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Analysis of inviscid shear instability of axisymmetric flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simple analytical criteria are derived to determine whether axisymmetric base flows in annuli and pipes are stable or unstable. Both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric inviscid disturbances are considered. Our sufficient condition for stability improves upon the classical result of \cite{Batchelor_Gill_1962}, following the idea of the second Kelvin-Arnol'd stability theorem. A novel sufficient condition for instability is also derived by extending the recently proposed hurdle theorem for parallel flows \citep{Deguchi_Hirota_Dowling_2024}. These analytical criteria are applied to annular and pipe model flows and are shown to effectively predict the neutral parameters obtained from eigenvalue computations of the stability problem.</description>

      <title>Log-linear law of the mean streamwise velocity in turbulent boundary layers with moderate adverse pressure gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An essential feature of canonical zero-pressure-gradient (ZPG) turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) is that the mean streamwise velocity exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the wall-normal distance, known as the log law. In this study, we demonstrate that this conventional log law is not suitable for turbulent boundary layers subjected to pressure gradients (PGs). Instead, a log--linear law is theoretically derived for TBLs under moderate adverse pressure gradients (APGs), based on the total shear-stress balance and a rescaled eddy-viscosity model. The validity of the proposed log--linear law is assessed using available datasets of incompressible APG TBLs with the Clauser pressure-gradient parameter $\beta$ ranging from 0.73 to 9.0. Compared with the conventional log law, the present log--linear formulation shows significantly improved agreement with the measured mean velocity profiles. In the limiting case of $\beta \to 0$, the proposed law naturally recovers the classical log law.</description>

      <title>AI-based separation of turbulence from coherent background flows in decaying hydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Separating turbulent fluctuations from coherent large-scale background flows is a fundamental challenge in the analysis of numerical simulations and astronomical observations. Traditional approaches to this problem commonly rely on decomposition-based techniques, including scale-based filtering methods such as Fourier or wavelet transforms, as well as adaptive methods like the Hilbert-Huang transformation. In realistic flows, however, coherent motions and turbulent fluctuations often overlap across a broad range of scales and interact nonlinearly, rendering any clear and unique separation inherently ambiguous, particularly in astrophysical settings where data are projected or sparsely sampled. In this work, we assess the robustness of AI-based turbulence-background separation using two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes simulations of decaying hydrodynamic turbulence. The simulations are initialized with a coherent background flow and divergence-free turbulent perturbations with a Kolmogorov-like power spectrum, and evolve without external forcing, providing a conservative physical testbed. A neural network trained exclusively on static synthetic images is applied to simulation snapshots at different evolutionary stages. We find that the model successfully recovers turbulent fluctuations during early and intermediate stages, when partial scale separation is preserved. At later stages, despite the substantial decay of turbulent energy and the resulting reduction in fluctuation strength, the model continues to recover visually and spectrally plausible turbulent structures and preserves inertial-range spectral scaling, demonstrating robust separation under increasingly challenging conditions.

      <title>Experimental investigation of wall-pressure fluctuations on a fully appended submarine model at high Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in hydroacoustics through a systematic wind tunnel investigation of wall-pressure fluctuations on the fully appended DARPA SUBOFF model at operationally relevant Reynolds numbers ranging from $5.6 \times 10^{6}$ to $1.4 \times 10^{7}$. The experimental campaign encompasses baseline straight-ahead flow, complex maneuvering (yaw and pitch) conditions, and a first-of-its-kind assessment of a novel vortex control baffle (VCB). To ensure benchmark-quality spectral data, rigorous signal processing techniques were applied, specifically Wiener filtering for background noise suppression and dynamic transfer function correction for pinhole sensors. Key findings indicate that while spectral self-similarity holds across Reynolds numbers, the primary finding is the critical role of appendages in noise amplification. Unstable horseshoe vortex dynamics at the sail-hull junction drive localized pressure fluctuations of up to 300%, establishing this feature as a major coherent noise source. To address this, the study provides the pioneering experimental validation of the VCB. By physically suppressing horseshoe vortex formation at the sail-hull junction, the VCB achieves a global stabilization of the downstream flow, resulting in a significant 35% reduction in root-mean-square wall-pressure fluctuations at the stern and an approximately 14% reduction along the parallel mid-body. Furthermore, maneuvering conditions are shown to fundamentally reshape the pressure field, introducing substantial crossflow effects and non-monotonic spectral behaviors. This comprehensive dataset and the demonstrated efficacy of the VCB provide essential physical insights and a critical validation benchmark for the design of next-generation quiet submarines.</description>

      <title>The global attractor of the Toner-Tu-Swift-Hohenberg equations of active turbulence and its properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Toner-Tu-Swift-Hohenberg (TTSH) equations are one of the basic equations that are used to model turbulent behaviour in active matter, specifically the swarming of bacteria in suspension. They combine features of the incompressible Navier-Stokes, the Toner-Tu and Swift-Hohenberg equations, together with the important properties that they are linearly driven, and that the Laplacian diffusion is taken to be negative in combination with hyper-dissipation. We prove that the TTSH equations possess a finite-dimensional compact global attractor on the periodic domain $\mathbb{T}^d$ ($d=2,3$) and we establish explicit estimates for its Lyapunov dimension which agree with the heuristic prediction based on the Swift-Hohenberg length scale. The predominance of this length scale (as a vortex length scale) has been observed in both numerical and experimental studies of bacterial turbulence, so our methods and results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this phenomenon. We also carry out pseudospectral direct numerical simulations of these PDEs in dimension $d=2$ through which we obtain Lyapunov spectra for representative parameter values. We show that our numerical results are consistent with the analytically derived rigorous bounds.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of passively moving rigid bodies in unsteady flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes the topology optimization method for moving rigid bodies subjected to forces from fluid flow, such as sails and turbines, with an unsteady time-dependent formulation. Unlike existing topology optimization frameworks in which rigid-body motion drives the flow, which is referred to as $\textit{active}$, the present study considers rigid-body motion induced by fluid forces, i.e., $\textit{passive}$. The equations of motion governing the rigid-body dynamics are solved in a coupled manner with the continuity equation and the momentum conservation equations. The rigid body is represented on a design grid that is separated from the analysis grid on which the state and adjoint fields are defined. After updating the rigid body motion, the body is mapped onto the analysis grid. The fluid equations are solved using the lattice kinetic scheme, an extended version of the lattice Boltzmann method, owing to its suitability for unsteady flows. Design sensitivities based on the adjoint variable method are presented and applied to two- and three-dimensional problems involving translational and rotational motions. The optimized shapes for each problem are discussed from a physical perspective and compared with a reference shape or their binarized counterparts, providing insights into the effectiveness of the proposed method as well as its limitations.</description>

      <title>Quantum-vortex-driven Kelvin wave in the thermal background of superfluid helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present numerical evidence that Kelvin waves (KWs) on quantized vortices in superfluid helium can be directly observed in the normal fluid component at finite temperatures. Using the Fully cOUpled loCAl model of sUperfLuid Turbulence (FOUCAULT) model, we analyze the propagation and temperature dependence of KWs by simultaneously measuring the dispersion of waves on the vortex displacement and the normal fluid velocity. The results demonstrate that the normal fluid supports a coherent KW-like response, with a dispersion relation matching that of the vortex filament (VF). Unlike the Schwarz model where there is almost no temperature dependence, in FOUCAULT KWs frequency and damping both depend on temperature, highlighting the role of mutual friction in mediating the coupling between the two fluids. These findings open a pathway for experimental observation of KWs in the normal phase using tracer based visualization.</description>

      <title>Seeing through water: diffuse image-based depth measurements in three-dimensional dam-break flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a dedicated experimental facility and an image-based method for measuring water depth in a radially spreading dam-break wave propagating over a horizontal plane. The facility consists of a prismatic reservoir containing a known volume of water dyed with a soluble colorant and equipped with a removable vertical breach whose geometry can be varied, and a 6.4 m x 3.4 m plane that can be inclined from 0{\deg} to 30{\deg}. The plane is enclosed within a light box providing highly uniform illumination through an array of 60 LED floodlights. Wave propagation is captured by two scientific CMOS cameras mounted on the ceiling of the light box, which record the spatial and temporal evolution of the dye-induced color intensity associated with the advancing water layer. Preliminary dry calibration tests were conducted to assess the spectral compatibility between the broadband white-LED emission, the CMOS sensor sensitivity, and the absorption properties of several dyes at different concentrations. This analysis identified the dye providing the highest attenuation within the effective spectral band of the imaging system, ensuring sensitivity to very small optical path lengths. Based on this characterization, a bi-exponential model is introduced to relate the normalized gray level to the optical path length. A series of dam-break experiments with five initial reservoir levels was performed to assess statistical repeatability. The high consistency observed across the repeated tests confirms the robustness of the measurement procedure. The validity of the reconstructed depth fields is further supported by independent estimates of the water volume released from the reservoir, obtained from an array of ultrasonic level sensors and from a calibrated analytical emptying model. Together, these comparisons confirm the reliability and accuracy of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Flash evaporation Riemann Problem: Formulation and its Exact Solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flash evaporation, a liquid-to-gas phase transition phenomenon in real fluids, is prevalent in aerospace propulsion systems. To elucidate the physical mechanisms of such complex flows and provide theoretical benchmarks for Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations, this paper formalizes the Flash evaporation Riemann problem (FeRP) characterized by the expansion branch crossing the saturation line, within the framework of Homogeneous Equilibrium and Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium assumptions. An exact solution framework that analytically resolves all thermodynamic derivatives of equilibrium two-phase fluids is established for arbitrary two-parameter equations of state. By evaluating the Landau fundamental derivative, the non-classical wave structures arising in the FeRP are analyzed, for which a stable iterative solution strategy incorporating the Chapman-Jouguet condition as an outer constraint is proposed. Furthermore, an exact solution for the FeRP based on Wood's mechanical equilibrium speed of sound is developed, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of its thermodynamic implications. Results indicate that Wood's model alters the definition of the two-phase mixture entropy in the Euler equations, introducing an isentropic path characterized by a "density lag" effect and non-physical entropy decrease. Comparative analysis of the FeRP under typical scramjet fuel injection conditions reveals that, although Wood's model captures the general trend of the Riemann solution curve, it significantly underestimates intermediate pressure, velocity, and the extent of vaporization relative to the complete equilibrium model.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Wall Boundary Modeling for Turbulent Flows Using the Lattice Boltzmann Method with Adaptive Cartesian Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an enhanced wall-boundary treatment for the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), designed for high-Reynolds-number turbulent flows on adaptively refined Cartesian grids. The method improves the slip-velocity bounce-back scheme by coupling it with a near-wall turbulence model based on an analytical wall function. The Spalart-Allmaras (negative) turbulence model is solved using a second-order finite-difference scheme and integrated within the LBM framework to statistically represent the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations (LBM-RANS). The approach is validated on two benchmark configurations: the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) 0012 airfoil and the McDonnell Douglas (MD)-30P30N multi-element high-lift configuration. LBM-RANS results show good agreement with conventional finite-volume RANS solutions and experimental data for key aerodynamic quantities, including pressure and skin-friction distributions, as well as turbulent boundary layer velocity profiles and eddy-viscosity fields. The method delivers smooth and accurate predictions of skin friction, which are often challenging for immersed-boundary approaches on Cartesian grids. The auxiliary geometric data required for enforcing the turbulent boundary condition are minimal, making the method potentially well-suited for graphics processing unit (GPU)-based implementations. Moreover, no ad-hoc near-wall treatments are needed, as the boundary condition is applied naturally via the link-wise bounce-back scheme. These results illustrate that the proposed LBM-RANS framework can robustly and accurately simulate high-Reynolds-number turbulent two-dimensional (2D) flows over complex aerodynamic geometries under equilibrium or near-equilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous epicuticular charging affects droplet dynamics on living leaves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How water droplets move and slide on leaves influences plant ecophysiological and abiotic interactions, as well as the design of advanced bio-inspired wetting materials. Despite cross-disciplinary relevance, current descriptions of the in situ dynamics of droplets on living leaves focus almost exclusively on surface structure and chemistry, treating the leaf as a static, electrically neutral substrate. Here, three decades after the mechanistic discovery of the Lotus effect, we show that a yet 'hidden' force due to instantaneous electrical phenomena affect the dynamic droplet motion on living leaves. Using high-speed motion tracking and precision charge measurements, we show that droplets sliding on the pristine epicuticular wax layer on superhydrophobic Colocasia esculenta leaves strongly charge affecting its dynamics, previously observed only on synthetic (highly electronegative fluorinated) surfaces. Droplets accumulate charges of Qp,D1 = -0.02 to -0.15 nC per 30 uL droplet on pristine leaves. However, we specifically demonstrate the crucial role of the epicuticular wax layer plasticity: by a structural modification that decreases its roughness amplitude, the same leaves gain an impressive 30-40 fold enhancement in charge transfer (reaching Qt,D1 = -2.8 to -5.2 nC) slowing the droplet by half due to an estimated electrostatic force of 11 uN dominating the resistive forces. The charge accumulation is surface-history-dependent and charge quantities per droplet are surprisingly similar or even exceeding those recently reported from artificial surfaces. Our findings prove that electrostatic charging is a fundamental component of droplet-leaf interactions, opening new research directions from charge-affected leaf ecology to sustainable materials for droplet-based energy harvesting by tuning surface treatments and, moreover,...</description>

      <title>N.E.O.N.-Bridge Geometry Determination: Turbulence Modeling of Individual N.E.O.N.-Bridge Segment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The N.E.O.N.-Bridge is a capstone project being developed by students at TAMUCC, under the oversight of Los Alamos National Laboratory. The project requires the development of a hull geometry for an autonomous bridge segment optimized to support onboard electronics and camera systems while maintaining stability in a dynamic water environment. Traditional ribbon bridge systems typically do not experience intense hydrodynamic loading due to current transportation and assembly methods, whereas the N.E.O.N-Bridge must continuously withstand forces from dynamic flow patterns. The requirement for a hull geometry to have both hydrodynamic design and rigidity, as in current ribbon bridges, has posed unique challenges. The current hull designs were evaluated through turbulent water-flow simulations performed with ANSYS Discovery. Boundary conditions were determined based on the forward motion of the bridge segment, simulating inlet and outlet flows, and the resulting pressure distribution. A waterline-based geometric constraint derived from the camera system's elevation enabled the simulation to model flow characteristics in an operational scenario. Velocity fields, pressure contours, and turbulent flow patterns were analyzed to identify areas of high loading and hydrodynamic inefficiencies. The findings will provide essential performance metrics that could be used to make design adjustments to the overall hull geometry. The simulation results will support improvements in stability, structural rigidity, and overall effectiveness of the hull geometry, advancing the development of the N.E.O.N-Bridge segments.</description>

      <title>Melting dynamics and mixing layer growth near the ice-ocean interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ice melting into saline water plays a fundamental role in the dynamics near the ice-ocean interface in polar oceans. The physics of ice melting involves a non-trivial interplay between thermodynamics at the interface, hydrodynamic transport in the bulk and the properties of the ambient ocean. The key control parameters are the density ratio $R_\rho$ proportional to the ambient ocean salinity and the Lewis number $Le = \kappa_T/\kappa_S$, which compares the thermal and salt diffusivities. Increasing the salinity is known to slow down melting, with the melt rate transitioning from subdiffusive to diffusive as $R_\rho$ increases. Here, we ssess the role of turbulence in this transition, using highly-resolved numerical simulations of the two-dimensional Boussinesq equations with a slowly melting upper boundary. We analyse the non-stationary growth of the temperature and meltwater mixing layers, varying the Lewis number and the density ratio. While meltwater is continuously entrained by convection inside the bulk, we identify a transition from convection to diffusion close to the interface. This transition is reflected by the formation of an interfacial boundary layer that regulates the flux of meltwater pouring into the turbulent bulk for $R_\rho \gtrsim 10$. Using mixing-layer diagnostics based on meltwater-concentration thresholds, we observe that the turbulent layer grows super-diffusively $\propto t^{1.33}$, while the interfacial boundary layer expands diffusively $\propto t^{0.5}$ but with a non-universal prefactor. These results indicate that double-diffusive effects are here confined to the interface, and highlight potential limitations of diagnostics based on fixed concentration thresholds in oceanographic applications.</description>

      <title>Frequency-domain general synthetic iterative scheme for efficient simulation of oscillatory rarefied gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillatory rarefied gas flows are frequently encountered in MEMS, and their efficient numerical simulation remains a major challenge due to the time dependent nature of the problem and the high dimensionality of the Boltzmann kinetic equation. Here, we address this challenge by focusing on the periodic steady state and solving the resulting problem using the frequency domain general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS). The key idea of GSIS is to simultaneously solve the mesoscopic kinetic equation and the macroscopic synthetic equation. The kinetic equation provides high-order constitutive relations, beyond those given by the Newton law of viscosity and the Fourier law of heat conduction, to the synthetic equation. In turn, the synthetic equation, which converges to the periodic steady state much faster than the kinetic equation, boosts the evolution of the kinetic equation toward the periodic steady state. As a result, super convergence is achieved, together with an asymptotic preserving property that allows the use of coarse spatial grids. The analytical Fourier stability analysis and the Chapman-Enskog expansion, together with challenging numerical simulations, are employed to demonstrate the fast convergence and asymptotic-preserving properties of GSIS, revealing that it can be three orders of magnitude faster than conventional kinetic schemes in near continuum flow regimes.</description>

Abstract: The decay of magnetically dominated turbulence exhibits robust inverse transfer of magnetic energy even in the absence of net magnetic helicity, challenging traditional cascade-based phenomenology. While recent studies suggest that magnetic reconnection governs the evolution of such systems, a comprehensive understanding has been lacking. Here we test a reconnection-mediated model for decaying magnetic turbulence in two-dimensional (strict-2D), 2.5D, and three-dimensional (3D) systems with both helical and nonhelical initial conditions. We show that the magnetic-energy decay timescale scales with the Lundquist number in a manner consistent with Sweet-Parker-type reconnection rather than Alfvenic or purely resistive timescales. We develop a broken power-law model for the magnetic energy spectra and provide analytic predictions for the temporal evolution of energy across both sub-inertial and inertial ranges, which are confirmed by high-resolution simulations. In nonhelical turbulence, these results favor anastrophy as the dominant constraint over helicity fluctuations. Using Minkowski functionals to analyze reconnecting current sheets in real space, we find that the structures controlling the decay are substantially smaller than the global magnetic correlation scale, implying local Lundquist numbers well below the system-scale value. This explains the weak sensitivity of global decay laws to current-sheet resolution and that the current-sheet aspect ratios converge toward Sweet-Parker predictions only at sufficiently high resolution. Together, these results establish magnetic reconnection as the organizing principle underlying inverse transfer, spectral evolution, and decay in magnetically dominated turbulence, providing a unified picture applicable across dimensionality and helicity regimes with direct implications for astrophysical plasmas.</description>

Abstract: For the water-air system, the bulk density ratio is as high as about 1000; no model can fully tackle such a high density ratio system. In the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations, the density $\rho$ within the water-air interface is assumed to be a constant based on the Boussinesq approximation namely $\rho (\mathrm{d} \mathbf u/\mathrm{d} t)$, which does not account for the true momentum evolution $\mathrm{d} (\rho \mathbf u)/\mathrm{d} t$ ($\mathbf u$-fluid velocity). Here, we present an alternative theory for the density evolution equations of immiscible fluids in computational fluid dynamics, differing from the concept of Navier-Stokes and Euler equations. Our derivation is built upon the physical principle of energy minimization from the aspect of thermodynamics. The present results provide a generalization of Bernoulli's principle for energy conservation and a general formulation for the sound speed. The present model can be applied for immiscible fluids with arbitrarily high density ratios, thereby, opening a new window for computational fluid dynamics both for compressible and incompressible fluids.</description>

      <title>Impact of boiling liquid droplets: Vapor entrapment suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There hardly is a fluid mechanics phenomenon attracting more attention than the impact of a droplet, due to its undeniable beauty, many applications and the numerous challenges it poses. One of the crucial factors turns out to be the cushioning effect of the gas surrounding the droplet. This fact, together with the observation that almost all of the relevant literature was done in air, triggers the question what would happen when the liquid was a boiling liquid, i.e., a liquid in thermal equilibrium with its own vapor, as is the case during transport of cryogenic liquids such as liquid hydrogen. To investigate precisely this question, we experimentally generate droplets in thermodynamical equilibrium with their own vapor, even before impact, such that minute energy exchanges of the droplet with its surroundings can trigger phase change. Using a frustrated total internal reflection (TIR) setup, we make the exciting observation that depending on the impact speed and vapor conditions, the entrapment of vapor can be completely suppressed under boiling liquid conditions. We create a simplified model based on scaling arguments and perform numerical simulations considering both the compressible and condensable properties of the vapor layer that are in very good agreement with our experimental findings. Our results can be of great consequence to the pressures exerted during droplet impact and on an industrial scale may help better understand the loads experienced during sloshing wave impact inside cryogenic liquid containers.</description>

      <title>Pressure shifts in pulsatile shear: A microfluidic method to probe the normal stress response of complex fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A microfluidic approach to probing the first normal stress difference from single-point pressure measurements in transient shear flows is presented. Using an original experimental design, we examine the near-zero-mean pulsatile flow of polymeric solutions in a straight microchannel at low Reynolds and Womersley numbers. An important aspect of this work is that the enhanced fluid elastic stresses can be efficiently determined via the pressure shift measured from pressure-controlled pulsatile shear experiments. We find a scaling law that collapses pressure-shift data from viscoelastic fluids of different molecular weights onto a single master curve that can then be used to predict this phenomenology. Taken together, these results could help shed light on our understanding of the non-linear normal stress responses in time-dependent flows.</description>

      <title>Geometric Solution of Turbulence as Diffusion in Loop Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly nonlinear dynamics, from fluid turbulence to quantum chromodynamics, have long constituted some of the most challenging problems in theoretical physics. This review describes a unified theoretical framework, the loop space calculus, which offers an analytical approach to these problems. The central idea is a shift in perspective from pointwise fields to integrated loop observables, a transformation that recasts the governing nonlinear equations into a universal linear diffusion equation in the space of loops. This framework, supported by recent mathematical analysis, is analytically solvable and yields an exact, parameter-free solution for decaying hydrodynamic turbulence -- the Euler ensemble -- which is shown to be dual to a solvable string theory. The theory's predictions include: (i) the unification of spatial and temporal scaling laws, governed by two related, infinite spectra of intermittency and decay exponents derived from the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function; (ii) a first-order phase transition in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence; and (iii) the formation of quantized, concentric shells in passive scalar mixing. The theory also predicts log-periodic oscillations in correlation functions -- effects not captured by standard phenomenology -- for which there is now emerging evidence from high-precision turbulence experiments. The appearance of identical mathematical structures as solutions to the turbulent regime of Yang-Mills gradient flow points to the broad applicability of this approach. The framework also yields a new type of analytic Hodge-dual matrix surface that solves the Yang-Mills fixed-point loop equation by harmonic map, opening the way for a geometric formulation of QCD string theory.</description>

      <title>Numerical Methods for a 2D "Bad" Boussinesq Equation: RK4, Strang Splitting, and High-frequency Fourier Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical methods for a two-dimensional ``bad'' Boussinesq equation: $u_{tt} = u_{xx} + u_{xxxx} + u_{yy} - 3 (u^{2})_{xx}$ are presented with good accuracy. The methods mainly depend on pseudo-spectral Fourier with a trimming of carefully chosen high-frequency Fourier modes. One method also relies on Runge-Kutta fourth order (RK4), and another method relies on Strang operator splitting. Before implementing the two methods, we analyze using Fourier series the linearized version of the equation by removing the nonlinear term $3(u^{2})_{xx}$, and found that a particular bound or condition needs to be satisfied to avoid blow-up solution. We found that high-frequency Fourier modes that do not satisfy the condition must be excluded from the Fourier solution. We then apply this condition to the numerical methods for solving the nonlinear Boussinesq equation and found that including only the Fourier modes that satisfy the condition gives stable numerical solution with good accuracy up to $t=100$. Including even just a few number of Fourier modes that violate the condition can result in a blow-up solution as early as $t=23.5$. The accuracy of the method is measured by computing the $L^{\infty}$ error against a soliton exact solution. The errors resulting from RK4 and Strang splitting numerical simulations differ slightly for small $\triangle t$, while there is a noticeable decrease in performance for the Strang splitting simulation as $\triangle t$ increases. Using our numerical methods, we also display a simulation with Dirichlet boundary condition to account for wave reflections.</description>

      <title>A gauge identity for interscale transfer in inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In inhomogeneous turbulence, local interscale energy transfer is commonly diagnosed in Large Eddy Simulation (LES) using the subgrid-scale (SGS) production $\Pi^{\mathrm{SGS}}=-\tau_{ij}\bar{S}_{ij}$, although its physical meaning is unclear near boundaries. An exact gauge identity is derived showing that $\Pi^{\mathrm{SGS}}=\Pi^{\mathrm{inc}}+\nabla\!\cdot\!\boldsymbol{J}$, where $\Pi^{\mathrm{inc}}$ is a kernel-integrated increment-based transfer consistent with K\'arm\'an--Howarth--Monin--Hill formulations and $\boldsymbol{J}$ is a spatial transport current. The identity is verified using the exact Womersley solution and evaluated with DNS of turbulent channel flow. It is found that near walls $\nabla\!\cdot\!\boldsymbol{J}$ can dominate $\Pi^{\mathrm{SGS}}$, implying that SGS production is not a unique proxy for local cascade in inhomogeneous LES diagnostics.</description>

Abstract: The General Lagrangian Mean (GLM) theory uses a version of the averaged equations of fluid dynamics, designed to examine interactions between small-amplitude waves and mean flows. These equations are formulated in coordinates following the fluid's average velocity and are often referred to as `pseudo-Lagrangian'. This paper focuses on the principles for deriving the GLM equations, using an inviscid, incompressible, homogeneous fluid as a demonstration case. Our exposition methodically differs from others and is aimed at the learners of this theory.</description>

      <title>Libby-Fox perturbations and the analytic adjoint solution for laminar viscous flow along a flat plate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of the solution to the adjoint two-dimensional boundary layer equations on a flat plate are investigated from the viewpoint of Libby-Fox theory that describes the algebraic perturbations to the Blasius boundary layer. The adjoint solution is obtained from the Green's function of the perturbation equation as a sum over the infinite perturbation modes of the Blasius solution. The analysis of the solution allows us to obtain constraints on the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. The extension of the analysis to the case with non-zero pressure gradient, corresponding to the Falkner-Skan solution, is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Low regularity ill-posedness and shock formation for 3D ideal compressible MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) significantly boosts the understanding and development of solar physics, planetary dynamics and controlled nuclear fusion. Dynamical properties of the MHD system involve nonlinear interactions of waves with multiple travelling speeds (the fast and slow magnetosonic waves, the Alfv\'{e}n wave and the entropy wave). One intriguing topic is the shock phenomena accompanied by the magnetic field, which have been affirmed by astronomical observations. However, permitting the residence of all above multi-speed waves, mathematically, whether one can prove shock formation for three dimensional (3D) MHD is still open. The multiple-speed nature of the MHD system makes it fascinating and challenging. In this paper, we report our recent progress in answering the above question. For 3D ideal compressible MHD, we construct planar symmetric examples of shock formation allowing the presence of all characteristic waves with multiple wave speeds. This also answers a question raised by Majda on conservation law in 1984. Building on our construction, we further prove that the Cauchy problem for 3D ideal MHD is $H^2$ ill-posed. And this is caused by the shock formation. In particular, when the magnetic field is absent, we also provide a desired low-regularity ill-posedness result for the 3D compressible Euler equations, and it is sharp with respect to the regularity of the fluid velocity. Our proof for 3D MHD is based on a coalition of a carefully designed algebraic approach and a geometric approach. To trace the nonlinear interactions of various waves, we algebraically decompose the 3D ideal MHD equations into a $7\times 7$ non-strictly hyperbolic system. Via detailed calculations, we reveal its hidden subtle structures. With them we give a complete description of MHD dynamics up to the earliest singular event, when a shock forms.</description>

Abstract: In a fractional Sobolev space $H^s(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with $s\leq\frac74$, we prove the low-regularity ill-posedness for the 2D compressible Euler equations and the 2D ideal compressible MHD system. Our ill-posedness results match the $H^\frac74$ regularity threshold for the 2D compressible Euler system with respect to the fluid velocity and density.</description>

Abstract: Within the Large Eddy Simulation framework, we propose a methodology based on the Lie theory to derive symmetry-preserving turbulence models. We apply this methodology to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.} These models explicitly depend on both the filtered strain-rate tensor and the filtered vorticity tensor. Particular emphasis is placed on models that additionally ensure stability.</description>
