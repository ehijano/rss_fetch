      <title>Survey of Non-thermal Electron around Supermassive Black Holes through Polarization Flips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically thick non-thermal synchrotron sources notably produce linear polarization vectors being parallel to projected magnetic field lines on the observer's screen, although they are perpendicular in well-known optically thin cases. To elucidate the complex relationship between the vectors and fields and to investigate the energy and spatial distribution of non-thermal electrons through the images, we perform polarization radiative transfer calculations at submillimeter wavelengths. Here the calculations are based on semi-analytic force-free jet models with non-thermal electrons with a power-law energy distribution. In calculated images, we find a $90^\circ$-flip of linear polarization (LP) vectors at the base of counter-side (receding) jet near a black hole, which occurs because of large optical depths for synchrotron self-absorption effect. The $90^\circ$-flip of LP vectors is also seen on the photon ring at a high frequency, since the optical depth along the rays is large there due to the light bending effect. In addition, we see the flip of the sign of circular polarization (CP) components on the counter jet and photon ring. Furthermore, we show that these polarization flips are synthesized with large values in the spectral index map, and also give rise to outstanding features in the Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) map. Since the conditions of flipping depend on the magnetic field strength and configuration and the energy distribution of electrons, we can expect that the polarization flips will provide us with an observational evidence for the presence of non-thermal electrons around the black hole, and a clue to the magnetically driving mechanism of plasma jets.</description>

      <title>Next Generation Accretion Disk Reflection Model: High-Density Plasma Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Luminous accretion disks around black holes are expected to have densities of $\sim 10^{15-22}\,$cm$^{-3}$, which are high enough such that plasma physics effects become important. Many of these effects have been traditionally neglected in the calculation of atomic parameters, and therefore from photoionization models, and ultimately also from X-ray reflection models. In this paper, we describe updates to the atomic rates used by the XSTAR code, which is in turn part of the XILLVER disk reflection model. We discuss the effect of adding necessary high density corrections into the XILLVER code. Specifically, we find that the change of recombination rates play an important role, dominating the differences between model versions. With synthetic spectra, we show that even in a highly ionized state, high density slabs can produce strong iron ($\sim$6.5-9$\,$keV) and oxygen ($\sim0.6-0.8\,$keV) resonance features. The significant iron emission could address the problem of the supersolar iron abundances found in some sources.</description>

      <title>Tuning a PTA in the detection era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) transition into the detection era of the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB), it is important for PTA collaborations to review, and possibly revise, their observing campaigns. The source of the GWB is unknown, and it may take years to pin down its nature. An astrophysical ensemble of supermassive binary black holes is one very likely source for the GWB. Evidence for such a background should come in the form of detectable anisotropies in the GWB and resolvable binary signals. A ``single source'' would be a boon for gravitational astrophysics, as such a source would emit gravitational waves for millions of years in the PTA frequency band. Earlier studies have shown that the observational strategies for finding single sources are somewhat different than for finding the statistical correlations needed for the detection of a stochastic background. Here we present generic methods for studying the effects of various observational strategies, taking advantage of detector sensitivity curves, i.e., noise-averaged, frequency-domain detection statistics. The statistical basis for these methods is presented along with myriad examples of how to tune a detector towards single, deterministic signals or a stochastic background. The importance of the uncorrelated half of the GWB, i.e. the pulsar-term, will be discussed as one of the most important sources of noise in the observational era of PTAs.</description>

      <title>Dark energy effects on surface gravitational redshift and Keplerian frequency of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research of the properties of neutron stars with dark energy is a particularly interesting yet unresolved problem in astrophysics. We analyze the influence of dark energy on the equation of state, the maximum mass, the surface gravitational redshift, and the Keplerian frequency for the traditional neutron star and the hyperon star matter within the relativistic mean field theory, using the GM1 and TM1 parameter sets by considering the two flavor symmetries of SU(6) and SU(3) combined with the observations of PSR J1614-2230, PSR J0348+0432, PSR J0030+0451, RX J0720.4-3125, and 1E 1207.4-5209. It is found that the existence of dark energy leads to the softened equations of state of the traditional neutron star and the hyperon star. The radius of a fixed-mass traditional neutron star (or hyperon star) with dark energy becomes smaller, which leads to increased compactness. The existence of dark energy can also enhance the surface gravitational redshift and the Keplerian frequency of the traditional neutron stars and the hyperon stars. The growth of the Keplerian frequency may cause speeding up of the spin rate, which may provide a possible way to understand and explain the pulsar glitch phenomenon. Specifically, we infer that the mass and the surface gravitational redshift of PSR J1748-2446ad without dark energy for the GM1 (TM1) parameter set are 1.141 $M_\odot$ (1.309 $M_\odot$) and 0.095 (0.105), respectively. The corresponding values for the GM1 (TM1) parameter set are 0.901 $M_\odot$ (1.072 $M_\odot$) and 0.079 (0.091) if PSR J1748-2446ad contains dark energy with $\alpha=0.05$. PSR J1748-2446ad may be a low-mass pulsar with a lower surface gravitational redshift under our selected models.</description>

      <title>Repeated partial disruptions in a WD-NS or WD-BH merger modulate the prompt emission of long-duration merger-type GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00472v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have long been an unresolved issue. GRB 230307A stands out as an exceptionally bright event, belonging to the long-duration GRBs but also exhibiting a late emission component reminiscent of a kilonova. Together with the similar events GRBs 060614 and 211211A, they make up a new sub-group of GRBs with intriguing progenitors. If such long-duration merger-type GRBs originated from the coalescence of a white dwarf (WD) with a neutron star (NS) or a black hole (BH), as proposed in the recent literature, then the larger tidal disruption radius of the WD, together with a non-negligible residual orbital eccentricity, would make repeated partial tidal disruptions inevitable. This may modulate the mass accretion and jet launching process at the NS or BH, resulting in a quasi-periodic modulation (QPM) in the light curve of the GRB, on the orbital period. The detection of potential QPMs during the early episode of prompt emission of these three GRBs supports this scenario, and the relatively slow QPM ($&gt;$ 1 s) suggests that the lighter object can not be a NS. We propose that the progenitor system of GRBs 230307A, 060614, and 211211A consist of a WD of mass 1.3 $M_\odot$, 0.9 $M_\odot$ and 1.4 $M_\odot$, respectively, and a NS (or BH). After several cycles of modulations, the WD is completely destructed, and the accretion of the remaining debris dominates the extended emission episode.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of LHAASO PeVatrons by Interstellar Radiation Field and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "PeVatrons" refer to astrophysical sources capable of accelerating particles to energies around $10^{15}$ electron volts and higher, potentially contributing to the cosmic ray spectrum in the knee region. Recently, LHAASO has discovered a large number of PeVatrons, allowing us to investigate in greater depth the contributions of these sources to cosmic rays above the knee region. However, high-energy gamma rays undergo attenuation due to interactions with the interstellar radiation field and cosmic microwave background radiation, requiring corrections to restore the true spectral characteristics at the source. In this study, using interstellar radiation field model extracted from galprop code, we quantitatively calculated the spectral absorption effects of sources listed in the first LHAASO source catalog, with some sources showing absorption reaching 30\% at 100 TeV and 80\% at 3 PeV. We also calculated the high energy gamma ray absorption effects of Galactic microquasars, which are potential PeVatrons. By calculating the absorption effects, it will help differentiate the radiation mechanisms of the acceleration sources.</description>

      <title>Imaging the black hole shadow and extended jet of M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galaxy M87 is one of the prime targets for high resolution radio imaging pursuing the ringlike shadow of its supermassive black hole, the innermost regions of accretion flow, and the formation of the relativistic jet. However, it remains challenging to observe both jointly. Only recently, global mm-VLBI array (GMVA)+ALMA observations at 86 GHz in 2018 were able to reconstruct the M87 black hole shadow and the extended jet emission simultaneously. In order to analyze the ring and jet of M87, conventional CLEAN algorithms were mainly employed alongside the RML method SMILI in the previous work. To test the robustness of the reconstructed structures of M87 GMVA+ALMA observations at 86GHz, we estimate the ring diameter, width, and the extended jet emission with the possible central spine by two different novel imaging algorithms: resolve and DoG-HiT. Overall reconstructions are consistent with the results reported in the previous paper. The ring structure of the M87 is resolved at higher resolution and the posterior distribution of M87 ring features is explored. The resolve images show that the ring diameter is 60.9 +- 2.2 muas and width is 16.0 +- 0.9 muas. The ring diameter is 61.0 muas and width is 20.6 muas by DoG-HiT. The ring diameter is therefore in agreement with the estimation (64+4-8 muas) by SMILI and the geometrical modeling. Two bright spots in the ring are reconstructed by four independent imaging methods, the substructure in the ring is therefore most likely originated from the data. A consistent limb-brightened jet structure is reconstructed by resolve and DoG-HiT, albeit with a less pronounced central spine. Modern data-driven imaging methods confirm the ring and jet structure in M87, complementing traditional VLBI methods with novel perspectives on the significance of recovered features. They confirm the result of the previous report.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray halos around pulsars: impact on pulsar wind physics and galactic cosmic ray transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TeV haloes are a recently discovered class of very high energy gamma-ray emitters. These sources consist of extended regions of multi-TeV emission, originally observed around the two well-known and nearby pulsars, Geminga and PSR B0656+14 (Monogem), and possibly, with different degrees of confidence, around few more objects with similar age. Since their discovery, TeV haloes have raised much interest in a large part of the scientific community, for the implications their presence can have on a broad range of topics spanning from pulsar physics to cosmic ray physics and dark matter indirect searches. In this article, we review the reasons of interest for TeV haloes and the current status of observations. We discuss the proposed theoretical models and their implications, and conclude with an overlook on the prospects for better understanding this phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next-generation neutrino telescope IceCube-Gen2 is planned to include a surface detector array consisting of scintillation detectors and radio antennas for the detection of cosmic-ray air showers. Prototype stations, each comprising 8 scintillator panels and 3 SKALA antennas, have been deployed to various locations. One of these stations is located at the site of the Pierre Auger Observatory, situated within the most densely instrumented part of the surface detector array, which features a spacing of 433 meters. In this contribution, we present first results from this prototype station, including the observation of the Galactic noise, and the first coincident detection of air showers between the prototype radio antennas and the water-Cherenkov detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory.</description>

      <title>Probing the propeller regime with wide neutron star binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the duration of the propeller stage in wide binary systems with neutron stars and calculate the time of accretion onset for various propeller models. We apply our modeling to the symbiotic X-ray binary SWIFT J0850.8-4219. Unless a propeller with a very slow spin-down is operating, it is very improbable to find a system similar to SWIFT J0850.8-4219 at the propeller stage. Then we model the evolution of a neutron star in a binary with a solar-like companion. We calculate for which orbital separations and magnetic fields a neutron star can start to accrete while the companion is still on the Main sequence. We demonstrate that for the magnetic field $B\lesssim10^{12}$~G neutron stars at the orbital separation $a\gtrsim 1$~AU do not reach the propeller stage. In the case of a slow propeller spin-down, neutron stars never start to accrete. For the more rapid propeller spin-down, a neutron star can start to accrete or spend a long time at the propeller stage depending on the parameters.</description>

      <title>Search for UHE neutrinos in the background of cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main challenge in detecting ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrinos is discriminating a neutrino-induced shower in the background of showers initiated by ultra-high energy nuclei. The resulting shower development from neutrinos exhibits different characteristics from hadron-induced showers because neutrinos penetrate the atmosphere more deeply than hadrons.
  This study focuses on simulations of highly inclined neutrino-induced showers above $75^\circ$ zenith angles, exploring an extensive energy range from $1 \text{EeV}$ to $120 \text{EeV}$. These simulated showers have different ranges of interaction depths corresponding to each zenith angle, presenting diverse detection challenges.
  Our methodology utilises timing data from radio antennas for the shower front calculation for extensive air showers induced by neutrinos and nuclei. Furthermore, we incorporate signals obtained from Water Cherenkov detectors and the spatial distribution of stations registering signals in both Water Cherenkov detectors and radio antennas. We aim to classify neutrino-induced showers and background events stemming from nuclei by harnessing a decision tree classifier employing the Gini impurity method. Our framework yields excellent accuracy for separating the neutrinos from the background.
  The findings of this study offer significant advancements in the domain of UHE neutrino detection, shedding light on astrophysical phenomena associated with these elusive particles amidst the complex background of UHE nuclei.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity and thermal Hall effect in dense electron-ion plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine thermal conductivity and the thermal Hall effect in electron-ion plasmas relevant to hot neutron stars, white dwarfs, and binary neutron star mergers, focusing on densities found in the outer crusts of neutron stars and the interiors of white dwarfs. We consider plasma consisting of single species of ions, which could be either iron $\isotope[56]{Fe}$, carbon $\isotope[12]{C}$, helium $\isotope[4]{He}$, or hydrogen $\isotope[1]{H}$ nuclei. The temperature range explored is from the melting temperature of the solid $T\sim10^9$~K up to $10^{11}$~K. This covers both degenerate and non-degenerate electron regimes. We find that thermal conductivity increases with density and temperature for which we provide analytical scaling relations valid in different regimes. The impact of magnetic fields on thermal conductivity is also analyzed, showing anisotropy in low-density regions and the presence of the thermal Hall effect characterized by Leduc-Righi coefficient. The transition from degenerate to non-degenerate regime is characterized by a minimum ratio of thermal conductivity to temperature, which is analogous to the minimum observed already in the case of electrical conductivity.</description>

      <title>SN 2021foa: The "Flip-Flop" Type IIn / Ibn supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN~2021foa, unique among the class of transitional supernovae for repeatedly changing its spectroscopic appearance from hydrogen-to-helium-to-hydrogen-dominated (IIn-to-Ibn-to-IIn) within 50 days past peak brightness. The spectra exhibit multiple narrow ($\approx$ 300--600~km~s$^{-1}$) absorption lines of hydrogen, helium, calcium and iron together with broad helium emission lines with a full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of $\sim 6000$~km~s$^{-1}$. For a steady, wind-mass loss regime, light curve modeling results in an ejecta mass of $\sim 8$ M$_{\odot}$ and CSM mass below 1 M$_{\odot}$, and an ejecta velocity consistent with the FWHM of the broad helium lines. We obtain a mass-loss rate of $\approx 2$ M$_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1}$. This mass-loss rate is three orders of magnitude larger than derived for normal Type II SNe. We estimate that the bulk of the CSM of SN~2021foa must have been expelled within half a year, about 15 years ago. Our analysis suggests that SN~2021foa had a helium rich ejecta which swept up a dense shell of hydrogen rich CSM shortly after explosion. At about 60 days past peak brightness, the photosphere recedes through the dense ejecta-CSM region, occulting much of the red-shifted emission of the hydrogen and helium lines, which results in observed blue-shift ($\sim -3000$~km~s$^{-1}$). Strong mass loss activity prior to explosion, such as those seen in SN~2009ip-like objects and SN~2021foa as precursor emission, are the likely origin of a complex, multiple-shell CSM close to the progenitor star.</description>

      <title>Exploring the high-density reflection model for the soft excess in RBS 1124</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 'Bare' active galactic nuclei (AGN) are a subclass of Type 1 AGN that show little or no intrinsic absorption. They offer an unobscured view of the central regions of the AGN and therefore serve as ideal targets to study the relativistic reflection features originating from the innermost regions of the accretion disc. We present a detailed broadband spectral analysis ($0.3 - 70$ keV) of one of the most luminous bare AGN in the local universe, RBS 1124 ($z= 0.208$) using a new, co-ordinated high signal-to-noise observation obtained by $\textit{XMM-Newton}$ and $\textit{NuSTAR}$. The source exhibits a power-law continuum with $\Gamma \sim$ 1.8 along with a soft excess below 2 keV, a weak neutral iron line and curvature at high energies ($\sim 30$ keV). The broadband spectrum, including the soft excess and the high-energy continuum, is well fit by the relativistic reflection model when the accretion disc is allowed to have densities of log$(n_{\rm e}$/cm$^{-3}$) $\gtrsim 19.2$. Our analysis therefore suggests that when high-density effects are considered, relativistic reflection remains a viable explanation for the soft excess.</description>

      <title>Dipolar Fluence distribution of statistically isotropic FERMI Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the large-angle distribution of the gamma-ray bursts (GRB) from the updated FERMI/GBM catalogue, to probe the statistical isotropy of these astrophysical transient events. We also study the angular distribution of the GRB fluence, as a way to explore if this radiative feature shows some preferred direction on the sky that can suggest their origin. Our model-independent approach performs a directional analysis of the updated FERMI/GBM catalogue. The statistical significance of our results is obtained by comparison with a large set of statistically isotropic samples of cosmic objects, with the same features of the FERMI data. Our analyses confirm that the angular distribution of the FERMIGRB is statistically isotropic on the celestial sphere. Moreover, analysing the directional distribution of the FERMIGRB fluence, that is, the median GRB fluence in a set of directions that scans the celestial sphere, we found that this astrophysical property exhibits a net dipolar structure with a directional preference for latitudes near the galactic plane. However, additional studies show that this directional preference, indeed, is not correlated with the Milky Way galactic plane, suggesting that the GRB, and its fluence dipolar structure, are extra-galactic in origin. Interestingly, the analyses of the BATSE Channel 4 fluence data, that is, those GRB from BATSE with energy $&gt;$ 300 keV, reveal that its dipole direction is very well aligned with the cosmic microwave background dipole.</description>

      <title>New results on the gamma-ray burst variability-luminosity relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01644v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the dawn of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow era, a Cepheid-like correlation was discovered between time variability V and isotropic-equivalent peak luminosity Liso of the prompt emission of about a dozen long GRBs with measured redshift available at that time. Soon afterwards, the correlation was confirmed against a sample of about 30 GRBs, despite being affected by significant scatter. Unlike the minimum variability timescale (MVT), V measures the relative power of short-to-intermediate timescales. We aim to test the correlation using about two hundred long GRBs with spectroscopically measured redshift, detected by Swift, Fermi, and Konus/WIND, for which both observables can be accurately estimated. For all the selected GRBs, variability was calculated according to the original definition using the 64-ms background-subtracted light curves of Swift/BAT (Fermi/GBM) in the 15-150 (8-900) keV energy passband. Peak luminosities were either taken from literature or derived from modelling broad-band spectra acquired with either Konus/WIND or Fermi/GBM. The statistical significance of the correlation has weakened to &lt;~2%, mostly due to the appearance of a number of smooth and luminous GRBs characterised by a relatively small V. At odds with most long GRBs, 3 out of 4 long-duration merger candidates have high V and low Liso. Luminosity is more tightly connected with shortest timescales measured by MVT rather than short-to-intermediate ones, measured by V. We discuss the implications on internal dissipation models and the role of the e+- photosphere. We identified a few, smooth GRBs with a single broad pulse and low V, that might have an external shock origin, in contrast with most GRBs. The combination of high variability (V&gt;~0.1), low luminosity (Liso&lt;~10^51 erg s^-1) and short MVT (&lt;~ 0.1 s) could be a good indicator for a compact binary merger origin.</description>

      <title>Constraining anisotropic diffusion between Geminga and Earth with the cosmic-ray electron and positron spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gamma-ray halo surrounding Geminga suggests a notable reduction in cosmic-ray diffusion. One potential explanation for this phenomenon is the projection effect of slow diffusion perpendicular to the average magnetic field (represented by the diffusion coefficient $D_\perp$) within an anisotropic diffusion framework. In this context, the diffusion coefficient parallel to the mean field ($D_\parallel$) may remain substantial, allowing electrons and positrons ($e^\pm$) generated by Geminga to effectively propagate towards Earth along magnetic field lines, potentially leading to an observable $e^\pm$ flux. This study initially establishes the fundamental parameters of the anisotropic model based on the morphology and spectral observations of the Geminga halo, and subsequently forecasts the $e^\pm$ flux generated by Geminga at Earth's location. Our findings indicate that the $e^-+e^+$ spectrum obtained by DAMPE can provide critical constraints on the anisotropic diffusion model: to ensure that the projected spectrum does not surpass the observational data, the Alfv\'en Mach number of the turbulent magnetic field ($M_A$) should not fall below 0.75, corresponding to $D_\parallel/D_\perp\lesssim3$ given $D_\perp=D_\parallel M_A^4$. This suggests that a substantial reduction in $D_\parallel$ relative to the Galactic average may still be necessary. Additionally, our analysis reveals that within the anisotropic diffusion framework, Geminga could generate a distinct peak around 1 TeV in the $e^-+e^+$ spectrum, potentially accounting for the anomalous 1.4 TeV excess tentatively detected by DAMPE.</description>

      <title>Wind from cold accretion flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the physical mechanisms of launching and acceleration of wind from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) accretion disk. We focus on the radiation line force driven and magnetic driven wind models, which operate on the accretion disk scale. We review the investigation histories of the two mechanisms and the most new results obtained recently. The ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) found in the hard X-ray bands are believed to directly originate from AGN accretion disks. We review the theoretical works applying the two mechanisms of wind to explain the UFOs. We briefly introduce the propagation of winds on a large scale which is important for AGN wind feedback study. Finally, the roles of wind in AGN feedback are briefly reviewed.</description>

      <title>Recent cosmogenic neutrino search results with IceCube and prospects with IceCube-Gen2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos with energies beyond PeV (extremely high energy, EHE) are produced in interaction of the highest energy cosmic rays. One contribution to the EHE neutrino flux is expected to arise from so-called cosmogenic neutrinos generated in ultra high energy cosmic ray interactions with cosmic microwave background photons. Observation of cosmogenic neutrinos can probe the nature of cosmic rays beyond the energies for resonant photo-pion production (GZK cutoff). The IceCube detector instruments a cubic kilometer of the South Pole ice to detect Cherenkov light emitted by charged particles produced in neutrino interactions. In the future IceCube-Gen2 will increase the effective detection volume for EHE neutrinos by adding radio antennas to the in-ice detector. In this contribution we present new constraints on the EHE neutrino flux above $5 \times 10^6$ GeV using 12.6 years of IceCube data. The differential upper limit constrains the all-flavor EHE neutrino flux at 1 EeV to below a level of $E^2 \Phi \sim 10^{-8} \, \mathrm{GeV} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{sr}^{-1}$. Additionally, we also describe the projected sensitivity of the IceCube-Gen2 radio array, which will reach fluxes about 1.5 orders of magnitude smaller than the current limits at 1 EeV.</description>

      <title>The breaking of $f-$mode universal relation in proto-neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proto-neutron stars have both high-density and relatively high-temperature in them. This study analyses how the equation of state changes with temperature, which is relevant for proto-neutron stars. We determine an equation of state for the proto-neutron stars in the relativistic mean field model in which the coupling parameters are density-dependent. The equation of state considerably affects the mass-radius curve, thereby affecting the f-mode oscillation frequency. Temperature makes the equation of state stiffer at relatively low and intermediate densities, thereby making the star less compact and the mass-radius curve flatter. The f-mode frequency for low and intermediate-mass neutron stars decreases with temperature and thus should be easier to detect. The universal relation (connecting f-mode frequency, mass and radius) changes non-linearly with temperature. The parameters defining the universal relation ($\omega M = a(T) \left(\frac{M}{R}\right) + b(T)$) becomes temperature dependent with the coefficients following a parabolic relation with temperature.</description>

      <title>Fragments of harmony amid apparent chaos: a closer look at the X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions of the galaxy RX J1301.9+2747</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are an extreme X-ray variability phenomenon associated with low-mass supermassive black holes. First discovered in the nucleus of the galaxy GSN 069, they have been so far securely detected in five other galaxies, including RX J1301.9+2747. When detected, the out-of-QPE emission (quiescence) is consistent with the high-energy tail of thermal emission from an accretion disk. We present the X-ray and radio properties of RX J1301.9+2747, both in quiescence and during QPEs. We analyse X-ray data taken during five XMM-Newton observations between 2000 and 2022. The last three observations were taken in coordination with radio observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. We also make use of EXOSAT, ROSAT, and Chandra archival observations taken between 1983 and 2009. XMM-Newton detected 34 QPEs of which 8 have significantly lower amplitudes than the others. No correlated radio/X-ray variability was observed during QPEs. In terms of timing properties, the QPEs in RX J1301.9+2747 do not exhibit the striking regularity observed in the discovery source GSN 069. In fact there is no clear repetition pattern between QPEs: the average time separation between their peaks is about four hours, but it can be as short as one, and as long as six hours. The QPE spectral properties of RX J1301.9+2747 as a function of energy are however very similar to those of GSN 069 and of other QPE sources. The quiescent emission of RX J1301.9+2747 is more complex than that of GSN 069, as it requires a soft X-ray excess-like component in addition to the thermal emission from the accretion disk. Its long-term X-ray quiescent flux variations are of low-amplitude and not strictly monotonic, with a general decay over $\sim 22$ years. We discuss our observational results in terms of some of the ideas and models that have been proposed so far for the physical origin of QPEs.</description>

      <title>Nucleosynthesis contribution of neutrino-dominated accretion flows to the solar neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elemental abundances of stars reflect the complex enrichment history of the galaxy. To explore and explain the metal enrichment history of the cosmic environment near our solar system, we study the evolution of $^{56} \mathrm{Fe}$ abundance over time and [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] evolution in the solar neighborhood. Core-collapse supernovae make the dominant contribution in the early stages, while Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have a delayed and dominant impact in the later stages. In this work, we consider the nucleosynthesis contribution of neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs) formed at the end of the lives of massive stars. The results show that the [Fe/H] gradually increases over time and eventually reaches $\rm [Fe/H]=0$ and above, reproducing the chemical enrichment process in the solar neighborhood. Before the onset of SNe Ia, the ratio of $^{56} \mathrm{Fe}$ mass to the total gas mass increases by a factor of at most $\sim 1.44$ when NDAFs are taken into account. We find that by including NDAF in our models, the agreement with the observed metallicity distribution of metal-poor stars in the solar neighborhood ($\rm &lt; 1~kpc$) is improved, while not significantly altering the location of the metallicity peak. This inclusion can also reproduce the observed evolutionary change of [Mg/Fe] at [Fe/H] $\sim -1.22$, bringing the ratio to match the solar abundance. Our results provide an extensive understanding of metallicity evolution in the solar environments by highlighting the nucleosynthesis contribution of NDAF outflows in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>A cosmic formation site of silicon and sulphur revealed by a new type of supernova explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cores of stars are the cosmic furnaces where light elements are fused into heavier nuclei. The fusion of hydrogen to helium initially powers all stars. The ashes of the fusion reactions are then predicted to serve as fuel in a series of stages, eventually transforming massive stars into a structure of concentric shells. These are composed of natal hydrogen on the outside, and consecutively heavier compositions inside, predicted to be dominated by helium, carbon/oxygen, oxygen/neon/magnesium, and oxygen/silicon/sulphur. Silicon and sulphur are fused into inert iron, leading to the collapse of the core and either a supernova explosion or the direct formation of a black hole. Stripped stars, where the outer hydrogen layer has been removed and the internal He-rich layer (in Wolf-Rayet WN stars) or even the C/O layer below it (in Wolf-Rayet WC/WO stars) are exposed, provide evidence for this shell structure, and the cosmic element production mechanism it reflects. The types of supernova explosions that arise from stripped stars embedded in shells of circumstellar material (most notably Type Ibn supernovae from stars with outer He layers, and Type Icn supernovae from stars with outer C/O layers) confirm this scenario. However, direct evidence for the most interior shells, which are responsible for the production of elements heavier than oxygen, is lacking. Here, we report the discovery of the first-of-its-kind supernova arising from a star peculiarly stripped all the way to the silicon and sulphur-rich internal layer. Whereas the concentric shell structure of massive stars is not under debate, it is the first time that such a thick, massive silicon and sulphur-rich shell, expelled by the progenitor shortly before the SN explosion, has been directly revealed.</description>

      <title>X-ray and optical observations of the millisecond pulsar binary PSRJ1431-4715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first X-ray observation of the energetic millisecond pulsar binary PSR J1431-4715, performed with XMM-Newton and complemented with fast optical multi-band photometry acquired with the ULTRACAM instrument at ESO-NTT. It is found as a faint X-ray source without a significant orbital modulation. This contrasts with the majority of systems that instead display substantial X- ray orbital variability. The X-ray spectrum is dominated by non-thermal emission and, due to the lack of orbital modulation, does not favour an origin in an intrabinary shock between the pulsar and companion star wind. While thermal emission from the neutron star polar cap cannot be excluded in the soft X-rays, the dominance of synchrotron emission favours an origin in the pulsar magnetosphere that we describe at both X-ray and gamma-ray energies with a synchro-curvature model. The optical multi-colour light curve folded at the 10.8h orbital period is double-humped, dominated by ellipsoidal effects, but also affected by irradiation. The ULTRACAM light curves are fit with several models encompassing direct heating and a cold spot, or heat redistribution after irradiation either through convection or convection plus diffusion. Despite the inability to constrain the best irradiation models, the fits provide consistent system parameters, giving an orbital inclination of 59$\pm$6deg and a distance of 3.1$\pm$0.3 kpc. The companion is found to be an F-type star, underfilling its Roche lobe ( f_RL = 73$\pm$4%), with a mass of 0.20$\pm$0.04 M_sun, confirming the redback status, although hotter than the majority of redbacks. The stellar dayside and nightside temperatures of 7500K and 7400K, respectively, indicate a weak irradiation effect on the companion, likely due to its high intrinsic luminosity. Although the pulsar mass cannot be precisely derived, a heavy (1.8-2.2 M_sun) neutron star is favoured</description>

      <title>On the mass distribution of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The merging black hole binaries detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave observatories, may help us shed light on how such binaries form. In addition, these detections can help us probe the hypothesized primordial black holes, a candidate for the observed abundance of dark matter. In this work, we study the black-hole mass distribution obtained from the LVK binary black hole merger events. We obtain that distribution by first associating a skewed normal distribution to each event detected with a signal to noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;$ 8 and then summing all such distributions. We also simulate black hole binaries from two separate populations of merging binaries. One of these is a stellar-origin population that follows a mass-distribution similar to the zero-age mass function of stars. The second population of black holes follows a Gaussian mass-distribution. Such a distribution could approximate a population of black hole binaries formed from earlier black hole mergers in dense stellar environments, or binaries of primordial black holes. For those populations, we evaluate the number of detectable events and fit their combination to the LVK observations. In our work, we rely on a wide range of stellar-origin black-hole mass distributions. We find that the observed LVK events can be fitted much better by the combination of such a stellar-origin mass distribution and a Gaussian distribution, than by the stellar-origin mass distribution alone.</description>

      <title>Sharp Rise in Cosmic Ray Irradiation of Organisms on Earth Caused by a Nearby SN Shockwave Passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work considers the modelling of nearby supernova (SN) effects on Earth's biosphere via cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated by shockwaves. The rise of the radiation background on Earth resulted from the external irradiation by CR high-energy particles and internal radiation in organisms by the decay of cosmogenic ${}^{14}$C is evaluated. We have taken into account that the CR flux near Earth goes up steeply when the shockwave crosses the Solar System, while in previous works the CR transport was considered as purely diffusive. Our simulations demonstrate a high rise of the external ionization of the environments at Earth's surface by atmospheric cascade particles that penetrate the first 70-100 m of water depth. Also, the cosmogenic ${}^{14}$C decay is able to irradiate the entire biosphere and deep ocean organisms. We analyzed the probable increase in mutation rate and estimated the distance between Earth and an SN, where the lethal effects of irradiation are possible. Our simulations demonstrate that for SN energy of around $10^{51}$ erg the lethal distance could be $\sim$ 18 pc.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave ringdown analysis using the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the final stage of the merger of two black holes, the ringdown signal takes an important role on providing information about the gravitational dynamics in strong field. We introduce a novel time-domain (TD) approach, predicated on the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic, for ringdown analysis. This method diverges from traditional TD techniques in that its parameter space remains constant irrespective of the number of modes incorporated. This feature is achieved by reconfiguring the likelihood and analytically maximizing over the extrinsic parameters that encompass the amplitudes and reference phases of all modes. Consequently, when performing the ringdown analysis under the assumption that the ringdown signal is detected by the Einstein Telescope, parameter estimation computation time is shortened by at most five orders of magnitude compared to the traditional TD method. We further establish that traditional TD methods become difficult when including multiple overtone modes due to close oscillation frequencies and damping times across different overtone modes. Encouragingly, this issue is effectively addressed by our new TD technique. The accessibility of this new TD method extends to a broad spectrum of research and offers flexibility for various topics within black hole spectroscopy applicable to both current and future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Accurate pulsar timing array residual variances and correlation of the stochastic gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays have reported a compelling evidence of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background. However, the origin of the signal remains undetermined, largely because its spectrum is bluer for an astrophysical source and can be explained by cosmological models. In this letter, we derive theoretically accurate expressions for the Fourier bin variances and correlation of pulsar timing residuals, and demonstrate their outstanding agreement with astrophysical simulations. In contrast, we show that a common power law traditionally used to interpret a stochastic gravitational wave background spectrum is generally faced with systematic errors, one of which is the illusion of a bluer signal. This hints at a conservative solution, supportive of an astrophysical source, to the observed correlated common spectrum process in pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background due to core collapse resulting in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic background of gravitational wave signals arising from the core-collapse supernovae is produced through various complex mechanisms that need detailed and careful investigation. We proposed a simplified multi-peak waveform of the amplitude spectrum. The corresponding energy spectra of our model fit the energy spectra obtained from different numerical simulations of various types of core-collapse events such as non-rotating, slow and fast rotating massive progenitors resulting in neutron stars. The maximum dimensionless energy density $\Omega_{gw}$ corresponding to our model is of $\mathcal{O}(10 {^{-12})} $ around 650 Hz. Assuming some degree of uncertainty, we estimated the parameters for the core collapse waveform using BILBY. We studied the detectability of the signal of our model against gravitational-wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope, advanced LIGO and Virgo. Our study indicates that these detectors have to gain more sensitivity to pick up the gravitational wave signals of stochastic background.</description>

      <title>Forecasts for Helium Reionization Detection with Fast Radio Bursts in the Era of Square Kilometre Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed dispersion measures (DMs) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a good indicator of the amount of ionized material along the propagation paths. In this work, we present a forecast of He II reionization detection using the DM and redshift measurements of FRBs from the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Assuming a model of the Universe in which \he reionization occurred at a specific redshift $z_{\rm re}$, we analyze what extent the signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{S/N}$) for the detection of the amplitude of reionization can be achieved in the era of SKA. Using $10^{6}$ mock FRB data from a one-year observation of the second phase of SKA, we find that the $\mathrm{S/N}$ for detecting He II reionization can approach the $32-50\sigma$ level and the uncertainty on the reionization redshift can be constrained to be $\sigma(z_{\rm re})\approx 0.022-0.031$, depending on the assumed FRB redshift distribution. We also examine the influence of different fiducial $z_{\rm re}$ values, finding that this effect has a modest impact on the forecasts. Our results demonstrate the potentially remarkable capability of SKA-era FRBs in constraining the epoch of He II reionization.</description>

      <title>Relaxation to universal non-Maxwellian equilibria in a collisionless plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generic equilibria are derived for turbulent relaxing plasmas via an entropy-maximization procedure that accounts for the short-time conservation of certain collisionless invariants. The conservation of these collisionless invariants endows the system with a partial `memory' of its prior conditions, but is imperfect on long time scales due to the development of a turbulent cascade to small scales, which breaks the precise conservation of phase volume, making this memory imprecise. The equilibria are still determined by the short-time collisionless invariants, but the invariants themselves are driven to a universal form by the nature of the turbulence. This is numerically confirmed for the case of beam instabilities in one-dimensional electrostatic plasmas, where sufficiently strong turbulence appears to cause the distribution function of particle energies to develop a universal power-law tail, with exponent -2.</description>

      <title>Binary progenitor systems for Type Ic supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae are explosions of massive stars at the end of their evolution. They are responsible for metal production and for halting star formation, having a significant impact on galaxy evolution. The details of these processes depend on the nature of supernova progenitors, but it is unclear if Type Ic supernovae (without hydrogen or helium lines in their spectra) originate from core-collapses of very massive stars (&gt; 30 Msun) or from less massive stars in binary systems. Here we show that Type II (with hydrogen lines) and Ic supernovae are located in environments with similar molecular gas densities, therefore their progenitors have comparable lifetimes and initial masses. This supports a binary interaction for most Type Ic supernova progenitors, which explains the lack of hydrogen and helium lines. This finding can be implemented in sub-grid prescriptions in numerical cosmological simulations to improve the feedback and chemical mixing.</description>

      <title>An X-ray Significantly Variable, Luminous, Type 2 Quasar at z = 2.99 with a Massive Host Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive X-ray analysis and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of WISEA J171419.96+602724.6, an extremely luminous type 2 quasar at $z$ = 2.99. The source was suggested as a candidate Compton-thick (column density N$_{\rm H}&gt;$1.5 $\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) quasar by a short XMM-Newton observation in 2011. We recently observed the source with deep NuSTAR and XMM-Newton exposures in 2021 and found that the source has a lower obscuration of N$_{\rm H}\sim$5 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ with an about four times lower flux. The two epochs of observations suggested that the source was significantly variable in X-ray obscuration, flux, and intrinsic luminosity at 2-3~$\sigma$ in less than 2.5 years (in the source rest frame). We performed SED fitting of this source using CIGALE thanks to its great availability of multiwavelength data (from hard X-rays to radio). The source is very luminous with a bolometric luminosity of $L_{\rm BOL}\sim$ 2.5 $\times$ 10$^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Its host galaxy has a huge star formation rate (SFR) of $\sim$1280 Solar mass yr$^{-1}$ and a huge stellar mass of $\sim$1.1 $\times$ 10$^{12}$ Solar mass. The correlation between the SFR and stellar mass of this source is consistent with what was measured in the high-$z$ quasars. It is also consistent with what was measured in the main-sequence star-forming galaxies, suggesting that the presence of the active nucleus in our target does not enhance or suppress the SFR of its host galaxy. The source is an Infrared hyper-luminous, obscured galaxy with significant amount of hot dust in its torus and shares many similar properties with hot, dust obscured galaxies.</description>

Abstract: The era of gravitational wave astronomy began in 2015 with the observation of the signal from the merger of two black holes by the LIGO detectors; by 2021, almost 100 more such transient signals from coalescences of compact binaries of black holes and neutron stars were catalogued. With improvements to the ground-based interferometer network consisting of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA now promising to bring the total number of detections into the hundreds, we review the observational signatures and analysis methods for the most prolific gravitational-wave source: the coalescence of compact binaries.</description>

      <title>Targeting 100-PeV tau neutrino detection with an array of phased and high-gain reconstruction antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos at ultrahigh energies can originate both from interactions of cosmic rays at their acceleration sites and through cosmic-ray interactions as they propagate through the universe. These neutrinos are expected to have a low flux which drives the need for instruments with large effective areas. Radio observations of the inclined air showers induced by tau neutrino interactions in rock can achieve this, because radio waves can propagate essentially unattenuated through the hundreds of kilometers of atmosphere. Proposed arrays for radio detection of tau neutrinos focus on either arrays of inexpensive receivers distributed over a large area, the GRAND concept, or compact phased arrays on elevated mountains, the BEACON concept, to build up a large detector area with a low trigger threshold. We present a concept that combines the advantages of these two approaches with a trigger driven by phased arrays at a moderate altitude (1 km) and sparse, high-gain outrigger receivers for reconstruction and background rejection. We show that this design has enhanced sensitivity at 100 PeV over the two prior designs with fewer required antennas and discuss the need for optimized antenna designs.</description>

      <title>It's written in the massive stars: The role of stellar physics in the formation of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the age of gravitational-wave (GW) sources and newly discovered local black holes (BH) and neutron stars (NS), understanding the fate of stars is a key question. Not every massive star is expected to successfully explode as a supernova and leave behind a NS; some stars form BHs. The remnant depends on explosion physics but also on the final core structure, often summarized by the compactness parameter or iron core mass, where high values have been linked to BH formation. Several groups have reported similar patterns in these parameters as a function of mass, characterized by a prominent compactness peak followed by another peak at higher masses, pointing to a common underlying physical mechanism. Here, we investigate its origin by computing single-star models from 17 to 50 solar masses with MESA. The first and second compactness increases originate from core carbon and neon burning, respectively, becoming neutrino dominated, which enhances the core contraction and ultimately increases the iron-core mass and compactness. An early core neon ignition during carbon burning, and an early silicon ignition during oxygen burning help counter the core contraction and decrease the final iron core mass and compactness. Shell mergers between C/Ne and O-burning shells further decrease the compactness and we show that they are due to an enhanced entropy production in these layers. We find that the final structure of massive stars is not random but already written in their cores at core helium exhaustion. The same mechanisms determine the final structure of any star in this core mass range, including binary products, though binary interactions systematical shift the range of expected BH formation. Finally, we discuss the role of stellar physics uncertainties and how to apply these findings to studies of GW sources. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>The Accelerating Decline of the Mass Transfer Rate in the Recurrent Nova T Pyxidis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recurrent nova T Pyxidis has erupted six times since 1890, with its last outburst in 2011, and the relatively short recurrence time between classical nova explosions indicates that T Pyx must have a massive white dwarf accreting at a high rate. It is believed that, since its outburst in 1890, the mass transfer rate in T Pyx was very large due to a feedback loop where the secondary is heated by the hot white dwarf. The feedback loop has been slowly shutting off, reducing the mass transfer rate, and thereby explaining the magnitude decline of T Pyx from $\sim13.8$ (before 1890) to 15.7 just before the 2011 eruption. We present an analysis of the latest $Hubble~Space~Telescope$ (HST) far ultraviolet and optical spectra, obtained 12 years after the 2011 outburst, showing that the mass transfer rate has been steadily declining and is now below its pre-outburst level by about 40%: $\dot{M} \sim 1-3\times 10^{-7}M_\odot$/yr for a WD mass of $\sim 1.0-1.4 M_\odot$, an inclination of $50^\circ - 60^\circ$, reddening $E(B-V)=0.30 \pm 0.05$ and a Gaia DR3 distance of $2860^{+816}_{-471}$~pc. This steady decrease in the mass transfer rate in the $\sim$decade after the 2011 ourbutst is in sharp contrast with the more constant pre-outburst UV continuum flux level from archival international ultraviolet explorer (IUE) spectra. The flux (i.e. $\dot{M}$) decline rate is 29 times faster now in the last $\sim$decade than observed since 1890 to $\sim$2010. The feedback loop shut off seems to be accelerating, at least in the decade following its 2011 outburst. In all eventualities, our analysis confirms that T Pyx is going through an unusually peculiar short-lived phase.</description>

Abstract: We examine the role of refractory organics as a major C carrier in the outer protosolar nebula and its implications for the compositions of large Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) and CI chondrites. By utilizing Rosetta measurements of refractory organics in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, we show that they would make up a large fraction of the protosolar C inventory in the KBO-forming region based on the current widely adopted solar abundances. However, this would free up too much O to form water ice, producing solid material that is not sufficiently rock-rich to explain the uncompressed density of the Pluto-Charon system and other large KBOs; the former has been argued as the most representative value we have for the bulk composition of large KBOs (Barr &amp; Schawmb 2016, Bierson &amp; Nimmo 2019). This inconsistency further highlights the solar abundances problem - an ongoing challenge in reconciling spectroscopically determined heavy element abundances with helioseismology constraints. By employing a new dataset from solar CNO neutrinos and solar wind measurements of C, N, and O, we show that the uncompressed density of the Pluto-Charon system can be reproduced over a wide range of scenarios. We show that a lack of sulfates in Ryugu and Bennu samples implies a lower amount of water ice initially accreted into CI chondrite parent bodies than previously thought. These data are found to be consistent with the solar C/O ratio implied by the new dataset. Our predictions can be tested by future neutrino, helioseismology, and cosmochemical measurements.</description>

      <title>Emergence of microphysical bulk viscosity in binary neutron star post-merger dynamics</title>

Abstract: In nuclear matter in isolated neutron stars, the flavor content (e.g., proton fraction) is subject to weak interactions, establishing flavor ($\beta$-)equilibrium. However, there can be deviations from this equilibrium during the merger of two neutron stars. We study the resulting out-of-equilibrium dynamics during the collision by incorporating direct and modified Urca processes (in the neutrino-transparent regime) into general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations with a simplified neutrino transport scheme. We demonstrate how weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity in post-merger simulations can emerge and assess the bulk viscous dynamics of the resulting flow. We further place limits on the impact on the post-merger gravitational wave strain. Our results show that weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity can potentially lead to a phase shift of the post-merger gravitational wave spectrum, although the effect is currently on the same level as the numerical errors of our simulation.</description>

      <title>3D code for MAgneto-Thermal evolution in Isolated Neutron Stars, MATINS: thermal evolution and lightcurves</title>

Abstract: The thermal evolution of isolated neutron stars is a key element in unraveling their internal structure and composition and establishing evolutionary connections among different observational subclasses. Previous studies have predominantly focused on one-dimensional or axisymmetric two-dimensional models. In this study, we present the thermal evolution component of the novel three-dimensional magnetothermal code MATINS (MAgneto-Thermal evolution of Isolated Neutron Star). MATINS employs a finite volume scheme and integrates a realistic background structure, along with state-of-the-art microphysical calculations for the conductivities, neutrino emissivities, heat capacity, and superfluid gap models. This paper outlines the methodology employed to solve the thermal evolution equations in MATINS, along with the microphysical implementation which is essential for the thermal component. We test the accuracy of the code and present simulations with non-evolving magnetic fields of different configurations (all with electrical currents confined to the crust and a magnetic field that does not thread the core), to produce temperature maps of the neutron star surface. Additionally, for a specific magnetic field configuration, we show one fully coupled evolution of magnetic field and temperature. Subsequently, we use a ray-tracing code to link the neutron star surface temperature maps obtained by MATINS with the phase-resolved spectra and pulsed profiles that would be detected by distant observers. This study, together with our previous article focused on the magnetic formalism, presents in detail the most advanced evolutionary code for isolated neutron stars, with the aim of comparison with their timing properties, thermal luminosities and the associated X-ray light curves.</description>

      <title>Birth and Evolution of Fast Radio Bursts: Strong Population-Based Evidence for a Neutron-Star Origin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the appeal of their extraordinary radio luminosity to our curiosity is undiminished, the nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has remained unclear. The challenge has been due in part to small sample sizes and limited understanding of telescope selection effects. We here present the first inclusion of the entire set of one-off FRBs from CHIME/FRB Catalog 1 in frbpoppy. Where previous work had to curate this data set, and fit for few model parameters, we have developed full multi-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) capabilities for frbpoppy -- the comprehensive, open-science FRB population synthesis code -- that allow us to include all one-off CHIME bursts. Through the combination of these two advances we now find the best description of the real, underlying FRB population, with higher confidence than before. We show that $4\pm3\times10^{3}$ one-off FRBs go off every second between Earth and $z$=1; and we provide a mock catalog based on our best model, for straight-forward inclusion in other studies. We investigate CHIME side-lobe detection fractions, and FRB luminosity characteristics, to show that some bright, local FRBs are still being missed. We find strong evidence that FRB birth rates evolve with the star formation rate of the Universe, even with a hint of a short (0.1$-$1 Gyr) delay time. The preferred contribution of the hosts to the FRB dispersion agrees with a progenitor birth location in the host disk. This population-based evidence solidly aligns with magnetar-like burst sources, and we conclude FRBs are emitted by neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intense flaring events in the near-infrared and X-ray wavebands of our Galactic Center have been the subject of research for decades. In recent years, the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope captured the motion and polarimetric signature of such a flare in close proximity to the supermassive black hole. This study aims to investigate a broad parameter space for hot spot motion in the vicinity of Sgr$A*$ and reproduce the observed flaring behavior. To this end, we have developed a General Relativistic Radiative Transfer code and conducted a parameter study including both planar and ejected hot spot configurations around supermassive black holes. Super-Keplerian orbital frequencies are favored by circular equatorial, cylindrical and parabolic models, whereas conical hot spot trajectories provide a better fit for orbital frequencies below the Keplerian value. Additionally, a distant observer cannot effectively differentiate between Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, as well as face-on orbits at different observation angles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly magnetized neutron stars have quantum refraction effects on pulsar emission due to the non-linearity of the quantum electrodynamics (QED) action. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the polarization states of pulsar emission under the quantum refraction effects, combined with the dependence on the emission frequency; we solve a system of evolution equations of the Stokes vector, where the birefringent vector, in which such effects are encoded, acts on the Stokes vector. At a fixed frequency of emission, depending on the magnitude of the birefringent vector, dominated mostly by the magnetic field strength, the evolution of the Stokes vector largely exhibits three different patterns: (i) monotonic, or (ii) half-oscillatory, or (iii) highly oscillatory behaviors. These features are understood and confirmed by means of approximate analytical solutions to the evolution equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the acceleration of particles in astrophysical sources by the Fermi mechanism is revisited under the assumption of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). We calculate the energy spectrum and the acceleration time of particles leaving the source as a function of the energy beyond which the Lorentz invariance violation becomes relevant. Lorentz invariance violation causes significant changes in the acceleration of particles by the first and second-order Fermi mechanisms. The energy spectrum of particles accelerated by first-order Fermi mechanism under LIV assumption shows a strong suppression for energies above the break. The calculations presented here complete the scenario for LIV searches with astroparticles by showing, for the first time, how the benchmark acceleration mechanisms (Fermi) are modified under LIV assumption.</description>

      <title>Neutron star kicks plus rockets as a mechanism for forming wide low-eccentricity neutron star binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent neutron star surface observations corroborate a long-standing theory that neutron stars may be accelerated over extended periods after their birth. We analyze how these prolonged rocket-like accelerations, combined with rapid birth kicks, impact binary orbits. We find that even a small contribution of rocket kicks combined with instantaneous natal kicks can allow binaries to reach period--eccentricity combinations unattainable in standard binary evolution models. We propose these kick + rocket combinations as a new channel to form wide low-eccentricity neutron star binaries such as Gaia NS1, as well as inducing stellar mergers months to years after a supernova to cause peculiar high-energy transients.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Population Synthesis with Magnetorotational Evolution: Constraining the Decay of Magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a population synthesis model for normal radio pulsars in the Galaxy incorporating the latest developments in the field and the magnetorotational evolution processes. Our model considers spin-down with a force-free magnetosphere and the decay of the magnetic field strength and its inclination angle. The simulated pulsar population is fit to a large observation sample that covers the majority of radio surveys using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. We compare the distributions of four major observables: spin period (P), spin down rate($\dot{P}$), dispersion measure, and radio flux density using accurate high-dimensional Kolmogoro-Smirnov statistics. We test two B-field decay scenarios, an exponential model motivated by ohmic dissipation and a power-law model motivated by the Hall effect. The former clearly provides a better fit, and it can successfully reproduce the observed pulsar distributions with a decay timescale of $8.3_{-3.0}^{+3.9}$ Myr. The result suggests that significant B-field decay in aged pulsars and ohmic dissipation could be the dominant process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims to detect highly inclined extensive air showers (EAS) with down-going and up-going trajectories. Several working groups in the GRAND collaboration are developing methods to reconstruct the incoming direction, core position, primary energy, and composition of the showers. The reconstruction pipeline -- currently under development in the France/IAP working group -- relies on a model of spherical wavefront emission for arrival times, which is possible because the radio signals are generated far away from the antenna stations. The amplitude distribution of the signals at the antenna level is described by an Angular Distribution Function that considers various asymmetries in the data, including geomagnetic effects. In this contribution, we present preliminary results from testing our EAS reconstruction procedure using realistic mock observations.</description>

Abstract: GRAND (the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection) is a proposed next-generation observatory of ultra-high-energy neutrinos, cosmic rays, and gamma rays of cosmic origin, with energies exceeding about 100 PeV. GRAND is envisioned as a collection of large-scale ground arrays of self-triggered radio antennas that target the radio emission from extensive air showers initiated by UHE particles. Three prototype arrays are in operation: GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay in France, GRAND@Auger in Argentina, and GRANDProto300 in China. They test the detection principle and technology of GRAND, in preparation for its next phase, consisting of two arrays of 10'000 antennas each, in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, to be deployed from 2030 on. We present the concept of GRAND, its science goals, the status of the prototypes, their first measurements, and the technical and scientific perspectives that these measurements open for the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the upscattering of atmospheric neutrinos in the interior of the Earth producing heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) which subsequently decay inside large volume detectors (e.g. Super-Kamiokande or DUNE). We compute the flux of upscattered HNLs arriving at a detector, and the resultant event rate of visible decay products. Using Super-Kamiokande's atmospheric neutrino dataset we find new leading constraints for dipole couplings to any flavor with HNL masses between roughly 10 MeV and 100 MeV. For mass mixing with tau neutrinos, we probe new parameter space near HNL masses of $\sim 20$ MeV with prospects for substantial future improvements. We also discuss prospects at future experiments such as DUNE, JUNO, and Hyper-Kamiokande.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A model is constructed to predict the emission originating from axion-to-photon conversion in the strongly magnetized ultrarelativistic plasma of neutron stars. The acceleration and multiplicity of the charges are observed to shift the axion-induced spectral feature with respect to previous expectations. The frequency range of interest widens accordingly, and heavier dark matter axions may resonate in magnetospheric splits giving rise to detectable radio signals that could extend into the millimeter band. Ultimately, this work follows an affirmative answer to the question of whether neutron stars can give rise to any detectable high-frequency spectral feature that would allow us to probe axion dark matter of masses up to about a millielectronvolt.</description>

      <title>Probing a Dark Sector with Collider Physics, Direct Detection, and Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assess the complementarity between colliders, direct detection searches, and gravitational wave interferometry in probing a scenario of dark matter in the early universe. The model under consideration contains a $B-L$ gauge symmetry and a vector-like fermion which acts as the dark matter candidate. The fermion induces significant a large dark matter-nucleon scattering rate, and the $Z^\prime$ field produces clear dilepton events at colliders. Thus, direct detection experiments and colliders severely constrain the parameter space in which the correct relic density is found in agreement with the data. Nevertheless, little is known about the new scalar responsible for breaking the $B-L$ symmetry. If this breaking occurs via a first-order phase transition at a TeV scale, it could lead to gravitational waves in the mHz frequency range detectable by LISA, DECIGO, and BBO instruments. The spectrum is highly sensitive to properties of the scalar sector and gauge coupling. We show that a possible GW detection, together with information from colliders and direct detection experiments, can simultaneously pinpoint the scalar self-coupling, and narrow down the dark matter mass where a thermal relic is viable.</description>

Abstract: Theoretical predictions suggest that very massive stars have the potential to form through multiple collisions and eventually evolve into intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) within Population III star clusters embedded in mini dark matter haloes. In this study, we investigate the long-term evolution of Population III star clusters, including models with a primordial binary fraction of $f_{\rm b}=0$ and 1, using the $N$-body simulation code PETAR. We comprehensively examine the phenomenon of hierarchical triple black holes in the clusters, specifically focusing on their merging inner binary black holes (BBHs), with post-Newtonian correction, by using the TSUNAMI code. Our findings suggest a high likelihood of the inner BBHs containing IMBHs with masses on the order of $\mathcal{O}(100)M_{\odot}$, and as a result, their merger rate could be up to $0.1{\rm Gpc}^{-3}{\rm yr}^{-3}$. The orbital eccentricities of some merging inner BBHs oscillate over time periodically, known as the Kozai-Lidov oscillation, due to dynamical perturbations. Detectable merging inner BBHs for mHz GW detectors LISA/TianQin/Taiji concentrate within $z&lt;3$. More distant sources would be detectable for CE/ET/LIGO/KAGRA/DECIGO, which are sensitive from $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$Hz to $\mathcal{O}(100)$Hz. Furthermore, compared with merging isolated BBHs, merging inner BBHs affected by dynamical perturbations from tertiary BHs tend to have higher eccentricities, with a significant fraction of sources with eccentricities closing to 1 at mHz bands. GW observations would help constrain formation channels of merging BBHs, whether through isolated evolution or dynamical interaction, by examining eccentricities.</description>

      <title>Impact of higher harmonics of gravitational radiation on the population inference of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Templates modeling just the dominant mode of gravitational radiation are generally sufficient for the unbiased parameter inference of near-equal-mass compact binary mergers. However, neglecting the subdominant modes can bias the inference if the binary is significantly asymmetric, very massive, or has misaligned spins. In this work, we explore if neglecting these subdominant modes in the parameter estimation of non-spinning binary black hole mergers can bias the inference of their population-level properties such as mass and merger redshift distributions. Assuming the design sensitivity of advanced LIGO-Virgo detector network, we find that neglecting subdominant modes will not cause a significant bias in the population inference, although including them will provide more precise estimates. This is primarily due to the fact that asymmetric binaries are expected to be rarer in our detected sample, due to their intrinsic rareness and the observational selection effects. The increased precision in the measurement of the maximum black hole mass can help in better constraining the upper mass gap in the mass spectrum.</description>

      <title>Astrophysics and Nuclear Physics Informed Interactions in Dense Matter: Inclusion of PSR J0437-4715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how vector-isoscalar and vector-isovector interactions can be determined within the density regime of neutron stars (NSs), while fulfilling nuclear and astrophysics constrains. We make use of the Chiral Mean Field (CMF) model, a SU(3) nonlinear realization of the sigma model within the mean-field approximation, for the first time within a Bayesian analysis framework. We show that neutron-matter $\chi$EFT constraints at low density are only satisfied if the vector-isovector mixed interaction term is included, e.g., a $\omega^2\rho^2$ term. We also show the behavior of the model with respect to the conformal limit. We demonstrate that the CMF model is able to predict a value for the parameter $d_c$ related to the trace anomaly and its derivative takes values below 0.2 above four times saturation density within a hadronic version of the model that does not include hyperons or a phase transition to deconfined matter. We compare these effects with results from other (non-chiral) Relativistic Mean Field models to assess how different approaches to incorporating the same physical constraints affect predictions of NS properties and dense matter equations of state. We also include data from the gravitation wave event GW230529 detected by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration and the most recent radius measurement of PSR J0437-4715 from the NASA NICER mission. Our analysis reveals that this new NICER measurement leads to an average reduction of approximately $\sim 0.1$ km radius in the posterior of the NS mass-radius relationship.</description>

      <title>Possible signatures of higher dimension in thin accretion disk around brane world black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We probe deeply into the characteristics of thin accretion disk surrounding black hole within the brane world paradigm. We investigate how model parameters affect the physical properties of the disk. Our findings indicate that as the tidal charge parameter inherited from the higher dimension increases, the energy flux, the radiation temperature, the spectral cutoff frequency, the spectral luminosity, and the conversion efficiency of the disk all increase, but the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit decreases. Compared to cases of the Kerr and Schwarzschild black holes, the disk is hotter and more luminous for positive tidal charge parameter, while it is cooler and less luminous for negative tidal charge parameter, which suggests the potential for probing possible signatures of higher dimension.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological model of gravitational self-force enhanced tides in inspiralling binary neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from inspiralling binary neutron stars provide unique access to ultra-dense nuclear matter and offer the ability to constrain the currently unknown neutron star equation-of-state through tidal measurements. This, however, requires the availability of accurate and efficient tidal waveform models. In this paper we present PhenomGSF, a new phenomenological tidal phase model for the inspiral of neutron stars in the frequency-domain, which captures the gravitational self-force informed tidal contributions of the time-domain effective-one-body model TEOBResumS. PhenomGSF is highly faithful and computationally efficient, and by choosing a modular approach, it can be used in conjunction with any frequency-domain binary black hole waveform model to generate the complete phase for a binary neutron star inspiral. PhenomGSF is valid for neutron star binaries with unequal masses and mass ratios between 1 and 3, and dimensionless tidal deformabilities up to 5000. Furthermore, PhenomGSF does not assume universal relations or parameterised equations-of-state, hence allowing for exotic matter analyses and beyond standard model physics investigations. We demonstrate the efficacy and accuracy of our model through comparisons against TEOBResumS, numerical relativity waveforms and full Bayesian inference, including a reanalysis of the binary neutron star observation GW170817.</description>

      <title>Does Magnetic Reconnection Change Topology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that magnetic reconnection and topology-change can be understood, and distinguished, in terms of trajectories of Alfv\'enic wave-packets ${\bf x}(t)$ moving along the magnetic field ${\bf B(x}, t)$ with Alfv\'en velocity $\dot{\bf x}(t)={\bf V}_A({\bf x},t)$, i.e. adopting a Lagrangian formalism for virtual particles. A considerable simplification is attained, in fact, by directly employing elementary concepts from hydrodynamic turbulence without appealing to the fictitious and complicated notion of magnetic field lines moving through plasma. In incompressible flows, Alfv\'enic trajectories correspond to the dynamical system $\dot{\bf x}(t)={\bf B}$, where $\bf B$ solves the induction equation, with phase space $(\bf x,B)$. Metric topology of this phase space, at any time $t$, captures the intuitive notion that nearby wave-packets should remain nearby at a slightly different time $t\pm \delta t$, unless topology changes e.g., by dissipation. In fact, continuity conditions for magnetic field allow rapid but continuous divergence of these trajectories, i.e., reconnection, but not discontinuous divergence which would change magnetic topology. Thus topology can change only due to time-reversal symmetry breaking e.g., by dissipation or turbulence. In laminar and even chaotic flows, the separation of Alfv\'enic trajectories at all times remains proportional to their initial separation, i.e., slow reconnection, and topology changes by dissipation with a rate proportional to resistivity. In turbulence, trajectories diverge super-linearly with time independent of their initial separation, i.e., fast reconnection, and magnetic topology changes by turbulent diffusion with a rate independent of small-scale plasma effects. Our results strongly support the Lazarian-Vishniac model of stochastic reconnection and its reformulation by Eyink in terms of stochastic flux-freezing.</description>

      <title>Deep Einstein@Home search for Continuous Gravitational Waves from the Central Compact Objects in the Supernova Remnants Vela Jr. and G347.3-0.5 using LIGO public data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a search for continuous nearly monochromatic gravitational waves from the central compact objects associated with the supernova remnants Vela Jr. and G347.3 using LIGO O2 and O3 public data. Over $10^{18}$ different waveforms are considered, covering signal frequencies between 20-1300 Hz (20-400 Hz) for G347.3-0.5 (Vela Jr) and a very broad range of frequency derivatives. Thousands of volunteers donating compute cycles through the computing project Einstein@Home have made this endeavour possible. Following the Einstein@Home search, we perform multi-stage follow-ups of over 5 million waveforms. The selection threshold is set so that a signal could be confirmed using the first half of the LIGO O3 data. We find no significant signal candidate for either targets. Based on this null result, for G347.3-0.5, we set the most constraining upper limits to date on the amplitude of gravitational wave signals, corresponding to deformations below $10^{-6}$ in a large part of the search band. At the frequency of best strain sensitivity, near $161$ Hz, we set 90\%\ confidence upper limits on the gravitational wave intrinsic amplitude of $h_0^{90\%}\approx 6.2\times10^{-26}$. Over most of the frequency range our upper limits are a factor of 10 smaller than the indirect age-based upper limit. For Vela Jr., near $163$ Hz, we set $h_0^{90\%}\approx 6.4\times10^{-26}$. Over most of the frequency range our upper limits are a factor of 15 smaller than the indirect age-based upper limit. The Vela Jr. upper limits presented here are slightly less constraining than the most recent upper limits of \cite{ligo_o3a_c_v} but they apply to a broader set of signals.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from thermal heavy scalar dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a gauge singlet scalar with mass around $1-10$ TeV as a thermal heavy dark matter candidate along with a dilaton as a Higgs portal mediator in a dimensionless scalar extension of the Standard Model. We demonstrate analytically that such a model gives rise to very strong first-order electroweak phase tyransition through supercooling. We calculate the corresponding gravitational wave signals due to bubble collisions during the phase transition. The produced gravitational waves can be detected by future space-based gravitational wave detectors in the frequency range from $10^{-4}$ Hz to $0.1$ Hz.</description>
