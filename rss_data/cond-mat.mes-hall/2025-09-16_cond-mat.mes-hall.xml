      <title>Terahertz electrodynamics in a zero-field Wigner crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In clean two-dimensional (2D) systems, electrons are expected to self-organize into a regular lattice, a Wigner crystal, when their mutual Coulomb repulsion overwhelms kinetic energy. Understanding the Wigner crystal at zero magnetic field is a long-sought goal in physics, thanks to its fundamental simplicity and possible connection to the density-driven metal-insulator transition. To date, evidence for such a crystal has been reported across various platforms. However, the AC conductivity of a zero-field Wigner crystal, a key observable characterizing its electrodynamics, has never been measured. Here, we develop an ultrasensitive on-chip terahertz (THz) spectroscopy technique to probe the AC conductivity in electrostatically gated monolayer MoSe2 encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. We observe a sub-THz resonance corresponding to the pinning mode of a zero-field Wigner crystal, whose frequency is orders of magnitude higher than those under high magnetic fields. Using the pinning mode as an indicator, we reveal that moderate disorder notably stabilizes the Wigner crystal. With increasing density towards melting, we find that the pinning mode of the Wigner crystal coexists with a growing Drude component characteristic of an electron liquid, and the competition between these two components in the conductivity spectra leads to the insulator-metal transition of the 2D electron system. Our findings not only elucidate the low-energy electrodynamics of a zero-field Wigner crystal, but also establish on-chip THz spectroscopy as a powerful probe for correlated quantum phases in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>A new skyrmion topological transition driven by higher-order exchange interactions in Janus MnSeTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals magnets offer a promising platform for pushing skyrmion technology to the single-layer limit with high tunability. While Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is often recognized as central to skyrmion formation, their stability, collapse, and topological transition in 2D materials remain largely unexplored. In particular, the effect of higher-order exchange interactions (HOI) on these phenomena is unknown. Here, using first-principles calculations and atomistic spin simulations, we report a new topological transition generated by HOI, which we term 'ferric transition', in single-layer MnSeTe. Surprisingly, skyrmion stability and collapse remain largely unaffected by HOI due to the dominant role of DMI near the saddle point, whereas the Bloch point is strongly modified, giving rise to this novel transition. This mechanism is fundamentally distinct from the well-known radial and chimera transitions. Moreover, we predict that Janus MnSeTe exhibits remarkably high skyrmion energy barriers due to its strong DMI, among the highest reported for intrinsic 2D magnets. Our findings unveil an unexpected role of HOI in skyrmion topological transitions and establish Janus MnSeTe as a robust platform for 2D skyrmionics.</description>

      <title>Localization and Wetting of 4He Inside Pre-plated Nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low dimensional quantum fluids, where one can probe the effects of enhanced thermal and quantum fluctuations on macroscopic quantum wavefunctions, can be experimentally realized through transverse physical confinement of superfluid helium on scales smaller than the coherence length. Reaching this scale is difficult, requiring confinement in single or multiple pores with nanometer radii. Porous silicates such as MCM-41 have a pore radius larger than the coherence length of 4He, and in this work we systematically explore the possibility of pre-plating pores with different elements to reduce the pore size without localizing the confined superfluid. Through a direct solution of the few-body Schrodinger equation combined with quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we explore the behavior of helium confined inside cylindrical nanopores for a range of pre-plating elements, including rare gases and alkali metals. For rare gases, we find that helium remains strongly attracted to the pore walls and any atoms in the core form an incompressible liquid. For alkali metals such as Cs, weak interactions between helium and the pre-plating material prevent localization near the walls and enable delocalization in the pore center. Our results extend previous results for helium wetting on flat two dimensional coated substrates to the curved geometry inside nanopores, and demonstrate that alkali pre-plated nanopores may enable a tunable one-dimensional confined quantum liquid of helium.</description>

      <title>Design and Optimization of Spin Dynamics in Ge Quantum Dots: g-Factor Modulation, Dephasing Sweet Spots, and Phonon-Induced Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10731v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of spin dynamics in hole-based quantum dot qubits demands high-fidelity simulations that capture realistic device geometries, material interfaces, and self-consistent electrostatics. Here, we present a comprehensive three-dimensional study of gate-defined quantum dot hole spin qubits in strained Si$_{0.2}$Ge$_{0.8}$/Ge heterostructures. In contrast to prior work relying on idealized confinement or decoupled Poisson-Schr\"odinger treatments, our approach combines self-consistent electrostatics with a four-band Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian to resolve spin-orbit interactions, wavefunction asymmetries, and g-tensor anisotropies in realistic device structures. We quantify the impact of device size and gate bias on wavefunction localization, electric-field-induced g-factor modulation, and identify "sweet spots" in vertical electric field where g-factor sensitivity to charge noise is minimized, enhancing spin dephasing times. Spin relaxation due to phonon coupling is also modeled, revealing size-dependent T1 behavior consistent with strong Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic-field scaling near $B^{-8}$. This work establishes a predictive modeling framework for optimizing spin coherence in planar Ge quantum dots and provides quantitative design guidance for scalable, electrically controlled hole spin qubits in group-IV semiconductors.</description>

      <title>RKKY interaction mediated by a spin-polarized 2D electron gas with Rashba and altermagnetic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic interactions between impurity spins play a crucial role in determining magnetic configurations in spintronic systems. Using a Green's function formalism, we investigate Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange interactions between two localized spins mediated by a two-dimensional electron gas arising from two spin-polarized bands with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and altermagnetic dispersion. We analyze two distinct regimes: (a) strong out-of-plane ferromagnetic order, and (b) weak in-plane order. For out-of-plane magnetization, the Heisenberg, Ising, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) exchange interaction terms exhibit oscillatory spatial modulations and asymptotically decay as $1/R^{2}$ with impurity separation. Besides, all exchange terms display beating-like patterns that can be tuned via the exchange coupling strength between conduction electrons and ferromagnetic ordering. The DM vector lies within the two-dimensional plane, with the DM interaction being odd in the RSOC strength, oscillatory, and increasing in magnitude with RSOC strength. In contrast, it is even in the out-of-plane Zeeman field strength and oscillatory. Furthermore, the Heisenberg interaction exhibits a non-linear dependence on the altermagnetic band parameter. In the case of weak in-plane order, the Heisenberg exchange interaction shows a non-linear dependence on the in-plane exchange coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Measuring pulse heating in Si quantum dots with individual two-level fluctuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To encode quantum information in semiconductor spin qubits, voltage pulses are necessary for initialization, gate operation, and readout. However, these pulses dissipate heat, shifting spin-qubit frequencies and reducing gate fidelities. The cause of this pulse heating in quantum-dot devices is unknown. Here, we measure pulse heating using charged two-level fluctuators (TLFs) in Si/SiGe quantum dots. We find that the TLFs are susceptible to pulse heating. The amount of heating depends on the pulse amplitude and frequency, but not on the distance between the pulsed gates and the TLFs. The amount of heating also generally depends on the idling voltage of the pulsed gates, suggesting that electrons accumulated under or near the gates contribute to the heating. We hypothesize that reducing the area of the gates with electrons nearby could mitigate the heating.</description>

      <title>Correlated interlayer quantum Hall state in alternating twisted trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trilayer graphene allows systematic control of its electronic structure through stacking sequence and twist geometry, providing a versatile platform for correlated states. Here we report magnetotransport in alternating twisted trilayer graphene with a twist angle of about 5$^{\circ}$. The data reveal an electron-hole asymmetry that can be captured by introducing layer-dependent potential shifts. At charge neutrality ($\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=0$), three low-resistance states appear, which Hartree-Fock mean-field analysis attributes to emerging spin-resolved helical edge modes similar to those of quantum spin Hall insulators. At $\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=-1$, we also observe suppressed resistance when the middle and bottom layers are each half filled while the top layer remains inert at $\nu=-2$, consistent with an interlayer excitonic quantum Hall state. These results demonstrate correlated interlayer quantum Hall phases in alternating twisted trilayer graphene, including spin-resolved edge transport and excitonic order.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Driven Asymmetry in the Breakdown of the $\nu$ = 1 Quantum Hall State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report real-time detection of longitudinal and transverse transport responses across distinct frequency bands in a ferromagnetic filling factor $\nu$ = 1 integer quantum Hall state. By tuning $\nu$, we simultaneously access the evolution of the screening environment and bulk excitation structure. The resulting asymmetric breakdown, for $\nu&gt;1$ and $\nu&lt;1$, reveals that interaction effects, rather than a single-particle band picture, dominate the transport instability. Our findings highlight the indispensability of electron-electron interactions even in integer quantum Hall phases, suggesting that distinct many-body entanglement structures underlie both integer and fractional topological phases.</description>

      <title>Large Chern-Number Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect from Canted Antiferromagnetic Order in $d$-Electron System on Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons of $d$-symmetry in a kagome lattice are considered which interact with non-collinear antiferromagnetic order in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. The non-collinearity of spin texture gives rise to non-relativistic spin splitting and the associated intrinsic Berry curvature. The integral of the latter over the Brillouin zone becomes nontrivial for non-coplanar (canted) non-collinear spin order even without explicit on-site or transfer spin-orbit coupling. That gives rise to a nonzero (scalar) spin chirality, and a record value for the Chern number of $C=\pm 5$ can appear when the Fermi level is in an appropriate gap for isotropic electron hopping integrals, or nearly isotropic ones. The numerical results for this topological quantum anomalous Hall effect are supported by an analytical formula. It is possible to split the $C=\pm 5$ plateau into different possible nonzero values for the Chern number by varying the onsite energies. The topological phase transitions between Hall plateaus can be driven by flipping the Zeeman-like exchange field or controlling the onsite energies, alluding to the potential of this system to quantum information.</description>

      <title>Bridging Structure and Activity in Nanocatalysts via Machine Learning and Global Structure Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing a mapping between nanocatalysts structure and their catalytic properties is essential for efficient design. To this end, we demonstrate the accuracy of a general machine learning framework on a representative and challenging application: predicting the mass activity of Pt nanoparticles for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction, estimated via a microkinetic model. Accurate models are obtained when leveraging either a nanocatalyst's structure representation accessible at the computational level, namely the surface site generalized coordination number distributions, or one accessible experimentally, namely the nanoparticle's pair distance distribution function. Building on this result, we demonstrate that our machine learning model, in tandem with Bayesian optimization, efficiently identifies the Top-10 and Top-100 most active structures out of a large pool of candidates comprising more than 50000 different structures, after probing the activity only of a few thousand structures. These findings provide a robust blueprint for accelerated theoretical and experimental identification of active nanocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Absence of detectable spin and orbital pumping from Ni to Nb by out-of-plane ferromagnetic resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited ferromagnets can pump spin angular momentum, along with possibly orbital angular momentum. Among elemental ferromagnets, Ni has been proposed to exhibit substantial orbital pumping relative to spin pumping. Here, we search for a signature of orbital pumping by Ni, specifically by comparing out-of-plane ferromagnetic resonance in heterostructures without Ni (FeV/Nb) and with Ni (FeV-Ni/Nb). The FeV/Nb series shows a clear increase in Gilbert damping with the Nb sink thickness, attributed to spin pumping from FeV to Nb. Surprisingly, the FeV-Ni/Nb series exhibits no such damping increase, revealing no significant spin or orbital pumping from Ni to Nb. Our results offer a fresh perspective on angular-momentum transfer in Ni-based heterostructures, suggesting that the interpretation of some strong orbitronic effects may require further consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an experimental methodology for probing the energy barrier inhomogeneity at the metal/semiconductor interface without the need for time-consuming microscopic survey. It is based on the known statistical nature of the interfacial energy barrier and the use of planar tunnel junction as an array of parallelly-connected ballistic electron emission microscopy (BEEM) tips. In order to analyze a lump of local BEEM signals, we incorporate the Tung model into the Bell-Kaiser theory. To validate our theoretical strategies, we investigate the interfacial energy barrier inhomogeneity of Pt/4H-SiC(0001) junction as a model system.</description>

      <title>Topological excitonic insulators in electron bilayers modulated by twisted hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium interlayer exciton condensation is common in bilayer quantum Hall systems and is characterized by spontaneous phase coherence between isolated layers. It has been predicted that similar physics can occur in the absence of a magnetic field in some two-dimensional semiconductor bilayers. In this work we consider the case of two transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers separated by a twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) bilayer or multilayer. The hBN layers suppress tunneling between the TMD layers so that phase coherence is spontaneous when it is present. When twisted, the hBN layers also form a ferroelectric moir\'e pattern that applies opposite triangular-lattice modulation potentials to the two TMD layers. We show via mean-field theory that at total hole filling per moir\'e unit cell $\nu=1$, this geometry can favor a chiral p-wave exciton condensate state in which the quantum anomalous Hall effect coexists with counter-flow superfluidity. We present a mean-field phase diagram for TMD hole bilayers modulated by twisted hBN, discuss the conditions needed for the realization of the p-wave condensate state, and propose experiments that could confirm its presence.</description>

      <title>Glimpsing at Electron's Form Factor through Quasiparticle Interference in Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that characteristics of the electron's form factor in two-dimensional materials are observable in quasiparticle interference (QPI) spectrum. We study QPI in twisted bilayer graphene using real-space tight-binding calculations combined with the kernel polynomial method, which agrees excellently with the form factor norm obtained from the continuum Hamiltonian. The QPI signals, displaying a chiral structure, reveal all distinct interference processes between states near the Dirac points. We propose pseudospin textures of twisted bilayer graphene to explain all the interference mechanisms. Our results provide microscopic insights into electronic eigenstates of twisted bilayer graphene and suggest QPI as a potential method for probing the form factor, which governs the material's quantum geometry and many-body states.</description>

Abstract: The present work comprehensively reviews electron hydrodynamics in graphene, highlighting both experimental observations and theoretical developments. Key experimental signatures such as negative vicinity resistance, Poiseuille flow, and significant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law have been discussed, with special emphasis on Lorenz ratio measurements. In the theoretical direction, recent efforts have focused on developing hydrodynamic frameworks for calculating the thermodynamic and transport coefficients of electrons in graphene. The present work has briefly addressed the theoretical framework adopted by our group.</description>

      <title>Localizing Individual Exciton on a Quantum Hall Antidot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Hall systems host quasiparticles demonstrating correlated electron physics and non-trivial quantum statistics. Excitonic phases, archetypical for interaction effect, have attracted significant interest in recent years in double-layer quantum Hall systems where spatially separated electrons and holes form bosonic condensate through Coulomb interaction. Here, employing the approach of quantum Hall antidot with two spatially separated edge channels, we demonstrate a new type of quantum Hall quasiparticle exciton which represents a quantum-coherent bound state of an electron and a hole situated on their corresponding edges coupled through intralayer tunneling and Coulomb interaction. Quantum-coherent dynamics of the exciton is reflected in the observed evolution of the position and magnitude of the antidot conductance peaks around the electron-hole resonance. The quantum Hall antidot setup allows localization and electrical tuning of individual quantum Hall excitons. Quantum superposition of vacuum- and electron-hole pairing states is observed through the gate-dependent tunneling conductance of the antidot. Modeling the electron-hole pair as a coupled two-level system, semi-quantitative understanding of experimental observations is achieved. This work opens avenues for creating quantum systems of multiple quantum Hall quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging reveals electromechanical ionic memory in 2D nanochannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanofluidic memristors promise brain-inspired information processing with ions, yet their microscopic origin remains debated. So far, ionic memory has been attributed to ion-specific interactions, dynamic wetting, chemical reactions or mechanical deformations, yet typically without direct evidence. Here, by combining operando interferometric imaging with electrokinetic measurements, we directly visualize voltage-induced blistering of the confining walls of two-dimensional (2D) nanochannels, as key origin of memristive hysteresis. We identify two distinct classes of blisters: unidirectional, driven by electrostatic forces on surface charges, and bidirectional, arising from osmotic pressure due to concentration polarization. This mechanistic framework explains device evolution and device-to-device variability, and reframes stochastic blistering as a functional design element. Our results constitute a direct proof of electromechanical coupling as a robust pathway to ionic memory in 2D nanochannels and open routes toward high-performance ionic memristors and electrically actuated nanofluidic valves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of comprehensive first-principles and kp-method studies of electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of graphene on a monolayer of CrI$_3$. First, we identify a twist angle between the graphene and CrI$_3$, that positions the graphene Dirac cones within the bandgap of CrI$_3$. Then, we derive the low-energy effective Hamiltonian describing electronic properties of graphene Dirac cones. Subsequently, we examine anomalous and valley Hall conductivity and discuss possible topological phase transition from a quantum anomalous Hall insulator to a trivial insulating state, concomitant a change in the magnetic ground state of CrI$_3$. These findings highlight the potential of strain engineering in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures for controlling topological and magnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Dual-mode operation of ring-shaped spin Hall magnetoresistance sensor with biaxial sensing capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spin Hall magnetoresistance sensor based on a NiFe/Pt multiring bridge structure, which exhibits high sensitivity and good linearity in two perpendicular directions within the sensor plane. Under DC excitation, it responds linearly to magnetic field perpendicular to the current direction, whereas AC excitation enables a linear response with near-zero offset to magnetic field aligned with the current direction, driven by spin-orbit torque effect. Moreover, the AC excitation effectively mitigates low-frequency 1/f noise down to sub-microvolt per sqrt(Hz) at 1 Hz. Systematic investigations have been performed to optimize the NiFe thickness while keeping the Pt thickness at 2 nm. The biaxial sensing capability offers a promising approach for multidimensional magnetic field detection in advanced sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Generic continuum model formalism for moir\'e superlattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moir\'e superlattice system provides an excellent platform for exploring various novel quantum phenomena. To theoretically tackle the diverse correlated and topological states emerging from moir\'e superlattices, one usually adopts an effective low-energy continuum model based on which the electron-electron effects are further considered. However, the construction of an accurate continuum model remains a challenging task, particularly for complex moir\'e superlattices such as twisted transition metal dichalcogenides. In this work, we develop a formalism for constructing generic continuum models that are in principle applicable for arbitrary moir\'e superlattices and are extrapolatable to any twist angles. Our key insight is that the microscopic electronic properties are intrinsic properties of the system, which should remain invariant across all twist angles; the lattice relaxations act as external inputs that vary with twist angles and are coupled with the electrons, and the coupling coefficients are characterized by intrinsic parameters. This partition enables a universal description of the angle variation of the continuum model using a single set of model parameters. To extract the model parameters, we design a numerical workflow based on data from first principles density functional theory calculations. We apply this framework to twisted bilayer MoTe$_{2}$, and obtain a single set of model parameters that accurately reproduce first-principles results, including electronic band structures, charge density distributions and Chern numbers, at three different twist angles. Furthermore, the model extrapolates robustly to smaller twist angles. Our work not only provides a more precise understanding of the microscopic properties of moir\'e superlattices, but also lays a foundation for future theoretical studies of low-energy electronic properties in generic moir\'e superlattice systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian quantum geometric tensor and nonlinear electrical response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the non-Hermitian quantum geometric tensor (QGT) governs nonlinear electrical responses in systems with a spectral line gap. The quantum metric, which is a component of the QGT and takes complex values in non-Hermitian systems, generates an intrinsic nonlinear conductivity independent of the scattering time, while the complex Berry curvature induces a wavepacket-width-dependent response. Using one-dimensional and two-dimensional non-Hermitian models, we establish a universal link between nonlinear dynamics and the QGT, thereby connecting quantum state geometry to observable transport phenomena. Crucially, our analysis indicates that the wavepacket width significantly affects non-Hermitian transport -- a feature absent in Hermitian systems. This framework unifies non-Hermitian response theory by revealing how geometric degrees of freedom encode transport in open and synthetic quantum matter. Our results bridge fundamental quantum geometry with emergent functionality, offering pathways to exploit geometric effects in topological devices and engineered materials.</description>

      <title>Radio-frequency charge detection on graphene electron-hole double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity detection of charge transitions in quantum dots (QDs) is a key ingredient in solid state quantum computation. We demonstrate high-bandwidth radio-frequency charge detection in bilayer graphene quantum dots (QDs) using a capacitively coupled quantum point contact (QPC). The device design suppresses screening effects and enables sensitive QPC-based charge readout. The QPC is arranged to maximize the readout contrast between two neighboring, coupled electron and hole QDs. We apply the readout scheme to a single-particle electron-hole double QD and demonstrate time-resolved detection of charge states as well as magnetic field dependent tunneling rates. This promises a high-fidelity readout scheme for individual spin and valley states, which is important for the operation of spin, valley or spin-valley qubits in bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Mutual synchronization of two asymmetric-nano-constriction-based spin-Hall nano-oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an asymmetric-nanoconstriction (ANC) design of spin-Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) and investigate mutual synchronization of a pair of such devices using micromagnetic simulations. The ANC geometry enables strong dipolar coupling at sub-50 nm separations while preserving independent current bias for each oscillator. We first characterize the auto-oscillation of a single ANC-SHNO, revealing a broad frequency tuning range and a field-controlled crossover between negative and positive nonlinearities. We then demonstrate that two such oscillators can mutually synchronize solely via dipolar stray fields, without electrical or spin-wave coupling. Depending on the bias conditions, the coupled pair exhibits robust in-phase (0{\deg}) or out-of-phase (180{\deg}) locking. Notably, we find a bias-dependent amplitude correlation: when the oscillators sustain comparable amplitudes, both in-phase and out-of-phase synchronization are accessible, whereas amplitude imbalance drives the system into an out-of-phase state accompanied by suppression of the weaker oscillator. By combining strong conservative coupling with independent frequency and gain control, the ANC-SHNO platform provides a scalable route toward phased oscillator arrays, neuromorphic computing architectures, and experimental exploration of non-Hermitian spintronic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Many-body skyrmion interactions in helimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body interactions strongly influence the structure, stability, and dynamics of condensed-matter systems, from atomic lattices to interacting quasi-particles such as superconducting vortices. Here, we investigate theoretically the pairwise and many-body interaction terms among skyrmions in helimagnets, considering both the ferromagnetic and conical spin backgrounds. Using micromagnetic simulations, we separate the exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, and Zeeman contributions to the skyrmion-skyrmion pair potential, and show that the binding energy of skyrmions within the conical phase depends strongly on the film thickness. For small skyrmion clusters in the conical phase, three-body interactions make a substantial contribution to the cohesive energy, comparable to that of pairwise terms, while four-body terms become relevant only at small magnetic fields. As the system approaches the ferromagnetic phase, these higher-order contributions vanish, and the interactions become essentially pairwise. Our results indicate that realistic models of skyrmion interactions in helimagnets in the conical phase must incorporate many-body terms to accurately capture the behavior of skyrmion crystals and guide strategies for controlling skyrmion phases and dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The controlled assembly of solid-state spins with nanoscale spatial precision is an outstanding challenge for quantum technology. Here, we combine DNA-based patterning with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) ensemble quantum sensors in diamond to form and sense programmable 2D arrays of spins. We use DNA origami to control the spacing of chelated Gd$^{3+}$ spins, as verified by the observed linear relationship between proximal NVs' relaxation rate, $1/T_1$, and the engineered number of Gd$^{3+}$ spins per origami unit. We further show that DNA origami provides a robust way of functionalizing the diamond surface with spins as it preserves the charge state and spin coherence of proximal, shallow NV centers. Our work enables the formation and interrogation of ordered, strongly interacting spin networks with applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation. We quantitatively discuss the prospects of entanglement-enhanced metrology and high-throughput proteomics.</description>

      <title>Sinusoidal Displacement Describes Disorder in CsPbBr3 Nanocrystal Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder is an intrinsic feature of all solids, from crystals of atoms to superlattices of colloidal nanoparticles. Unlike atomic crystals, in nanocrystal superlattices a single misplaced particle can affect the positions of neighbors over long distances, leading to cumulative disorder. This elusive form of collective particle displacement leaves clear signatures in diffraction, but little is known about how it accumulates and propagates throughout the superlattice. Here we rationalize propagation and accumulation of disorder in a series of CsPbBr3 nanocrystal superlattices by using synchrotron grazing incidence small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering. CsPbBr3 nanocrystals of colloidal softness S in the range of 0.3-0.7 were obtained by preparing particles with different sizes and ligand mixtures, consisting of oleic acid and primary amines of variable lengths. Most diffraction patterns showed clear signatures of anisotropic disorder, with multilayer diffraction characteristics of high structural coherence visible only for the {100} axial directions and lost in all other directions. As the softness decreased, the superlattices transitioned to a more ordered regime where small-angle diffraction peaks became resolution-limited, and superlattice multilayer diffraction appeared for the (110) diagonal reflections. To rationalize these anisotropies in structural coherence and their dependence on superlattice softness, we propose a sinusoidal displacement model where longitudinal and transverse displacements modulate nanocrystal positions. The model explains experimental observations and advances the understanding of disorder in mesocrystalline systems as they approach the limits of structural perfection.</description>

      <title>Achieving DFT accuracy in short range ordering and stacking fault energy using moment tensor potential for CoCrFeNi and CoCrNi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) such as CoCrFeNi and CoCrNi are promising structural materials owing to their outstanding mechanical and thermal properties, which arise from complex chemical disorder and atomic-scale interactions. Although density functional theory (DFT) has provided fundamental insights into these systems, its high computational cost limits exploration of large-scale phenomena. Classical interatomic potentials have been used to address this gap but often lack the fidelity needed to capture many-body interactions and chemical short-range ordering (CSRO) effects. In this work, we developed a machine-learned Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) to bridge accuracy and efficiency. The MTP was trained on a comprehensive DFT database spanning unary to quaternary configurations and reproduces energies, forces, and stresses with near-DFT accuracy across diverse structural and chemical environments. It accurately predicts elastic properties and recovers compositional trends in bulk and shear moduli in agreement with DFT. Hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations capture CSRO, reproducing key DFT-reported features including Cr-Cr and Fe-Fe repulsion and Ni-Cr ordering. Stacking fault energetics were modeled, yielding ISF energies near 54 mJ/m2 for CoCrNi and 36 mJ/m2 for CoCrFeNi, consistent with DFT predictions. Local chemical environment effects on stacking faults were also resolved: Co-rich planes reduce, whereas Cr- or Fe-rich planes increase, the stacking fault energy. By enabling large-scale, high-fidelity simulations at a fraction of DFT's cost, the developed MTP provides a robust framework for predictive modeling of thermodynamic stability, defect behavior, and mechanical response of FCC MEAs.</description>

      <title>Quantum hierarchical Fokker-Planck equations with U(1) gauge fields: Application to the Aharonov-Bohm ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a three-dimensional subsystem under a time-dependent U(1) gauge field coupled to rotationally invariant environments. To capture the dynamic behavior of the subsystem under thermal excitations and dissipations, it is imperative to treat the bath in a non-Markovian and nonperturbative manner. This is because quantum noise is constrained by the uncertainty principle, which dictates the relationship between the noise correlation time and the amplitude of the energy fluctuation. To this end, we derive the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) incorporating the gauge field, enabling a rigorous investigation of the dynamics of the reduced subsystem. Transforming the HEOM into the Wigner representation yields quantum hierarchical Fokker-Planck equations [U(1)-QHFPE] with U(1) gauge fields. These equations incorporate vector fields into the damping operators while preserving both gauge invariance and rotational symmetry. To demonstrate the practical use of the formalism, the effects of a heat bath in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring. Our investigation includes simulations of the equilibrium distribution, linear absorption spectra, and AB currents under thermal conditions. Within a rotationally invariant system-bath (RISB) model, we predict the emergence of a persistent current even in dissipative environments, provided the bath is non-Markovian and the temperature is sufficiently low. We also assessed the validity of the Caldeira-Leggett model in this context.</description>

      <title>Heralded Emission Detection in Quantum Dot Solids under Twin-Photon Excitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing quantum correlations between photons is an emerging direction in optical spectroscopy, but experimental progress has thus far been limited to fluorescence-detected studies of molecular systems at room temperature. Here, we demonstrate heralded emission detection (HED) under continuous-wave (CW) entangled-photon excitation of near-infrared (NIR)-emitting colloidal III-V quantum dots (QDs) at low temperatures. We use superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) and large-area NIR avalanche photodiodes (APDs) to maximize the time resolution ($\sim$70 ps) and emission count rates ($\sim$2000 cps). To our knowledge, these results represent the first demonstration of HED in the solid state and establish NIR QDs as a bright, tunable model system with longer-lived coherences and integrability with optical cavities as an additional experimental control knob.</description>

      <title>Readout of a solid state spin ensemble at the projection noise limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin ensembles are central to quantum science, from frequency standards and fundamental physics searches to magnetic resonance spectroscopy and quantum sensing. Their performance is ultimately constrained by spin projection noise, yet solid-state implementations have so far been limited by much larger photon shot noise. Here we demonstrate a direct, quantum non-demolition readout of a mesoscopic ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond that surpasses the photon shot-noise limit and approaches the intrinsic spin projection noise. By stabilizing the $^{14}$N nuclear spin bath at high magnetic fields and employing repetitive nuclear-assisted spin readout, we achieve a noise reduction of 3.8 dB below the thermal projection noise level. This enables direct access to the intrinsic fluctuations of the spin ensemble, allowing us to directly observe the signatures of correlated spin states. Our results establish projection noise-limited readout as a practical tool for solid-state quantum sensors, opening pathways to quantum-enhanced metrology, direct detection of many-body correlations, and the implementation of spin squeezing in mesoscopic solid-state ensembles.</description>

      <title>Multi-block exceptional points in open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems can be approximately described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians (NHHs) and Lindbladians. The two approaches differ by quantum jump terms corresponding to a measurement of the system by its environment. We analyze the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in NHHs and Lindbladians. In particular, we show how EPs in NHHs relate to a novel type of EPs -- multi-block EPs -- in the non-Hermitian Liouvillian, i.e. the Lindbladian in absence of quantum jump terms. We further analyze how quantum jump terms modify the multi-block structure. To illustrate our general findings, we present two prime examples: qubits and qutrits coupled to additional ground state levels that serves as sinks of the population. In those examples, we can navigate through the EP block structure by a variation of physical parameters. We analyze how the dynamics of the population of the states is affected by the order of the EPs. Additionally, we demonstrate that the quantum geometric tensor serves as a sensitive indicator of EPs of different kinds.</description>

      <title>-Continuum limit of bipartite lattices - The SSH model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a continuous non-local model that faithfully replicates the rich topological and spectral features of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Remarkably, our model shares the SSH models bulk energy spectrum, eigenstates, and Zak phase, hallmarks of its topological character, while introducing a tunable length-scale a quantifying non-locality. This parameter allows for a controlled interpolation between non-local and local regimes. Furthermore, for a specific value of a the exact spectral equivalence to the discrete SSH model is established. Distinct from previous continuous analogues based on Schr\"odinger or Dirac-type Hamiltonians, our approach maintains chiral symmetry, does not require an external potential and features periodic energy bands. On finite domains, the model supports a flat band with zero energy formed by a countable infinite set of exponentially localized zero-energy edge states of topological origin. Beyond SSH, our method lays the foundation for constructing non-local, continuous analogues of a wide class of bipartite and multipartite lattices, opening new paths for theoretical exploration and new challenges for experimental realization in topological quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Magnetic Anisotropy Energy of MoS$_2$-supported Mn$_{12}$ complexes by Electric Field: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine low-energy adsorption configurations of four dodecanuclear manganese single-molecule magnets [Mn$_{12}$O$_{12}$(O$_2$CR)$_{16}$(H$_2$O)$_4$] (Mn$_{12}$), where the ligand R being H, CH$_3$, CHCl$_2$ or C$_6$H$_5$, on a molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) monolayer using force field and density functional theory calculations. The van der Waals interaction is shown to be crucial for determining the adsorption energy. Some electrons transfer from the substrate to the molecules upon surface adsorption, resulting in a reduction of the magnetic anisotropy energy of Mn$_{12}$. Since the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of Mn$_{12}$ is close to the valence band of MoS$_2$, a negative electric field is more effective in modulating charge transfer and energy band alignment, and thus altering the magnetic anisotropy energy, compared with a positive electric field. A significant increase in the magnetic anisotropy energy of Mn$_{12}$ with the ligand R=CHCl$_2$ or R=C$_6$H$_5$ under a sufficiently high electric field has been predicted. Our calculations show that the molecules remain intact on the surface both before and after the electric field is applied. Finally, a two-level system formed by different adsorption configurations is evaluated, and the tunability of its energy barrier under an electric field is demonstrated. Our study sheds light on tuning the properties of single-molecule magnets using an electric field, when the molecules are supported on a surface.</description>

      <title>From hidden order to skyrmions: Quantum Hall states in an extended Hofstadter-Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between topology and strong interactions gives rise to a variety of exotic quantum phases, including fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and their lattice analogs - fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Such topologically ordered states host fractionalized excitations, which for spinful systems are often accompanied by ferromagnetism and skyrmions. Here, we study a Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized $\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order. We further investigate the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $\nu=1$ and its skyrmionic excitations upon doping. In particular, we find that nearest-neighbor repulsion is sufficient to stabilize both particle- and hole-skyrmions in the ground state around $\nu=1$, whereas we do not find such textures around $\nu=\frac{1}{3}$. The diagnostic toolbox presented in this work, based on local densities, correlation functions, and spin-resolved observables, is directly applicable in quantum gas microscopy experiments. Our results open new pathways for experimental exploration of FCIs with spin textures in both ultracold atom and electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarization and diode effect in thermoelectric current through altermagnet-based superconductor heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advent of a new class of magnetic material named as altermagnet (AM), characterized by a combination of momentum-dependent spin-splitting with zero net magnetization, has opened up promising prospects for spintronic applications. We theoretically explore how the altermagnetic spin-splitting affects the thermoelectric quasiparticle current in AM-based superconducting heterostructures. Our setup comprises of a bilayer system where a $d$-wave AM is proximity coupled to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor (SC). We calculate the thermoelectric current carried by the quasiparticles applying a finite thermal bias accross the junction. The behavior of the thermoelectric current with the system's base temperature and chemical potential is very similar to that in traditional SC heterostructures. Remarkably, the dissipative thermoelectric current found in the AM junction is spin-split and thus generates finite spin-polarization in the AM-based junction, which can approach $100\%$ spin-polarization in the strong altermagnetic phase. We further investigate the thermoelectric current in AM-based Josephson junction (JJ) and illustrate how to achieve the diode effect in this AM-based JJ. The efficiency of our proposed thermoelectric diode reaches upto $\sim 80\%$ and changes its sign depending on the strength of the AM, enhancing the potential for spin-calotronics applications.</description>

      <title>Grain boundary-limited thermal transport in suspended thin graphite across an unexplored thickness regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10704v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present systematic thermal conductivity measurements of suspended thin graphite ribbons, 234-527 nm thick, using a four-probe 3-omega method. Unlike recent reports of phonon hydrodynamics and exceptionally high thermal conductivity in micrometer-thick graphite (Science, 2020),we observe significantly lower thermal conductivity and no signatures of collective phonon flow in this intermediate thickness regime. Instead, our measured thermal conductivity lies between few-layer graphene and bulk graphite.These results agree with a first-principles-informed Peierls-Boltzmann transport model with spatially resolved Monte Carlo sampling. Additionally, the temperature for the peak thermal conductivity shifts lower with increasing thickness, due to the interplay of phonon-boundary and phonon-isotope scattering. Incorporating grain boundary scattering into simulations is necessary to replicate the experimental trends. These findings delineate the boundary between ballistic, hydrodynamic, and diffusive transport regimes in graphite, and underscore the dominant role of disorder and geometry in phonon transport in quasi-two-dimensional materials, offering insights for nanoscale thermal management.</description>

Abstract: We investigate gradual development of the quasiparticle states in two quantum dots attached to opposite sides of the topological superconducting nanowire, hosting the boundary modes. Specifically, we explore the non-equilibrium cross-correlations transmitted between these quantum dots via the zero-energy Majorana modes. From the analytical and numerical results we reveal nonlocal features in the transient behavior of electron pairing, which subsequently cease while the hybrid structure evolves towards its asymptotic steady limit configuration. We estimate duration of these temporary nonlocal phenomena and inspect their possible manifestation in the quench-driven processes. Such dynamical effects might play an important role in braiding protocols of the topological and/or conventional superconducting quantum bits using nanoscopic hybrid structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanopatterned magnetic thin films offer a platform for exploration of tailored magnetic properties such as emergent long-range order. A prominent example is artificial spin ice (ASI), where an arrangement of nanoscale magnetic elements, acting as macrospins, interact via their dipolar fields. In this study, we discuss the transition from antiferromagnetic (AFM) to ferromagnetic (FM) long-range order in a square lattice ASI, as the magnetic elements are gradually rotated through 45{\deg} to a "pinwheel" configuration. The AFM$\unicode{x2013}$FM transition is observed experimentally using synchrotron radiation x-ray spectromicroscopy and occurs for a certain rotation angle of the nanomagnets, dependent on the dipolar coupling strength determined by the separation of the magnets in the lattice. Large-scale magnetic dipole simulations show that the point-dipole approximation fails to capture the correct AFM$\unicode{x2013}$FM transition angle. However, excellent agreement with experimental data is obtained using a dumbbell-dipole model which better reflects the actual dipolar fields of the magnets. This model also explains the coupling dependence of the transition angle, another feature not captured by the point-dipole model. Our findings resolve a discrepancy between measurement and theory in previous work on "pinwheel" ASIs and establish the coupling dependence of the AFM-FM transition. The revised dipole model, with a more accurate representation of the stray field, offers more precise control of magnetic order in artificial spin systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum free electrons, i.e. plane waves, with wavevector k, and occupancy constrained by the Pauli exclusion principle, are explained in all solid state physics texts. Although overly simplified, free-electron theory works surprisingly well for many properties of simple metals. For bulk materials, it is assumed that the sample is effectively infinite and that surfaces are irrelevant. Over the past 30 years, experiments that visualize surfaces and enable the study of 2-d materials have revolutionized solid state physics, stimulating new experiment, theory, and applications. Modified free electron models, adapted to films, have enabled modeling of electronic properties of films. This paper analyzes three such models: periodic boundary conditions, hard-wall boundary conditions, and soft-wall (SW) boundary conditions, in order of increasing realism. The SW case is illustrated for an aluminum film consisting of six atomic layers, comparing SW free-electron theory with a scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiment.</description>

Abstract: We study spin polarization induced by locally injected electric currents in a metal whose spin--orbit interaction reflects its structural chirality. We reveal both spin polarization in bulk in the linear response and antiparallel spin polarization near the boundary in the quadratic response against electric fields, and reproduce the experimentally observed correlation between the chirality of the metal and the direction of spin polarization. In particular, we elucidate that the sign of the quadratic spin accumulation is opposite to that expected from the bulk spin current. This sign discrepancy originates from the dipole-like charge distribution appearing in the quadratic response. Our method is applicable to a wide range of real materials with various types of spin--orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Theory of Tunneling between Two-Dimensional Electron Layers Driven by Spin Pumping: Adiabatic Regime and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tunneling spectroscopy between parallel two-dimensional (2D) electronic systems provides a powerful method to probe the underlying electronic properties by measuring tunneling conductance. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for spin transport in 2D-to-2D tunneling systems, driven by spin pumping. This theory applies to a vertical heterostructure where two layers of metallic 2D electron systems are separated by an insulating barrier, with one layer exchange-coupled to a magnetic layer driven at resonance. Utilizing a non-perturbative Floquet-Keldysh formalism, we derive general expressions for the tunneling spin and charge currents across a broad range of driving frequencies, extending beyond the traditional adiabatic pumping regime. At low frequencies, we obtain analytical results that recover the known behaviors in the adiabatic regime. However, at higher frequencies, our numerical findings reveal significant deviations in the dependence of spin and charge currents on both frequency and precession angle. This work offers fresh insights into the role of magnetization dynamics in tunneling transport, opening up new avenues for exploring non-adiabatic spin pumping phenomena.</description>

      <title>Approaching the ultrastrong coupling regime between an Andreev level and a microwave resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Josephson junctions formed in semiconductor nanowires host Andreev bound states and serve as a physical platform to realize Andreev qubits tuned by electrostatic gating. With the Andreev bound state being confined to the nanoscale weak link, it couples to a circuit-QED architecture via the state-dependent supercurrent flowing through the weak link. Thus, increasing this coupling strength is a crucial challenge for this architecture. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication and microwave characterization of a weak link which is defined in an InAs-Al (core-half shell) nanowire and embedded in a superconducting loop with a lumped-element resonator patterned from a thin NbTiN film with high kinetic inductance. We investigated several devices with various weak link lengths and performed spectroscopy that revealed pair transitions and single-quasiparticle transitions arising from spin-orbit split Andreev bound states. Our approach offers a compact geometry and a large resonator impedance above 12 k$\Omega$ at a resonator frequency of 8 GHz, which facilitates large coupling in the system. For the pair transitions, the experimentally observed energy level splitting demonstrates the coupling to an Andreev level of 490 MHz. We apply a perturbative model that shows good agreement with the experimental data and extract the maximum coupling of 968~MHz. Moreover, we show that the coupling is even stronger to an Andreev level with a higher transmission. In addition, spectroscopy of single-quasiparticle transitions reveals spin-orbit split Andreev bound states with the extracted spin-photon coupling of 77 MHz.</description>

Abstract: We present the emergence of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in semiconductor-based artificial graphene with realistic Coulomb interaction using high-precision variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods, complemented by exact diagonalization calculations of the generalized Hubbard model. We analyze models of armchair hexagonal geometries nanopatterned on GaAs quantum wells. Our results reveal a distinct magnetic phase transition driven by the absence/addition of a single electron at half-filling. This form of itinerant magnetism predicted rigorously for Hubbard model remained unascertained in large scale realistic systems. We demonstrate that Coulomb scattering terms play a crucial role in stabilizing Nagaoka ferromagnetism, enabling the observation of the phase transition for system parameters near $U/t \approx 60$.</description>

      <title>Robust Wave Splitters Based on Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have discovered specific conditions for generic scattering systems to act as wave splitters that are robust to any change in relative amplitude or phase of an arbitrary injected waveform. Specifically for complex systems with tunable parameters, these conditions for robust splitting (RS) are abundant, and by using multiple tunable parameters the relative amplitude and phase of the output signals can also be tuned. The splitting property of the systems works for all possible input phase differences and amplitude ratios and does not require a particular coherent input signal. We show experimentally that the fixed splitting ratios and output phases at RS conditions are robust to 100 dB of relative power and 2$\pi$ phase changes of the input waves to a complex non-Hermitian two-port system. We also demonstrate that the splitting power ratio can be tuned by multiple orders of magnitude and the RS conditions can be tuned to any desired frequency with suitable tunable perturbations embedded in the system. Although this phenomenon is realized in two-port systems and involves some degree of attenuation, tunable robust splitting can be achieved between any two ports of multiport systems. These results are general to all wave scattering phenomena (electromagnetic, acoustic, etc.) and hold in generic complex scattering systems.</description>

      <title>Unconventional tunnel magnetoresistance scaling with altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) typically increases with barrier thickness as electron transmission in the antiparallel configuration decays faster than that of the parallel configuration. In this work, we reveal an anomalous scaling effect in altermagnetic tunnel junctions (AMTJs), where the TMR decreases anomalously with an increasing barrier thickness. The anomalous scaling originates from the overlapping spin-split branches forming a transmission path that cannot be suppressed in the antiparallel state. Such phenomenon is explained by a double-barrier model and is further demonstrated using ab initio quantum transport simulations in 2D V2Te2O/Cr2Se2O/V2Te2O and V2Te2O/ZnSe/V2Te2O AMTJs. Our work identifies a peculiar unexpected transport characteristic of AMTJ, providing a fundamental limit on AMTJ device design and illustrating the potential optimal design of AMTJ at the ultrascaled monolayer limit.</description>

      <title>Long-range ballistic transport of indirect excitons in a van der Waals heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exciton transport is fundamental for understanding transport phenomena in bosonic systems and for exploring excitation energy transfer in materials. Spatially indirect excitons (IXs) are composed of electrons and holes in separated layers. Long IX lifetimes allow them to form quantum bosonic states and travel long distances. In this work, we measured IX transport kinetics in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure by time-resolved imaging of IX cloud expansion. We found efficient IX transport. Describing this transport as diffusive gives anomalously high diffusivity, orders of magnitude higher than for regular diffusive exciton transport in van der Waals heterostructures. The IX transport kinetics shows that this efficient IX transport is long-range ballistic transport.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchy of Superconductivity and Topological Charge Density Wave States in Rhombohedral Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect are conventionally regarded as mutually exclusive: superconductivity is suppressed by magnetic fields, whereas the quantum Hall effect relies on them. Here we report a striking exception, where an unconventional superconducting phase is stabilized by an out-of-plane magnetic field and coexists with a re-entrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) effect in moir\'e-less rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. The re-entrant quantum Hall state, arising from a bubble-like charge density wave (CDW), provides a natural backdrop for the emergence of superconductivity. Angle-resolved transport reveals that the field-stabilized superconducting phase occupies the same density--displacement-field regime as a stripe-ordered phase at zero field, yet only develops once the stripe is replaced by a bubble-like CDW at finite field. These findings demonstrate a decisive role of CDW order in stabilizing superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene, establishing a new paradigm for the interplay between superconductivity and quantum Hall physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While tremendous research has revealed that symmetry enriches topological phases of matter, more general principles that protect topological phases have yet to be explored. In this Letter, we elucidate the roles of subspaces in free-fermionic topological phases. A subspace property for Hamiltonians enables us to define new topological invariants. It results in peculiar topological boundary phenomena, i.e., the emergence of an unpaired zero mode or zero-winding skin modes, characterizing subspace-protected topological phases. We establish and demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence in subspace-protected topological phases. We further discuss the interplay of the subspace property and internal symmetries. Toward application, we also propose possible platforms possessing the subspace property.</description>

      <title>Quantum adiabaticity in many-body systems and almost-orthogonality in complementary subspace</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate why, in quantum many-body systems, the adiabatic fidelity and the overlap between the initial state and instantaneous ground states often yield nearly identical values. Our analysis suggests that this phenomenon results from an interplay between two intrinsic limits of many-body systems: the limit of small evolution parameters and the limit of large system sizes. In the former case, conventional perturbation theory provides a straightforward explanation. In the latter case, a key insight is that pairs of vectors in the Hilbert space orthogonal to the initial state tend to become nearly orthogonal as the system size increases. We illustrate these general findings with two representative models of driven many-body systems: the driven Rice-Mele model and the driven interacting Kitaev chain model.</description>

      <title>Correlated Phases in Spin-Orbit-Coupled Rhombohedral Trilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments indicate that crystalline graphene multilayers exhibit much of the richness of their twisted counterparts, including cascades of symmetry-broken states and unconventional superconductivity. Interfacing Bernal bilayer graphene with a WSe$_2$ monolayer was shown to dramatically enhance superconductivity -- suggesting that proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling plays a key role in promoting Cooper pairing. Motivated by this observation, we study the phase diagram of spin-orbit-coupled rhombohedral trilayer graphene via self-consistent Hartree-Fock simulations, elucidating the interplay between displacement field effects, long-range Coulomb repulsion, short-range (Hund's) interactions, and substrate-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. In addition to generalized Stoner ferromagnets, we find various flavors of intervalley coherent ground states distinguished by their transformation properties under electronic time reversal, $\text{C}_3$ rotations, and an effective anti-unitary symmetry. We pay particular attention to broken-symmetry phases that yield Fermi surfaces compatible with zero-momentum Cooper pairing, identifying promising candidate orders that may support spin-orbit-enhanced superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10828v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Luttinger model is a paradigm for the breakdown due to interactions of the Fermi liquid description of one-dimensional massless Dirac fermions. Attempts to discretize the model on a one-dimensional lattice have failed to reproduce the established bosonization results, because of the fermion-doubling obstruction: A local and symmetry-preserving discretization of the Hamiltonian introduces a spurious second species of low-energy excitations, while a nonlocal discretization opens a single-particle gap at the Dirac point. Here we show how to work around this obstruction, by discretizing both space and time to obtain a \textit{local} Lagrangian for a helical Luttinger liquid with Hubbard interaction. The approach enables quantum Monte Carlo simulations that preserve the topological protection of an unpaired Dirac cone.</description>

      <title>Power Laws for the Thermal Slip Length of a Liquid/Solid Interface From the Structure and Frequency Response of the Contact Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05443v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today's powerful integrated chips for information processing, computer graphics and visualization generate so much heat that liquid based cooling is now indispensable to prevent breakdown from thermal runaway effects. While thermal convection schemes using two-phase cooling in microfluidic networks or liquid immersion are proving effective, further progress requires tackling the intrinsic thermal resistance of a liquid/solid (L/S) interface, quantified by the thermal slip length. Theoretical models and experimental tools for estimating this length have been developed for superfluid/metal interfaces but no comparable tools exist for systems at non-cryogenic temperatures. Researchers have therefore come to rely heavily on non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to understand the influence of various parameters. But despite considerable effort, no actual relations have been proposed. Our study of 180 systems describing a liquid layer confined between identical crystals at different temperatures highlights the influence of correlated behavior throughout the L/S contact zone. When rescaled by key variables in the zone, the data for the thermal slip length exhibit excellent collapse onto two power law relations dependent on the peak value of the in-plane structure factor of the first liquid layer and the ratio of dominant frequencies pegged to the maxima in the vibrational density of states of the first liquid and solid layer. We hope that this perspective, which highlights the critical role of surface localized phonons in L/S systems, can now better guide development of analytic models and de novo interface designs for minimizing thermal slip.</description>

Abstract: The increasing demand for sustainable energy solutions necessitates advancements in hydrogen storage technologies. This study investigates the hydrogen adsorption characteristics of graphene and a (8,0) carbon nanotube (CNT) decorated with adatoms of various elements. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the universal interatomic potential 'PreFerred Potential' (PFP) implemented in the Matlantis framework, we explore the hydrogen storage capabilities of these doped carbon structures at 77K. We analyze the adsorption efficiency based on the position of adatoms (top, bridge, and hollow sites) and find that the group II elements, such as calcium and strontium, exhibit significant hydrogen uptake. Additionally, light elements like lithium and sodium demonstrate enhanced gravimetric hydrogen storage due to their low atomic mass. Our findings provide insights into the potential of doped graphene and CNTs for efficient hydrogen storage applications.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian dynamics of generation of bound states in the continuum via single-photon scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The excitation of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in two- or multi-qubit systems lies at the heart of entanglement generation and harnessing in Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics platforms. However, the generation of qubit pair BICs through single-photon scattering is hindered by the fact that these states are effectively decoupled from propagating photons. We prove that scattering of a parity-invariant single photon on a qubit pair, combined with a properly engineered time variation of the qubit detuning, is not only feasible, but also more effective than strategies based on the relaxation of the excited states of the qubits when the distance between the qubits gives rise to non-negligible photon delays (non-Markovian regime). The use of tensor network methods to simulate the proposed scheme enables to include such photon delays in collision models, thus opening the possibility to follow the time evolution of the full quantum system, including qubits and field, and to efficiently implement and characterize the dynamics hence identifying optimal working points for the BIC generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structured light offers a powerful approach to tailor light-matter interactions in quantum systems with chiral properties. While chirality has been extensively studied in passive platforms, the role of optical gain in controlling chiral quantum dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of qubits interacting with structured gain environments, where amplification depends on the light's polarization or momentum. By quantizing the electromagnetic field in linear bianisotropic media with gain and extending the Lindblad formalism to these settings, we derive a master equation governing the qubit's irreversible evolution. We show that chiral gain can break time-reversal symmetry and drive the system toward a symmetry-broken steady state with nonreciprocal properties. This effect is illustrated in detail for moving plasmonic substrates, which exhibit inherently chiral gain that selectively amplifies transitions of a given handedness. Our results establish chiral gain as a novel mechanism for engineering nonreciprocal quantum steady states.</description>

      <title>Observation of Perfect Absorption in Hyperfine Levels of Molecular Spins with Hermitian Subspaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate Perfect Absorption (PA) of radiation, in which incoming energy is entirely dissipated, in a system consisting of molecular spin centers coherently coupled to a planar microwave resonator operated at milliKelvin temperature and in the single photon regime. This platform allows us to fine tune the spin-photon coupling and to control the effective dissipation of the two subsystems towards the environment, thus giving us the opportunity to span over a wide space of parameters. Our system can be effectively described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian exhibiting distinct Hermitian subspaces. We experimentally show that these subspaces, linked to the presence of PA, can be engineered through the resonator-spin detuning, which controls the composition of the polaritons in terms of photon and spin content. In such a way, the required balance between the feeding and the loss rates is effectively recovered even in the absence of PT-symmetry. We show that Hermitian subspaces influence the overall aspect of coherent spectra of cavity QED systems and enlarge the possibility to explore non-Hermitian effects in open quantum systems. We finally discuss how our results can be potentially exploited for applications, in particular as single-photon switches and modulators.</description>

      <title>A superinductor in a deep sub-micron integrated circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superinductors are circuit elements characterised by an intrinsic impedance in excess of the superconducting resistance quantum ($R_\text{Q}\approx6.45~$k$\Omega$), with applications from metrology and sensing to quantum computing. However, they are typically obtained using exotic materials with high density inductance such as Josephson junctions, superconducting nanowires or twisted two-dimensional materials. Here, we present a superinductor realised within a silicon integrated circuit (IC), exploiting the high kinetic inductance ($\sim 1$~nH/$\square$) of TiN thin films native to the manufacturing process (22-nm FDSOI). By interfacing the superinductor to a silicon quantum dot formed within the same IC, we demonstrate a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rfSET), the most widely used sensor in semiconductor-based quantum computers. The integrated nature of the rfSET reduces its parasitics which, together with the high impedance, yields a sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art, combined with a 10,000-fold area reduction. Beyond providing the basis for dense arrays of integrated and high-performance qubit sensors, the realization of high-kinetic-inductance superconducting devices integrated within modern silicon ICs opens many opportunities, including kinetic-inductance detector arrays for astronomy and the study of metamaterials and quantum simulators based on 1D and 2D resonator arrays.</description>
