      <title>URBAN-SPIN: A street-level bikeability index to inform design implementations in historical city centres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cycling is reported by an average of 35\% of adults at least once per week across 28 countries, and as vulnerable road users directly exposed to their surroundings, cyclists experience the street at an intensity unmatched by other modes. Yet the street-level features that shape this experience remain under-analysed, particularly in historical urban contexts where spatial constraints rule out large-scale infrastructural change and where typological context is often overlooked. This study develops a perception-led, typology-based, and data-integrated framework that explicitly models street typologies and their sub-classifications to evaluate how visual and spatial configurations shape cycling experience. Drawing on the Cambridge Cycling Experience Video Dataset (CCEVD), a first-person and handlebar-mounted corpus developed in this study, we extract fine-grained streetscape indicators with computer vision and pair them with built-environment variables and subjective ratings from a Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD) survey, thereby constructing a typology-sensitive Bikeability Index that integrates subjective and perceived dimensions with physical metrics for segment-level comparison. Statistical analysis shows that perceived bikeability arises from cumulative, context-specific interactions among features. While greenness and openness consistently enhance comfort and pleasure, enclosure, imageability, and building continuity display threshold or divergent effects contingent on street type and subtype. AI-assisted visual redesigns further demonstrate that subtle, targeted changes can yield meaningful perceptual gains without large-scale structural interventions. The framework offers a transferable model for evaluating and improving cycling conditions in heritage cities through perceptually attuned, typology-aware design strategies.</description>

      <title>Fiscal Dynamics in Japan under Demographic Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Japan's population is shrinking, the share of working-age people is falling, and the number of elderly is growing fast. These trends squeeze public finances from both sides--fewer people paying taxes and more people drawing on pensions and healthcare. Policy discussions often focus on one fix at a time, such as raising taxes, reforming pensions, or boosting productivity. However, these levers interact with each other through feedback loops and time delays that are not yet well understood. This study builds and calibrates an integrated system dynamics model that connects demographics, labor supply, economic output, and public finance to explore two questions: (RQ1) What feedback structure links demographic change to fiscal outcomes, and how do different policy levers work through that structure? (RQ2) Which combinations of policies can stabilize key fiscal indicators within a meaningful timeframe? The model, grounded in official statistics, tracks historical trends reasonably well. Policy experiments show that productivity improvements and controlling per-person costs offer the most effective near-term relief, because they act quickly through revenue and spending channels. In contrast, raising fertility actually worsens the fiscal picture in the medium term, since it takes decades for newborns to grow up and join the workforce. A combined scenario pairing moderate productivity gains with moderate cost control nearly eliminates the deficit by 2050. These findings underscore the importance of timing when evaluating demographic policy. Stabilizing finances within a practical timeframe requires levers that improve the budget directly, rather than those that work through slow demographic channels. The model serves as a transparent testing ground for designing time-aware fiscal policy packages in aging, high-debt economies.</description>

      <title>Silence Routing: When Not Speaking Improves Collective Judgment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wisdom of crowds has been shown to operate not only for factual judgments but also in matters of taste, where accuracy is defined relative to an individual's preferences. However, it remains unclear how different types of social signals should be selectively used in such domains. Focusing on a music preference dataset in which contributors provide both personal evaluations (Own) and estimates of population-level preferences (Estimated), we propose a routing framework for collective intelligence in taste. The framework specifies when contributors should speak, what they should report, and when silence is preferable. Using simulation-based aggregation, we show that prediction accuracy improves over an all-own baseline across a broad region of the parameter space, conditional on items where routing applies. Importantly, these gains arise only when silence is allowed, enabling second-order signals to function effectively. The results demonstrate that collective intelligence in matters of taste depends on principled signal routing rather than simple averaging.</description>

      <title>Detecting Network Instability via Multiscale Detrended Cross-Correlations and MST Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a multiscale measure of network instability based on the joint use of Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA) and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) filtering. The proposed metric, the Elastic Detrended Cross-Correlation Ratio (Elastic DCCR), is defined as a finite-difference measure of the logarithmic sensitivity of the average MST length to the observation scale. It captures how the structure of cross-correlation networks deforms across different investment horizons. When applied to a network of global equity indices, the Elastic DCCR rises sharply during episodes of financial stress, reflecting increased short-term coordination among investors and a contraction of correlation distances. The measure reveals scale-dependent reconfigurations in network topology that are not visible in single-scale analyses, and highlights clear differences between stressed and stable market regimes. The approach does not assume covariance stationarity and relies only on scale-dependent detrended correlations; as a result, it is broadly applicable to other complex systems in which interaction strength varies with scale.</description>

      <title>Transforming Policy-Car Swerving for Mitigating Stop-and-Go Traffic Waves: A Practice-Oriented Jam-Absorption Driving Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stop-and-go waves, as a major form of freeway traffic congestion, cause severe and long-lasting adverse effects, including reduced traffic efficiency, increased driving risks, and higher vehicle emissions. Amongst the highway traffic management strategies, jam-absorption driving (JAD), in which a dedicated vehicle performs "slow-in" and "fast-out" maneuvers before being captured by a stop-and-go wave, has been proposed as a potential method for preventing the propagation of such waves. However, most existing JAD strategies remain impractical mainly due to the lack of discussion regarding implementation vehicles and operational conditions. Inspired by real-world observations of police-car swerving behavior, this paper first introduces a Single-Vehicle Two-Detector Jam-Absorption Driving (SVDD-JAD) problem, and then proposes a practical JAD strategy that transforms such behavior into a maneuver capable of suppressing the propagation of an isolated stop-and-go wave. Five key parameters that significantly affect the proposed strategy, namely, JAD speed, inflow traffic speed, wave width, wave speed, and in-wave speed, are identified and systematically analyzed. Using a SUMO-based simulation as an illustrative example, we further demonstrate how these parameters can be measured in practice with two stationary roadside traffic detectors. The results show that the proposed JAD strategy successfully suppresses the propagation of a stop-and-go wave, without triggering a secondary wave. This paper is expected to take a significant step toward making JAD practical, advancing it from a theoretical concept to a feasible and implementable strategy. To promote reproducibility in the transportation domain, we have also open-sourced all the code on our GitHub repository https://github.com/gotrafficgo.</description>

      <title>Two phase transitions in modular multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular networks, such as critical infrastructures, are often built from distinct, densely connected modules (e.g., cities) that are sparsely interconnected. When such networks are gradually and randomly disrupted under a percolation process, they undergo two critical phase transitions. The first transition occurs when modules become isolated from one another, while the second corresponds to the collapse of the entire network, including the internal connectivity of the modules. Here, we study these phase transitions in modular multiplex networks and compare them with those observed in single-layer modular networks. We focus on models in which the modules are arranged and connected either as a Random Regular network or as a two-dimensional square lattice. We show here that these systems exhibit diverse transition behaviors, with some transitions occurring continuously and others abruptly; notably, one realistic model could display two distinct first-order transitions in the same system. For the modular Random Regular multiplex, we further characterize the spatial transition through its scaling behavior, revealing signatures of a mixed-order phase transitions. In addition, we analytically determine the critical threshold at which modules become disconnected. Our results highlight the crucial role of modular organization and the critical role of interdependence in shaping network vulnerabilities under failures.</description>

      <title>Pivoting as an Adaptive Strategy to Geopolitical Tensions in U.S. Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geopolitical tensions increasingly reshape the structure and openness of global science, yet we still lack a clear understanding of how successfully scientists adapt their work under such pressures. Using millions of funding and publication datasets across the past ten years, we investigate how U.S. China geopolitical tensions reshaped individual research activities of U.S. based scientists, particularly those collaborating with Chinese peers. We find that although U.S. China geopolitical tensions significantly reduce funding opportunities, many scientists actively respond by pivoting their research portfolios toward alternative topics, and this adaptive reorientation partially mitigates funding losses. Crucially, the effectiveness of this adaptive strategy is highly unequal: for scientists in high risk domains, those of Asian descent, and early-career scientists, pivoting offers only limited protection against funding loss. Our results demonstrate that geopolitical tensions reshape science through shifts in scientists' strategic decisions about their research focus. Understanding this adaptive but uneven reconfiguration is essential for science policies to strengthen the resilience and inclusiveness of the scientific enterprise.</description>

      <title>The selective use of physics knowledge in policy: how interdisciplinary physics bridges subfields and shapes policy influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific knowledge has become central to policymaking as societies face challenges related to technological change, climate risk, and public health. Despite the growing emphasis on evidence-based policy, a systematic understanding of how science is selectively used in policy, specifically which forms of knowledge are preferred and which scientific citations translate into influence, remains limited. We address these questions by constructing a novel dataset that links policy documents from the Overton database with publications from the American Physical Society, enabling an analysis of how physics knowledge enters and circulates in policy discourse. Using subfield classifications, we provide quantitative evidence for a gap between scientific communities and policymakers. First, we find that policy documents draw on broad and interdisciplinary areas of physics, such as General Physics and Interdisciplinary Physics, rather than mirroring the structure of physics research production. Second, we identify substantial institutional heterogeneity with systematic differences in subfield preferences across policy producing organizations and topics. Third, network analysis reveals that interdisciplinary areas of physics act as a central bridge connecting specialized subfields. Finally, regression analysis reveals a clear separation between policy visibility and policy influence. While interdisciplinary areas facilitate entry into policy discourse, it does not necessarily increase downstream policy influence. Conversely, documents citing geophysics are associated with approximately 24 percent higher policy influence, likely driven by the political salience of climate change policy. Our findings underscore the distinction between scientific visibility and policy influence, contributing to a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between scientific communities and policy system.</description>

      <title>Detecting and forecasting tipping points from sample variance alone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anticipating tipping points in complex systems is a fundamental challenge across domains. Traditional early warning signals (EWSs) based on critical slowing down, such as increasing sample variance, are widely used, but their ability to reliably indicate imminent bifurcations and forecast their timing remains limited. Here, we introduce TIPMOC (TIpping via Power-law fits and MOdel Comparison), a parametric framework designed to statistically detect the approach of a bifurcation and estimate its future location using only the sample variance. TIPMOC exploits the mathematical property that variance diverges with a characteristic power-law form near codimension-one bifurcations. By sequentially monitoring system variance as a control parameter changes, TIPMOC statistically adjudicates between linear and power-law divergence at each step. When evidence favors power-law divergence, TIPMOC forecasts the impending tipping point and estimates its position; otherwise, it avoids false positives. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate TIPMOC's robustness and accuracy in both detection and timing prediction across different types of dynamics and bifurcation. TIPMOC shows low false positive rates and performs well even with uneven sampling and colored noise. This method thus enhances the interpretability and practical utility of classical EWSs, serving as both a transparent add-on and a stand-alone statistical tool for forecasting regime shifts in diverse complex systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized Langevin Models of Linear Agent-Based Systems: Strategic Influence Through Environmental Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based models typically treat systems in isolation, discarding environmental coupling as either computationally prohibitive or dynamically irrelevant. We demonstrate that this neglect misses essential physics: environmental degrees of freedom create memory effects that fundamentally alter system dynamics. By systematically transforming linear update rules into exact generalized Langevin equations, we show that unobserved environmental agents manifest as memory kernels whose timescales and coupling strengths are determined by the environmental interaction spectrum. Network topology shapes this memory structure in distinct ways: small-world rewiring drives dynamics toward a single dominant relaxation mode, while fragmented environments sustain multiple persistent modes corresponding to isolated subpopulations. We apply this framework to covert influence operations where adversaries manipulate target populations exclusively via environmental intermediaries. The steady-state response admits a random-walk interpretation through hitting probabilities, revealing how zealot opinions diffuse through the environment to shift system agent opinions toward the zealot mean - even when zealots never directly contact targets.</description>

      <title>Formalization and inevitability of the Pareto principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formalize and study a generalized form of the Pareto principle or "20/80-rule" as a property of bounded cumulative processes. Modeling such processes by non-negative gain densities, we first show that any such process satisfies a generalized Pareto principle of the form "fraction $p$ of inputs yields fraction $1-p$ of outputs". To obtain a non-trivial and unique characterization, we define the generalized Pareto principle via the decreasing rearrangement of the gain density function. Within this framework, we analyze both constructed gain densities that exemplify the framework and its imposed restrictions, as well as distribution families commonly encountered in datasets, including power-law, exponential, and normal distributions. Finally, we predict commonly encountered ranges for the generalized Pareto principle and discuss the implications of elevating a structural property into a prescriptive role.</description>

      <title>Two variants of the friendship paradox: The condition for inequality between them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06176v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The friendship paradox -- the observation that, on average, one's friends have more friends than oneself -- admits two common formulations depending on whether averaging is performed over edges or over nodes. These two definitions, the "alter-based" and "ego-based" means, are often treated as distinct but related quantities. This paper establishes their exact analytical relationship, showing that the difference between them is governed by the degree-degree covariance normalized by the mean degree. Explicit examples demonstrate the three possible cases of positive, zero, and negative covariance, corresponding respectively to assortative, neutral, and disassortative mixing patterns. The derivation further connects the covariance form to the moment-based expression introduced by Kumar, Krackhardt, and Feld [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2306412121 (2024)], which involves the (-1)st, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd moments of the degree distribution. The two formulations are shown to be equivalent, as they should be: the moment-based representation expands the same structural dependence that the covariance form expresses in its most compact and interpretable form. The analysis thus unifies node-level and moment-level perspectives on the friendship paradox, offering both a pedagogically transparent derivation and a direct bridge to recent theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Importance inversion transfer identifies shared principles for cross-domain learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capacity to transfer knowledge across scientific domains relies on shared organizational principles. However, existing transfer-learning methodologies often fail to bridge radically heterogeneous systems, particularly under severe data scarcity or stochastic noise. This study formalizes Explainable Cross-Domain Transfer Learning (X-CDTL), a framework unifying network science and explainable artificial intelligence to identify structural invariants that generalize across biological, linguistic, molecular, and social networks. By introducing the Importance Inversion Transfer (IIT) mechanism, the framework prioritizes domain-invariant structural anchors over idiosyncratic, highly discriminative features. In anomaly detection tasks, models guided by these principles achieve significant performance gains - exhibiting a 56% relative improvement in decision stability under extreme noise - over traditional baselines. These results provide evidence for a shared organizational signature across heterogeneous domains, establishing a principled paradigm for cross-disciplinary knowledge propagation. By shifting from opaque latent representations to explicit structural laws, this work advances machine learning as a robust engine for scientific discovery.</description>
