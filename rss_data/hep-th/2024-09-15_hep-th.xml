      <title>(In)stability of symbiotic vortex-bright soliton in holographic immiscible binary superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbiotic vortex-bright soliton structures with non-trivial topological charge in one component are found to be robust in immiscibel two-component superfluids, due to the effective potential created by a stable vortex in the other component. We explore the properties of symbiotic vortex-bright soliton in strongly coupled binary superfluids by holography, which naturally incorporates finite temperature effect and dissipation. We show the dependence of the configuration on various parameters, including the winding number, temperature and inter-component coupling. We then study the (in)stability of symbiotic vortex-bright soliton by both the linear approach via quasi-normal modes and the full non-linear numerical simulation. Rich dynamics are found for the splitting patterns and dynamical transitions. Moreover, for giant symbiotic vortex-bright soliton structures with large winding numbers, the vortex splitting instability might be rooted in the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We also show that the second component in the vortex core could act as a stabilizer so as to suppress or even prevent vortex splitting instability. Such stabilization mechanism opens possibility for vortices with smaller winding number to merge into vortices with larger winding number, which is confirmed for the first time in our simulation.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of light towers and swampland constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical evolution of FLRW cosmologies in the presence of a tower of scalar light states and a runaway exponential potential. Some of the attractor solutions have problematic behaviours from the EFT point of view, which we use to argue for restrictions on the possible exponential scalings of the potential and tower characteristic mass as we move towards asymptotic regions in moduli space. These serve as further evidence that the tower mass should not decay faster than the potential or the KK scale associated to the homogeneous decompactification of a single compact dimension. We provide support from different top-down compactifications and connect with previous arguments found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Towards complexity of primary-deformed Virasoro circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fubini-Study metric is a central element of information geometry. We explore the role played by information geometry for determining the circuit complexity of Virasoro circuits and their deformations. To this effect, we study unitary quantum circuits generated by the Virasoro algebra and Fourier modes of a primary operator. Such primary-deformed Virasoro circuits can be realized in two-dimensional conformal field theories, where they provide models of inhomogeneous global quenches. We consider a cost function induced by the Fubini-Study metric and provide a universal expression for its time-evolution to quadratic order in the primary deformation for general source profiles. For circuits generated by the Virasoro zero mode and a primary, we obtain a non-zero cost only if spatial inhomogeneities are sufficiently large. In this case, we find that the cost saturates when the source becomes time independent. The exact saturation value is determined by the history of the source profile. As a byproduct, returning to undeformed circuits, we relate the Fubini-Study metric to the K\"ahler metric on a coadjoint orbit of the Virasoro group.</description>

      <title>Practical Introduction to Action-Dependent Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Action-dependent field theories are systems where the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian depends on new variables that encode the action. After a friendly introduction, we make a quick presentation of a new mathematical framework for action-dependent field theory: multicontact geometry. The formalism is illustrated in a variety of action-dependent Lagrangians, some of which are regular and other singular, that come from some well-known theories whose Lagrangians have been modified to incorporate action-dependent terms. Detailed computations are provided, including the constraint algorithm, in both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms. They include the Klein-Gordon equation, the Bosonic string theory, Metric-affine gravity, Maxwell's electromagnetism, (2+1)-dimensional gravity and Chern-Simons equation, and the heat equation and Burgers' equation.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension in Power-Law $f(R)$ Gravity and Generalized Brans-Dicke Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework to alleviate the Hubble tension. This framework is based on dynamics of a minimally coupled scalar field which either belongs to the Brans-Dicke theory with a self-interacting potential or is the scalar partner of $f(R)$ gravity. These two theories are dynamically equivalent when the Brans-Dicke parameter is zero. We will use the dynamical equivalence to interpret the Hubble tension in the same theoretical framework. For both theories, we write one set of field equations in which the value of a parameter distinguishes between the two theories. We will show that $H_0$ actually evolves with redshift so that its value is consistent with that measured from the local distance ladder and then drops to the value measured from CMB at high redshift. We argue that even though both theories exhibit this behaviour, Brans-Dicke theory with an exponential potential is more successful than power-law $f(R)$ gravity to relieve the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Timelike-bounded $dS_4$ holography from a solvable sector of the $T^2$ deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has leveraged the tractability of $T\bar T$ style deformations to formulate timelike-bounded patches of three-dimensional bulk spacetimes including $dS_3$. This proceeds by breaking the problem into two parts: a solvable theory that captures the most entropic energy bands, and a tuning algorithm to treat additional effects and fine structure. We point out that the method extends readily to higher dimensions, and does not require factorization of the full $T^2$ operator (the higher dimensional analogue of $T\bar T$ defined in [1]). Focusing on $dS_4$, we first define a solvable theory at finite $N$ via a restricted $T^2$ deformation of the $CFT_3$ on ${S}^2\times \mathbb{R}$, in which $T$ is replaced by the form it would take in symmetric homogeneous states, containing only diagonal energy density $E/V$ and pressure (-$dE/dV$) components. This defines a finite-N solvable sector of $dS_4/\text{deformed-CFT}_3$, capturing the radial geometry and count of the entropically dominant energy band, reproducing the Gibbons-Hawking entropy as a state count. To accurately capture local bulk excitations of $dS_4$ including gravitons, we build a deformation algorithm in direct analogy to the case of $dS_3$ with bulk matter recently proposed in [2]. This starts with an infinitesimal stint of the solvable deformation as a regulator. The full microscopic theory is built by adding renormalized versions of $T^2$ and other operators at each step, defined by matching to bulk local calculations when they apply, including an uplift from $AdS_4/CFT_3$ to $dS_4$ (as is available in hyperbolic compactifications of M theory). The details of the bulk-local algorithm depend on the choice of boundary conditions; we summarize the status of these in GR and beyond, illustrating our method for the case of the cylindrical Dirichlet condition which can be UV completed by our finite quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Spectral decomposition of field operators and causal measurement in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the spectral decomposition of field operators in bosonic quantum field theory as a limit of a strongly continuous family of POVM decompositions. The latter arise from integrals over families of bounded positive operators. Crucially, these operators have the same locality properties as the underlying field operators. We use the decompositions to construct families of quantum operations implementing measurements of the field observables. Again, the quantum operations have the same locality properties as the field operators. What is more, we show that these quantum operations do not lead to superluminal signaling and are possible measurements on quantum fields in the sense of Sorkin.</description>

      <title>Optical Aspect of Cosmological Black Holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by string theory scenarios, we study the optical aspect of AdS black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. Concretely, we investigate and examine the shadows and the deflection angle of light rays by such cosmological black holes. Concerning the shadows, we first deal with the non-rotating solutions. In particular, we obtain perfect circular shadows where their sizes are controlled by the involved parameter including the charge and the cosmological constant. Combining the Newman-Janis formalism and the Hamilton-Jacobi algorithm, we approach the rotating black hole solutions using real curves. Among others, we observe that the size and shape shadows depend on the rotating parameter and the remaining ones. To make contact with Event Horizon Telescope observational data, we show that certain constrains should be imposed on such parameters. Then, we study the behaviors of the light rays near to such cosmological black holes by computing the deflection angle in terms of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory parameters. Specifically, we reveal that the effect of the cosmological constant on the deflection angle changes as the coupling between the black hole parameters is adjusted. When the rotation parameter is introduced, we observe this effect becomes similar to that of the cosmological constant in ordinary AdS black holes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study higher-derivative supersymmetric effective field theories focusing on the systematic procedure for the elimination of ghosts from the spectrum. Particular attention is paid to the auxiliary fields, for which the higher-derivative terms induce non-algebraic equations of motion. By employing field redefinitions or the reduction of order procedure (both in component and superfield language) we show that the auxiliary fields remain non-dynamical in the EFT and that on shell they give rise to both derivative and non-derivative corrections to the scalar action. These methods are applied to the search for a SUSY embedding of the DBI action and to the dimensional reduction of HD terms for the K\"ahler moduli in type IIB string compactifications.</description>

      <title>Constraints on RG Flows from Protected Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider protected operators with the same conformal dimensions in the ultraviolet and infrared fixed point. We derive a sum rule for the difference between the two-point function coefficient of these operators in the ultraviolet and infrared fixed point which depends on the two-point function of the scalar operator. In even dimensional conformal field theories, scalar operators with exactly integer conformal dimensions are associated with Type-B conformal anomalies. The sum rule, in these cases, computes differences between Type-B anomaly coefficients. We argue the positivity of this difference in cases in which the conformal manifold contains weakly coupled theories. The results are tested in free theories as well as in $\mathcal N = 2$ superconformal QCD, necklace quivers and holographic RG flows. We further derive sum rules for currents and stress tensor two-point functions.</description>

      <title>New insights into the analytic structure of correlation functions via kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The way a relativistic system approaches fluid dynamical behaviour can be understood physically through the signals that will contribute to its linear response to perturbations. What these signals are is captured in the analytic structure of the retarded correlation function. The non-analyticities can be grouped into three types based on their dimension in the complex frequency plane. In this paper, we will use kinetic theory to find how we can calculate their corresponding signals. In the most general case of a system with particles that have a continuum of thermalization rates, we find that a non-analytic region appears. To calculate its signal, we introduce the non-analytic area density that describes the properties of this region, and we construct a method to calculate it. Further, to take into account the ambiguity present in signal analysis, following from manipulations of the non-analyticities, we will identify two specific choices called pictures with interesting analytic properties and compare in what scenarios each picture is most useful.</description>

      <title>Relational Dynamics with Periodic Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a systematic way in which a relational dynamics can be established relative to periodic clocks both in the classical and quantum theories, emphasising the parallels between them. We show that: (1) classical and quantum relational observables that encode the value of a quantity relative to a periodic clock are only invariant along the gauge orbits generated by the Hamiltonian constraint if the quantity itself is periodic, and otherwise the observables are only transiently invariant per clock cycle (this implies, in particular, that counting winding numbers does not lead to invariant observables relative to the periodic clock); (2) the quantum relational observables can be obtained from a partial group averaging procedure over a single clock cycle; (3) there is an equivalence ('trinity') between the quantum theories based on the quantum relational observables of the clock-neutral picture of Dirac quantisation, the relational Schr\"odinger picture of the Page-Wootters formalism, and the relational Heisenberg picture that follows from quantum deparametrisation, all three taken relative to periodic clocks (implying that the dynamics in all three is necessarily periodic); (4) in the context of periodic clocks, the original Page-Wootters definition of conditional probabilities fails for systems that have a continuous energy spectrum and, using the equivalence between the Page-Wootters and the clock-neutral, gauge-invariant formalism, must be suitably updated. Finally, we show how a system evolving periodically with respect to a periodic clock can evolve monotonically with respect to an aperiodic clock, without inconsistency. The presentation is illustrated by several examples, and we conclude with a brief comparison to other approaches in the literature that also deal with relational descriptions of periodic clocks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the theory of a scalar in the fundamental representation of the internal supergroup $SU(N|M)$. Remarkably, for $M=N+1$ its tree-level mass does not receive quantum corrections at one loop from either self-coupling or interactions with gauge bosons and fermions. This property comes at the price of introducing both degrees of freedom with wrong statistics and with wrong sign kinetic terms. We detail a method to break $SU(N|M)$ down to its bosonic subgroup through a Higgs-like mechanism, allowing for the partial decoupling of the dangerous modes, and study the associated vacuum structure up to one loop.</description>

      <title>Newman-Penrose formalism and exact vacuum solutions to conformal Weyl gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the exterior solution for a static, spherically symmetric source in Weyl conformal gravity in terms of the Newman--Penrose formalism. We first show that both the static, uncharged black hole solution of Mannheim and Kazanas and the static, charged Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m-like solution can be found more easily in this formalism than in the traditional coordinate-basis approach, where the metric tensor components are taken as the basic variables. Second, we show that the Newman-Penrose formalism offers a particularly convenient framework that is well suited for the discussion of conformal gravity solutions corresponding to Petrov ''type-D'' spacetimes. This is illustrated with a two-parameter class of wormhole solutions that includes the Ellis--Bronnikov wormhole solution of Einstein's gravity as a limiting case. Other salient issues, such as the gauge equivalence of solutions and the inclusion of the electromagnetic field are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Pure Gauss-Bonnet NUT Black Hole Solution: II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present article, we have obtained an exact analytical solution of six-dimensional pure Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the presence of both NUT and Maxwell charges. The topology of the horizon is chosen to be the product of two 2-spheres. Upon evaluating the solution, we study the spacetime properties, such as event horizon and singularity, and obtain the ranges of parameter space where the solution is valid. We discuss how the presence of Maxwell charges may impact the solution's asymptotic expansion and what distinctive effects it will bring to the geometry. The thermodynamic properties of the solution are also discussed, emphasizing the interplay between NUT and Maxwell charges.</description>

      <title>Considerations on electromagnetic radiation in Podolsky electrodynamics within a Lorentz-symmetry violating framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore how higher-order derivative terms impact a physical observable within a Lorentz-Symmetry Violating (LSV) framework. We specifically examine Podolsky electrodynamics coupled with the Carroll-Field-Jackiw model (CFJ). Our analysis shows how vacuum and wave propagation are affected by the interaction of LSV parameters with properties of Podolsky electrodynamics. In this scenario, our results indicate that the new electromagnetic vacuum is birefringent, dichroic, and dispersive. We also point out that the higher-derivative term in the presence of the CFJ space-time anisotropy induces an oscillation mechanism between the photon, which acquires a non-vanishing mass, and the massive vector mode carried by the higher derivative. We then investigate the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a moving charged particle interacting with this new medium. Our analysis reveals that the refractive vacuum through which the charged particle travels influences the electromagnetic radiation, leading to a profile similar to the Cherenkov effect.</description>

      <title>$SU(\infty)$ Quantum Gravity and Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we highlight the structure and main properties of an abstract approach to quantum cosmology and gravity dubbed $SU(\infty)$-QGR. Beginning from the concept of the Universe as an isolated quantum system, the main axiom of the model is the existence of infinite number of mutually commuting observables. Consequently, the Hilbert space of the Universe represents $SU(\infty)$ symmetry. This Universe as a whole is static and topological. Nonetheless, quantum fluctuations induce local clustering in its quantum state and divide it to approximately isolated subsystems representing $G \times SU(\infty)$ symmetry, where $G$ is a generic finite rank internal symmetry for each subsystem that is entangled to the rest of the Universe by the global $SU(\infty)$ symmetry. In addition to parameters characterizing representation of $G$ by subsystems, their states depend on 4 continuous parameters: two of them characterize the representation of $SU(\infty)$, a dimensionful parameter arises from the possibility of comparing representations of $SU(\infty)$ by different subsystems, and the forth parameter is a measurable used as time registered by an arbitrary subsystem chosen as a quantum clock. They introduce a relative dynamics for subsystem formulated by a symmetry invariant effective Lagrangian defined on the (3+1)D parameter space. At lowest quantum order it is a Yang-Mills field theory for both $SU(\infty)$ and internal symmetries. We identify the common $SU(\infty)$ symmetry and its interaction with gravity. Thus, $SU(\infty)$-QGR predicts a spin-1 mediator for quantum gravity. Apparently this is in contradiction with classical gravity. Nonetheless, we show that an observer unable to detect the quantumness of gravity perceives its effect as the curvature of the space of average values of aforementioned parameters. We prove that emergent spacetime has a Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Phenomenology of Identified Particle Spectra in Heavy-Ion Collisions at LHC Energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonequilibrium state does not relax to thermodynamic equilibrium but to a state which takes into account long-living fluctuations as quasi-conserved quantities. This state is described by the relevant statistical operator within the Zubarev method to derive the nonequilibrium statistical operator. We apply this approach to the spectra of particles produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at the LHC experiments at CERN. We show that controversal explanations of the low-momentum part of the spectrum given by an extended hydrodynamic-like Blast-Wave approach [with mesonic chemical potentials] and the reaction-kinetic description of the hadron resonance gas can be considered as special approximation of a more general nonequilibrium approach which takes mesonic chemical potentials into account to describe quasi-conserved particle numbers, but takes also continuum correlations, in particular resonances, into account using the Beth-Uhlenbeck [or Dashen-Ma-Bernstein] virial expansion. We present results for the spectra of pions, kaons, and protons and explain why different approaches can explain the data obtained from the ALICE experiments.</description>

      <title>Learning Theory Informed Priors for Bayesian Inference: A Case Study with Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological models are often motivated and formulated in the language of particle physics, using quantities such as the axion decay constant, but tested against data using ostensibly physical quantities, such as energy density ratios, assuming uniform priors on the latter. This approach neglects priors on the model from fundamental theory, including from particle physics and string theory, such as the preference for sub-Planckian axion decay constants. We introduce a novel approach to learning theory-informed priors for Bayesian inference using normalizing flows (NF), a flexible generative machine learning technique that generates priors on model parameters when analytic expressions are unavailable or difficult to compute. As a test case, we focus on early dark energy (EDE), a model designed to address the Hubble tension. Rather than using uniform priors on the $\textit{phenomenological}$ EDE parameters $f_{\rm EDE}$ and $z_c$, we train a NF on EDE cosmologies informed by theory expectations for axion masses and decay constants. Our method recovers known constraints in this representation while being $\sim 300,000$ times more efficient in terms of total CPU compute time. Applying our NF to $\textit{Planck}$ and BOSS data, we obtain the first theory-informed constraints on EDE, finding $f_{\rm EDE} \lesssim 0.02$ at $95\%$ confidence with an $H_0$ consistent with $\textit{Planck}$, but in $\sim 6\sigma$ tension with SH0ES. This yields the strongest constraints on EDE to date, additionally challenging its role in resolving the Hubble tension.</description>

Abstract: We study the index of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Yang-Mills theory on $S^3\times\mathbb{R}$ at large angular momenta. A generalized Cardy limit exhibits macroscopic entropy at large $N$. Our result is derived using free QFT analysis, and also a background field method on $S^3$. The index sets a lower bound on the entropy. It saturates the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of known supersymmetric AdS$_5$ black holes, thus accounting for their microstates. We further analyze the so-called Macdonald index, exploring small black holes and possibly new black holes reminiscent of hairy black holes. Finally, we study aspects of large supersymmetric AdS$_7$ black holes, using background field method on $S^5$ and 't Hooft anomalies.</description>

Abstract: We study the large $N$ matrix model for the index of 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Yang-Mills theory and its truncations to understand the dual AdS$_5$ black holes. Numerical studies of the truncated models provide insights on the black hole physics, some of which we investigate analytically with the full Yang-Mills matrix model. In particular, we find many branches of saddle points which describe the known black hole solutions. We analytically construct the saddle points dual to the small black holes whose sizes are much smaller than the AdS radius. They include the asymptotically flat BMPV black holes embedded in large AdS with novel thermodynamic instabilities.</description>

      <title>Notes on Confinement on $\mathbf{R^3 \times S^1}$: From Yang-Mills, super-Yang-Mills, and QCD(adj) to QCD(F)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10423v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a pedagogical introduction to the physics of confinement on $R^3 \times S^1$, using $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills with massive or massless adjoint fermions as the prime example; at the end, we also add fundamental flavours. The small-$S^1$ limit is remarkable, allowing for controlled semiclassical determination of the nonperturbative physics in these, mostly non-supersymmetric, theories. We begin by reviewing the Polyakov confinement mechanism on $R^3$. Moving on to $R^3 \times S^1$, we show how introducing adjoint fermions stabilizes center symmetry, leading to abelianization and semiclassical calculability. We explain how monopole-instantons and twisted monopole-instantons arise. We describe the role of various novel topological excitations in extending Polyakov's confinement to the locally four-dimensional case, discuss the nature of the confining string, and the $\theta$-angle dependence.~We study the global symmetry realization and, when available, present evidence for the absence of phase transitions as a function of the $S^1$ size. As our aim is not to cover all work on the subject, but to prepare the interested reader for its study, we also include brief descriptions of topics not covered in detail: the necessity for analytic continuation of path integrals, the study of more general theories, and the 't Hooft anomalies involving higher-form symmetries.</description>

Abstract: The BPS spectrum of AdS/CFT exhibits multi-gravitons at low energies, while having black hole states at higher energies. This can be studied concretely in AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ in terms of classical cohomologies, even in the quantum regimes at finite $1/N$. Recently, Chang and Lin found a threshold for non-graviton states in the $SU(2)$ maximal super-Yang-Mills theory. We explicitly construct and present this threshold cohomology.</description>

      <title>Complexity = Anything Can Grow Forever in de Sitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in anti-de Sitter holography point towards the association of an infinite class of covariant objects, the simplest one being codimension-one extremal volumes, with quantum computational complexity in the microscopic description. One of the defining features of these gravitational complexity proposals is describing the persistent growth of black hole interior in classical gravity. It is tempting to assume that the gravitational complexity proposals apply also to gravity outside their native anti-de Sitter setting in which case they may reveal new truths about these cases with much less understood microscopics. Recent first steps in this direction in de Sitter static patch demonstrated a very different behavior from anti-de Sitter holography deemed hyperfast growth: diverging complexification rate after a finite time. We show that this feature is not a necessity and among gravitational complexity proposals there are ones, which predict linear or exponential late-time growth behaviors for complexity in de Sitter static patches persisting classically forever.</description>

Abstract: We study the large $N$ limit of the matrix models associated with the superconformal indices of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories. We find that for a large class of $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal gauge theories, the superconformal indices in the large $N$ limit of such theories are dominated by the 'parallelogram' saddle, providing $O(N^2)$ free energy for the generic value of chemical potentials. This saddle corresponds to BPS black holes in AdS$_5$ whenever a holographic dual description is available. Our saddle applies to a large class of gauge theories, including ADE quiver gauge theories, and the theories with rank-2 tensor matters. Our analysis works for most $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal gauge theories that admit a suitable large $N$ limit while keeping the flavor symmetry fixed. We also find 'multi-cut' saddle points, which correspond to the orbifolded Euclidean black holes in AdS$_5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the generalized holographic complexity of odd-dimensional Myers-Perry asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (MP-AdS) black holes with equal angular momenta within the ``complexity equals anything'' proposal. We begin by determining the codimension-one generalized volume complexity by finding the extremum of the generally covariant volume functional. Locally, we show that its late-time growth rate aligns with the critical momenta associated with the extremal hypersurfaces. Globally, we discover diverse phase transitions for the complexity at early times, including first-order, second-order, and multi-critical transitions. An area law and a phase diagram are proposed to adapt to these phase behaviours, highlighting the effects of the black hole's angular momentum. At zero time, we define the generalized holographic complexity of formation and examine its scaling relations for both large near-extremal MP-AdS black holes and static charged black holes. We find that the scaling behaviours of the generalized volume complexity of formation maintain uniformity with those of the original holographic complexity formulations, except in cases where the scalar functional defining the generalized holographic complexity is infinite in the vacuum limit or at spatial infinity. Additionally, we show that these findings can be applied to codimension-zero observables.</description>

Abstract: We put forward a new method of constructing unfolded formulations of field theories, which is based on initial fixation of the form of an unfolded field and subsequent looking for the corresponding unfolded equation as an identity that this field satisfies. Making use of this method, we find an unfolded formulation for 4d scalar electrodynamics. By considering a symmetry-breaking scalar potential, we study the implementation of the Higgs mechanism within the framework of the unfolded dynamics approach. We explore a deformation of unfolded modules in the symmetry-broken phase and identify a non-invertible unfolded field redefinition that diagonalizes the higgsed system.</description>

      <title>Yukawa Couplings at Infinite Distance and Swampland Towers in Chiral Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09775v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study limits of vanishing Yukawa couplings of 4d chiral matter fields in Quantum Gravity, using as a laboratory type IIA orientifolds with D6-branes. In these theories chiral fermions arise at brane intersections, where an infinite tower of charged particles dubbed gonions are localised. We show that in the limit $Y\rightarrow 0$ some of these towers become asymptotically massless, while at the same time the kinetic term of some chiral fields becomes singular and at least two extra dimensions decompactify. For limits parametrised by a large complex structure saxion $u$, Yukawa couplings have a behaviour of the form $Y \, \sim \, {1}/{u^r}$, with $r$ some positive rational number. Moreover, in this limit some of the gauge couplings associated to the Yukawa vanish. The lightest gonion scales are of order $m_{\rm gon} \sim g^s M_{\rm P}$ with $s&gt;1$, verifying the magnetic WGC with room to spare and with no need of its tower/sublattice versions. We also show how this behaviour can be understood in the context of the emergence of kinetic terms in Quantum Gravity. All these results may be very relevant for phenomenology, given the fact that some of the Yukawa couplings in the Standard Model are very small.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analytic method to calculate the vortex number on a torus is constructed, focusing on analytic vortex solutions to the Chern-Simons-Higgs theory, whose governing equation is the so-called Jackiw-Pi equation. The equation is one of the integrable vortex equations and is reduced to Liouville's equation. The requirement of continuity of the Higgs field strongly restricts the characteristics and the fundamental domain of the vortices. Also considered are the decompactification limits of the vortices on a torus, in which "flux loss" phenomena occasionally occur.</description>

      <title>Graphene Shapes from Quantum Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temperature constraints are highly desirable in the experimental setup when seeking the synthesis of new carbon structures. Fluctuations of the Dirac field result in temperature-dependent corrections to the Helfrich-Canham formulation, which governs the classical elasticity of the graphene membrane at equilibrium. Here, we examine the emergent shapes allowed by the effective model up to quadratic order in Ricci curvature and discuss the constraints required to observe them. We determine the mechanical stability conditions and provide a phase diagram characterized by the appearance of a critical temperature $T_c$ that distinguishes between carbon nanotube and fullerene phases. The observation of minimal and developable surfaces is anticipated, respectively, at the high- and low-temperature regimes. Additionally, a Beltrami trumpet surface is forecasted when the membrane is subjected to an external source balancing out internal Helfrich stresses.</description>

      <title>A T-Duality of Non-Supersymmetric Heterotic Strings and an implication for Topological Modular Forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments connecting non-supersymmetric heterotic string theory to the theory of Topological Modular Forms (TMF), we show that the worldsheet theory with central charge $(17,\frac{3}{2})$ obtained by fibering the $(E_8)_1 \times (E_8)_1$ current algebra over the $\mathcal{N}=(0,1)$ sigma model on $S^{1}$ with antiperiodic spin structure (such that the two $E_8$ factors are exchanged as we go around the circle), is continuously connected to the $(E_8)_2$ theory in the Gaiotto$-$Johnson-Freyd$-$Witten sense of going "up and down the RG trajectories". Combined with the work of Tachikawa and Yamashita, this furnishes a physical derivation of the fact that the $(E_8)_2$ theory corresponds to the unique nontrivial torsion element $[(E_8)_2]$ of $\mathsf{TMF}^{31}$ with zero mod-2 elliptic genus.</description>

      <title>Meso-inflationary Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking with non-minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a realization of the inflationary scenario where the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is spontaneously broken during inflation, facilitated by its non-minimal coupling to gravity. This results in effectively two-field inflation: the early stage is driven by an inflaton field with the PQ symmetry intact, and the later stage is driven by the PQ scalar after its effective mass becomes tachyonic, causing destabilization from the origin. The non-minimal coupling serves the dual purpose of restoring the PQ symmetry during early inflation and flattening the PQ potential post-tachyonic shift, allowing for continued slow roll. We analyze the inflationary background solutions and scalar perturbations, which are amplified at small scales via significant isocurvature perturbations generated near the symmetry-breaking epoch. These perturbations lead to second-order gravitational waves, detectable by next-generation space-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Numerical approach to the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bell-CHSH (Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt) inequality in the vacuum state of a relativistic scalar quantum field is analyzed. Using Weyl operators built with smeared fields localized in the Rindler wedges, the Bell-CHSH inequality is expressed in terms of the Lorentz invariant inner products of test functions. A numerical framework for these inner products is devised. Causality is also explicitly checked by a numerical evaluation of the Pauli-Jordan function. Violations of the Bell-CHSH inequality are reported for different values of the particle mass parameter.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic soft theorems and soft spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using universal predictions provided by classical soft theorems, we revisit the energy emission spectrum for gravitational scatterings of compact objects in the low-frequency expansion. We calculate this observable beyond the zero-frequency limit, retaining an exact dependence on the kinematics of the massive objects. This allows us to study independently the ultrarelativistic or massless limit, where we find agreement with the literature, and the small-deflection or post-Minkowskian (PM) limit, where we provide explicit results up to $\mathcal{O}(G^5)$. These confirm that the high-velocity limit of a given PM order is smoothly connected to the corresponding massless result whenever the latter is analytic in the Newton constant $G$. We also provide explicit expressions for the waveforms to order $\omega^{-1}$, $\log\omega$, $\omega(\log\omega)^2$ in the soft limit, $\omega\to0$, expanded up to sub-subleading PM order, as well as a conjecture for the logarithmic soft terms of the type $\omega^{n-1}(\log\omega)^{n}$ with $n\ge 3$.</description>

      <title>Boundary Chaos: Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random matrix spectral correlations is a defining feature of quantum chaos. Here, we study such correlations in a minimal model of chaotic many-body quantum dynamics where interactions are confined to the system's boundary, dubbed \textit{boundary chaos}, in terms of the spectral form factor and its fluctuations. We exactly calculate the latter in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension $q$ for different classes of random boundary interactions and find it to coincide with random matrix theory, possibly after a non-zero Thouless time. The latter effect is due to a drastic enhancement of the spectral form factor, when integer time and system size fulfill a resonance condition. We compare our semiclassical (large $q$) results with numerics at small local Hilbert space dimension ($q=2,3$) and observe qualitatively similar features as in the semiclassical regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study inflation driven by the tachyon field in the holographic braneworld by assuming the second slow-roll parameter $\eta$ is constant. The parameter $\eta$ can be either defined by the tachyon scalar field and the Hubble parameter or by the Hubble parameter only. By assuming a constant $\eta$, we derive and numerically solve a differential equation for the Hubble expansion rate. We calculate numerically the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We confront the results with the observational data and find some constraints on the free model parameters. The swampland conjectures are discussed in the context of the constant-roll inflation, with some accent on the holographic model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black hole formation has been discussed widely, when density perturbations in the early universe cause matter to collapse gravitationally, giving rise to these ultra-compact objects. We propose that such a gravitational collapse also gives rise to primordial naked singularities, that would play an important role in the observable features of present universe. We consider two types of collapse scenarios that give rise to event-like and object-like visible singularities within a cosmological background. We briefly discuss implications of primordial naked singularities, including those for dark matter, vis-a-vis primordial black holes.</description>

Abstract: Toric Ricci--flat metrics in dimension four correspond to certain holomorphic vector bundles over a twistor space. We construct these bundles explicitly, by exhibiting and characterising their patching matrices, for the five--parameter family of Riemannian ALF metrics constructed by Chen and Teo. The Chen--Teo family contains a two--parameter family of asymptotically flat gravitational instantons. The patching matrices for these instantons take a simple rational form.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating primordial gravitational waves from null energy condition violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the parity-violating effects in primordial gravitational waves (GWs) due to null energy condition (NEC) violation in two very early universe scenarios: bounce-inflation and intermediate NEC violation during inflation. In both scenarios, we numerically solve the power spectra of parity-violating primordial GWs generated by coupling the background field and the spectator field with the Nieh-Yan term, respectively. We find that the background field can significantly enhance parity-violating effects at scales corresponding to the maximum of the GW power spectra. In contrast, the parity-violating effects produced by the spectator show significantly weaker observability even if the coupling constant is large. Therefore, in NEC-violating scenarios, the significant observable parity-violating effects in primordial GWs primarily arise from the physics directly related to NEC violation. This result highlights the potential of primordial GWs as crucial tools for exploring NEC-violating and parity-violating physics.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation from binary systems in Unimodular gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unimodular gravity (UG) is classically considered identical to General Relativity (GR). However, due to restricted diffeomorphism symmetry, the Bianchi identites do not lead to the conservation of energy-momentum tensor. Thus, the conservation of energy-momentum tensor needs to be separately assumed in order to reconcile with GR. Relaxing this assumption, one finds that the conservation violation can lead to differences with GR, which can be subsequently examined in astrophysical and cosmological scenarios. To this end, we examine the predictions of UG in the context of binary systems emitting gravitational radiation. Primarily, we show how the field equations involve a diffusion function which quantifies the measure of non-conservation. Due to this violation, the dispersion relation is modified. Incorporating these changes, we provide an expression for the energy loss by the binaries, which reduces to Peters-Mathews result in the GR limit. Using binary pulsar data, we constrain the theory parameter $\zeta$ (which signifies non-conservation) by determining the rate of orbital decay. The strongest constrain on $\zeta$ comes out to be $\vert \zeta \vert \leq 5\times 10^{-4}$ which is better by an order of magnitude than an existing equivalent constraint coming from the tidal deformability of the neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Building blocks for $W$-algebras of classical types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The universal $2$-parameter vertex algebra $W_{\infty}$ of type $W(2,3,4,\dots)$ serves as a classifying object for vertex algebras of type $W(2,3,\dots,N)$ for some $N$ in the sense that under mild hypothesis, all such vertex algebras arise as quotients of $W_{\infty}$. There is an $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ family of such $1$-parameter vertex algebras which, after tensoring with a Heisenberg algebra, are known as $Y$-algebras. They were introduced by Gaiotto and Rap\v{c}\'ak and are expected to be the building blocks for all $W$-algebras in type $A$, i.e., every $W$-(super) algebra in type $A$ is an extension of a tensor product of finitely many $Y$-algebras. Similarly, the orthosymplectic $Y$-algebras are $1$-parameter quotients of a universal $2$-parameter vertex algebra $W^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$ of type $W(2,4,6,\dots)$, which is a classifying object for vertex algebras of type $W(2,4,\dots, 2N)$ for some $N$. Unlike type $A$, these algebras are not all the building blocks for $W$-algebras of types $B$, $C$, and $D$. In this paper, we construct a new universal $2$-parameter vertex algebra of type $W(1^3, 2, 3^3, 4, 5^3,6,\dots)$ which we denote by $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ since it contains a copy of the affine vertex algebra $V^k(\mathfrak{sp}_2)$. We identify $8$ infinite families of $1$-parameter quotients of $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ which are analogues of the $Y$-algebras. We regard $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ as a fundamental object on equal footing with $W_{\infty}$ and $W^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$, and we give some heuristic reasons for why we expect the $1$-parameter quotients of these three objects to be the building blocks for all $W$-algebras of classical types. Finally, we prove that $W^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ has many quotients which are strongly rational. This yields new examples of strongly rational $W$-superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Decoherence due to Casimir effect?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open system dynamics of an electron is studied in the presence of radiation field, confined between two parallel conducting pates. It has been suggested in previous works that the quantized zero-point modes of this field lead to finite decoherence effects, possibly due to the Casimir force. However, in this work it is shown that the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix of the electron are suppressed due to the sudden switching on of the interaction with the environment, and would not be observationally relevant in typical scenarios. The work clarifies important theoretical aspects of the setup and argues that any irreversible loss of coherence, in general, should not be ascribed to vacuum fluctuations. It can only originate from emission of bremsstrahlung by the electron, due to the acceleration caused by the effective Coulomb potential of all the infinite image charges.</description>
