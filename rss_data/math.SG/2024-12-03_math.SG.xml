      <title>On closed characteristics of minimal action on a convex three-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every closed characteristic of minimal action on the boundary of a uniformly convex domain in $\R^4$ bounds a disk-like global surface of section. A corollary is that the cylindrical symplectic capacity of a convex body in $\R^4$ coincides with the minimal action of a closed generalized characteristic on its boundary.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Fredholm Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a robust functional analytic framework for adiabatic limits. This framework consist of a notion of adiabatic Fredholm family, several possible regularity properties, and an explicit construction that provides finite dimensional reductions that fit into all common regularization theories. We show that thhese finite dimensional reductions inherit global continuity and differentiability properties from the adiabatic Fredholm family. Moreover, we indicate how to construct adiabatic Fredholm families that describe the adiabatic limits for the nondegenerate Atiyah-Floer conjecture and strip-shrinking in quilted Floer theory.</description>

      <title>Central extensions of Lie algebras, dynamical systems, and symplectic nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connections between Euler's equations on central extensions of Lie algebras and Euler's equations on the original, extended algebras are described. A special infinite sequence of central extensions of nilpotent Lie algebras constructed from the Lie algebra of formal vector fields on the line is considered, and the orbits of coadjoint representations for these algebras are described. By using the compact nilmanifolds constructed from these algebras by I.K. Babenko and the author, it is shown that covering Lie groups for symplectic nilmanifolds can have any rank as solvable Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Sesquicuspidal curves, scattering diagrams, and symplectic nonsqueezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a large new family of rational algebraic curves in the complex projective plane with a (p,q) cusp singularity. More precisely, we classify all such pairs (p,q) for curves which are rigid (in a suitable sense), finding a phase transition from discrete to continuous as the ratio p/q crosses the fourth power of the golden ratio. In particular, for many values of (p,q), our curves solve the minimal degree problem for plane curves with a (p,q) cusp singularity. Our technique relies on (i) explicit bijections between curves in log Calabi-Yau surfaces and curves in nontoric blowups of toric surfaces, (ii) the tropical vertex group and its connections with relative Gromov--Witten invariants, and (iii) recent positivity results for scattering diagrams. As our main application, we completely solve the stabilized symplectic embedding problem for four-dimensional ellipsoids into the four-dimensional round ball. The answer is neatly encoded in a single piecewise smooth function which transitions from an infinite Fibonacci staircase to an explicit rational function. Many of our results also extend to other target spaces, e.g. del Pezzo surfaces and more general rational surfaces.</description>

      <title>Relative simplicity of the universal coverings of transformation groups and Tsuboi's metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many transformation groups on manifolds are simple, but their universal coverings are not. In the present paper, we study the concept of relatively simple group, that is, a group with the maximum proper normal subgroup. We show that many examples of universal coverings of transformation groups are relatively simple, including the universal covering $\widetilde{\mathrm{Ham}}(M,\omega)$ of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of a closed symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$.
  Tsuboi constructed a metric space $\mathcal{M}(G)$ for a simple group $G$. We generalize his construction to relatively simple groups, and study their large scale geometric structure. In particular, Tsuboi's metric space of $\widetilde{\mathrm{Ham}}(M, \omega)$ is not quasi-isometric to the half line for every closed symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct infinitely many examples of four manifolds with macroscopic dimension 4 equipped with circle bundles whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature. Further, we verify that these bundles have macroscopic dimension at most 3. Our constructions are based on techniques from symplectic geometry.</description>

      <title>A landscape of contact manifolds via rational SFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.04182v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a hierarchy functor from the exact symplectic cobordism category to a totally ordered set from a $BL_\infty$ (Bi-Lie) formalism of the rational symplectic field theory (RSFT). The hierarchy functor consists of three levels of structures, namely algebraic planar torsion, order of semi-dilation and planarity, all taking values in $\mathbb{N}\cup \{\infty\}$, where algebraic planar torsion can be understood as the analogue of Latschev-Wendl's algebraic torsion in the context of RSFT. The hierarchy functor is well-defined through a partial construction of RSFT and is within the scope of established virtual techniques. We develop computation tools for those functors and prove all three of them are surjective. In particular, the planarity functor is surjective in all dimension $\ge 3$. Then we use the hierarchy functor to study the existence of exact cobordisms. We discuss examples including iterated planar open books, spinal open books, affine varieties with uniruled compactification and links of singularities.</description>

Abstract: Lavrentiev curves form a special class of rectifiable curves which includes cusp-free piecewise smooth curves. We call a Lavrentiev curve Legendrian if the integral of the contact form equals zero on any its subarc. We define Legendrian isotopies of such curves and prove that the equivalence classes of Legendrian Lavrentiev links with respect to Legendrian isotopies coincide with smooth classes.</description>

      <title>Fillability obstructions for high-dimensional confoliations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study confoliations in dimensions higher than three mostly from the perspective of symplectic fillability. Our main result is that Massot-Niederkr\"uger-Wendl's bordered Legendrian open book, an object that obstructs the weak symplectic fillability of contact manifolds, admits a generalization for confoliations equipped with symplectic data. Applications include the non-fillability of the product of an overtwisted contact manifold and a class of symplectic manifolds, and the fact that Bourgeois contact structures associated with overtwisted contact manifolds admit no weak symplectic fillings for which the symplectic structure restricts at the boundary to a positive generator of the second cohomology of the torus factor. In addition, along the lines of the original 3-dimensional work of Eliashberg and Thurston, we give a new definition of approximation and deformation of confoliations by contact structures and describe some natural examples.</description>

      <title>Open enumerative mirror symmetry for lines in the mirror quintic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mirror symmetry gives predictions for the genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants of a closed Calabi--Yau variety in terms of period integrals on a mirror family of Calabi-Yau varieties. We deduce an analogous mirror theorem for the open Gromov-Witten invariants of certain Lagrangian submanifolds of the quintic threefold from homological mirror symmetry, assuming the existence of a negative cyclic open-closed map. The Lagrangians we consider can be thought of as SYZ mirrors to lines, and their open Gromov-Witten (OGW) invariants coincide with relative period integrals on the mirror quintic calculated by Walcher. Their OGW invariants are irrational numbers contained in an algebraic extension of the rationals, and admit an expression similar to the Ooguri-Vafa multiple cover formula involving special values of a Dirichlet L-function. We achieve these results by studying the Floer theory of a different immersed Lagrangian in the quintic that supports a one-dimensional family of objects in the Fukaya category homologically mirror to coherent sheaves supported on lines in the mirror quintic. The field in which the OGW invariants lie arises as the invariant trace field of (the smooth locus of) a closely related hyperbolic Lagrangian submanifold with conical singularities in the quintic. These results explain some of the predictions on the existence of hyperbolic Lagrangian submanifolds in the quintic put forward by Jockers-Morrison-Walcher.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian representation of isomonodromic deformations of twisted rational connections: The Painlev\'{e} $1$ hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we build the Hamiltonian system and the corresponding Lax pairs associated to a twisted connection in $\mathfrak{gl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ admitting an irregular and ramified pole at infinity of arbitrary degree, hence corresponding to the Painlev\'{e} $1$ hierarchy. We provide explicit formulas for these Lax pairs and Hamiltonians in terms of the irregular times and standard $2g$ Darboux coordinates associated to the twisted connection. Furthermore, we obtain a map that reduces the space of irregular times to only $g$ non-trivial isomonodromic deformations. In addition, we perform a symplectic change of Darboux coordinates to obtain a set of symmetric Darboux coordinates in which Hamiltonians and Lax pairs are polynomial. Finally, we apply our general theory to the first cases of the hierarchy: the Airy case $(g=0)$, the Painlev\'{e} $1$ case $(g=1)$ and the next two elements of the Painlev\'{e} $1$ hierarchy.</description>
