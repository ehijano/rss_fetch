      <title>Gluing diffeomorphisms, bi-Lipschitz mappings and homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we address the following problem, often encountered in geometric constructions: having defined an orientation preserving diffeomorphism in a number of `patches' on a manifold $\mathcal{M}$, can we extend it to a diffeomorphism of the whole manifold $\mathcal{M}$? We give a positive answer, provided the `patches' are sufficiently regular. Then, we extend the same result to the case of bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms and homeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Conformal measure rigidity and ergodicity of horospherical foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a higher rank extension of rigidity theorems of Sullivan, Tukia, Yue, and Kim-Oh for representations of rank one discrete subgroups of divergence type, in terms of the push-forwards of conformal measures via boundary maps. We consider a certain class of higher rank discrete subgroups, which we call hypertransverse subgroups. It includes all rank one discrete subgroups, Anosov subgroups, relatively Anosov subgroups, and their subgroups.
  Our proof of the rigidity theorem generalizes the idea of Kim-Oh to self-joinings of higher rank hypertransverse subgroups, overcoming the lack of CAT(-1) geometry on symmetric spaces. In contrast to the work of Sullivan, Tukia, and Yue, our argument is closely related to the study of horospherical foliations. We also show the ergodicity of horospherical foliations with respect to Burger-Roblin measures. This generalizes the classical work of Hedlund, Burger, and Roblin in rank one and of Lee-Oh for Borel Ansov subgroups in higher rank.</description>

      <title>A note on Stein fillability of circle bundles over symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, given a closed integral symplectic manifold $(\Sigma, \omega)$ of dimension $2n \geq 4$, for every integer $k&gt;\int_{\Sigma}\omega^{n}$, the Boothby-Wang bundle over $(\Sigma, k\omega)$ carries no Stein fillable contact structure. This negatively answers a question raised by Eliashberg. A similar result holds for Boothby-Wang orbibundles. As an application, we prove the non-smoothability of some isolated singularities.</description>

      <title>Pointed quandles of linkoinds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we define the fundamental quandle of knotoids and linkoids and prove that it is invariant under the under forbidden-move and hence encodes only the information of the underclosure of the knotoid. We then introduce $n$-pointed quandles, which generalize quandles by specifying $n$ elements as ordered basepoints. This leads to the notion of fundamental pointed quandles of linkoids, which enhances the fundamental quandle. Using $2$-pointed quandle allows us to distinguish 1-linkoids with equivalent under-closures and leads to a couple of 1-linkoid invariants. We also generalize the notion of homogeneity of quandles to $n$-homogeneity of quandles. We classify all $\infty$-homogeneous, finite quandles.</description>

      <title>A generators and relations derivation of Khovanov homology of 2 strand braid links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of the Thesis, we reformulate the Murakami-Ohtsuki-Yamada state-sum description of the level n Jones polynomial of an oriented link in terms of a suitable braided monoidal category whose morphisms are Q[q, q-1] s-linear combinations of oriented trivalent planar graphs, and give a corresponding description for the HOMFLY-PT polynomial. In the second part, we extend this construction and express the Khovanov Rozansky homology of an oriented link in terms of a combinatorially defined category whose morphisms are equivalence classes of formal complexes of (formal direct sums of shifted) oriented plane graphs. By working combinatorially, one avoids many of the computational difficulties involved in the matrix factorization computations of the original Khovanov-Rozansky formulation: one systematically uses combinatorial relations satisfied by these matrix factorizations to simplify the computation at a level that is easily handled. By using this technique, we can provide a computation of the level n Khovanov-Rozansky invariant of the 2-strand braid link with k crossings, for arbitrary n and k, confirming and extending previous results and conjectural predictions by Anokhina-Morozov, Carqueville-Murfet, Dolotin-Morozov, Gukov-Iqbal-Kozcaz-Vafa, and Rasmussen</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study surface subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}(4,\mathbb R)$ acting convex cocompactly on $\mathbb R \textrm P^3$ with image in the coaffine group. The boundary of the convex core is stratified, and the one dimensional strata form a pair of bending laminations. We show that the bending data on each component consist of a convex $\mathbb R \textrm P^2$ structure and an affine measured lamination depending on the underlying convex projective structure on $S$ with (Hitchin) holonomy $\rho: \pi_1S \to \mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb R)$. We study the space $\mathcal {ML}^\rho(S)$ of bending data compatible with $\rho$ and prove that its projectivization is a sphere of dimension $6g-7$.</description>

      <title>Generic doubling of rectangular pegs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a multiplicity result for rectangular pegs that there is a generic class of smooth Jordan curves in which every curve admits two geometrically distinct similar inscribed rectangles with aspect angle in $(0,\frac{\pi}{2})$, based on the a priori existence result of rectangular peg by Greene and Lobb, in which the rectangular peg problem is translated into finding intersection points of two Lagrangian tori. The key insights are certain generic geometric transversality of the two tori, and the correspondence between the intersection points and the inscribed rectangles. We present two distinct proofs: one involves the Lagrangian Floer homology, and the other is differential topological in nature which employs a novel computation formula for the algebraic intersection number. In Appendix B, written jointly with Urs Frauenfelder, we provide the detailed derivation of this computation formula.</description>

Abstract: Lavrentiev curves form a special class of rectifiable curves which includes cusp-free piecewise smooth curves. We call a Lavrentiev curve Legendrian if the integral of the contact form equals zero on any its subarc. We define Legendrian isotopies of such curves and prove that the equivalence classes of Legendrian Lavrentiev links with respect to Legendrian isotopies coincide with smooth classes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gromov used convex integration to prove that any closed orientable three-manifold equipped with a volume form admits three divergence-free vector fields which are linearly independent at every point. We provide an alternative proof of this (inspired by Seiberg-Witten theory) using geometric properties of eigenspinors in three dimensions. In fact, our proof shows that for any Riemannian metric, one can find three divergence-free vector fields such that at every point they are orthogonal and have the same non-zero length.</description>

      <title>Kontsevich's Characteristic Classes as Topological Invariants of Configuration Space Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kontsevich's characteristic classes are invariants of framed smooth fiber bundles with homology sphere fibers. It was shown by Watanabe that they can be used to distinguish smooth $S^4$-bundles that are all trivial as topological fiber bundles. In this article we show that this ability of Kontsevich's classes is a manifestation of the following principle: the ``real blow-up'' construction on a smooth manifold essentially depends on its smooth structure and thus, given a smooth manifold (or smooth fiber bundle) $M$, the topological invariants of spaces constructed from $M$ by real blow-ups could potentially differentiate smooth structures on $M$. The main theorem says that Kontsevich's characteristic classes of a smooth framed bundle $\pi$ are determined by the topology of the 2-point configuration space bundle of $\pi$ and framing data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We produce infinitely many distinct irreducible smooth 4-manifolds homeomorphic to #(2m+1)(CP^2 # -CP^2) and #(2n+1)(S^2 x S^2), respectively, for each m&gt;3 and n&gt;4. These provide the smallest exotic closed simply connected 4-manifolds with signature zero known to date, and in each one of these homeomorphism classes, we get minimal symplectic 4-manifolds. Our novel exotic 4-manifolds are derived from fairly special small Lefschetz fibrations we build via positive factorizations in the mapping class group, with spin and non-spin monodromies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of the present paper is twofold: firstly to extend to non-orientable compact 4-manifolds the notion of gem-induced trisection, directly obtained from colored triangulations (or, equivalently, from colored graphs encoding them, called gems); secondly to prove that, both in the orientable and non-orientable case, if the boundary is homeomorphic to a connected sum of sphere bundles over $\mathbb S^1$, gem-induced trisections naturally give rise to trisections of the corresponding closed 4-manifold. As a consequence, an estimation of the trisection genus of any closed orientable 4-manifold in terms of surgery description is obtained via colored triangulations.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic criteria for strong irreducibility of Heegaard splittings and finiteness of Goeritz groups</title>

Abstract: We give two criteria for diagrams of Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds. Weaker one of them guarantees that the splitting is strongly irreducible, and the stronger one guarantees in addition that the Goeritz group is finite. They are generalizations of the criteria introduced by Casson-Gordon and Lustig-Moriah. Their original ones require as input the diagram formed by a pair of maximal disk systems. Our present ones accept as input that of arbitrary disk systems, including minimal disk systems. In other words, our criteria accept Heegaard diagrams.</description>

Abstract: We give an expression for the Smith-Thom deficiency of the Hilbert square $X^{[2]}$ of a smooth real algebraic variety $X$ in terms of the rank of a suitable Mayer-Vietoris mapping in several situations. As a consequence, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the maximality of $X^{[2]}$ in the case of projective complete intersections, and show that with a few exceptions no real nonsingular projective complete intersection of even dimension has maximal Hilbert square. We also provide new examples of smooth real algebraic varieties with maximal Hilbert square.</description>

      <title>Relatively Anosov groups: finiteness, measure of maximal entropy, and reparameterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a geometrically finite Kleinian group $\Gamma$, the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure is finite and is the unique measure of maximal entropy for the geodesic flow, as shown by Sullivan and Otal-Peign\'e respectively. Moreover, it is strongly mixing by Babillot. We obtain a higher rank analogue of this theorem. Given a relatively Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$ of a semisimple real algebraic group, there is a family of flow spaces parameterized by linear forms tangent to the growth indicator. We construct a reparameterization of each flow space by the geodesic flow on the Groves-Manning space of $\Gamma$ which has an exponentially expanding property along unstable foliations. Using this reparameterization, we prove that the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure of each flow space is finite and is the unique measure of maximal entropy. Moreover, it is strongly mixing.</description>
