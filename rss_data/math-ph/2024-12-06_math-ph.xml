      <title>Spectral Networks: Bridging higher-rank Teichm\"uller theory and BPS states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This monograph is aiming to serve as a primary introduction to spectral networks, by presenting them and their many applications from the scope of geometry and mathematical physics in a unified way. We do not attempt to treat these two approaches separately but rather provide broad motivation and the necessary background to reach to the frontiers of this fast-evolving field of research, explaining simultaneously the relevant geometric and physical aspects. The targeted audience is researchers and advanced students from either a rather mathematical or physical oriented education who wish to enter the field.</description>

      <title>Energy cascades and condensation via coherent dynamics in Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work makes analytic progress in the deterministic study of turbulence in Hamiltonian systems by identifying two types of energy cascade solutions and the corresponding large- and small-scale structures they generate. The first cascade represents condensate formation via a highly coherent process recently uncovered, while the second cascade, which has not been previously observed, leads to the formation of other large-scale structures. The concentration of energy at small scales is characterized in both cases by the development of a power-law spectrum in finite time, causing the blow-up of Sobolev norms and the formation of coherent structures at small scales. These structures approach two different types of singularities: a point discontinuity in one case and a cusp in the other. The results are fully analytic and explicit, based on two solvable families of Hamiltonian systems identified in this study.</description>

      <title>KdV Equation for Theta Functions on Non-commutative Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fields of non-commutative geometry and string theory, quantum tori appear in different mathematical and physical contexts. Therefore, quantized theta functions defined on quantum tori are also studied (Yu. I. Manin, A. Schwartz; note that a comparison between the two definitions of quantum theta is still an open problem). One important application of classical theta functions is in soliton theory. Certain soliton equations, including the KdV equation, have algebro-geometric solutions that are given by theta functions (we refer to F. Gesztesy and H. Holden), and as such belong to an "integrable hierarchy." While quantized integrability is a very active and complicated subject, in this work we take a different, naive approach. We conduct an experiment: using a definition of differentiation on quantum tori (M. Rieffel), we ask whether the quantum theta function satisfies non-linear PDE. The experiment is successful on the 2-torus and for the KdV equation. This opens the way to future investigations, such as the quest for a compatible hierarchy satisfied by quantum theta, and a consistent definition of complete integrability.</description>

      <title>PT-Symmetry in $2\times 2$ Matrix Polynomials Formed by Pauli Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $2\times2$ matrix polynomials of the form $P_{n}(z)= \Sigma^{n}_{j=0}\,\sigma_{j}\,z^{j}$, for the cases $n=1,2,3$ are constructed, and the nature of PT-symmetry is examined across different points $z=(x,y)$ in the complex plane. The PT-symmetric properties of $P_{n}(z)$ can be characterized by two functions, denoted by $s(x,y)$ and $h(x,y)$. If the trace of the matrix polynomial is real, then the points at which it can exhibit PT-symmetry are defined by the family of curves $s(x,y)=0$. Additionally, at points where the function $h(x,y)\geq 0$, the matrix polynomial exhibits unbroken PT-symmetry; otherwise, it exhibits broken PT-symmetry. The intersection points of the curves $s(x,y)=0$ and $h(x,y)=k$, for a given $k\in \mathbb{R}$, are shown to lie on an ellipse, hyperbola, two lines passing through the origin, or a straight line, depending on the nature of PT-symmetry of the matrix polynomial. The PT-symmetric behaviour of $P_{n}(z)$ at the zeros of the matrix polynomial is also studied.</description>

      <title>Itinerant Ferromagnetism from One-Dimensional Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a universal kinetic mechanism for a half-metallic ferromagnet -- a metallic state with full spin polarization -- arising from strong on-site Coulomb repulsions between particles that exhibit constrained one-dimensional (1D) dynamics. We illustrate the mechanism in the context of a solvable model on a Lieb lattice in which doped electrons have 1D mobility. Such 1D motion is shown to induce only multi-spin ring exchanges of even parity, which mediate ferromagnetism and result in a unique half-metallic ground state. In contrast to the Nagaoka mechanism of ferromagnetism, this result pertains to any doped electron density in the {\it thermodynamic} limit. We explore various microscopic routes to such (approximate) 1D dynamics, highlighting two examples: doped holes in the strong-coupling limit of the Emery model and vacancies in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. Finally, we demonstrate an intriguing exact equivalence between the bosonic and fermionic versions of these models, which implies a novel mechanism for the conjectured Bose metallic phase.</description>

      <title>The essential self-adjointness of the wave operator on radiative spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the essential self-adjointness of the d'Alembertian $\square_g$, allowing a larger class of spacetimes than previously considered, including those that arise from perturbing Minkowski spacetime by gravitational radiation. We emphasize the fact, proven by Taira in closely related settings, that all tempered distributions $u$ satisfying $\square_g u = \lambda u +f$ for $\lambda\in \mathbb{C}\backslash \mathbb{R}$ and $f$ Schwartz are Schwartz. The proof is fully microlocal and relatively quick given the ``de,sc-'' machinery recently developed by the third author.</description>

      <title>On the role of the unitary transformations in Bell inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of the unitary transformations in the Bell-CHSH inequality is highlighted, in both Quantum Mechanics and relativistic Quantum Field Theory. In the former case, we discuss, through a few examples, how the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality can be encoded into unitary transformations acting on a given reference set of Bell's observables. In the latter case, the Bell-CHSH inequality for a real massive scalar field in the vacuum state is considered. After introducing suitable bounded Hermitian operators, we show that using unitary transformations can significantly improve our previous numerical algorithm, leading to an increase in the size of the violation.</description>

      <title>Super-Poissonian Squeezed Light in the Deep Strong Regime of the Quantum Rabi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By analytically solving the quantum Rabi model, we investigate the photonic properties of its ground eigenstate. In particular, we find that in the deep strong coupling regime, where the coupling strength $g$ exceeds the mode frequency $\omega$, the photonic state is effectively squeezed in one of its quadratures. The squeezing reaches its maximum at the curve corresponding to the quantum phase transition of the quantum Rabi system, and decreases rapidly on both sides of the phase transition. Notably, for $g/\omega\approx 3$, which is experimentally testable in existing trapped-ion platforms, the achievable squeezing parameter can reach approximately $r\approx 0.8$. Intriguingly, the photonic state is squeezed while its number distribution follows a super-Poissonian distribution, with the largest deviation from Poissonian behavior occurring at the phase transition between the normal and superradiant phases. In other words, the ground state of the quantum Rabi model contains super-Poissonian quantum squeezed photons.</description>

Abstract: We highlight a hidden aspect of scale-invariant actions that allow matter to couple with a dilaton field: $\ $the dynamics of the dilaton can be used to induce variations in Planck's quantum of action $\hbar$ and the speed of light $c$. This mechanism for generating variable $\hbar$ and $c$ in $\textit{curved}$ spacetimes offers novel insights into the origin of late-time cosmic acceleration, bypassing the need for dark energy.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian metric spaces and GH-convergence: the unbounded case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of Lorentzian metric space which drops the boundedness condition from our previous work and argue that the properties defining our spaces are minimal. In fact, they are defined by three conditions given by (a) the reverse triangle inequality for chronologically related events, (b) Lorentzian distance continuity and relative compactness of chronological diamonds, and (c) a distinguishing condition via the Lorentzian distance function. By adding a countably generating condition we confirm the validity of desirable properties for our spaces including the Polish property. The definition of (pre)length space given in our previous work on the bounded case is generalised to this setting. We also define a notion of Gromov-Hausdorff convergence for Lorentzian metric spaces and prove that (pre)length spaces are GH-stable. It is also shown that our (sequenced) Lorentzian metric space bring a natural quasi-uniformity (resp.\ quasi-metric). Finally, an explicit comparison with other recent constructions based on our previous work on bounded Lorentzian metric spaces is presented.</description>

      <title>On the Replica Symmetry of a Variant of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Spin Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider $N$ i.i.d. Ising spins with mean $m\in (-1,1)$ whose interactions are described by a Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian with a quartic correction. This model was recently introduced by Bolthausen in \cite{Bolt2} as a toy model to understand whether a second moment argument can be used to derive the replica symmetric formula in the full high temperature regime if $m\neq 0$. In \cite{Bolt2}, Bolthausen suggested that a natural analogue of the de Almeida-Thouless condition for the toy model is
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:conj} \beta^2(1-m^2)^2\leq 1. \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, \, (1)\end{equation} Here, $\beta \geq 0$ corresponds to the inverse temperature. While the second moment method implies replica symmetry for $\beta $ sufficiently small, Bolthausen showed that the method fails to prove replica symmetry in the full region described by (1). A natural question that was left open in \cite{Bolt2} is whether (1) correctly characterizes the high temperature phase of the toy model. In this note, we show that this is indeed not the case. We prove that if $|m| \geq m_*$, for some $m_* \in (0,1)$, the limiting free energy of the toy model is negative for suitable $\beta $ that satisfy (1).</description>

      <title>On the $1/c$ expansion in $2d$ CFTs with degenerate operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically determine the large central charge asymptotic expansion of the Virasoro conformal blocks entering in four-point functions with external degenerate operators on a sphere in $2d$ CFTs, and study its resurgence properties as a function of the conformal cross-ratio $z$. We focus on the cases of four heavy level-two $(2,1)$ degenerate operators, and two $(2,1)$ heavy degenerate ones plus two arbitrary light operators. The $1/c$ asymptotic series is Borel summable for generic values of $z$, but it jumps when a Stokes line is crossed. Starting from the $1/c$ series of the identity block, we show how a resurgent analysis allows us to completely determine the other Virasoro block and in fact to reconstruct the full correlator. We also show that forbidden singularities, known to exist in correlators with two heavy and two light operators, appear with four heavy operators as well. In both cases, they are turning points emanating Stokes lines, artefacts of the asymptotic expansion, and we show how they are non perturbatively resolved. More general correlators and implications for gravitational theories in $\text{AdS}_{3}$ are briefly discussed. Our results are based on new asymptotic expansions for large parameters $(a,b,c)$ of certain hypergeometric functions $\,_2 F_1(a,b,c;z)$ which can be useful in general.</description>

      <title>Unitarity bounds with subthreshold and anomalous cuts for $b$-hadron decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a generalisation of the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) parametrization. Most form factors (FFs) in $b$-hadron decays exhibit additional branch cuts -- namely subthreshold and anomalous branch cuts -- beyond the ``standard'' unitarity cut. These additional cuts cannot be adequately accounted for by the BGL parametrization. For instance, these cuts arise in the FFs for $B\to D^{(*)}$, $B\to K^{(*)}$, and $\Lambda_b\to \Lambda$ processes, which are particularly relevant from a phenomenological standpoint. We demonstrate how to parametrize such FFs and derive unitarity bounds in the presence of subthreshold and/or anomalous branch cuts. Our work paves the way for a wide range of new FF analyses based solely on first principles, thereby minimising systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>From Magic State Distillation to Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic State Distillation (MSD) has been a research focus for fault-tolerant quantum computing due to the need for non-Clifford resource in gaining quantum advantage. Although many of the MSD protocols so far are based on stabilizer codes with transversal $T$ gates, there exists quite several protocols that don't fall into this class. We propose a method to map MSD protocols to iterative dynamical systems under the framework of stabilizer reduction. With our mapping, we are able to analyze the performance of MSD protocols using techniques from dynamical systems theory, easily simulate the distillation process of input states under arbitrary noise model and visualize it using flow diagram. We apply our mapping to common MSD protocols for $\ket{T}$ state and find some interesting properties: The $[[15, 1, 3]]$ code may distill states corresponding to $\sqrt{T}$ gate and the $[[5, 1, 3]]$ code can distill the magic state for corresponding to the $T$ gate. Besides, we examine the exotic MSD protocols that may distill into other magic states proposed in [Eur. Phys. J. D 70, 55 (2016)] and identify the condition for distillable magic states. We also study new MSD protocols generated by concatenating different codes and numerically demonstrate that concatenation can generate MSD protocols with various magic states. By concatenating efficient codes with exotic codes, we can reduce the overhead of the exotic MSD protocols. We believe our proposed method will be a useful tool for simulating and visualization MSD protocols for canonical MSD protocols on $\ket{T}$ as well as other unexplored MSD protocols for other states.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Maxwell field coupled to a single rotating charge. This Hamiltonian system admits soliton-type solutions, where the field is static, while the charge rotates with constant angular velocity. We prove that any solution of finite energy converges, in suitable local energy seminorms, to the corresponding soliton in the long time limit.</description>

      <title>Bessel potentials and Green functions on pseudo-Euclidean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review properties of Bessel potentials, that is, inverse Fourier transforms of (regularizations of) $\frac{1}{(m^2+p^2)^{\frac{\mu}{2}}}$ on a pseudoEuclidean space with signature $(q,d-q)$. We are mostly interested in the Lorentzian signature $(1,d-1)$, and the case $\mu=2$, related to the Klein-Gordon equation $(-\Box+m^2)f=0$. We analyze properties of various ``two-point functions'', which play an important role in Quantum Field Theory, such as the retarded/advanced propagators or Feynman/antiFeynman propagators. We consistently use hypergeometric functions instead of Bessel functions, which makes most formulas much more transparent. We pay attention to distributional properties of various Bessel potentials. We include in our analysis the ``tachyonic case'', corresponding to the ``wrong'' sign in the Klein-Gordon equation.</description>

      <title>Embedding formalism for ${\mathcal N}$-extended AdS superspace in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04135v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The supertwistor and bi-supertwistor formulations for ${\mathcal N}$-extended anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspace in four dimensions, ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$, were derived two years ago in arXiv:2108.03907. In the present paper, we introduce a novel realisation of the ${\mathcal N}$-extended AdS supergroup $\mathsf{OSp}(\mathcal{N}|4;\mathbb{R})$ and apply it to develop a coset construction for ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$ and the corresponding differential geometry. This realisation naturally leads to an atlas on ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$ (that is a generalisation of the stereographic projection for a sphere) that consists of two charts with chiral transition functions for ${\mathcal N}&gt;0$. A manifestly $\mathsf{OSp}(\mathcal{N}|4;\mathbb{R})$ invariant model for a superparticle in ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$ is proposed. Additionally, by employing a conformal superspace approach, we describe the most general conformally flat $\mathcal N$-extended supergeometry. This construction is then specialised to the case of ${\rm AdS}^{4|4\mathcal N}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Immersion (i.e., local embedding) is relevant to the physics of topologically ordered phases through entanglement bootstrap. An annulus can immerse in a disk or a sphere as a "figure-8", which cannot be smoothly deformed to an embedded annulus. We investigate a simple problem: is there an Abelian state on the immersed figure-8 annulus, locally indistinguishable from the ground state of the background physical system? We show that if the answer is affirmative, a strong sense of isomorphism must hold: two homeomorphic immersed regions must have isomorphic information convex sets, even if they cannot smoothly deform to each other on the background physical system. We explain why to care about strong isomorphism in physical systems with anyons and give proof in the context of Abelian anyon theory. We further discuss a connection between immersed annuli and anyon transportation in the presence of topological defects. In appendices, we discuss related problems in broader contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the anti-ferromagnetic Potts model on trees exhibits strong spatial mixing for a near-optimal range of parameters. Our work complements recent results of Chen, Liu, Mani, and Moitra [arXiv.2304.01954] who showed this to be true in the infinite temperature setting, corresponding to uniform proper colorings. We furthermore prove weak spatial mixing results complementing results in [arXiv.2304.01954].</description>

      <title>A scaling limit of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice Yang-Mills-Higgs theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The construction of non-Abelian Euclidean Yang-Mills theories in dimension four, as scaling limits of lattice Yang-Mills theories or otherwise, is a central open question of mathematical physics. This paper takes the following small step towards this goal. In any dimension $d\ge 2$, we construct a scaling limit of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice Yang-Mills theory coupled to a Higgs field transforming in the fundamental representation of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. After unitary gauge fixing and taking the lattice spacing $\varepsilon\to 0$, and simultaneously taking the gauge coupling constant $g\to 0$ and the Higgs length $\alpha\to \infty$ in such a manner that $\alpha g$ is always equal to $c\varepsilon$ for some fixed $c$ and $g= O(\varepsilon^{50d})$, a stereographic projection of the gauge field is shown to converge to a scale-invariant massive Gaussian field. This gives the first construction of a scaling limit of a non-Abelian lattice Yang-Mills theory in a dimension higher than two, as well as the first rigorous proof of mass generation by the Higgs mechanism in such a theory. Analogous results are proved for $\mathrm{U}(1)$ theory as well. The question of constructing a non-Gaussian scaling limit remains open.</description>

      <title>Bounds for Equilibrium States on Amenable Group Subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a result on equilibrium measures for potentials with summable variation on arbitrary subshifts over a countable amenable group. For finite configurations $v$ and $w$, if $v$ is always replaceable by $w$, we obtain a bound on the measure of $v$ depending on the measure of $w$ and a cocycle induced by the potential.
  We then use this result to show that under this replaceability condition, we can obtain bounds on the Lebesgue-Radon-Nikodym derivative $d (\mu_\phi \circ \xi ) / d\mu_\phi $ for certain holonomies $\xi$ that generate the homoclinic (Gibbs) relation.
  As corollaries, we obtain extensions of results by Meyerovitch and Garcia-Ramos and Pavlov to the countable amenable group subshift setting. Our methods rely on the exact tiling result for countable amenable groups by Downarowicz, Huczek, and Zhang and an adapted proof technique from Garcia-Ramos and Pavlov.</description>

      <title>Wiener-Hopf solution of the free energy TBA problem and instanton sectors in the O(3) sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbation theory in asymptotically free quantum field theories is asymptotic. The factorially growing perturbative coefficients carry information about non-perturbative corrections, which can be related to renormalons and instantons. Using the Wiener-Hopf technique we determine the full analytic solution for the free energy density in the two dimensional $O(N)$ sigma models. For $N&gt;3$ there are no instantons, and we found that the perturbative series carries all the information about the non-perturbative corrections. However, in the $O(3)$ case, we identify several non-perturbative sectors that are not related to the asymptotics of the perturbative series. The number of sectors depends on the observables: for the ground-state energy density we identify three sectors, which we attribute to instantons. For the free energy density in the running perturbative coupling we found infinitely many sectors.</description>

Abstract: The existence of a set of $10$ Intrinsic Conformal Symmetries, which acts on three-dimensional hypersurfaces (spacelike or timelike), leads to the existence of two distinct families of 5D geometries. These models represent the general solutions of the bulk field equations where their energy-momentum tensor, includes only two components: a negative cosmological constant and a parallel pressure $p_{\parallel}$ aligned with the extra spatial dimension. Significantly, these models offer a novel perspective for investigating the impacts of spatial inhomogeneity and anisotropy on the cosmological evolution of the Universe, particularly within the context of the braneworld scenarios. It is shown that one of these families reduces to a \emph{fully inhomogeneous, anisotropic and conformally flat brane model} with a \emph{perfect fluid equation of state} and corresponds to the Stephani Universe (i.e. a Stephani brane) which implies that our model can be matched smoothly with the standard FRW model. We provide the generalized Friedmann and Raychaudhuri equations and we present how the additional quantities could affect the cosmological evolution. In particular we show that the new constituents are the terms $p_{\parallel }$, $\sigma ^{2}$ and the four acceleration of the brane observers that could affect the observational measurement of the Hubble parameter depending on which term dominates therefore provide us a potential answer to the Hubble tension and cosmic acceleration problems due to local inhomogeneities and anisotropies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the nature of exotic spheres from two novel perspectives, addressing the fundamental question: ``What makes an exotic sphere exotic?''
  First, we explore spherical T-duality in the context of $\mathrm{S}^3$-bundles over $\mathrm{S}^4$. We demonstrate that the distinct smooth structures of exotic spheres $\Sigma^7$ correspond to spherical T-dual pairs for 16 out of the 28 diffeomorphism classes of smooth structures on seven-dimensional homotopy spheres. Furthermore, we show that spherical T-dual pairs can be encoded in $\star$-diagrams. These diagrams impose equivalences that constrain their $\mathrm{S}^3$-invariant geometries.
  Second, we introduce homotopy Hopf manifolds $\Sigma^7 \times \mathrm{S}^1$ and examine their complex structures using logarithmic transformations. This analysis links their smooth structures to the algebraic and topological invariants of Fano orbifolds. Additionally, we relate these constructions to the Homological Mirror Symmetry program and propose connections to the theory of topological modular forms, aiming to unify geometric topology, elliptic cohomology, and modular forms.</description>

      <title>On $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ permutation gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct a (unitary) $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ permutation gauging of a (unitary) modular category $\mathcal{C}$. In particular, the formula for the modular data of the gauged theory is provided in terms of modular data of $\mathcal{C}$, which provides positive evidence of the reconstruction program. Moreover as a direct consequence, the formula for the fusion rules is derived, verifying the conjectured formula of Edie-Michell-Jones-Plavnik. Our construction explicitly shows the genus-$0$ data of the gauged theory contains higher genus data of the original theory. As applications, we obtain an identity for the modular data that does not come from modular group relations, and we prove that representations of the symmetric mapping class group (associated to closed surfaces) coming from weakly group theoretical modular categories have finite images.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of Mandelbrot cascades -- in the context of vector-valued martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve a long-standing open problem of determining the Fourier dimension of the Mandelbrot canonical cascade measure (MCCM). This problem of significant interest was raised by Mandelbrot in 1976 and reiterated by Kahane in 1993. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Fourier dimension of the MCCM for random weights $W$ satisfying the condition $\mathbb{E}[W^t]&lt;\infty$ for all $t&gt;0$. As a corollary, we prove that the MCCM is Salem if and only if the random weight has a specific two-point distribution. In addition, we show that the MCCM is Rajchman with polynomial Fourier decay whenever the random weight satisfies $\mathbb{E}[W^{1+\delta}]&lt;\infty$ for some $\delta&gt;0$. As a consequence, we discover that, in the Biggins-Kyprianou's boundary case, the Fourier dimension of the MCCM exhibits a second order phase transition at the inverse temperature $\beta = 1/2$; we establish the upper Frostman regularity for MCCM; and we obtain a Fourier restriction estimate for MCCM.
  While the precise Fourier dimension formula seems to be a little magical in the realm of cascade theory, it turns out to be fairly natural in the context of vector-valued martingales. Indeed, the vector-valued martingales will play key roles in our new formalism of actions by multiplicative cascades on finitely additive vector measures, which is the major novelty of this paper.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits on 2-regular circulant digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits (equivalence classes of closed cycles up to cyclic shifts) play an important role in applications of graph theory. For example, they appear in the definition of the Ihara zeta function and exact trace formulae for the spectra of quantum graphs. Circulant graphs are Cayley graphs of $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Here we consider directed Cayley graphs with two generators (2-regular Cayley digraphs). We determine the number of primitive periodic orbits of a given length (total number of directed edges) in terms of the number of times edges corresponding to each generator appear in the periodic orbit (the step count). Primitive periodic orbits are those periodic orbits that cannot be written as a repetition of a shorter orbit. We describe the lattice structure of lengths and step counts for which periodic orbits exist and characterize the repetition number of a periodic orbit by its winding number (the sum of the step sequence divided by the number of vertices) and the repetition number of its step sequence. To obtain these results, we also evaluate the number of Lyndon words on an alphabet of two letters with a given length and letter count.</description>

      <title>Closed orbits of MHD equilibria with orientation-reversing symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a generalisation of the periodic orbit structure often seen in reflection or mirror symmetric MHD equilibria, we consider equilibria with other orientation-reversing symmetries. An example of such a symmetry, which is a not a reflection, is the parity transformation $(x,y,z) \mapsto (-x,-y,-z)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. It is shown under any orientation-reversing isometry, that if the pressure function is assumed to have toroidally nested level sets, then all orbits on the tori are necessarily periodic. The techniques involved are almost entirely topological in nature and give rise to a handy index describing how a diffeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}^3$ alters the poloidal and toroidal curves of an invariant embedded 2-torus.</description>

Abstract: We consider the standard overlap $\mathcal{O}_{ij}: =\langle \mathbf{r}_j, \mathbf{r}_i\rangle\langle \mathbf{l}_j, \mathbf{l}_i\rangle$ of any bi-orthogonal family of left and right eigenvectors of a large random matrix $X$ with centred i.i.d. entries and we prove that it decays as an inverse second power of the distance between the corresponding eigenvalues. This extends similar results for the complex Gaussian ensemble from Bourgade and Dubach [arXiv:1801.01219], as well as Benaych-Georges and Zeitouni [arXiv:1806.06806], to any i.i.d. matrix ensemble in both symmetry classes. As a main tool, we prove a two-resolvent local law for the Hermitisation of $X$ uniformly in the spectrum with optimal decay rate and optimal dependence on the density near the spectral edge.</description>

      <title>Physical Vacuum Problems for the Full Compressible Euler Equations: Hadamard-style Local Well-posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript addresses the local well-posedness theories for the dynamics of non-isentropic compressible Euler equations in a physical vacuum. We establish the Hadamard-style local well-posedness within suitable weighted Sobolev spaces, demonstrating existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on initial data. Additionally, we provide a priori energy estimates and continuation criteria. These results are applicable to the low-regularity solutions, in the sense that, the pointwise regularities of the free boundaries and the velocity fields restricted to them could merely be $C^{1.5+}$ and $C^{1+}$, respectively.
  This is the first well-posedness result for the full compressible Euler equations in a physical vacuum for space dimensions not restricted to one. The approach is based on the framework of Eulerian coordinates.</description>

      <title>Direct linearisation of the non-commutative Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the non-commutative Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation and a `lifted' modified Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (mKP) equation are directly linearisable, and thus integrable in this sense. There are several versions of the non-commutative mKP equations, including the two-dimensional generalisations of the non-commutative modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation and its alternative form (amKdV). Herein we derive the `lifted' mKP equation, whose solutions are the natural two-dimensional extension of those for the non-commutative mKdV equation derived in Blower and Malham. We also present the log-potential form of the mKP equation, from which all of these non-commutative mKP equations can be derived. To achieve the integrability results, we construct the pre-Poppe algebra that underlies the KP and mKP equations. This is a non-commutative polynomial algebra over the real line generated by the solution (and its partial derivatives) to the linearised form of the KP and mKP equations. The algebra is endowed with a pre-Poppe product, based on the product rule for semi-additive operators pioneered by Poppe for the commutative KP equation. Integrability corresponds to establishing a particular polynomial expansion in the respective pre-Poppe algebra. We also present numerical simulations of soliton-like interactions for the non-commutative KP equation.</description>

      <title>Generalized coherent states for the harmonic oscillator by the J-matrix method with an extension to the Morse potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While dealing with the J-Matrix method for the harmonic oscillator to write down its tridiagonal matrix representation in an orthonormal basis of L2(R); we rederive a set of generalized coherent states (GCS) of Perelomov type labeled by points z of the complex plane C and depending on a positive integer number m The number states expansion of these GCS gives rise to coefficients that are complex Hermite polynomials whose linear superpositions provide eigenfunctions for the two-dimensional magnetic Laplacian associated with the mth Landau level. We extend this procedure to the Morse oscillator by constructing a new set of GCS of Glauber type.</description>
