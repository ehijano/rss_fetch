      <title>Dimension vectors of $\tau$-rigid modules and $f$-vectors of cluster monomials from triangulated surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}$ associated with a triangulated surface, we give a characterization of the triangulated surface such that different non-initial cluster monomials in $\mathcal{A}$ have different $f$-vectors. Similarly, for the associated Jacobian algebra $J$, we give a characterization of the triangulated surface such that different $\tau$-rigid $J$-modules have different dimension vectors. Moreover, we also show that different basic support $\tau$-tilting $J$-modules have different dimension vectors. Our main ingredient is a notion of intersection numbers defined by Qiu and Zhou. As an application, we show that the denominator conjecture holds for $\mathcal{A}$ if the marked surface is a closed surface with exactly one puncture, or the given tagged triangulation has neither loops nor tagged arcs connecting punctures.</description>

      <title>Exotic Spaltenstein varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a new family of algebraic varieties, called exotic Spaltenstein varieties. These generalise the notion of Spaltenstein varieties (which are the partial flag analogues to classical Springer fibres) to the case of exotic Springer fibres. We show that, for self-adjoint nilpotent endomorphisms of order two, the top-dimensional irreducible components are in bijection with semi-standard Young bitableaux, via constructing an explicit map. Moreover, we are able to give a combinatorial formula for this top dimension. We conjecture that this description of the irreducible components holds for nilpotent endomorphisms of arbitrary order. Finally, we mention some connections to the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of Tanabe algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the (co)homology of Tanabe algebras, which are a family of subalgebras of the partition algebras exhibiting a Schur-Weyl duality with certain complex reflection groups. The homology of the partition algebras has been shown to be related to the homology of the symmetric groups by Boyd-Hepworth-Patzt and the results they obtain depend on a parameter. In all known results, the homology of a diagram algebra is dependent on one of two things: the invertibility of a parameter in the ground ring or the parity of the positive integer indexing the number of pairs of vertices. We show that the (co)homology of Tanabe algebras is isomorphic to the (co)homology of the symmetric groups and that this is independent of both the parameter and the parity of the index. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a result of this sort. Along the way we will also study the (co)homology of the uniform block permutation algebra and the totally propagating partition algebra as well collecting cohomological analogues of known results for the homology of partition algebras and Jones annular algebras.</description>

      <title>Formal extension of noncommutative tensor-triangular support varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a support variety theory defined on the compact part of a monoidal triangulated category, we define an extension to the non-compact part following the blueprint of Benson--Carlson--Rickard, Benson--Iyengar--Krause, Balmer--Favi, and Stevenson. We generalize important aspects of the theory of extended support varieties to the noncommutative case, and give characterizations of when an extended support theory detects the zero object, under certain assumptions. In particular, we show that when the original support variety theory is based on a Noetherian topological space, detects the zero object, satisfies a generalized tensor product property, and comes equipped with a comparison map, then the extended support variety also detects the zero object. In the case of stable categories of finite tensor categories, this gives conditions under which the central cohomological support admits an extension that detects the zero object, confirming part of a recent conjecture made by the second author together with Nakano and Yakimov.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a derivation on the enhanced nilHecke algebra yielding a p-dg algebra when working over a field of characteristic p. We define functors on the category of p-dg modules resulting in an action of small quantum sl2 on the Grothendieck group, which is isomorphic to a baby Verma module. We upgrade the derivation into an action of the Lie algebra sl(2).</description>

      <title>Representation theory of topological full groups of \'etale groupoids and paradoxicality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.10767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a unified treatment of several results concerning full groups of ample groupoids and paradoxical decompositions attached to them. This includes a criterion for the full group of an ample groupoid being amenable as well as comparison of its orbit, Koopman and groupoid-left-regular representations. Besides that, we unify several recent results about paradoxicality in semigroups and groupoids, relating embeddings of Thompson's group V into full groups of ample \'etale groupoids.</description>

      <title>Compatible weak factorization systems and model structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper the concept of compatible weak factorization systems in general categories is introduced as a counterpart of compatible complete cotorsion pairs in abelian categories. We describe a method to construct model structures on general categories via two compatible weak factorization systems satisfying certain conditions, and hence generalize a very useful result by Gillespie for abelian model structures. As particular examples, we show that weak factorizations systems associated to some classical model structures (for example, the Kan-Quillen model structure on $\mathsf{sSet}$) satisfy these conditions.</description>

      <title>Symplectic geometry of electrical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we relate a well-known in symplectic geometry compactification of the space of symmetric bilinear forms considered as a chart of the Lagrangian Grassmannian to the specific compactifications of the space of electrical networks in the disc obtained in \cite{L}, \cite{CGS} and \cite{BGKT}. In particular, we state an explicit connection between these works and describe some of the combinatorics developed there in the language of symplectic geometry. We also show that the combinatorics of the concordance vectors forces the uniqueness of the symplectic form, such that corresponding points of the Grassmannian are isotropic. We define a notion of Lagrangian concordance which provides a construction of the compactification of the space of electrical networks in the positive part of the Lagrangian Grassmannian bypassing the construction from \cite{L}.</description>

      <title>Singularity categories of rational double points in arbitrary characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a one-to-one correspondence between the singularity categories of rational double points and the simply-laced Dynkin graphs in arbitrary characteristic. This correspondence is well-known in characteristic zero since the rational double points are quotient singularities in characteristic zero whereas not necessarily in positive characteristic. Considering some rational double points are not taut in characteristic two, three or five, we can see there exist two rational double points which are not analytically isomorphic but whose singularity categories are triangulated equivalent. As an application, we construct a counter-example in positive characteristic of a theorem of Hua and Keller: the dg singularity category of a hypersurface singularity determines its Tyurina algebra.</description>

      <title>Transitivity in wreath products with symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the notion of a transitive subgroup of a permutation group $P$ extends naturally to the subsets of $P$. We study transitive subsets of the wreath product $G \wr S_n$, where $G$ is a finite abelian group. This includes the hyperoctahedral group for $G=C_2$. We give structural characterisations of transitive subsets using the character theory of $G \wr S_n$ and interpret such subsets as designs in the conjugacy class association scheme of $G \wr S_n$. In particular, we prove a generalisation of the Livingstone-Wagner theorem and give explicit constructions of transitive sets. Moreover, we establish connections to orthogonal polynomials, namely the Charlier polynomials, and use them to study codes and designs in $C_r \wr S_n$. Many of our results extend results about the symmetric group $S_n$.</description>
