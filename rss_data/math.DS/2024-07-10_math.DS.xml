      <title>Limits and Powers of Koopman Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical systems provide a comprehensive way to study complex and changing behaviors across various sciences. Many modern systems are too complicated to analyze directly or we do not have access to models, driving significant interest in learning methods. Koopman operators have emerged as a dominant approach because they allow the study of nonlinear dynamics using linear techniques by solving an infinite-dimensional spectral problem. However, current algorithms face challenges such as lack of convergence, hindering practical progress. This paper addresses a fundamental open question: \textit{When can we robustly learn the spectral properties of Koopman operators from trajectory data of dynamical systems, and when can we not?} Understanding these boundaries is crucial for analysis, applications, and designing algorithms. We establish a foundational approach that combines computational analysis and ergodic theory, revealing the first fundamental barriers -- universal for any algorithm -- associated with system geometry and complexity, regardless of data quality and quantity. For instance, we demonstrate well-behaved smooth dynamical systems on tori where non-trivial eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator cannot be determined by any sequence of (even randomized) algorithms, even with unlimited training data. Additionally, we identify when learning is possible and introduce optimal algorithms with verification that overcome issues in standard methods. These results pave the way for a sharp classification theory of data-driven dynamical systems based on how many limits are needed to solve a problem. These limits characterize all previous methods, presenting a unified view. Our framework systematically determines when and how Koopman spectral properties can be learned.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional $C^0$ transversality and the shadowing property for Axiom A diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Petrov and Pilyugin (2015) generalized a notion of $C^0$ transversality of Sakai (1995) using smooth curves. Their definition involves only continuous maps from ${\mathbb R}^n$ to a manifold, which is a purely topological one. They also provided a sufficient condition for the $C^0$ transversality in terms of homological nature. In this paper, we prove that such a homological condition of Axiom A diffeomorphisms is sufficient for enjoying the shadowing property. Moreover, it is proved that the $C^0$ transversality of Axiom A diffeomorphisms with codimension one basic sets implies the homological condition.</description>

      <title>Interior points and Lebesgue measure of overlapping Mandelbrot percolation sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a special one-parameter family of d-dimensional random, homogeneous self-similar iterated function systems (IFSs) satisfying the finite type condition. The object of our study is the positivity of Lebesgue measure and the existence of interior points in these random sets and in particular the existence of an interesting parameter interval where the attractor has positive Lebesgue measure, but empty interior almost surely conditioned on the attractor not being empty. We give a sharp bound on the critical probability for the case of positivity Lebesgue measure using the theory of multitype branching processes in random environments and in some special cases on the critical probability for the existence of interior points. Using a recent result of Tom Rush, we provide a family of such random sets where there exists a parameter interval for which the corresponding attractor has a positive Lebesgue measure, but empty interior almost surely conditioned on the attractor not being empty.</description>

      <title>Mixing, Li-Yorke chaos, distributional chaos and Kato's chaos to multiple mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,d)$ be a compact metric space and $F=\{f_1,f_2,...,f_m\}$ be an $m$-tuple of continuous maps from $X$ to itself. In this paper, we introduce the definitions of transitivity, weakly mixing and mixing of multiple mappings $(X,F)$ from a set-valued perspective, which is the semigroup generated by $F$ based on iterated function system. Firstly, we prove that for multiple mappings, mixing implies distributional chaos in a sequence, Li-Yorke chaos and Kato's chaos. Besides, we demonstrate that $F$ is Kato's chaos if and only if $F^k$ is Kato's chaos for any $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Finally, we construct a symbolic dynamical system to show that distributional chaos may be generated by only two strongly non-wandering points.</description>

      <title>$(\omega, \alpha, n)$-sensitivity and limit sets of zero entropy homeomorphisms on the square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a homeomorphism $f$ of a compact metric space $X$ and a positive integer $n\geq 2$, we introduce the notion of $(\omega, \alpha, n)$-sensitivity of $f$, which describes such a kind of chaos: there is some $c&gt;0$ such that for any $x\in X$ and any open neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there are points $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and $\{y_i\}_{i=1}^n$ in $U$ such that both the collection of $\omega$-limit sets $\omega(x_i, f)$ and that of the $\alpha$-limit sets $\alpha(y_i, f)$ are pairwise $c$-separated. Then we construct a class of homeomorphisms of the square $[-1, 1]^2$ which are $(\omega, \alpha, n)$-sensitive for any $n\geq 2$ and have zero topological entropies. To investigate further the complexity of zero entropy homeomorphisms by using limit sets, we analyze in depth the limit sets of square homeomorphisms by the boundary permeating technique. Specially, we prove that for any given set of points $Y\equiv\{y_{n1}, y_{n2}:n\in\mathbb N\}$ in $(-1, 1)^2$ which satisfies some loosely technical conditions, and for any given family of pairwise disjoint countable dense subsets $\{W_n:n\in\mathbb N\}$ of $(-1, 1)^2-Y$, there is a zero entropy homeomorphism $f$ on the square $[-1, 1]^2$ such that $\omega(x, f)=\{y_{n1}\}$ and $\alpha(x, f)=\{y_{n2}\}$ for any $n$ and any $x\in W_n$.</description>

      <title>Rank-one systems, flexible classes and Shannon orbit equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a Shannon orbit equivalence between the universal odometer and a variety of rank-one systems. This is done in a unified manner, using what we call flexible classes of rank-one transformations. Our main result is that every flexible class contains an element which is Shannon orbit equivalent to the universal odometer. Since a typical example of flexible class is $\{T\}$ when $T$ is an odometer, our work generalizes a recent result by Kerr and Li, stating that every odometer is Shannon orbit equivalent to the universal odometer. When the flexible class is a singleton, the rank-one transformation given by the main result is explicit. This applies to odometers, Chacon's map and irrational rotations for almost every angle. We also prove that strongly mixing systems, or systems with a given eigenvalue form flexible classes. In particular, strong mixing, rationality or irrationality of the eigenvalues are not preserved under Shannon orbit equivalence.</description>

      <title>System stabilization with policy optimization on unstable latent manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stability is a basic requirement when studying the behavior of dynamical systems. However, stabilizing dynamical systems via reinforcement learning is challenging because only little data can be collected over short time horizons before instabilities are triggered and data become meaningless. This work introduces a reinforcement learning approach that is formulated over latent manifolds of unstable dynamics so that stabilizing policies can be trained from few data samples. The unstable manifolds are minimal in the sense that they contain the lowest dimensional dynamics that are necessary for learning policies that guarantee stabilization. This is in stark contrast to generic latent manifolds that aim to approximate all -- stable and unstable -- system dynamics and thus are higher dimensional and often require higher amounts of data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach stabilizes even complex physical systems from few data samples for which other methods that operate either directly in the system state space or on generic latent manifolds fail.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of stable and unstable manifolds of a hyperbolic cycle under perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stable and unstable manifolds, originating from hyperbolic cycles, fundamentally characterize the behaviour of dynamical systems in chaotic regions. This letter demonstrates that their shifts under perturbation, crucial for chaos control, are computable with minimal effort using functional derivatives by considering the entire system as an argument. The shifts of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits, as the intersections of these manifolds, are readily calculated by analyzing the movements of the intersection points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study extends the functional perturbation theory, originally developed for orbits and periodic orbits in dynamical systems, \textit{e.g.} a map $\mathcal{P}$, to derive formulae for the deformation of an $d$-dimensional invariant torus, on which one can define $\mathcal{P}^k$ for $k\in \mathbb{R}$ and even $\mathbf{k}\in\mathbb{R}^d$ to continuize and generalize the exponential function $\mathcal{P}^{\mathbf{k}}$ in $k$. The invariant tori, which manifest as closed flux surfaces in magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) machines, are the dominant structure influencing the radial transport and, consequently, the overall confinement performance.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a nonlinear fish-bone model for suspension bridges with rigid hangers in the presence of flow effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a dynamic system of nonlinear partial differential equations modeling the motions of a suspension bridge. This fish-bone model captures the flexural displacements of the bridge deck's mid-line, and each chordal filament's rotation angle from the centerline. These two dynamics are strongly coupled through the effect of cable-hanger, appearing through a sublinear function. Additionally, a structural nonlinearity of Woinowsky-Krieger type is included, allowing for large displacements. Well-posedness of weak solutions is shown and long-time dynamics are studied. In particular, to force the dynamics, we invoke a non-conservative potential flow approximation which, although greatly simplified from the full multi-physics fluid-structure interaction, provides a driver for non-trivial end behaviors. We describe the conditions under which the dynamics are uniformly stable, as well as demonstrate the existence of a compact global attractor under all nonlinear and non-conservative effects. To do so, we invoke the theory of quasi-stability, first explicitly constructing an absorbing ball via stability estimates and, subsequently, demonstrating a stabilizability estimate on trajectory differences applied to the aforesaid absorbing ball. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to examine the possible end behaviors of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Contact geometry of Hill's approximation in a spatial restricted four-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the planar and spatial circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) is of contact type for all energy values below the first critical value. Burgos-Garc\'ia and Gidea extended Hill's approach in the CR3BP to the spatial equilateral CR4BP, which can be used to approximate the dynamics of a small body near a Trojan asteroid of a Sun--planet system. Our main result in this paper is that this Hill four-body system also has the contact property. In other words, we can "contact" the Trojan. Such a result enables to use holomorphic curve techniques and Floer theoretical tools in this dynamical system in the energy range where the contact property holds.</description>

Abstract: For Euclidean pure point diffractive Delone sets of finite local complexity and with uniform patch frequencies it is well known that the patch counting entropy computed along the closed centred balls is zero. We consider such sets in the setting of sigma-compact locally compact Abelian groups and show that the topological entropy of the associated Delone dynamical system is zero. For this we provide a suitable version of the variational principle. We furthermore construct counterexamples, which show that the patch counting entropy of such sets can be non-zero in this context. Other counterexamples will show that the patch counting entropy of such a set can not be computed along a limit and even be infinite in this setting.</description>

Each horocycle is closed or dense on a certain subset of the unit tangent bundle. In fact, we classify each half-horocycle in terms of the associated geodesic rays. We also determine the nonwandering set of the horocyclic flow and characterize the surfaces admitting a minimal set for this flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.02188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A number of recent studies have proposed that linear representations are appropriate for solving nonlinear dynamical systems with quantum computers, which fundamentally act linearly on a wave function in a Hilbert space. Linear representations, such as the Koopman representation and Koopman von Neumann mechanics, have regained attention from the dynamical-systems research community. Here, we aim to present a unified theoretical framework, currently missing in the literature, with which one can compare and relate existing methods, their conceptual basis, and their representations. We also aim to show that, despite the fact that quantum simulation of nonlinear classical systems may be possible with such linear representations, a necessary projection into a feasible finite-dimensional space will in practice eventually induce numerical artifacts which can be hard to eliminate or even control. As a result, a practical, reliable and accurate way to use quantum computation for solving general nonlinear dynamical systems is still an open problem.</description>

      <title>Population dynamics under demographic and environmental stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to the study of the long term dynamics of diffusion processes modelling a single species that experiences both demographic and environmental stochasticity. In our setting, the long term dynamics of the diffusion process in the absence of demographic stochasticity is determined by the sign of $\Lambda_0$, the external Lyapunov exponent, as follows: $\Lambda_0&lt;0$ implies (asymptotic) extinction and $\Lambda_0&gt;0$ implies convergence to a unique positive stationary distribution $\mu_0$. If the system is of size $\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}$ for small $\epsilon&gt;0$ (the intensity of demographic stochasticity), demographic effects will make the extinction time finite almost surely. This suggests that to understand the dynamics one should analyze the quasi-stationary distribution (QSD) $\mu_\epsilon$ of the system. The existence and uniqueness of the QSD is well-known under mild assumptions.
  We look at what happens when the population size is sent to infinity, i.e., when $\epsilon\to 0$. We show that the external Lyapunov exponent still plays a key role: 1) If $\Lambda_0&lt;0$, then $\mu_\epsilon\to \delta_0$, the mean extinction time is of order $|\ln \epsilon|$ and the extinction rate associated with the QSD $\mu_{\epsilon}$ has a lower bound of order $\frac{1}{|\ln\epsilon|}$; 2) If $\Lambda_0&gt;0$, then $\mu_\epsilon\to \mu_0$, the mean extinction time is polynomial in $\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}$ and the extinction rate is polynomial in $\epsilon^{2}$. Furthermore, when $\Lambda_0&gt;0$ we are able to show that the system exhibits multiscale dynamics: at first the process quickly approaches the QSD $\mu_\epsilon$ and then, after spending a polynomially long time there, it relaxes to the extinction state. We give sharp asymptotics in $\epsilon$ for the time spent close to $\mu_\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>The central limit theorem on nilpotent Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and establish the central limit theorem for products of i.i.d. random variables on arbitrary simply connected nilpotent Lie groups, allowing a possible bias. Two new phenomena arise in the presence of a bias: (a) the walk spreads out at a higher rate in the ambient group, (b) the limiting hypoelliptic diffusion process may not have full support. We study the limiting distribution, prove estimates on its density and describe its support. We also establish corresponding Berry-Esseen bounds under optimal moment assumptions, as well as an analogue of Donsker's invariance principle. Various examples of nilpotent Lie groups are treated in detail showing the variety of different behaviours. We also obtain a characterization of when the limiting distribution is an ordinary gaussian and answer a question of Tutubalin from the 1960s regarding asymptotically close distributions on nilpotent Lie groups.</description>

Using this method, we find the new upper bound $53/126 \approx 0.4206$ for the minimum density of an identifying code on the infinite hexagonal grid, down from the previous record of $3/7 \approx 0.4286$.</description>

      <title>Neural Context Flows for Learning Generalizable Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02154</link>

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations typically struggle to generalize to new dynamical behaviors created by parameter changes in the underlying system, even when the dynamics are close to previously seen behaviors. The issue gets worse when the changing parameters are unobserved, i.e., their value or influence is not directly measurable when collecting data. We introduce Neural Context Flow (NCF), a framework that encodes said unobserved parameters in a latent context vector as input to a vector field. NCFs leverage differentiability of the vector field with respect to the parameters, along with first-order Taylor expansion to allow any context vector to influence trajectories from other parameters. We validate our method and compare it to established Multi-Task and Meta-Learning alternatives, showing competitive performance in mean squared error for in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluation on the Lotka-Volterra, Glycolytic Oscillator, and Gray-Scott problems. This study holds practical implications for foundational models in science and related areas that benefit from conditional neural ODEs. Our code is openly available at https://github.com/ddrous/ncflow.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the strictly convex quadrilateral central configuration with a fixed angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conjecture of the existence and the uniqueness of the strictly convex quadrilateral central configuration for the Newtonian 4-body problem is one of the most-talked open problems in the study of the classical n-body problems in celestial mechanics. MacMillan and Bartky first gave its general existence in the 1930s and a particular case for its uniqueness. Still, the general case has yet to be solved perfectly since it was considered by Sim'{o} and Yoccoz in the 1980s and was first mentioned by Albouy and Fu in 2008 in the formal publication. Using coordinates of mutual distances and Morse's critical point theory, we give the (at most) uniqueness of the planar strictly convex 4-body central configuration when the angle of one pair of the opposite sides is given.</description>
