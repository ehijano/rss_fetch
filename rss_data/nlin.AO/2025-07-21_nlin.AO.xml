      <title>Fractal Social Dynamics as a Driver of Consensus and Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human social behavior is organized in stratified, hierarchical networks, with a support group with about 5 members, expanding proportionally at each layer up to a maximum of approximately 150 frequent interactions per individual. This is known as Social Brain Hypothesis, and its findings are supported by psychological and neurological evidence. The fractal network framework provides valuable insights into social phenomena such as the spread of fake news and the development of technology. This study models socioeconomic interactions using fractal networks, where group sizes scale by a fixed factor, to analyze how consensus is formed. Using $q$-calculus, the model reveals how hierarchical structures influence information spread, highlighting universal features governed by power laws.. The results follow $q$-Gaussian distributions, showing heavy-tails that align with observed inequalities in societies worldwide. The results show that inequalities arise from the fractal structure of the socioeconomic network.</description>

      <title>Directionality measures in evolutionary ecological networks: Insights from the Tangled Nature model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The myriad microscopic interactions among the individual organisms that constitute an ecological system collectively give rise, at the macroscopic scale, to evolutionary trends. The ability to detect the directionality of such trends is crucial for understanding and managing the dynamics of natural systems. Nevertheless, identifying the key observable quantities that capture such directional behaviour poses a major challenge. In this study, we propose that translating ecological data into a network framework is a valuable strategy to measure system stability and evolution. We examine the Tangled Nature model as a test case, evaluating network entropy, species diversity, and the clustering coefficient as metrics of network stability and directionality.</description>

      <title>Modelling the spillover from online engagement to offline protest: stochastic dynamics and mean-field approximations on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media is transforming various aspects of offline life, from everyday decisions such as dining choices to the progression of conflicts. In this study, we propose a coupled modelling framework with an online social network layer to analyse how engagement on a specific topic spills over into offline protest activities. We develop a stochastic model and derive several mean-field models of varying complexity. These models allow us to estimate the reproductive number and anticipate when surges in activity are likely to occur. A key factor is the transmission rate between the online and offline domains; for offline outbursts to emerge, this rate must fall within a critical range, neither too low nor too high. Additionally, using synthetic networks, we examine how network structure influences the accuracy of these approximations. Our findings indicate that low-density networks need more complex approximations, whereas simpler models can effectively represent higher-density networks. When tested on two real-world networks, however, increased complexity did not enhance accuracy.</description>
