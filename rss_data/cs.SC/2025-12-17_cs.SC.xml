      <title>More is Less: Adding Polynomials for Faster Explanations in NLSAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To check the satisfiability of (non-linear) real arithmetic formulas, modern satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving algorithms like NLSAT depend heavily on single cell construction, the task of generalizing a sample point to a connected subset (cell) of $\mathbb{R}^n$, that contains the sample and over which a given set of polynomials is sign-invariant.
  In this paper, we propose to speed up the computation and simplify the representation of the resulting cell by dynamically extending the considered set of polynomials with further linear polynomials. While this increases the total number of (smaller) cells generated throughout the algorithm, our experiments show that it can pay off when using suitable heuristics due to the interaction with Boolean reasoning.</description>

      <title>Oracle-Based Multistep Strategy for Solving Polynomial Systems Over Finite Fields and Algebraic Cryptanalysis of the Aradi Cipher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multistep solving strategy consists in a divide-and-conquer approach: when a multivariate polynomial system is computationally infeasible to solve directly, one variable is assigned over the elements of the base finite field, and the procedure is recursively applied to the resulting simplified systems. In a previous work by the same authors (among others), this approach proved effective in the algebraic cryptanalysis of the Trivium cipher.
  In this paper, we present a new recursive formulation of the corresponding algorithm based on a Depth-First Search strategy, along with a novel complexity analysis leveraging tree structures. We also introduce the notion of an "oracle function", which is intended to determine whether evaluating a new variable is required to simplify the current polynomial system. This notion allows us to unify all previously proposed variants of the multistep strategy, including the classical hybrid approach, by appropriately selecting the oracle function.
  Finally, we employ the multistep solving strategy in the cryptanalysis of the NSA's recently introduced low-latency block cipher Aradi, achieving a first full-round algebraic attack that exposes structural features in its symbolic model.</description>
