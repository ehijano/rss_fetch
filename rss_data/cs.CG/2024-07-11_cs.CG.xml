      <title>Topological Offsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Topological Offsets, a novel approach to generate manifold and self-intersection-free offset surfaces that are topologically equivalent to an offset infinitesimally close to the surface. Our approach, by construction, creates a manifold, watertight, and self-intersection-free offset surface strictly enclosing the input, while doing a best effort to move it to a prescribed distance from the input. Differently from existing approaches, we embed the input in a volumetric mesh, and insert a topological offset around the mesh with purely combinatorial operations. The topological offset is then inflated/deflated to match the user-prescribed distance, while enforcing that no intersections or non-manifold configurations are introduced. We evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach on the non-intersecting subset of Thingi10k, and show that topological offsets are beneficial in multiple graphics applications, including (1) converting non-manifold surfaces to manifold ones, (2) creation of nested cages/layered offsets, and (3) reliably computing finite offsets.</description>

      <title>Fast Approximation Algorithms for Euclidean Minimum Weight Perfect Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding a Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching for $n$ points in the plane. It is known that a deterministic approximation algorithm for this problems must have at least $\Omega(n \log n)$ runtime. We propose such an algorithm for the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem with runtime $O(n\log n)$ and show that it has approximation ratio $O(n^{0.2995})$. This improves the so far best known approximation ratio of $n/2$. We also develop an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm for the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem in higher dimensions and show it has approximation ratio $O(n^{0.599})$ in all fixed dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Fr\'echet Distance Unleashed: Approximating a Dog with a Frog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a minor variant of the continuous Fr\'echet distance between polygonal curves can be computed using essentially the same algorithm used to solve the discrete version, thus dramatically simplifying the algorithm for computing it. The new variant is not necessarily monotone, but this shortcoming can be easily handled via refinement. Combined with a Dijkstra/Prim type algorithm, this leads to a realization of the Fr\'echet distance (i.e., a morphing) that is locally optimal (aka locally correct), that is both easy to compute, and in practice, takes near linear time on many inputs. The new morphing has the property that the leash is always as short-as-possible. We implemented the new algorithm, and developed various strategies to get a fast execution in practice. Among our new contributions is a new simplification strategy that is distance-sensitive, and enables us to compute the exact continuous Fr\'echet distance in near linear time in practice. We preformed extensive experiments on our new algorithm, and released Julia and Python packages with these new implementations.</description>

      <title>Chromatic Alpha Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03128v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in the medical sciences, we study finite chromatic sets in Euclidean space from a topological perspective. Based on the persistent homology for images, kernels and cokernels, we design provably stable homological quantifiers that describe the geometric micro- and macro-structure of how the color classes mingle. These can be efficiently computed using chromatic variants of Delaunay and alpha complexes, and code that does these computations is provided.</description>
