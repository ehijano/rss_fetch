      <title>Central limits from generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(Y_n)_n$ be a sequence of $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued random variables. Suppose that the generating function \[f(x, z) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \varphi_{Y_n}(x) z^n,\] where $\varphi_{Y_n}$ is the characteristic function of $Y_n$, extends to a function on a neighborhood of $\{0\} \times \{z : |z| \leq 1\} \subset \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{C}$ which is meromorphic in $z$ and has no zeroes. We prove that if $1 / f(x, z)$ is twice differentiable, then there exists a constant $\mu$ such that the distribution of $(Y_n - \mu n) / \sqrt{n}$ converges weakly to a normal distribution as $n \to \infty$.
  If $Y_n = X_1 + \cdots + X_n$, where $(X_n)_n$ are i.i.d. random variables, then we recover the classical (Lindeberg$\unicode{x2013}$L\'evy) central limit theorem. We also prove the 2020 conjecture of Defant that if $\pi_n \in \mathfrak{S}_n$ is a uniformly random permutation, then the distribution of $(\operatorname{des} (s(\pi_n)) + 1 - (3 - e) n) / \sqrt{n}$ converges, as $n \to \infty$, to a normal distribution with variance $2 + 2e - e^2$.</description>

      <title>Regularity of invariant densities for random switching between two linear odes in Rd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a paper entitled singularities of invariant densities for random switching between two linear odes in 2D, Bakhtin et al [5], consider a Markov process obtained by random switching between two stable linear vector fields in the plane and characterize the singularities of the invariant density in terms of the switching and contraction rates. This paper considers a generalization of this model obtained by random switching between two stable linear vector fields in Rd and provides sufficient conditions ensuring that the invariant distribution is absolutely continuous and has a Cr density. In dimension greater than 3 it provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully non-elliptic example of random switching for which quantitative conditions guaranteeing smoothness of the invariant density can be proved.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Fluctuation Expansions for Nonlinear Stochastic Heat Equations in Singular Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher order fluctuation expansions for stochastic heat equations (SHE) with nonlinear, non-conservative and conservative noise are obtained. These Edgeworth-type expansions describe the asymptotic behavior of solutions in suitable joint scaling regimes of small noise intensity and diverging singularity. The results include both the case of the SHE with regular and irregular diffusion coefficients. In particular, this includes the correlated Dawson-Watanabe and Dean-Kawasaki SPDEs, as well as SPDEs corresponding to the Fleming-Viot and symmetric simple exclusion processes.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation for the Complex Fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes with Hurst parameter H \in (0, 1/2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the strong consistency and asymptotic normality of a least squares estimator of the drift coefficient in complex-valued Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes driven by fractional Brownian motion, extending the results of Chen, Hu, Wang (2017) to the case of Hurst parameter H \in (1/4 , 1/2) and the results of Hu, Nualart, Zhou (2019) to a two-dimensional case. When H \in (0, 1/4], it is found that the integrand of the estimator is not in the domain of the standard divergence operator. To facilitate the proofs, we develop a new inner product formula for functions of bounded variation in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H \in (0, 1/2). This formula is also applied to obtain the second moments of the so-called {\alpha}-order fractional Brownian motion and the {\alpha}-fractional bridges with the Hurst parameter H \in (0, 1/2).</description>

      <title>The Smoluchowski-Kramers approximation for a system with arbitrary friction depending on both state and distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of stochastic differential equations describing diffusive phenomena, which has arbitrary friction depending on both state and distribution is investigated. The Smoluchowski-Kramers approximation is seen to describe dynamics in the small mass limit. We obtain the limiting equation and, in particular, the addition drift terms that appear in the limiting equation are expressed in terms of the solutions to the Lyapunov matrix equation and Sylvester matrix equation. Furthermore, we provide the rate of convergence and extend the system to encompass more general interactions and noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We associate two specific projective systems of probability spaces with any Tsirelson convolution system. If the projective limits of these systems exist, then we call the convolution system convergent and $K$-convergent, respectively. It is shown that convergent convolution systems give rise to continuous products of probability spaces, while $K$-convergent convolution systems lead to flow systems. We investigate the relationship between convergence and $K$-convergence, as well as their connections to two-parameter product systems of Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Errors-In-Variables Model Fitting for Partially Unpaired Data Utilizing Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to introduce a general argumentation framework for regression in the errors-in-variables regime, allowing for full flexibility about the dimensionality of the data, error probability density types, the (linear or nonlinear) model type and the avoidance of explicit definition of loss functions. Further, we introduce in this framework model fitting for partially unpaired data, i.e. for given data groups the pairing information of input and output is lost (semi-supervised). This is achieved by constructing mixture model densities, which directly model this loss of pairing information allowing for inference. In a numerical simulation study linear and nonlinear model fits are illustrated as well as a real data study is presented based on life expectancy data from the world bank utilizing a multiple linear regression model. These results allow the conclusion that high quality model fitting is possible with partially unpaired data, which opens the possibility for new applications with unfortunate or deliberate loss of pairing information in the data.</description>

      <title>An elementary proof of representation of submodular function as an supremum of measures on $\sigma$-algebra with totally ordered generating class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an alternative proof of a fact that a finite continuous non-decreasing submodular set function on a measurable space can be expressed as a supremum of measures dominated by the function, if there exists a class of sets which is totally ordered with respect to inclusion and generates the sigma-algebra of the space. The proof is elementary in the sense that the measure attaining the supremum in the claim is constructed by a standard extension theorem of measures. As a consequence, a uniquness of the supremum attaining measure also follows. A Polish space is an examples of the measurable space which has a class of totally ordered sets that generates the Borel sigma-algebra.</description>

      <title>Second Maximum of a Gaussian Random Field and Exact (t-)Spacing test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the novel concept of the second maximum of a Gaussian random field on a Riemannian submanifold. This second maximum serves as a powerful tool for characterizing the distribution of the maximum. By utilizing an ad-hoc Kac Rice formula, we derive the explicit form of the maximum's distribution, conditioned on the second maximum and some regressed component of the Riemannian Hessian. This approach results in an exact test, based on the evaluation of spacing between these maxima, which we refer to as the spacing test.
  We investigate the applicability of this test in detecting sparse alternatives within Gaussian symmetric tensors, continuous sparse deconvolution, and two-layered neural networks with smooth rectifiers. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments, which illustrate the calibration and power of the proposed tests. More generally, this test can be applied to any Gaussian random field on a Riemannian manifold, and we provide a general framework for the application of the spacing test in continuous sparse kernel regression.
  Furthermore, when the variance-covariance function of the Gaussian random field is known up to a scaling factor, we derive an exact Studentized version of our test, coined the $t$-spacing test. This test is perfectly calibrated under the null hypothesis and has high power for detecting sparse alternatives.</description>

      <title>Integral representations for the joint survival functions of the cumulated components of multinomial random vectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a multivariate normal integral expression for the joint survival function of the cumulated components of any multinomial random vector. This result can be viewed as a multivariate analog of Equation (7) from Carter &amp; Pollard (2004), who improved Tusn\'ady's inequality. Our findings are based on a crucial relationship between the joint survival function of the cumulated components of any multinomial random vector and the joint cumulative distribution function of a corresponding Dirichlet distribution. We offer two distinct proofs: the first expands the logarithm of the Dirichlet density, while the second employs Laplace's method applied to the Dirichlet integral.</description>

      <title>On the rate of convergence in the Hall-Janson coverage theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a spherical Poisson Boolean model $Z$ in Euclidean $d$-space with $d \geq 2$, with Poisson intensity $t$ and radii distributed like $rY$ with $r \geq 0$ a scaling parameter and $Y$ a fixed nonnegative random variable with finite $(2d-2)$-nd moment (or if $d=2$, a finite $(2 + \varepsilon)$-moment condition for some $\varepsilon &gt;0$). Let $A \subset {\bf R}^d$ be compact with a nice boundary. Let $\alpha $ be the expected volume of a ball of radius $Y$, and suppose $r=r(t)$ is chosen so that $\alpha t r^d - \log t - (d-1) \log \log t$ is a constant independent of $t$. A classical result of Hall and of Janson determines the (non-trivial) large-$t$ limit of the probability that $A$ is fully covered by $Z$. In this paper we provide an $O((\log \log t)/\log t)$ bound on the rate of convergence in that result. With a slight adjustment to $r(t)$, this can be improved to $O(1/\log t)$.</description>

      <title>$\Phi^4_3$ measures on compact Riemannian $3$-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10185v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the $\Phi^4_3$ measure on an arbitrary 3-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold without boundary as an invariant probability measure of a singular stochastic partial differential equation. Proving the nontriviality and the covariance under Riemannian isometries of that measure gives for the first time a non-perturbative, non-topological interacting Euclidean quantum field theory on curved spaces in dimension 3. This answers a longstanding open problem of constructive quantum field theory on curved 3 dimensional backgrounds. To control analytically several Feynman diagrams appearing in the construction of a number of random fields, we introduce a novel approach of renormalization using microlocal and harmonic analysis. This allows to obtain a renormalized equation which involves some universal constants independent of the manifold. We also define a new vectorial Cole-Hopf transform which allows to deal with the vectorial $\Phi^4_3$ model where $\Phi$ is now a bundle valued random field. In a companion paper, we develop in a self-contained way all the tools from paradifferential and microlocal analysis that we use to build in our manifold setting a number of analytic and probabilistic objects.</description>

      <title>Variance Decay Property for Filter Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of nonlinear (stochastic) filter stability of a hidden Markov model (HMM) with white noise observations. A contribution is the variance decay property which is used to conclude filter stability. For this purpose, a new notion of the Poincar\'e inequality (PI) is introduced for the nonlinear filter. PI is related to both the ergodicity of the Markov process as well as the observability of the HMM. The proofs are based upon a recently discovered minimum variance duality which is used to transform the nonlinear filtering problem into a stochastic optimal control problem for a backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE).</description>

      <title>Impact of a block structure on the Lotka-Volterra model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lotka-Volterra (LV) model is a simple, robust, and versatile model used to describe large interacting systems such as food webs or microbiomes. The model consists of $n$ coupled differential equations linking the abundances of $n$ different species. We consider a large random interaction matrix with independent entries and a block variance profile. The $i$th diagonal block represents the intra-community interaction in community $i$, while the off-diagonal blocks represent the inter-community interactions. The variance remains constant within each block, but may vary across blocks.
  We investigate the important case of two communities of interacting species, study how interactions affect their respective equilibrium. We also describe equilibrium with feasibility (i.e., whether there exists an equilibrium with all species at non-zero abundances) and the existence of an attrition phenomenon (some species may vanish) within each community.
  Information about the general case of $b$ communities ($b&gt; 2$) is provided in the appendix.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Simulation Method for Fractional Order Compartment Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our study focuses on fractional order compartment models derived from underlying physical stochastic processes, providing a more physically grounded approach compared to models that use the dynamical system approach by simply replacing integer-order derivatives with fractional order derivatives. In these models, inherent stochasticity becomes important, particularly when dealing with the dynamics of small populations far from the continuum limit of large particle numbers. The necessity for stochastic simulations arises from deviations of the mean states from those obtained from the governing equations in these scenarios. To address this, we introduce an exact stochastic simulation algorithm designed for fractional order compartment models, based on a semi-Markov process. We have considered a fractional order resusceptibility SIS model and a fractional order recovery SIR model as illustrative examples, highlighting significant disparities between deterministic and stochastic dynamics when the total population is small. Beyond its modeling applications, the algorithm presented serves as a versatile tool for solving fractional order differential equations via Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounds on generalized transport: From single-molecule to bulk observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the transport of any differentiable scalar observable in $d$-dimensional non-equilibrium systems is bounded from above by the total entropy production scaled by the amount the observation "stretches" microscopic coordinates. The result--a time-integrated generalized speed limit--reflects the thermodynamic cost of transport of observables, and places underdamped and overdamped stochastic dynamics on equal footing with deterministic motion. Our work allows for stochastic thermodynamics to make contact with bulk experiments, and fills an important gap in thermodynamic inference, since microscopic dynamics is, at least for short times, underdamped. Requiring only averages but not sample-to-sample fluctuations, the proven transport bound is practical and applicable not only to single-molecule but also bulk experiments where only averages are observed, which we demonstrate by examples. Our results may facilitate thermodynamic inference on molecular machines without an obvious directionality from bulk observations of transients probed, e.g.\ in time-resolved X-ray scattering.</description>

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) algorithms estimate the uncertainty of a prediction model by calibrating its outputs on labeled data. The same calibration scheme usually applies to any model and data without modifications. The obtained prediction intervals are valid by construction but could be inefficient, i.e. unnecessarily big, if the prediction errors are not uniformly distributed over the input space.
  We present a general scheme to localize the intervals by training the calibration process. The standard prediction error is replaced by an optimized distance metric that depends explicitly on the object attributes. Learning the optimal metric is equivalent to training a Normalizing Flow that acts on the joint distribution of the errors and the inputs. Unlike the Error Reweighting CP algorithm of Papadopoulos et al. (2008), the framework allows estimating the gap between nominal and empirical conditional validity. The approach is compatible with existing locally-adaptive CP strategies based on re-weighting the calibration samples and applies to any point-prediction model without retraining.</description>
