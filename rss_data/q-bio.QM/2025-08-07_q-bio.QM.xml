      <title>Assessing the Impact of Image Super Resolution on White Blood Cell Classification Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately classifying white blood cells from microscopic images is essential to identify several illnesses and conditions in medical diagnostics. Many deep learning technologies are being employed to quickly and automatically classify images. However, most of the time, the resolution of these microscopic pictures is quite low, which might make it difficult to classify them correctly. Some picture improvement techniques, such as image super-resolution, are being utilized to improve the resolution of the photos to get around this issue. The suggested study uses large image dimension upscaling to investigate how picture-enhancing approaches affect classification performance. The study specifically looks at how deep learning models may be able to understand more complex visual information by capturing subtler morphological changes when image resolution is increased using cutting-edge techniques. The model may learn from standard and augmented data since the improved images are incorporated into the training process. This dual method seeks to comprehend the impact of image resolution on model performance and enhance classification accuracy. A well-known model for picture categorization is used to conduct extensive testing and thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. This research intends to create more efficient image identification algorithms customized to a particular dataset of white blood cells by understanding the trade-offs between ordinary and enhanced images.</description>

      <title>SCOUT: An in-vivo Methane Sensing System for Real-time Monitoring of Enteric Emissions in Cattle with ex-vivo Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of enteric methane emissions remains a critical bottleneck for advancing livestock sustainability through genetic selection and precision management. Existing ambient sampling approaches suffer from low data retention rates, environmental interference, and limited temporal resolution. We developed SCOUT (Smart Cannula-mounted Optical Unit for Trace-methane), the first robust in-vivo sensing system enabling continuous, high-resolution monitoring of ruminal methane concentrations through an innovative closed-loop gas recirculation design. We conducted comprehensive validation with two cannulated Simmental heifers under contrasting dietary treatments, with cross-platform comparison against established ambient sniffer systems. SCOUT achieved exceptional performance with 82% data retention compared to 17% for conventional sniffer systems, while capturing methane concentrations 100-1000x higher than ambient approaches. Cross-platform validation demonstrated strong scale-dependent correlations, with optimal correlation strength (r = -0.564 $\pm$ 0.007) at biologically relevant 40-minute windows and 100% statistical significance. High-frequency monitoring revealed novel behavior-emission coupling, including rapid concentration changes (14.5 $\pm$ 11.3k ppm) triggered by postural transitions within 15 minutes, insights previously inaccessible through existing technologies. The SCOUT system represents a transformative advancement, enabling accurate, continuous emission phenotyping essential for genomic selection programs and sustainable precision livestock management. This validation framework establishes new benchmarks for agricultural sensor performance while generating unprecedented biological insights into ruminal methane dynamics, contributing essential tools for sustainable livestock production in climate-conscious agricultural systems.</description>

      <title>Continual Multiple Instance Learning for Hematologic Disease Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic environment of laboratories and clinics, with streams of data arriving on a daily basis, requires regular updates of trained machine learning models for consistent performance. Continual learning is supposed to help train models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection). Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.</description>

      <title>Algebraically Observable Physics-Informed Neural Network and its Application to Epidemiological Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is a deep learning framework that integrates the governing equations underlying data into a loss function. In this study, we consider the problem of estimating state variables and parameters in epidemiological models governed by ordinary differential equations using PINNs. In practice, not all trajectory data corresponding to the population described by models can be measured. Learning PINNs to estimate the unmeasured state variables and epidemiological parameters using partial measurements is challenging.
  Accordingly, we introduce the concept of algebraic observability of the state variables. Specifically, we propose augmenting the unmeasured data based on algebraic observability analysis. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments under three scenarios in the context of epidemiological modelling. Specifically, given noisy and partial measurements, the accuracy of unmeasured states and parameter estimation of the proposed method is shown to be higher than that of the conventional methods. The proposed method is also shown to be effective in practical scenarios, such as when the data corresponding to certain variables cannot be reconstructed from the measurements.</description>

      <title>Efficient Data Selection for Training Genomic Perturbation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14571v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genomic studies, including CRISPR-based Perturb-seq analyses, face a vast hypothesis space, while gene perturbations remain costly and time-consuming. Gene perturbation models based on graph neural networks are trained to predict the outcomes of gene perturbations to facilitate such experiments. Due to the cost of genomic experiments, active learning is often employed to train these models, alternating between wet-lab experiments and model updates. However, the operational constraints of the wet-lab and the iterative nature of active learning significantly increase the total training time. Furthermore, the inherent sensitivity to model initialization can lead to markedly different sets of gene perturbations across runs, which undermines the reproducibility, interpretability, and reusability of the method. To this end, we propose a graph-based data filtering method that, unlike active learning, selects the gene perturbations in one shot and in a model-free manner. The method optimizes a criterion that maximizes the supervision signal from the graph neural network to enhance generalization. The criterion is defined over the input graph and is optimized with submodular maximization. We compare it empirically to active learning, and the results demonstrate that despite yielding months of acceleration, it also improves the stability of the selected perturbation experiments while achieving comparable test error.</description>

      <title>A nonstandard finite difference scheme for an SEIQR epidemiological PDE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) approach to a reaction-diffusion SEIQR epidemiological model, which captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious disease transmission. Formulated as a system of semilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), the model extends classical compartmental models by incorporating spatial diffusion to account for population movement and spatial heterogeneity. The proposed NSFD discretization is designed to preserve the continuous model's essential qualitative features, such as positivity, boundedness, and stability, which are often compromised by standard finite difference methods. We rigorously analyze the model's well-posedness, construct a structure-preserving NSFD scheme for the PDE system, and study its convergence and local truncation error. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the scheme's effectiveness in preserving biologically consistent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Characterization of Similarity Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07543v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing judgments of similarity within a perceptual or semantic domain, and making inferences about the underlying structure of this domain from these judgments, has an increasingly important role in cognitive and systems neuroscience. We present a new framework for this purpose that makes limited assumptions about how perceptual distances are converted into similarity judgments. The approach starts from a dataset of empirical judgments of relative similarities: the fraction of times that a subject chooses one of two comparison stimuli to be more similar to a reference stimulus. These empirical judgments provide Bayesian estimates of underling choice probabilities. From these estimates, we derive indices that characterize the set of judgments in three ways: compatibility with a symmetric dis-similarity, compatibility with an ultrametric space, and compatibility with an additive tree. Each of the indices is derived from rank-order relationships among the choice probabilities that, as we show, are necessary and sufficient for local consistency with the three respective characteristics. We illustrate this approach with simulations and example psychophysical datasets of dis-similarity judgments in several visual domains and provide code that implements the analyses at https://github.com/jvlab/simrank.</description>
