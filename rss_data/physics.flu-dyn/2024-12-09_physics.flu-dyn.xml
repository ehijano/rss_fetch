      <title>Modeling wildfire dynamics through a physics-based approach incorporating fuel moisture and landscape heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anthropogenic climate change has increased the probability, severity, and duration of heat waves and droughts, subsequently escalating the risk of wildfires. Mathematical and computational models can enhance our understanding of wildfire propagation dynamics. In this work, we present a simplified Advection-Diffusion-Reaction (ADR) model that accounts for the effect of fuel moisture, and also considers wind, local radiation, natural convection and topography. The model explicitly represents fuel moisture effects by means of the apparent calorific capacity method, distinguishing between live and dead fuel moisture content. Using this model, we conduct exploratory simulations and present theoretical insights into various modeling decisions in the context of ADR-based models. We aim to shed light on the interplay between the different modeled mechanisms in wildfire propagation to identify key factors influencing fire spread and to estimate the model's predictive capacity.</description>

      <title>Fluid-structure coupled simulation framework for lightweight explosion containment structures under large deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightweight, single-use explosion containment structures provide an effective solution for neutralizing rogue explosives, combining affordability with ease of transport. This paper introduces a three-stage simulation framework that captures the distinct physical processes and time scales involved in detonation, shock propagation, and large, plastic structural deformations. The hypothesis is that as the structure becomes lighter and more flexible, its dynamic interaction with the gaseous explosion products becomes increasingly significant. Unlike previous studies that rely on empirical models to approximate pressure loads, this framework employs a partitioned procedure to couple a finite volume compressible fluid dynamics solver with a finite element structural dynamics solver. The level set and embedded boundary methods are utilized to track the fluid-fluid and fluid-structure interfaces. The interfacial mass, momentum, and energy fluxes are computed by locally constructing and solving one-dimensional bi-material Riemann problems. A case study is presented involving a thin-walled steel chamber subjected to an internal explosion of $250~\text{g}$ TNT. The result shows a $30\%$ increase in the chamber volume due to plastic deformation, with its strains remaining below the fracture limit. Although the incident shock pulse carries the highest pressure, the subsequent pulses from wave reflections also contribute significantly to structural deformation. The high energy and compressibility of the explosion products lead to highly nonlinear fluid dynamics, with shock speeds varying across both space and time. Comparisons with simpler simulation methods reveal that decoupling the fluid and structural dynamics overestimates the plastic strain by $43.75\%$, while modeling the fluid dynamics as a transient pressure load fitted to the first shock pulse underestimates the plastic strain by $31.25\%$.</description>

      <title>Chaotic mixing in plane Couette turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lagrangian tracer particle trajectories for invariant solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations confined to the three-dimensional geometry of plane Couette flow are studied. Treating the Eulerian velocity field of an invariant solution as a dynamical system, the transport of these passive scalars along Lagrangian flow trajectories reveals a rich repertoire of different types of motion that can occur, including stagnation points, for which there is no fluid movement, and invariant tori, which obstruct chaotic mixing across the full volume of the plane Couette flow minimal cell. We determine the stability of these stagnation points, along with their stable and unstable manifolds, and find heteroclinic connections between them. These topological features produce a skeleton that shapes the passive tracer flow for a turbulent fluid, providing a first step to elucidating Lagrangian particle transport and mixing in three-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Free-surface equatorial flows with surface tension in spherical coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine an exact solution to the governing equations in spherical coordinates for an inviscid, incompressible fluid. This solution describes a steady, purely azimuthal equatorial flow with an associated free surface. Using functional analytic techniques, we demonstrate that if a free surface is known beforehand, the variations in pressure needed to achieve this surface implicitly define the shape of the free surface in a unique way.</description>

      <title>Penetrative rotating magnetoconvection subject to lateral variations in temperature gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convection-driven flows in planetary interiors exhibit rich dynamics owing to multiple spatio-temporally varying forcing conditions and physical constraints. In particular, the churning of liquid metals in the Earth's outer core, responsible for the dynamic geomagnetic field, is subjected to lower mantle thermal heterogeneity. Besides, the plausible existence of a stable stratification layer below the mantle influences the columnar convection. These additional symmetry-breaking constraints, motivated from geophysical scenario of the Earth's thermal core--mantle interaction, modulate the otherwise periodic and axially invariant convection flow patterns. Thus, the present study focuses on qualitative characterization and parametric quantification of rotating penetrative convection in the presence of magnetic induction effects with an aim to understand the role of the lower mantle on core convection thermally. Using complementing computational and theoretical calculations, the present study estimates the depth of penetration in bounded and unbounded fluid domains. Apart from qualitative differences in convective flow patterns from the reference homogeneous configurations, the additional constraints spatially modulate the extent of penetration into stable regions. Confinement effects, adding to the damping of penetrative convection, arising out of boundary constraints are quantified for bounded geometry. Appropriate normalizations, implemented to eliminate such effects, result in amended penetration depth estimates that align with the qualitative characteristics obtained for unbounded domains. Exact closed-form expressions for the depth of penetration are obtained, providing insights into the role of individual contributions of multiple physical constraints. Implications are speculated for realistic, yet unreachable, regimes of geophysical conditions of planetary cores.</description>

      <title>Multifractality and polygonal vortex filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this proceedings article we survey the results in [5] and their motivation, as presented at the 50th Journ\'ees EDP 2024. With the aim of quantifying turbulent behaviors of vortex filaments, we study the multifractality of a family of generalized Riemann's non-differentiable functions. These functions represent, in a certain limit, the trajectory of regular polygonal vortex filaments that evolve according to the binormal flow, the classical model for vortex filaments dynamics. We explain how we determined their spectrum of singularities through a careful design of Diophantine sets, which we study by using the Duffin-Schaeffer theorem and the Mass Transference Principle.</description>

      <title>Obliquely interacting solitary waves and wave wakes in free-surface flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the weakly nonlinear isotropic bi-directional Benney--Luke (BL) equation, which is used to describe oceanic surface and internal waves in shallow water, with a particular focus on soliton dynamics. Using the Whitham modulation theory, we derive the modulation equations associated with the BL equation that describe the evolution of soliton amplitude and slope. By analyzing rarefaction waves and shock waves within these modulation equations, we derive the Riemann invariants and modified Rankine--Hugoniot conditions. These expressions help characterize the Mach expansion and Mach reflection phenomena of bent and reverse bent solitons. We also derive analytical formulas for the critical angle and the Mach stem amplitude, showing that as the soliton speed is in the vicinity of unity, the results from the BL equation align closely with those of the Kadomtsev--Petviashvili (KP) equation. Corresponding numerical results are obtained and show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, as a far-field approximation for the forced BL equation -- which models wave and flow interactions with local topography -- the modulation equations yield a slowly varying similarity solution. This solution indicates that the precursor wavefronts created by topography moving at subcritical or critical speeds take the shape of a circular arc, in contrast to the parabolic wavefronts observed in the forced KP equation.</description>

      <title>Bursting bubble in an elasto-viscoplastic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A gas bubble sitting at a liquid-gas interface can burst following the rupture of the thin liquid film separating it from the ambient, owing to the large surface energy of the resultant cavity. This bursting bubble forms capillary waves, a Worthington jet, and subsequent droplets for a Newtonian liquid medium. However, rheological properties of the liquid medium like elasto-viscoplasticity can greatly affect these dynamics. Using direct numerical simulations, this study exemplifies how the complex interplay between elasticity (in terms of elastic stress relaxation) and yield stress influences the transient interfacial phenomena of bursting bubbles. We investigate how bursting dynamics depends on capillary, elastic, and yield stresses by exploring the parameter space of the Deborah number $De$ (dimensionless relaxation time of elastic stresses) and the plastocapillary number $\mathcal{J}$ (dimensionless yield-stress of the medium), delineating four distinct characteristic behaviours. Overall, we observe a non-monotonic effect of elastic stress relaxation on the jet development while plasticity of the elasto-viscoplastic medium is shown to affect primarily the jet evolution only at faster relaxation times (low $De$). The role of elastic stresses on jet development is elucidated with the support of energy budgets identifying different modes of energy transfer within the elasto-viscoplastic medium. The effects of elasticity on the initial progression of capillary waves and droplet formation are also studied. In passing, we study the effects of solvent-polymer-viscosity ratio on bursting dynamics and show that polymer viscosity can increase the jet thickness apart from reducing the maximum height of the jet.</description>

      <title>Compressibility and volume variations due to composition in multicomponent fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For single components fluids, vanishing isothermal compressibility implies that the mass density is constant, but the same conclusion is unknown for multicomponent fluids. Here the volume remains affected by changes of the composition. In the present paper we discuss an apparently natural way to conceptualise, based on derivatives of the Gibbs function g, this 'volume change due to composition' as a compression. In this way the phenomenon becomes quantitatively comparable to the usual coefficients of compressibility. This is a first step to investigate the range of validity of the constant density approximation of multicomponent fluids. As an illustration, three different aqueous solutions are discussed.</description>
