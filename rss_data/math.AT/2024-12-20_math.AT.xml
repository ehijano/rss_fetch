      <title>A universal characterization of uncurving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a category of non-symmetric operads with distinguished curvature term, and determine the right adjoint to the functor forgetting the distinction. As a result we give a universal characterization of the procedure of "twisting by a Maurer-Cartan element", and also of the curved A-infinity operad itself.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of diagram algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the homology of diagram algebras has emerged as an interesting and important field. In many cases, the homology of a diagram algebra can be identified with the homology of a group. In this paper we have two main aims. Firstly, we study the (co)homology of new families of diagram algebras such as the blob algebras and the walled Brauer algebras, both of which exhibit new phenomena in the field. Secondly, we show that in the cases where the homology of a diagram algebra can be identified with group homology one can also identify the cohomology of the algebra with the cohomology of a group. We use this to establish an integer-graded cohomology theory for these diagram algebras and identify this with the Tate cohomology of a group.</description>

      <title>Lie algebras and the (co)homology of configuration spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey decades of research identifying the (co)homology of configuration spaces with Lie algebra (co)homology. The different routes to this one proto-theorem offer genuinely different explanations of its truth, and we attempt to convey some sense of the conceptual core of each perspective. We close with a list of problems.</description>

      <title>Four-manifolds, two-complexes and the quadratic bias invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kreck and Schafer produced the first examples of stably diffeomorphic closed smooth 4-manifolds which are not homotopy equivalent. They were constructed by applying the doubling construction to 2-complexes over certain finite abelian groups of odd order. By extending their methods, we formulate a new homotopy invariant on the class of 4-manifolds arising as doubles of 2-complexes with finite fundamental group. As an application we show that, for any $k \ge 2$, there exist a family of $k$ closed smooth 4-manifolds which are all stably diffeomorphic but are pairwise not homotopy equivalent.</description>

      <title>Higher Lie theory in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this article is to develop integration theory for absolute partition $L_\infty$-algebras, which are point-set models for the (spectral) partition Lie algebras of Brantner-Mathew where infinite sums of operations are well-defined by definition. We construct a Quillen adjunction between absolute partition $L_\infty$-algebras and simplicial sets, and show that the right adjoint is a well-behaved integration functor. Points in this simplicial set are given by solutions to a Maurer-Cartan equation, and we give explicit formulas for gauge equivalences between them. We construct the analogue of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula in this setting and show it produces an isomorphic group to the classical one over a characteristic zero field.
  We apply these constructions to show that absolute partition $L_\infty$-algebras encode the $p$-adic homotopy types of pointed connected finite nilpotent spaces, up to certain equivalences which we describe by explicit formulas. In particular, these formulas also allow us to give a combinatorial description of the homotopy groups of the $p$-completed spheres as solutions to a certain equation in a given degree, up to an equivalence relation imposed by elements one degree above. Finally, we construct absolute partition $L_\infty$ models for $p$-adic mapping spaces, which combined with the description of the homotopy groups gives an algebraic description of the homotopy type of these $p$-adic mapping spaces parallel to the unstable Adams spectral sequence.</description>

      <title>On the Expressivity of Persistent Homology in Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09826v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology, a technique from computational topology, has recently shown strong empirical performance in the context of graph classification. Being able to capture long range graph properties via higher-order topological features, such as cycles of arbitrary length, in combination with multi-scale topological descriptors, has improved predictive performance for data sets with prominent topological structures, such as molecules. At the same time, the theoretical properties of persistent homology have not been formally assessed in this context. This paper intends to bridge the gap between computational topology and graph machine learning by providing a brief introduction to persistent homology in the context of graphs, as well as a theoretical discussion and empirical analysis of its expressivity for graph learning tasks.</description>
