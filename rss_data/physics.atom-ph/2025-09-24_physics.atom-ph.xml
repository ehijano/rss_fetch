      <title>Laser Excitation of Muonic 1S Hydrogen Hyperfine Transition: Effects of Multi-pass Cell Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating the laser-induced transition probability by using the fluence distribution that neglects interference effects (e.g., by employing ray-tracing methods) can lead to an overestimation of this probability, as it underestimates saturation effects. In this paper, we investigate how interference effects in the multi-pass cell, used to enhance the laser fluence, affect the laser-induced transition probability between hyperfine levels in muonic hydrogen, a bound system of a negative muon and a proton. To avoid complications related to the exact knowledge of the intra-cavity field, we develop a simple model that estimates the maximal possible interference effects for given laser and multi-pass cell parameters, thereby providing an upper bound for the resulting decrease in transition probability relative to the case where these effects are neglected. A numerical evaluation of this upper bound for muonic hydrogen shows that, under our experimental conditions, such effects can be safely neglected. Nonetheless, the methodology presented here could be applied to estimate the impact of interference effects on the laser-induced transition probability in other experiments involving coherent light in multi-pass systems.</description>

      <title>Localization and topological signatures under periodic twisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically explore a dynamical generalization of the Aubry-Andr\'e model in two dimensions formed by superimposing two square-lattice potentials. Motivated by the rich physics emerging at different twist angles between the two lattices at equilibrium, we introduce periodic twisting by continuously rotating one of the lattices with respect to the other in the plane. We demonstrate that the distinct time-dependent twisting in this system gives rise to an intricate form of periodic multi-frequency driving that changes with the distance from the rotation axis. We find that the incommensurate nature of the potential no longer plays the pivotal role as it does in the static case. Rather, the tunneling can be understood in terms of a local, spatially varying dynamical localization effect, which we show to yield ring-shaped states localized within the bulk that have interesting transport signatures. Quantifying the eigenstates with the Bott index and local Chern marker, we find that there is a zoo of states with non-trivial topological signatures, the most ubiquitous of which result in relatively uniform ring-shaped regions of the Chern marker. We investigate the origin of these effects from various angles and identify that hybridization between different delocalized ring states plays a vital role. Lastly, we discuss possible experimental realizations in quantum simulation settings. Our results open a new avenue of investigation with periodic twisting inducing a spatially varying multi-frequency drive.</description>

      <title>Overcoming limitations on gate fidelity in noisy static exchange-coupled surface qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrated that the spin state of individual atoms on surfaces can be quantum-coherently controlled through all-electric electron spin resonance. By constructing interacting arrays of atoms this results in an atomic-scale qubit platform. However, the static exchange coupling between qubits, limited lifetime and polarization of the initial state, impose significant limits on high-fidelity quantum control. We address this issue using open quantum systems simulation and quantum optimal control theory. We demonstrate the conditions under which high-fidelity operations ($\mathcal{F} \gtrsim 0.9$) are feasible in this qubit platform, and show how the Krotov method of quantum optimal control theory adapts to specific noise sources to outperform the conventional Rabi drivings. Finally, we re-examine the experimental setup used in the initial demonstration of this qubit platform and propose optimized experimental designs to maximize gate fidelity in this platform.</description>

      <title>Quantum-memory-assisted on-demand microwave-optical transduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave-optical transducers and quantum memories are fundamental components of quantum repeaters, essential for developing a quantum internet in which solid-state quantum computers serve as nodes interconnected by optical fibers for data transmission. Although both technologies have made significant advancements, the integration of microwave-optical conversion and quantum memory functionalities remains a challenge. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a memoryenhanced quantum microwave-optical transduction using a Rydberg ensemble. By utilizing a cascaded electromagnetically induced transparency process, we store microwave photons in a highly excited collective state and subsequently convert them into optical photons during the retrieval process. Taking advantage of the optical depth with order of millions for microwave photons in Rydberg ensemble, combined with a minimal storage dephasing rate at the single-photon level, the transducer achieves an areanormalized storage efficiency greater than 90%, a bandwidth of 2.1 MHz, and a noise equivalent temperature as low as 26 K, even in cavity-free conditions. Our findings pave the way for the practical implementation of quantum repeaters based on atomic ensembles in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>High harmonic generation from a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lasers provide intense coherent radiation, essential to cool and trap atoms into a Bose-Einstein condensate or can alternatively drive the non-linear dynamics of high-order harmonic generation. Yet, these two fundamental processes remained of independent consideration. Here, we connect matter waves at ultracold temperatures with radiation bursts on the ultrafast attosecond timescale. We do this by exploring high harmonic generation from a Bose-Einstein condensate.</description>

      <title>Scattering-asymmetry control with ultrafast electron wave packet shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.13425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scattering of a tightly focused electron beam by an atom forms one of the bases of modern electron microscopy. A fundamental symmetry breaking occurs when the target atom is displaced from the beam center. This displacement results in a deflection of the beam and an asymmetric angular distribution of the scattered electrons. Here we propose a concept to control the sign and magnitude of the scattering asymmetry by shaping the incident high-energy electron wave packet in momentum space on the atto- to picosecond time scale. The shaping controls the ultrafast real-space dynamics of the wave packet, shifting the balance between two competing contributions of the impact-parameter-dependent quantum interference and the momentum distribution of the wave packet on the target. We find a strong sensitivity of the elastic scattering on the wave packet properties, an effect that will allow wave-packet and target characterization in ultrafast electron microscopy.</description>
