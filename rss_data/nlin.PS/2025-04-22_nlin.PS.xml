      <title>The Onset of Metastable Turbulence in Pipe Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The onset of turbulence in pipe flow has been a fundamental challenge in physics, applied mathematics, and engineering for over 140 years. To date, the precursor of this laminar-turbulent transition is recognized as transient turbulent spots or puffs, but their defining characteristics - longevity, abrupt relaminarization, and super-exponential lifetime scaling - have been lack of first-principles explanations. By combining extensive computer simulations, theory, and verifications with experimental data, we identify distinct puff relaminarizations separated by a critical Reynolds number, which are defined by a noisy saddle-node bifurcation derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. Below the critical number, the mean lifetime of puff follows a square-root scaling law, representing an intrinsically deterministic decay dominated by the critical slowing down. Above the critical value, the bifurcation's node branch creates a potential well stabilizing the turbulence, while the saddle branch mediates stochastic barrier-crossing events that drive memoryless decay - a hallmark of metastable states. Accordingly, the mean lifetimes are solved theoretically and can be fitted super-exponentially. By quantifying the deterministic and stochastic components in the kinetic energy equation, the lifetime statistics of puff are analyzed in a unified framework across low-to-moderate Reynolds number regimes, uncovering the mechanisms governing the transition to metastable turbulence in pipe flows.</description>

      <title>Topological linear and nonlinear gap modes in defected dimer lattice with fourth-order diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the optical properties of linear and nonlinear topological in-phase, out-of-phase, and edge modes in a defected dimer lattice with fourth-order diffraction, encompassing their bifurcation characteristics, localized field distributions, and stability properties. Both focusing and defocusing nonlinearities are considered. Within the nontrivial regime, in-phase, out-of-phase, and edge modes can emerge within the gap. Numerical results reveal that three types of topological gap solitons bifurcate from their corresponding linear localized modes. The dimerization parameter can be tuned to drive the system from a trivial to a nontrivial configuration. We observe that as the strength of the fourth-order diffraction increases, the size of the spectral gap also enlarges, with this parameter effectively broadening the stability window for solitons. Our findings offer novel insights into the properties of both linear and nonlinear modes in topologically defected structures.</description>

      <title>The universality of filamentation-caused challenges of ultrafast laser energy deposition in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light propagation in semiconductors is the cornerstone of emerging disruptive technologies holding considerable potential to revolutionize telecommunications, sensors, quantum engineering, healthcare, and artificial intelligence. Sky-high optical nonlinearities make these materials ideal platforms for photonic integrated circuits. The fabrication of such complex devices could greatly benefit from in-volume ultrafast laser writing for monolithic and contactless integration. Ironically, as exemplified for Si, nonlinearities act as an efficient immune system self-protecting the material from internal permanent modifications that ultrashort laser pulses could potentially produce. While nonlinear propagation of high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses has been extensively investigated in Si, other semiconductors remain uncharted. In this work, we demonstrate that filamentation universally dictates ultrashort laser pulse propagation in various semiconductors. The effective key nonlinear parameters obtained strongly differ from standard measurements with low-intensity pulses. Furthermore, the temporal scaling laws for these key parameters are extracted. Temporal-spectral shaping is finally proposed to optimize energy deposition inside semiconductors. The whole set of results lays the foundations for future improvements, up to the point where semiconductors can be selectively tailored internally by ultrafast laser writing, thus leading to countless applications for in-chip processing and functionalization, and opening new markets in various sectors including technology, photonics, and semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Collective Excitations of Self-Gravitating Ultralight Dark Matter Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A remarkable feature of dark matter consisting of ultralight bosonic particles is the emergence of superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate structures on galactic scales. We investigate the oscillations of the solitonic dark matter structure in the central galactic region by numerically solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes problem, accounting for perturbations in the gravitational potential and local self-interactions. Our findings reveal that the central solitonic core, formed by the balance of gravitational attraction, quantum pressure, and repulsive interactions, exhibits significant oscillatory behaviour. These oscillations, characterized by distinct eigenmodes, provide insights into the dynamical properties of solitonic dark matter structures and their observational implications and contributions to galactic structure formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Motion of ferrodark solitons in harmonically trapped superfluids: spin corrections and emergent quartic potentials exhibiting symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for topological soliton dynamics in trapped spinor superfluids, decomposing the force acting on the soliton by the surrounding fluid into the buoyancy force and spin-corrections arising from the density depletion at soliton core and the coupling between the orbital motion and the spin mixing, respectively. For ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs), the spin correction enables mapping the FDS motion in a harmonic trap to the atomic-mass particle dynamics in an emergent quartic potential. Initially placing a type-I FDS near the trap center, a single-sided oscillation happens, which maps to the particle moving around a local minimum of the emergent double-well potential. As the initial distance of a type-II FDS from the trap center increases, the motion exhibits three regimes: trap-centered harmonic and anharmonic, followed by single-sided oscillations. Correspondingly the emergent quartic potential undergoes symmetry breaking, transitioning from a single minimum to a double-well shape, where particle motion shifts from oscillating around the single minimum to crossing between two minima via the local maximum, then the motion around one of the two minima. In a hard-wall trap with linear potential, the FDS motion maps to a harmonic oscillator.</description>
