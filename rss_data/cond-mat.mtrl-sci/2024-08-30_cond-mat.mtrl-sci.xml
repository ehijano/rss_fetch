      <title>A Quantitative Model of Triboelectric Charge Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triboelectricity, when rubbing or contacting materials causes electric charge transfer, is ubiquitous across many fields, and has been studied in detail for centuries. Despite this, a complete description of triboelectricity remains elusive. Here, we analyze the contact between a metal asperity and a semiconductor, including contributions from the depletion zone of the semiconductor and from flexoelectric polarization that arises due to the strain gradients at asperity contacts. The free charges involved in charge transfer are then discussed and calculated. As a result, we develop a quantitative model for triboelectric charge transfer that details how charge transfer scales with contact parameters, the relative influence of depletion and flexoelectricity, and which agrees with various trends in multiple classes of triboelectric experiments.</description>

      <title>Li$_2$MnCl$_4$ single crystal: new candidate for red-emitting neutron scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel red-emitting scintillator Li$_2$MnCl$_4$ is proposed as a candidate for thermal neutron detection. It features high Li content, low density, low effective atomic number, and emission in red-NIR region. These characteristics make it an interesting candidate for long distance neutron detection in harsh enviroments e. g. decomisioning of nuclear powerplants. The absorption spectrum is thoroughly investigated in the scope of Tanabe-Sugano diagram. Luminescence mechanism in the undoped Li$_2$MnCl$_4$ is studied in depth. Doping by Eu$^{2+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ is introduced as a trial to improve the scintillation efficiency. We show in the Eu$^{2+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ doped Li$_2$MnCl$_4$ that luminescence mechanism involves energy transfer from the dopants to Mn$^{2+}$, and propose the local lattice distortion around the dopant and a possible charge compensation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Magnetically dead layer in interacting ultrafine NiFe2O4 nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation of the magnetically dead layer and structural defects in ultrafine interacting NiFe2O4 nanoparticles (&lt;d&gt; = 4 nm) have been investigated using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, ^57Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, and dc magnetization and ac susceptibility measurements. According to the magnetic data, we found out three magnetic subsystems in NiFe2O4 nanoparticles. The first one with the lowest blocking (spin freezing) temperature (TS = 8 K) established by atomic magnetic moments of magnetically disordered particles with the d &lt; 4 nm. The other two subsystems are formed by the magnetic moments of the "core" of nanoparticles having size more than 4 nm and correlated surface spins in nanoparticle clusters, correspondingly. Magnetic moments of ferrimagnetically ordered "core" are blocking at a higher temperature ( \approx 40 K). It has been shown that the most significant contribution to the energy dissipation is made upon blocking of the correlated nanoparticle surface spins from the magnetically dead layer on the nanoparticles' surface. By the magnetic data, the thickness of this layer is dmd \approx 1 nm for a particle with the &lt;d&gt; \approx 4 nm. At the same time or meanwhile, the ^57Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy has revealed a structural disorder penetrating to a depth of up to dcd \approx 0.6 nm in a particle with &lt;d&gt; = 4 nm. This evidences for a faster destruction of the magnetic order as compared with the crystal order upon moving away from the center of a particle to its periphery.</description>

      <title>Group Conductivity and Nonadiabatic Born Effective Charges of Disordered Metals, Warm Dense Matter and Hot Dense Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The average ionization state is a critical parameter in plasma models for charged particle transport, equation of state, and optical response. The dynamical or nonadiabatic Born effective charge (NBEC), calculated via first principles time-dependent density functional theory, provides exact ionic partitioning of bulk electron response for both metallic and insulating materials. The NBEC can be trivially transformed into a ''group conductivity", that is, the electron conductivity ascribed to a subset of ions. We show that for disordered metallic systems, such as warm dense matter (WDM) and hot dense plasma, the static limit of the NBEC is different from the average ionization state, but that the ionization state can be extracted from the group conductivity even in mixed systems. We demonstrate this approach using a set of archetypical examples, including cold and warm aluminium, low- and high- density WDM carbon, and a WDM carbon-beryllium-hydrogen mixture.</description>

      <title>High-temperature observation of intralayer, interlayer, and Rydberg excitons in bulk van der Waals alloy single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit remarkable optical properties due to the diverse number of strongly bound excitons, which can be fine-tuned by alloying. Despite a flurry of research activity in characterizing these excitons, a comprehensive and profound understanding of their behavior with temperature is lacking. Here, we report the rich spectrum of excitonic features within bulk van der Waals alloy Mo$_{0.5}$W$_{0.5}$S$_2$ and Mo$_{0.5}$W$_{0.5}$Se$_2$ single crystals through temperature-dependent reflectance spectroscopy and first-principle calculations. We observed Rydberg excitons and interlayer excitons in both the single crystals. Notably, we provide the first experimental evidence of highly energetic A$^\prime$ and B$^\prime$ excitons in Mo$_{0.5}$W$_{0.5}$S$_2$ at room temperature. The strong carrier-phonon scattering significantly broadens the A$^\prime$, B$^\prime$ and interlayer excitons at room temperature in bulk Mo$_{0.5}$W$_{0.5}$S$_2$ single crystal compared to its selenide. Our findings, supported by density functional theory and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations, signify the crucial role of carrier-phonon interactions. These results open pathways for next-generation optoelectronic devices and quantum technologies operating at high temperature.</description>

      <title>Influence of surface pre-deformation on the Portevin-Le Chatelier effect and the related multiscale complexity of plastic flow in an Al-Mg alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of the surface pre-deformation on jerky flow caused by the Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect was investigated using flat tensile specimens of an Al-Mg alloy. Although jerky flow represents a macroscopic plastic instability, the underlying mechanisms stem from self-organization of dislocations, which pertains to deformation processes at mesoscopic scales. To provide a comprehensive approach, the investigation was carried out by coupling tensile tests, digital image correlation and acoustic emission techniques, each targeting a particular range of scales. Thin superficial layers were pre-deformed using surface mechanical attrition technique (SMAT). It was found that the observed effects depend on which surfaces are processed. Overall, the treated samples exhibited an enhanced yield strength without deterioration of ductility in comparison with the initial material. These changes in the general mechanical behavior are likely to be correlated with the changes in jerky flow. Using digital image correlation, a tendency to delocalization of bursts of plastic flow was found for both the PLC bands and smaller-scale strain heterogeneities outside the bands, the latter having been little studied so far. Unexpectedly, SMAT occurred to modify plastic flow drastically at this scale. In addition to clarification of the role played by the surface in the PLC effect, these findings provide new insights into relationships between deformation processes at distinct scales.</description>

      <title>From layered 2D carbon to 3D tetrahedral original allotropes C12 and C18 with physical properties related to diamond: Crystal chemistry and DFT investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two mechanisms of changes from 2D to 3D (D = dimensionality) involving 2D C(sp2) trigonal paving to C(sp3) tetrahedral stacking are proposed through puckering of the 2D layers on one hand and interlayer insertion of extra C on the other hand. Such transformations, led to original 3D hexagonal C12 and C18 allotropes respectively characterized by lon and bac topologies. Using density functional theory DFT calculations, the two allotropes were found cohesive and stable both mechanically (elastic properties) and dynamically (phonons). Comparisons of the physical properties with known uni C6 were established letting identify ranges of large Vickers hardness: HV (uni C6) = 89 GPa, HV (lon C12) = 97 GPa, and HV (bac C18) = 70 GPa. Whilst C6 was identified with acoustic phonons instability, C12 and C18 were found stable dynamically throughout the acoustic and optic frequency ranges. Furthering on the thermal properties the allotropes were characterized with a temperature dependence curve of the specific heat CV close to experimental data of diamond with best fit for novel C18. The electronic band structures reveal a small band gap of 1 eV for uni C6 and larger direct band gap of 3 eV for the two other 3D allotropes. Such modulations of the electronic and physical properties should open scopes of carbon research.</description>

      <title>Multiferroic Metallic Monolayer Cu(CrSe2)2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer stands out for its combined ferromagnetic (FM), ferroelectric (FE), and metallic properties, marking itself as a prominent 2D multiferroic metal. This work studies those properties and the relevant physics, using density functional calculations, Monte Carlo simulations, and $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics. Our results show that Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer is in the Cr$^{3+}$ $t_{2g}^3$ state with $S$ = 3/2 and Cu$^{1+}$ $3d^{10}$ with $S$ = 0. A ligand hole in the Se 4$p$ orbitals gives rise to metallic behavior and enhances the FM coupling between the local Cr$^{3+}$ $S$ = 3/2 spins. The observed in-plane magnetic anisotropy primarily arises from exchange anisotropy, which is associated with the Cr-Se-Cr itinerant ferromagnetism. In contrast, both single-ion anisotropy and shape magnetic anisotropy contribute negligibly. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is also quite weak, only about 3\% of the intralayer exchange parameters. Our Monte Carlo simulations show a FM Curie temperature ($T_{\rm C}$) of 190 K. Moreover, the monolayer exhibits a vertical FE polarization of 1.79 pC/m and a FE polarization switching barrier of 182 meV/f.u., and the FE state remains stable above 800 K as shown by $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, a magnetoelectric coupling is partially manifested by a magnetization rotation from in-plane to out-of-plane associated with a FE-to-paraelectric transition. The magnetization rotation can also be induced by either hole or electron doping, and the hole doping increases the $T_{\rm C}$ up to 238 K. In addition, tensile strain reduces the FE polarization but enhances $T_{\rm C}$ to 290 K, while a compressive strain gives an opposite effect. Therefore, the multiferroic metallic Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer may be explored for advanced multifunctional electronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by applications in information technology, the search for new materials with stable, long-range magnetic ordering continues. Metalorganic magnets, involving the coordination of metal atoms with specific organic ligands, are a focus of intense research. These magnets offer customizable properties through synthetic adjustments to ligands or coordination chemistry. Here the synthesis, structural characterization, and magnetic properties of the 2D cyanocarbon magnet NiTCNE is reported. 2D-crystalline domains of this single-layered metalorganic network reach sizes exceeding 30 nanometers through co-deposition of the ligand TCNE (tetracyanoethylene) and Ni atoms on an Au(111) surface under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Non-contact atomic force microscopy visualizes the structure with atomic resolution. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism establishes the 2D NiTCNE as a ferromagnet, with a very high magnetic remanence, a coercive field of around 1 tesla and a Curie temperature between 10 and 20 kelvin. As metalorganic chemistry opens a large variety of routes of synthesis, we anticipate that this materials research paves the way to new magnetic nanomaterials for spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>A Non-Isothermal Phase-Field Crystal Model with Lattice Expansion: Analysis and Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a non-isothermal phase-field crystal model including heat flux and thermal expansion of the crystal lattice. The thermal compatibility condition, as well as a positive entropy-production property, is derived analytically and further verified by numerical benchmark simulations. Furthermore, we examine how the different model parameters control density and temperature evolution during dendritic solidification through extensive parameter studies. Finally, we extend our framework to the modeling of open systems considering external mass and heat fluxes. This work sets the ground for a comprehensive mesoscale model of non-isothermal solidification including thermal expansion within a positive entropy-producing framework, and provides a benchmark for further meso- to macroscopic modeling of solidification.</description>

      <title>Prediction of an alternative route to polymeric carbon dioxide: A metastable energetic material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of pressure to attain new material properties recoverable to ambient conditions is a central problem in high-pressure physics. Despite decades of research, this goal has only been achieved in the laboratory for a few notable examples such as diamond and boron nitride. An area of significant interest is the transformation under compression of light-element molecular compounds to extended-covalently-bonded (polymeric) solids. Among them, CO2 has been extensively studied due to its status as the prototypical simple molecular system with a rich phase diagram and due to its fundamental role in Earth's physics and chemistry. One of its polymeric crystalline phases, accessible at extreme pressures and temperatures, have been recently quenched to ambient pressure, but only at a low temperature. Here we report first principles calculations predicting that isothermal compression of a carbon monoxide and oxygen mixture (CO+O2), rather than pure CO2, lowers the polymerization-onset pressure at room temperature from ~118 GPa to ~8 GPa. Moreover, it leads to the formation of an intrinsically different polymer with enhanced metastability. We show that this dense phase is an energetic material, which can be recovered to ambient pressure and temperature.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Properties of Type-I and Type-II Nodal Line Semimetals: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric (TE) properties of nodal line semimetals (NLSs) using a combination of semi-analytical calculations within Boltzmann's linear transport theory and the relaxation time approximation, along with first-principles calculations for the so-called type-I and type-II NLSs. We consider the conduction and valence bands that cross near the Fermi level of these materials through first-principles calculations of typical type-I (TiS) and type-II (Mg$_3$Bi$_2$) NLSs and use the two-band model fit to find the Fermi velocity $v_{F}$ and effective mass $m$ that will be employed as the initial energy dispersion parameters. The optimum curvature value for each energy band is searched by tuning the energy dispersion parameters to improve the TE properties of the NLss. We can obtain the best $\sim$$3.5\%$ increase in the Seebeck coefficient peak value compared to those using the initial parameter value in the type-I NLS, with the Seebeck coefficient ranging from $0.509S_{0}$ to $0.527S_{0}$ where $S_0 \approx 86.17~\mu$V/K. Meanwhile, the best increase in power factor, as large as $\sim$$83\%$ the initial value, can be obtained in the type-II NLS when $v_{F}$ is lowered. By systematically comparing all of our calculation results, we observed that tuning $v_{F}$ significantly improves TE properties in both types of NLS compared to tuning $m$. Our work is expected to trigger further calculations to scan other potential TE materials, particularly in the class of semimetals, by manipulating their band structure through the variation of the curvatures of their energy bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the vibrational and electronic properties of Al$_{12}$M (Zn, Cu) clusters are investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicate that the clusters favor low-spin states when evaluated with three different functionals: PBE, PBE0, and TPSSh. Additionally, the doped clusters exhibit lower ionization energy and electron affinity compared to the neutral Al$_{13}$ cluster. The density of states show a higher degree of hybridization in Al$_{12}$Cu compared to Al$_{12}$Zn.</description>

      <title>In-situ scanning gate imaging of individual two-level material defects in live superconducting quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low temperature physics of structurally amorphous materials is governed by two-level system defects (TLS), the exact origin and nature of which remain elusive despite decades of study. Recent advances towards realising stable high-coherence platforms for quantum computing has increased the importance of studying TLS in solid-state quantum circuits, as they are a persistent source of decoherence and instability. Here we perform scanning gate microscopy on a live superconducting quantum circuit at millikelvin temperatures to locate individual TLS. Our method directly reveals the microscopic nature of TLS and is also capable of deducing the three dimensional orientation of individual TLS electric dipole moments. Such insights, when combined with structural information of the underlying materials, can help unravel the detailed microscopic nature and chemical origin of TLS, directing strategies for their eventual mitigation.</description>

      <title>Multifaceted nature of defect tolerance in halide perovskites and emerging semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-halide perovskites (LHPs) have shot to prominence as efficient energy conversion materials that can be processed using cost-effective fabrication methods. A widely-quoted reason for their exceptional performance is their ability to tolerate defects, enabling long charge-carrier lifetimes despite high defect densities. Realizing defect tolerance in broader classes of materials would have a substantial impact on the semiconductor industry. Significant effort has been made over the past decade to unravel the underlying origins of defect tolerance to design stable alternatives to LHPs comprised of nontoxic elements. However, it has become clear that understanding defect tolerance in LHPs is far from straightforward. This review discusses the models proposed for defect tolerance in halide perovskites, evaluating the experimental and theoretical support for these models, as well as their limitations. We cover attempts to apply these models to identify materials beyond the lead-halide system that could also exhibit defect tolerance, and the successes and pitfalls encountered over the past decade. Finally, a discussion is made of some of the important missing pieces of information required for a deeper understanding and predictive models that enable the inverse design of defect tolerant semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Is Ultralow Friction on Graphite Sustainable in Contaminated Environments?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural lubricity arises typically at incommensurate, well-defined dry contacts where short-range elastic instability is significantly mitigated. However, under ambient conditions, airborne molecules adsorb onto solid surfaces, forming an intervening viscous medium that alters interfacial properties. Using molecular dynamics simulations with a newly parameterized interfacial potential, we investigate the preservation of ultralow friction on graphite with physisorbed n-hexadecane (HEX) as a model contaminant. Our findings reveal that a well-ordered monolayer of HEX molecules strongly adheres to the graphite surface, replicating its lattice structure and maintaining solid-like behavior, which leads to orientation-dependent shear stresses-an effect absent on a gold (111) surface. As the contaminant film thickens, this orientation effect diminishes. Additionally, as coverage increases from zero to one monolayer, the shear stress-velocity relationship transitions from Coulomb to quasi-Stokesian and then to quasi-Coulomb, highlighting the role of molecular displacement in high-velocity dissipation. Despite a hundredfold increase in shear stress compared to dry sliding, superlubricity on graphite persists under ambient conditions, enhancing our conventional understanding of structural lubricity.</description>

      <title>Gibbs free energies of Fe clusters can be approximated by Tolman correction to accurately model cluster nucleation and growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate Gibbs free energies of Fe clusters are required for predictive modeling of Fe cluster growth during condensation of a cooling vapor. We present a straightforward method of calculating free energies of cluster formation using the data provided by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We apply this method to calculate free energies of Fe clusters having from 2 to 100 atoms. The free energies are verified by comparing to an MD-simulated equilibrium cluster size distribution in a sub-saturated vapor. We show that these free energies differ significantly from those obtained with a commonly used spherical cluster approximation - which relies on a surface tension coefficient of a flat surface. The spherical cluster approximation can be improved by using a cluster size-dependent Tolman correction for the surface tension. The values for the Tolman length and effective surface tension were derived, which differ from the commonly used experimentally measured surface tension based on the potential energy. This improved approximation does not account for geometric magic number effects responsible for spikes and troughs in densities of neighbor cluster sizes. Nonetheless, it allows to model cluster formation from a cooling vapor and accurately reproduce the condensation timeline, overall shape of the cluster size distribution, average cluster size, and the distribution width. Using a constant surface tension coefficient resulted in distorted condensation dynamics and inaccurate cluster size distributions. The analytical expression for cluster nucleation rate from classical nucleation theory (CNT) was updated to account for the size-dependence of cluster surface tension.</description>

      <title>Ultrathin natural biotite crystals as a dielectric layer for van der Waals heterostructure applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biotite, an iron-rich mineral belonging to the trioctahedral mica group, is a naturally abundant layered material (LM) exhibiting attractive electronic properties for application in nanodevices. Biotite stands out as a non-degradable LM under ambient conditions, featuring high-quality basal cleavage, a significant advantage for van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) applications. In this work, we present the micro-mechanical exfoliation of biotite down to monolayers (1Ls), yielding ultrathin flakes with large areas and atomically flat surfaces. To identify and characterize the mineral, we conducted a multi-elemental analysis of biotite using energy-dispersive spectroscopy mapping. Additionally, synchrotron infrared nano-spectroscopy was employed to probe its vibrational signature in few-layer form, with sensitivity to the layer number. We have also observed good morphological and structural stability in time (up to 12 months) and no important changes in their physical properties after thermal annealing processes in ultrathin biotite flakes. Conductive atomic force microscopy evaluated its electrical capacity, revealing an electrical breakdown strength of approximately 1 V/nm. Finally, we explore the use of biotite as a substrate and encapsulating LM in vdWH applications. We have performed optical and magneto-optical measurements at low temperatures. We find that ultrathin biotite flakes work as a good substrate for 1L-MoSe2, comparable to hexagonal boron nitride flakes, but it induces a small change of the 1L-MoSe2 g-factor values, most likely due to natural impurities on its crystal structure. Furthermore, our results show that biotite flakes are useful systems to protect sensitive LMs such as black phosphorus from degradation for up to 60 days in ambient air. Our study introduces biotite as a promising, cost-effective LM for the advancement of future ultrathin nanotechnologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future information processing technologies like quantum memory devices have the potential to store and transfer quantum states to enable quantum computing and networking. A central consideration in practical applications for such devices is the nature of the light-matter interface which determines the storage state density and efficiency. Here, we employ an organic radical, $\alpha$,$\gamma$-bisdiphenylene-$\beta$-phenylallyl (BDPA) doped into an o-terphenyl host to explore the potential for using tuneable and high-performance molecular media in microwave-based quantum applications. We demonstrate that this radical system exhibits millisecond-long spin-lattice relaxation and microsecond-long phase memory times at room temperature, while also having the capability to generate an oscillating spin-polarized state using a co-dissolved photo-activated tetraphenylporphyrin moiety, all enabled by using a viscous liquid host. This latest system builds upon collective wisdom from previous molecules-for-quantum literature by combining careful host matrix selection, with dynamical decoupling, and photoexcited triplet-radical spin polarisation to realise a versatile and robust quantum spin medium.</description>

      <title>Order and disorder in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets, conventional long-range order is suppressed due to the presence of primitive triangular structural units, and the nature of the ensuing ground state remains elusive. One class of candidate states, extensively sought in experiments and vigorously studied theoretically, is the quantum spin liquid (QSL), a magnetically-disordered state in which all spins participate in a quantum-coherent many-body state. Randomly located impurities, present in all materials, may prevent QSL formation and instead lead to the formation of a spin-glass state. In this article, we review available data on the specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, and neutron scattering in GF materials. Such data show that a pure GF magnet possesses a characteristic ``hidden energy scale'' significantly exceeded by the other microscopic energy scales in the material. When cooled down to a temperature below the hidden energy scale, a GF material develops significant short-range order that dominates its properties and, in particular, dictates the spin-glass transition temperature for experimentally accessible impurity densities. We review the manifestations of short-range order in the commonly observed thermodynamics quantities in GF materials, possible scenarios for the hidden energy scale, and related open questions.</description>

      <title>Influence of anti-ferromagnetic ordering and electron correlation on the electronic structure of MnTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron correlation and long-range magnetic ordering have a significant impact on the electronic structure and physical properties of solids. Here, we investigate the electronic structure of ilmenite MnTiO$_{3}$ using room temperature photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical approaches within density functional theory (DFT), DFT+$U$ and DFT+dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). Mn 2$p$ (Ti 2$p$) core level photoemission spectra, confirming Mn$^{2+}$ (Ti$^{4+}$) oxidation state, exhibit multiple satellites which are very similar to that of MnO (TiO$_{2}$), suggesting similar strength of various interactions in this system. Valence band spectra collected at different photon energies suggest dominant Mn 3$d$ character in the highest occupied band with a wide insulating gap. DFT(+$U$) correctly predicts the experimentally observed anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) insulating ground state for MnTiO$_3$ where the requirement of a large $U$ to reproduce the experimental values of magnetic moment and band gap signifies the importance of electron correlation. Magnetically disordered paramagnetic (PM) phase could be well captured within DFT+DMFT, which provides an excellent agreement for the experimental band gap, paramagnetic moment, valence band spectra as well as dominant Mn 3$d$ character in the highest occupied band. The calculated spectral function remains largely unaffected and exhibits sharper features in the magnetically ordered AFM phase. We show that the electronic structure of MnTiO$_{3}$ in both the PM and AFM phases can be accurately described within DFT+DMFT.</description>

      <title>Estimation Enhancing in Optoelectronic Property: A Novel Approach Using Orbital Interaction Parameters and Tight-Binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper advocates for an innovative approach designed for estimating optoelectronic properties of quantum structures utilizing Tight-Binding (TB) theory. Predicated on the comparative analysis between estimated and actual properties, the study strives to validate the efficacy of this proposed technique; focusing notably on the computation of bandgap energy. It is observed that preceding methodologies offered a restricted accuracy when predicting complex structures like super-lattices and quantum wells. To address this gap, we propose a methodology involving three distinct phases using orbital interaction parameters (OIPs) and the TB theory. The research employed Aluminium Arsenide (AlAs) and Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) as the primary bulk materials. Our novel approach introduces a computation framework that first focuses on bulk computation, subsequently expanding to super-lattice structures. The findings of this research demonstrate promising results regarding the accuracy of predicated optoelectronic properties, particularly the cut-off wavelength. This study paves the way for future research, potentially enhancing the precision of the proposed methodology and its application scope within the field of quantum optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Do Graph Neural Networks Work for High Entropy Alloys?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have excelled in predictive modeling for both crystals and molecules, owing to the expressiveness of graph representations. High-entropy alloys (HEAs), however, lack chemical long-range order, limiting the applicability of current graph representations. To overcome this challenge, we propose a representation of HEAs as a collection of local environment (LE) graphs. Based on this representation, we introduce the LESets machine learning model, an accurate, interpretable GNN for HEA property prediction. We demonstrate the accuracy of LESets in modeling the mechanical properties of quaternary HEAs. Through analyses and interpretation, we further extract insights into the modeling and design of HEAs. In a broader sense, LESets extends the potential applicability of GNNs to disordered materials with combinatorial complexity formed by diverse constituents and their flexible configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dependence of tunneling conductance and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) on barrier thickness in magnetic tunnel junctions is theoretically investigated. The complex band structure of the insulator is taken into account, and an analytical formula for tunneling conductance and TMR is derived. Numerical calculations using a tight-binding model validate the analytical formula. The complex nature of insulator's band structure leads to significant oscillations in tunneling conductance and TMR as functions of barrier thickness. It is demonstrated that these TMR oscillations are not caused by quantum confinement within the barrier, but are instead analogous to classical two-slit optical interference.</description>

      <title>Electric field control of moir\'e skyrmion phases in twisted multiferroic NiI$_2$ bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted magnetic van der Waals materials provide a flexible platform to engineer new forms of unconventional magnetism. Here we demonstrate the emergence of electrically tunable topological moir\'e magnetism in twisted bilayers of the spin-spiral multiferroic NiI$_2$. We establish a rich phase diagram featuring uniform spiral phases, a variety of $k\pi$-skyrmion lattices, and nematic spin textures ordered at the moir\'e scale. The emergence of these phases is driven by the local stacking and the resulting modulated frustration in the spin spiral stemming from the moir\'e pattern. Notably, when the spin-spiral wavelength is commensurate with the moir\'e length scale by an integer $k$, multi-walled skyrmions become pinned to the moir\'e pattern. We show that the strong magnetoelectric coupling displayed by the moir\'e multiferroic allows the electric control of the $k\pi$-skyrmion lattices by an out-of-plane electric field, which couples to the moir\'e-induced electric polarization. While adiabatic changes in the electric field preserve the topology of the spin configurations, abrupt variations can trigger transitions between different skyrmion lattice ground states. Our results establish a highly tunable platform for skyrmionics based on twisted van der Waals multiferroics, potentially enabling a new generation of ultrathin topologically-protected spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the linear and nonlinear optical absorption coefficients (OAC) and refractive index changes (RIC) in quantum dot and quantum antidot systems with a position-dependent variable effective mass. Significant contributions to both linear and nonlinear OAC and RIC are observed. Our findings reveal that variations of the mass parameter modify the intersubband dipole matrix elements and energy intervals, leading to noticeable shifts in optical properties. The results show that higher {\gamma} values shift resonance peaks towards higher energies, while changes in the oscillator frequency result in abrupt shifts and peak diminutions. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the optical behaviors in the quantum systems under consideration, paving the way for designing devices with optimal efficiency</description>

      <title>Anisotropic effects in two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among a huge variety of known two-dimensional materials, some of them have anisotropic crystal structures; examples include so different systems as a few-layer black phoshphorus (phosphorene), beryllium nitride BeN$_4$, van der Waals magnet CrSBr, rhenium dichalgogenides ReX$_2$. As a consequence, their optical and electronic properties turn out to be highly anisotropic as well. In some cases, the anisotropy results not just in a smooth renormalization of observable properties in comparison with the isotropic case but in the appearance of dramatically new physics. The examples are hyperbolic plasmons and excitons, strongly anisotropic ordering of adatoms at the surface of two-dimensional or van der Waals materials, essential change of transport and superconducting properties. Here, we present a systematic review of electronic structure, transport and optical properties of several representative groups of anisotropic two-dimensional materials including semiconductors, anisotropic Dirac and semi-Dirac materials, as well as superconductors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humanity has long sought inspiration from nature to innovate materials and devices. As science advances, nature-inspired materials are becoming part of our lives. Animate materials, characterized by their activity, adaptability, and autonomy, emulate properties of living systems. While only biological materials fully embody these principles, artificial versions are advancing rapidly, promising transformative impacts across various sectors. This roadmap presents authoritative perspectives on animate materials across different disciplines and scales, highlighting their interdisciplinary nature and potential applications in diverse fields including nanotechnology, robotics and the built environment. It underscores the need for concerted efforts to address shared challenges such as complexity management, scalability, evolvability, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical and environmental considerations. The framework defined by classifying materials based on their level of animacy can guide this emerging field encouraging cooperation and responsible development. By unravelling the mysteries of living matter and leveraging its principles, we can design materials and systems that will transform our world in a more sustainable manner.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity Predictions with Foundation Atomistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have led to the development of foundation models for atomistic materials chemistry, enabling quantum-accurate descriptions of interatomic forces across diverse compounds at reduced computational cost. Hitherto, these models have been benchmarked mostly on harmonic phonons, and their accuracy and efficiency in predicting complex, technologically relevant anharmonic heat-conduction properties remains unknown. Here, we introduce a framework that leverages foundation models and the Wigner formulation of heat transport to overcome the major bottlenecks of current techniques for designing heat-management materials, such as high cost, limited transferability, or lack of physics awareness. We present the standards needed to achieve first-principles accuracy in conductivity predictions through foundational model fine-tuning, introducing suitable benchmark metrics and discussing the precision/cost trade-off. We apply our framework to a database of solids with diverse compositions and structures, demonstrating its potential to discover materials for next-gen technologies ranging from thermal insulation to neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Group-IV ternary and binary semiconductors using epitaxy of $\rm GeH_3Cl$ and $\rm SnH_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\rm{Ge}_{1-x-y}Si_{x}Sn_{y}$ alloys were grown on Ge buffer layers at ultra-low temperature using reactions of $\rm SnH_{4}$ and $\rm GeH_{3}Cl$ for the first time. The latter is a newly introduced CVD source designed for epitaxial development of group IV semiconductors under low thermal budgets and CMOS compatible conditions. The $\rm{Ge}_{1-x-y}Si_{x}Sn_{y}$ films were produced between 160-200oC with 3-5% Si and ~ 5-11 % Sn, which traverses the indirect to direct gap transition in Ge-Sn materials. The films were fully strained to Ge and exhibited defect-free microstructures, flat surfaces, homogeneous compositions, uniform thicknesses and sharp interfaces as required for device manufacturing. A comparative study was then conducted to investigate the applicability of $\rm GeH_{3}Cl$ for the synthesis of $\rm Ge_{1-y}Sn_{y}$ binaries under similar experimental conditions. The$\rm Ge_{1-y}Sn_{y}$ films were grown fully strained to Ge, but with reduced Sn compositions ranging from ~ 2 - 7 % and lower thicknesses relative to $\rm{Ge}_{1-x-y}Si_{x}Sn_{y}$. This prompted efforts to further investigate the growth behavior of $\rm Ge_{1-y}Sn_{y}$ using the $\rm GeH_{3}Cl$ method, bypassing the Ge buffer to produce samples directly on Si, with the aim of exploring how to manage interface strain. In this case the $\rm Ge_{1-y}Sn_{y}$ on Si films exhibited compositions and thicknesses comparable to $\rm Ge_{1-y}Sn_{y}$-on-Ge films; however, their strain states were mostly relaxed, presumably due to the large misfit between $\rm Ge_{1-y}Sn_{y}$ and Si. Efforts to increase the concentration and thickness of these samples resulted in non-homogeneous multi-phase materials containing large amounts of interstitial Sn impurities.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the static dielectric screening approximation of Coulomb interactions in atomically thin semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coulomb interactions in atomically thin materials are uniquely sensitive to variations in the dielectric screening of the environment, which can be used to control quasiparticles and exotic quantum many-body phases. A static approximation of the dielectric response, where increased dielectric screening is predicted to cause an energy redshift of the exciton resonance, has been until now sufficient. Here, we use charge-tunable exciton resonances to study screening effects in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers embedded in materials with dielectric constants ranging from 4 to more than 1000. In contrast to expectations, we observe a blueshift of the exciton resonance exceeding 30 meV for larger dielectric constant environments. By employing a dynamical screening model, we find that while the exciton binding energy remains mostly controlled by the static dielectric response, the exciton self-energy is dominated by the high-frequency response. Dielectrics with markedly different static and high-frequency screening enable the selective addressing of distinct many-body effects in layered materials and their heterostructures, expanding the tunability range and offering new routes to detect and control correlated quantum many-body states and to design optoelectronic and quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine a class of Hamiltonians characterized by interatomic, interorbital even-odd parity hybridization as a model for a family of topological insulators without the need for spin-orbit coupling. Non-trivial properties of these materials are exemplified by studying the topologically-protected edge states of s-p hybridized alkali and alkaline earth atoms in one and two-dimensional lattices. In 1D the topological features are analogous to the canonical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model but, remarkably, occur in the absence of dimerization. Alkaline earth chains, with Be standing out due to its gap size and near particle-hole symmetry, are of particular experimental interest since their Fermi energy without doping lies directly at the level of topological edge stats. Similar physics is demonstrated to occur in a 2D honeycomb lattice system of s-p bonded atoms, where dispersive edge states emerge. Lighter elements are predicted using this model to host topological states in contrast to spin-orbit coupling-induced band inversion favoring heaving atoms.</description>

      <title>Polarization textures in crystal supercells with topological bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials are a highly tunable platform for studying the momentum space topology of the electronic wavefunctions and real space topology in terms of skyrmions, merons, and vortices of an order parameter. Such textures for electronic polarization can exist in moir\'e heterostructures. A quantum-mechanical definition of local polarization textures in insulating supercells was recently proposed. Here, we propose a definition for local polarization that is also valid for systems with topologically non-trivial bands. We introduce semilocal hybrid polarizations, which are valid even when the Wannier functions in a system cannot be made exponentially localized in all dimensions. We use this definition to explicitly show that nontrivial real-space polarization textures can exist in topologically non-trivial systems with non-zero Chern number under (1) an external superlattice potential, and (2) under a stacking-induced moir\'e potential. In the latter, we find that while the magnitude of the local polarization decreases discontinuously across a topological phase transition from trivial to topologically nontrivial, the polarization does not completely vanish. Our findings suggest that band topology and real-space polar topology may coexist in real materials.</description>

      <title>One-step Pulsed Laser Deposition of Metal oxynitride/Carbon Composites for Supercapacitor Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced material composite of nanocarbons and metal-based materials provides a synergistic effect to obtain excellent electrochemical charge-storage performance and other properties. Herein, 3D porous carbon-metal oxynitride nanocomposites with tunable carbon/metal and oxygen/nitrogen ratio are synthesized uniquely by simultaneous ablation from two different targets by single-step pulsed laser deposition at room temperature. Co-ablation of titanium and vanadium nitride targets together with graphite allowed us to synthesize carbon-metal oxynitride porous nanocomposite and exploit them as a binder-free thin film supercapacitor electrode in aqueous electrolyte. We show that the elemental composition ratio and hence the structural properties can be tuned by selecting target configuration and by manipulating the ablation position. We investigate how this tuning capability impacts their charge-storage performances. We anticipate the utilization of as-synthesized various composites in a single PLD production run as next-generation active materials for flexible energy storage and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>A computational materials science paradigm for a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) bring the excitement of research into the classroom to improve learning and the sense of belonging in the field. They can reach more students, earlier in their studies, than typical undergraduate research. Key aspects are: students learn and use research methods, give input into the project, generate new research data, and analyze it to draw conclusions that are not known beforehand. CUREs are common in other fields but have been rare in materials science and engineering. I propose a paradigm for computational material science CUREs, enabled by web-based simulation tools from nanoHUB.org that require minimal computational skills. After preparatory exercises, students each calculate part of a set of closely related materials, following a defined protocol to contribute to a novel class dataset which they analyze, and also calculate an additional property of their choice. This approach has been used successfully in several class projects.</description>

      <title>The Drude weight of a flatband metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flatband systems form a new class of materials that challenge the conventional wisdom of transport. The intrinsically strong electronic correlations combined with the vanishing kinetic energy scale suggest a sensitive dependence of transport properties on the flat band states and make interacting flat bands promising candidates for exotic quantum transport. Utilizing the Drude weight, we investigate the low-frequency spectral properties of the electrical conductivity within a controlled analytic treatment of the many-body response at temperatures above the bandwidth and the interaction strength and below the bandgap. Focusing on this new transport regime, we demonstrate the potential of a quantum geometric approach for interacting systems and intermediate temperatures. The derived spectral weight yields unexplored 4-point geometric contributions unrelated to the quantum metric, which questions the previously proposed projection methods. For long-ranged interactions, we show that the low-frequency spectral weight reduces to the variance of the Berry curvature.</description>
