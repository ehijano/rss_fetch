      <title>Ergodicity of Langevin Dynamics and its Discretizations for Non-smooth Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is concerned with sampling from Gibbs distributions $\pi(x)\propto e^{-U(x)}$ using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In particular, we investigate Langevin dynamics in the continuous- and the discrete-time setting for such distributions with potentials $U(x)$ which are strongly-convex but possibly non-differentiable. We show that the corresponding subgradient Langevin dynamics are exponentially ergodic to the target density $\pi$ in the continuous setting and that certain explicit as well as semi-implicit discretizations are geometrically ergodic and approximate $\pi$ for vanishing discretization step size. Moreover, we prove that the discrete schemes satisfy the law of large numbers allowing to use consecutive iterates of a Markov chain in order to compute statistics of the stationary distribution posing a significant reduction of computational complexity in practice. Numerical experiments are provided confirming the theoretical findings and showcasing the practical relevance of the proposed methods in imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Hardware Trends Impacting Floating-Point Computations In Scientific Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of floating-point computation has been shaped by algorithmic advancements, architectural innovations, and the increasing computational demands of modern technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC). This paper examines the historical progression of floating-point computation in scientific applications and contextualizes recent trends driven by AI, particularly the adoption of reduced-precision floating-point types. The challenges posed by these trends, including the trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and precision, are discussed, as are innovations in mixed-precision computing and emulation algorithms that offer solutions to these challenges. This paper also explores architectural shifts, including the role of specialized and general-purpose hardware, and how these trends will influence future advancements in scientific computing, energy efficiency, and system design.</description>

      <title>Wavelet s-Wasserstein distances for 0 &lt; s &lt;= 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by classical harmonic analysis results characterizing H\"older spaces in terms of the decay of their wavelet coefficients, we consider wavelet methods for computing s-Wasserstein type distances. Previous work by Sheory (n\'e Shirdhonkar) and Jacobs showed that, for 0 &lt; s &lt;= 1, the s-Wasserstein distance W_s between certain probability measures on Euclidean space is equivalent to a weighted l_1 difference of their wavelet coefficients. We demonstrate that the original statement of this equivalence is incorrect in a few aspects and, furthermore, fails to capture key properties of the W_s distance, such as its behavior under translations of probability measures. Inspired by this, we consider a variant of the previous wavelet distance formula for which equivalence (up to an arbitrarily small error) does hold for 0 &lt; s &lt; 1. We analyze the properties of this distance, one of which is that it provides a natural embedding of the s-Wasserstein space into a linear space. We conclude with several numerical simulations. Even though our theoretical result merely ensures that the new wavelet s-Wasserstein distance is equivalent to the classical W_s distance (up to an error), our numerical simulations show that the new wavelet distance succeeds in capturing the behavior of the exact W_s distance under translations and dilations of probability measures.</description>

      <title>An Eulerian approach to regularized JKO scheme with low-rank tensor decompositions for Bayesian inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of using the Eulerian discretization for the problem of modelling high-dimensional distributions and sampling, is studied. The problem is posed as a minimization problem over the space of probability measures with respect to the Wasserstein distance and solved with entropy-regularized JKO scheme. Each proximal step can be formulated as a fixed-point equation and solved with accelerated methods, such as Anderson's. The usage of low-rank Tensor Train format allows to overcome the \emph{curse of dimensionality}, i.e. the exponential growth of degrees of freedom with dimension, inherent to Eulerian approaches. The resulting method requires only pointwise computations of the unnormalized posterior and is, in particular, gradient-free. Fixed Eulerian grid allows to employ a caching strategy, significally reducing the expensive evaluations of the posterior. When the Eulerian model of the target distribution is fitted, the passage back to the Lagrangian perspective can also be made, allowing to approximately sample from it. We test our method both for synthetic target distributions and particular Bayesian inverse problems and report comparable or better performance than the baseline Metropolis-Hastings MCMC with same amount of resources. Finally, the fitted model can be modified to facilitate the solution of certain associated problems, which we demonstrate by fitting an importance distribution for a particular quantity of interest.</description>

      <title>Local interaction simulation approach for the acoustic wave equation with perfectly matched layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of the acoustic wave equation plays an important role in various applications, including audio engineering, medical imaging, and fluid dynamics. However, the complexity of the propagation medium can pose challenges, such as the infinite computing region and the interface conditions between different media. In this paper, we construct a method for simulating acoustic wave propagation based on the local interaction simulation approach (LISA) and the perfectly matched layer (PML). This method can simulate wave propagation in a finite computing region and overcome the smoothing process at the interface between different media. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we propose a variational PDE model using $\ell_2-\ell_p$ regulariser for removing Poisson noise in presence of blur. The proposed minimization problem is solved using augmented Lagrangian method. The convergence of the sequence of minimizers have been carried out.

      <title>On Multilevel Energy-Based Fragmentation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-based fragmentation methods approximate the potential energy of a molecular system as a sum of contribution terms built from the energies of particular subsystems. Some such methods reduce to truncations of the many-body expansion (MBE); others combine subsystem energies in a manner inspired by the principle of inclusion/exclusion (PIE). The combinatorial technique of M\"obius inversion of sums over partially ordered sets, which generalizes the PIE, is known to provide a non-recursive expression for the MBE contribution terms, and has also been connected to related cluster expansion methods. We build from these ideas a very general framework for decomposing potential functions into energetic contribution terms associated with elements of particular partially ordered sets (posets) and direct products thereof. Specific choices immediately reproduce not only the MBE, but also a number of other existing decomposition forms, including, e.g., the multilevel ML-BOSSANOVA schema. Furthermore, a different choice of poset product leads to a setup familiar from the combination technique for high-dimensional approximation, which has a known connection to quantum-chemical composite methods. We present the ML-SUPANOVA decomposition form, which allows the further refinement of the terms of an MBE-like expansion of the Born-Oppenheimer potential according to systematic hierarchies of ab initio methods and of basis sets. We outline an adaptive algorithm for the a posteori construction of quasi-optimal truncations of this decomposition. Some initial experiments are reported and discussed.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph $p$-Laplacian equations for data interpolation and semi-supervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraph learning with $p$-Laplacian regularization has attracted a lot of attention due to its flexibility in modeling higher-order relationships in data. This paper focuses on its fast numerical implementation, which is challenging due to the non-differentiability of the objective function and the non-uniqueness of the minimizer. We derive a hypergraph $p$-Laplacian equation from the subdifferential of the $p$-Laplacian regularization. A simplified equation that is mathematically well-posed and computationally efficient is proposed as an alternative. Numerical experiments verify that the simplified $p$-Laplacian equation suppresses spiky solutions in data interpolation and improves classification accuracy in semi-supervised learning. The remarkably low computational cost enables further applications.</description>

      <title>Quadratic projectable Runge-Kutta methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runge-Kutta methods are affine equivariant: applying a method before or after an affine change of variables yields the same numerical trajectory. However, for some applications, one would like to perform numerical integration after a quadratic change of variables. For example, in Lie-Poisson reduction, a quadratic transformation reduces the number of variables in a Hamiltonian system, yielding a more efficient representation of the dynamics. Unfortunately, directly applying a symplectic Runge-Kutta method to the reduced system generally does not preserve its Hamiltonian structure, so many proposed techniques require computing numerical trajectories of the original, unreduced system.
  In this paper, we study when a Runge-Kutta method in the original variables descends to a numerical integrator expressible entirely in terms of the quadratically transformed variables. In particular, we show that symplectic diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (SyDIRK) methods, applied to a quadratic projectable vector field, are precisely the Runge-Kutta methods that descend to a method (generally not of Runge-Kutta type) in the projected variables. We illustrate our results with several examples in both conservative and non-conservative dynamics.</description>

      <title>CWENO Interpolation for Non-Oscillatory Stochastic Collocation in Uncertainty Quantification Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in mathematical models is essential for accurately predicting system behavior under variability. This study provides guidance on method selection for reliable UQ across varied functional behaviors in engineering applications. Specifically, we compare several interpolation and approximation methods within a stochastic collocation (SC) framework, namely: generalized polynomial chaos (gPC), B-splines, shape-preserving (SP) splines, and central weighted essentially nonoscillatory (CWENO) interpolation, to reconstruct probability density functions (PDFs) and estimate statistical moments. These methods are assessed for both smooth and discontinuous functions, as well as for the solution of the 1-D Euler and shallow water equations. While gPC and interpolation B-splines perform well with smooth data, they produce oscillations near discontinuities. Approximation B-splines and SP splines, while avoiding oscillations, converge more slowly. In contrast, CWENO interpolation demonstrates high robustness, effectively capturing sharp gradients without oscillations, making it suitable for complex, discontinuous data. Overall, CWENO interpolation emerges as a versatile and effective approach for SC, particularly in handling discontinuities in UQ.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel finite element method scheme for singularly perturbed advection-diffusion-reaction problems, which combines certain quantum-assisted stabilization scheme with a classical h-adaptive approach to provide automatic error control and corresponding approximation refinement. Appropriate finite element a posteriori error estimates are proved. Described approach demonstrates the possibility to overcome singular perturbations by applying error-controlled smoothening to finite element approximation. Possible benefits of the proposed finite element scheme are discussed and the numerical comparison with the typical adaptive scheme is provided.</description>

      <title>LazyDINO: Fast, scalable, and efficiently amortized Bayesian inversion via structure-exploiting and surrogate-driven measure transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LazyDINO, a transport map variational inference method for fast, scalable, and efficiently amortized solutions of high-dimensional nonlinear Bayesian inverse problems with expensive parameter-to-observable (PtO) maps. Our method consists of an offline phase in which we construct a derivative-informed neural surrogate of the PtO map using joint samples of the PtO map and its Jacobian. During the online phase, when given observational data, we seek rapid posterior approximation using surrogate-driven training of a lazy map [Brennan et al., NeurIPS, (2020)], i.e., a structure-exploiting transport map with low-dimensional nonlinearity. The trained lazy map then produces approximate posterior samples or density evaluations. Our surrogate construction is optimized for amortized Bayesian inversion using lazy map variational inference. We show that (i) the derivative-based reduced basis architecture [O'Leary-Roseberry et al., Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng., 388 (2022)] minimizes the upper bound on the expected error in surrogate posterior approximation, and (ii) the derivative-informed training formulation [O'Leary-Roseberry et al., J. Comput. Phys., 496 (2024)] minimizes the expected error due to surrogate-driven transport map optimization. Our numerical results demonstrate that LazyDINO is highly efficient in cost amortization for Bayesian inversion. We observe one to two orders of magnitude reduction of offline cost for accurate posterior approximation, compared to simulation-based amortized inference via conditional transport and conventional surrogate-driven transport. In particular, LazyDINO outperforms Laplace approximation consistently using fewer than 1000 offline samples, while other amortized inference methods struggle and sometimes fail at 16,000 offline samples.</description>

      <title>Assessing AI-Enhanced Single-Sweep Approximations for Problems with Forward-Peaked Scattering in Slab Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the Boltzmann transport equation can accurately model transport problems with highly forward-peaked scattering, obtaining its solution can become arbitrarily slow due to near-unity spectral radius associated with source iteration. Standard acceleration techniques like diffusion synthetic acceleration and nonlinear diffusion acceleration obtain merely one order of magnitude speedups compared to source iteration due to slowly decaying error moments. Additionally, converging approximations to the Boltzmann equation like Fokker-Planck and Boltzmann Fokker Planck run into similar problems with slow convergence. In this paper we assess the feasibility of using Fourier neural operators to obtain AI-enhanced low order, and single-sweep solutions for the transport equation in slab geometry using a predictor-corrector framework.</description>

Abstract: The layer-upon-layer approach in additive manufacturing, open or closed cells in polymeric or metallic foams involve an intrinsic microstructure tailored to the underlying applications. Homogenization of such architectured materials creates metamaterials modeled by higher-gradient models, specifically when the microstructure's characteristic length is comparable to the length scale of the structure. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of various finite elements methods for solving problems in strain-gradient elasticity. We employ open-source packages from Firedrake and FEniCS. Different finite element formulations are tested: we implement Lagrange, Argyris, Hermite elements, a Hu--Washizu type (mixed) formulation, as well as isogeometric analysis with Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS). For the numerical study, we investigate one- and two-dimensional problems discussed in the literature of strain-gradient modeling. All developed codes are open-access to encourage research in Finite Element Method (FEM) based computation of generalized continua.</description>

      <title>Large Eddy Simulation using Nonlinearly Stable Flux Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of the nonlinearly stable flux reconstruction (NSFR) schemes for resolving subsonic viscous turbulent free-shear flows is investigated. The schemes are extensively verified for the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the Taylor-Green Vortex (TGV) problem. Several under-resolved simulations of the TGV problem are conducted to assess the performance of NSFR for large eddy simulation that is implicitly filtered and fully implicit (ILES). Increasing the flux reconstruction correction parameter ensures that NSFR is stable and accurate for ILES while allowing for larger explicit time-steps. The entropy-stable schemes implemented with sum-factorization for tensor and Hadamard products are shown to be more cost-effective than classical DG with over-integration. The choice of the two-point (TP) numerical flux does not impact the solution and the use of standard eddy-viscosity-based sub-grid scale models does not yield improvements for the problem considered. From the DNS results, the pressure dilatation-based dissipation rate for the nonlinearly stable schemes is consistent with literature when computed from the kinetic energy (KE) budget terms, while spurious oscillations are seen when the term is directly computed. The magnitude of these oscillations is significantly lower for a collocated scheme and are effectively eliminated with the addition of Roe upwind dissipation to the TP numerical flux. Therefore, these oscillations are believed to be associated with the treatment of the face terms in nonlinearly stable schemes. It is shown that oversampling the velocity field is necessary for obtaining accurate turbulent KE (TKE) spectra and eliminates an apparent pile-up of TKE at the smallest resolved scales. Lastly, the TKE spectra for a decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence case are in good agreement with experiment measurements and computational results in the literature.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Flux-Corrected Transport Algorithm I: A Finite-Difference Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a generalized flux-corrected transport (FCT) algorithm, which is shown to be total variation diminishing under some conditions. The new algorithm has improved properties from the standpoint of use and analysis. Results show that the new FCT algorithm performs better than the older FCT algorithms and is comparable with other modern methods. This reformulation will also allow the FCT to be used effectively with exact or approximate Riemann solvers and as an implicit algorithm.
  This paper was originally submitted to the Journal of Computational Physics in 1990. It got lost in review. One reviewer loved the paper and suggested it be published immediately (he also died while it was in review). Another reviewer savaged the paper being from the FCT camp. The journal also went through several changes in management. Ultimately I declined to continue pursuing the paper as I had one infant child at the time and another on the way in 1995. Now 30 years on I am going to put this online.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the discrete-velocity-direction model (DVDM) in conjunction with the hyperbolic quadrature method of moments (HyQMOM) to develop a multidimensional spatial-temporal approximation of the BGK equation, termed DVD-HyQMOM. Serving as a multidimensional extension of HyQMOM, DVD-HyQMOM model achieves higher accuracy than other DVDM submodels, especially with an increased number of abscissas. The efficiency and effectiveness of this model are demonstrated through various numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Time splitting method for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with rough initial data in $L^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07410v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish convergence results related to the operator splitting scheme on the Cauchy problem for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with rough initial data in $L^2$,
  $$
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  i\partial_t u +\Delta u = \lambda |u|^{p} u, &amp; (x,t) \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}_+,
  u (x,0) =\phi (x), &amp; x\in\mathbb{R}^d,
  \end{array}
  \right.
  $$ where $\lambda \in \{-1,1\}$ and $p &gt;0$. While the Lie approximation $Z_L$ is known to converge to the solution $u$ when the initial datum $\phi$ is sufficiently smooth, the convergence result for rough initial data is open to question. In this paper, for rough initial data $\phi\in L^2 (\mathbb{R}^d)$, we prove the $L^2$ convergence of the filtered Lie approximation $Z_{flt}$ to the solution $u$ in the mass-subcritical range, $0&lt; p &lt; \frac{4}{d}$. Furthermore, we provide a precise convergence result for radial initial data $\phi\in L^2 (\mathbb{R}^d)$.</description>

      <title>Fast Kernel Summation in High Dimensions via Slicing and Fourier Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel-based methods are heavily used in machine learning. However, they suffer from $O(N^2)$ complexity in the number $N$ of considered data points. In this paper, we propose an approximation procedure, which reduces this complexity to $O(N)$. Our approach is based on two ideas. First, we prove that any radial kernel with analytic basis function can be represented as sliced version of some one-dimensional kernel and derive an analytic formula for the one-dimensional counterpart. It turns out that the relation between one- and $d$-dimensional kernels is given by a generalized Riemann-Liouville fractional integral. Hence, we can reduce the $d$-dimensional kernel summation to a one-dimensional setting. Second, for solving these one-dimensional problems efficiently, we apply fast Fourier summations on non-equispaced data, a sorting algorithm or a combination of both. Due to its practical importance we pay special attention to the Gaussian kernel, where we show a dimension-independent error bound and represent its one-dimensional counterpart via a closed-form Fourier transform. We provide a run time comparison and error estimate of our fast kernel summations.</description>

Abstract: Nonlocal periodic operators in partial differential equations (PDEs) pose challenges in constructing neural network solutions, which typically lack periodic boundary conditions. In this paper, we introduce a novel PDE perspective on approximating these nonlocal periodic operators. Specifically, we investigate the behavior of the periodic first-order fractional Laplacian and Riesz transform when acting on nonperiodic functions, thereby initiating a new PDE theory for approximating solutions to equations with nonlocalities using neural networks. Moreover, we derive quantitative Sobolev estimates and utilize them to rigorously construct neural networks that approximate solutions to the two-dimensional periodic critically dissipative Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) equation.</description>

      <title>Superfast direct inversion of the nonuniform discrete Fourier transform via hierarchically semi-separable least squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A direct solver is introduced for solving overdetermined linear systems involving nonuniform discrete Fourier transform matrices. Such matrices can be transformed into a Cauchy-like form that has hierarchical low rank structure. The rank structure of this matrix is explained, and it is shown that the ranks of the relevant submatrices grow only logarithmically with the number of columns of the matrix. A fast rank-structured hierarchical approximation method based on this analysis is developed, along with a hierarchical least-squares solver for these and related systems. This result is a direct method for inverting nonuniform discrete transforms with a complexity that is usually nearly linear with respect to the degrees of freedom in the problem.This solver is benchmarked against various iterative and direct solvers in the setting of inverting the one-dimensional type-II (or forward) transform, for a range of condition numbers and problem sizes (up to $4\times 10^6$ by $2\times 10^6$). These experiments demonstrate that this method is especially useful for large problems with multiple right-hand sides.</description>

      <title>Discrete Variable Topology Optimization Using Multi-Cut Formulation and Adaptive Trust Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new framework for solving general topology optimization (TO) problems that find an optimal material distribution within a design space to maximize the performance of a structure while satisfying design constraints. These problems involve state variables that nonlinearly depend on the design variables, with objective functions that can be convex or non-convex, and may include multiple candidate materials. The framework is designed to greatly enhance computational efficiency, primarily by diminishing optimization iteration counts and thereby reducing the solving of associated state-equilibrium partial differential equations (PDEs). It maintains binary design variables and addresses the large-scale mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem that arises from discretizing the design space and PDEs. The core of this framework is the integration of the generalized Benders' decomposition and adaptive trust regions. The trust-region radius adapts based on a merit function. To mitigate ill-conditioning due to extreme parameter values, we further introduce a parameter relaxation scheme where two parameters are relaxed in stages at different paces. Numerical tests validate the framework's superior performance, including minimum compliance and compliant mechanism problems in single-material and multi-material designs. We compare our results with those of other methods and demonstrate significant reductions in optimization iterations by about one order of magnitude, while maintaining comparable optimal objective function values. As the design variables and constraints increase, the framework maintains consistent solution quality and efficiency, underscoring its good scalability. We anticipate this framework will be especially advantageous for TO applications involving substantial design variables and constraints and requiring significant computational resources for PDE solving.</description>

      <title>Recursive reduction quadrature for the evaluation of Laplace layer potentials in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A high-order quadrature scheme is constructed for the evaluation of Laplace single and double layer potentials and their normal derivatives on smooth surfaces in three dimensions. The construction begins with a harmonic approximation of the density on each patch, which allows for a natural harmonic polynomial extension in a volumetric neighborhood of the patch in the ambient space. Then by the general Stokes theorem, singular and nearly singular surface integrals are reduced to line integrals preserving the singularity of the kernel, instead of the standard origin-centered 1-forms that require expensive adaptive integration. These singularity-preserving line integrals can be semi-analytically evaluated using singularity-swap quadrature. In other words, the evaluation of singular and nearly singular surface integrals is reduced to function evaluations at the vertices on the boundary of each patch. The recursive reduction quadrature largely removes adaptive integration that is needed in most existing high-order quadratures for singular and nearly singular surface integrals, resulting in exceptional performance. The scheme achieves twelve-digit accuracy uniformly for close evaluations and offers a speedup of five times or more in constructing the sparse quadrature-correction matrix compared to previous state-of-the-art quadrature schemes.</description>

      <title>On the existence of minimizers in shallow residual ReLU neural network optimization landscapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we show existence of minimizers in the loss landscape for residual artificial neural networks (ANNs) with multi-dimensional input layer and one hidden layer with ReLU activation. Our work contrasts earlier results in [D. Gallon, A. Jentzen, and F. Lindner, preprint, arXiv:2211.15641, 2022] and [P. Petersen, M. Raslan, and F. Voigtlaender, Found. Comput. Math., 21 (2021), pp. 375-444] which showed that in many situations minimizers do not exist for common smooth activation functions even in the case where the target functions are polynomials. The proof of the existence property makes use of a closure of the search space containing all functions generated by ANNs and additional discontinuous generalized responses. As we will show, the additional generalized responses in this larger space are suboptimal so that the minimum is attained in the original function class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with kinetic equations with velocity of constant magnitude. We propose a quadrature method of moments based on the Poisson kernel, called Poisson-EQMOM. The derived moment closure systems are well defined for all physically relevant moments and the resultant approximations of the distribution function converge as the number of moments goes to infinity. The convergence makes our method stand out from most existing moment methods. Moreover, we devise a delicate moment inversion algorithm. As an application, the Vicsek model is studied for overdamped active particles. Then the Poisson-EQMOM is validated with a series of numerical tests including spatially homogeneous, one-dimensional and two-dimensional problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a novel stability estimate in $L^\infty _t (L^p _x)$ between the regular Lagrangian flow of a Sobolev vector field and a piecewise affine approximation of such flow. This approximation of the flow is obtained by a (sort of) explicit Euler method, and it is the crucial tool to prove approximation results for the solution of the continuity equation by using the representation of the solution as the push-forward via the regular Lagrangian flow of the initial datum. We approximate the solution in two ways, one probabilistic and one deterministic, using different approximations for both the flow and the initial datum.</description>

Abstract: The problem of an optimal mapping between Hilbert spaces $IN$ of $\left|\psi\right\rangle$ and $OUT$ of $\left|\phi\right\rangle$ based on a set of wavefunction measurements (within a phase) $\psi_l \to \phi_l$, $l=1\dots M$, is formulated as an optimization problem maximizing the total fidelity $\sum_{l=1}^{M} \omega^{(l)} \left|\langle\phi_l|\mathcal{U}|\psi_l\rangle\right|^2$ subject to probability preservation constraints on $\mathcal{U}$ (partial unitarity). The constructed operator $\mathcal{U}$ can be considered as an $IN$ to $OUT$ quantum channel; it is a partially unitary rectangular matrix (an isometry) of dimension $\dim(OUT) \times \dim(IN)$ transforming operators as $A^{OUT}=\mathcal{U} A^{IN} \mathcal{U}^{\dagger}$. An iterative algorithm for finding the global maximum of this optimization problem is developed, and its application to a number of problems is demonstrated. A software product implementing the algorithm is available from the authors.</description>

      <title>A hybrid quantum solver for the Lorenz system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15417</link>

Abstract: We develop a hybrid classical-quantum method for solving the Lorenz system. We use the forward Euler method to discretize the system in time, transforming it into a system of equations. This set of equations is solved using the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) algorithm. We present numerical results comparing the hybrid method with the classical approach for solving the Lorenz system. The simulation results demonstrate that the VQLS method can effectively compute solutions comparable to classical methods. The method is easily extended to solving similar nonlinear differential equations.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess Site Closure Time Frames for Soil and Groundwater Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) is gaining prominence as an effective method for managing soil and groundwater contamination due to its cost-efficiency and minimal environmental disruption. Despite its benefits, MNA necessitates extensive groundwater monitoring to ensure that contaminant levels decrease to meet safety standards. This study expands the capabilities of PyLEnM, a Python package designed for long-term environmental monitoring, by incorporating new algorithms to enhance its predictive and analytical functionalities. We introduce methods to estimate the timeframe required for contaminants like Sr-90 and I-129 to reach regulatory safety standards using linear regression and to forecast future contaminant levels with the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks. Additionally, Random Forest regression is employed to identify factors influencing the time to reach safety standards. Our methods are illustrated using data from the Savannah River Site (SRS) F-Area, where preliminary findings reveal a notable downward trend in contaminant levels, with variability linked to initial concentrations and groundwater flow dynamics. The Bi-LSTM model effectively predicts contaminant concentrations for the next four years, demonstrating the potential of advanced time series analysis to improve MNA strategies and reduce reliance on manual groundwater sampling. The code, along with its usage instructions, validation, and requirements, is available at: https://github.com/csplevuanh/pylenm_extension.</description>
