      <title>Large magnon dichroism and other optical properties of hexagonal ferrite h-Lu0.6Sc0.4FeO3 with altermagnetic A2 spin ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroic hexagonal h-Lu0.6Sc0.4FeO3 single crystals with non-collinear spins were studied using the THz and Raman scattering spectroscopies and ellipsometry. Antiferromagnetic resonances, or magnons, were found at about 0.85 THz and 1.2 THz. These magnons harden as temperature increases and disappear above 130 K. This behavior is consistent with the magnetic susceptibility and a phase transition to a previously reported weak ferromagnetic state. A strong dichroism at the resonance with the AFM doublet has been observed at zero external magnetic field using both conventional circular polarization and THz vector vortex beams. This observation is attributed to the strong altermagnetic properties of h-Lu0.6Sc0.4FeO3 with a broken PT symmetry. The splitting of the magnon doublet in an external magnetic field applied long the c axis yields a g-factor of 3.0 for the Fe3+ ions. Raman spectra of the optical phonons revealed a Fano-type asymmetry due to their interaction with a continuum of polar excitations. Electronic transitions were studied with ellipsometry and the results were compared with the modelled using DFT+eDMFT.</description>

      <title>Modelling hydrogen storage in metal hydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a one-dimensional mathematical model for the loading process of hydrogen in a metal hydride tank. The model describes the evolution of the density and pressure of the hydrogen gas, the temperature of the tank, the averaged velocity of the gas through the porous metal structure, and the transformed fraction of metal into a metal hydride. The non-dimensionalisation of the model indicates a possible reduction of the system of equations and also shows that the density and the transformed metal fraction may be decoupled from the temperature equation. The reduced model is solved numerically. Introducing a spatial dependence into the kinetic reaction constant allows to explain unexpected temperature gradients observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>A set of nearly good real numbers to specify the eigenstates of a medium-body system with two kinds of spin-1 cold atoms and with the Hamiltonian containing non-commutable terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A distinguished feature of multi-species boson systems is the appearance of the odd channel, in which the coupled spin of two different bosons is given by an odd number. Through exact numerical solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a medium-body cold system containing two types of spin-1 atoms, the effect of the odd channel has been studied. It was found that, due to the odd channel, the terms in the Hamiltonian are no longer all commutable. Accordingly, the combined spin of a single species is no longer conserved. However, when the parameters of interactions lie in some specific and broad domains, instead of a set of good quantum numbers, the ground-state (g.s.) can be specified by a set of nearly good real numbers. Each of them is not exactly a number but a very narrow interval on the positive real axis. The widths of the intervals would tend to zero when the particle numbers tend to infinity. When the parameters vary, the nearly good numbers can jump suddenly from one narrow interval to another well-separated narrow interval. Since the results of this paper are extracted from the exact solution of a medium-body system and not from a many-body approach as usual, for general many-body systems with Hamiltonians containing non-commutable terms, it remains to be clarified whether specific domains exist in the parameter space in which a set of nearly good real numbers can be used to specify the eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Shapes of magnetic monopoles in effective $SU(2)$ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic exploration of a general family of effective $SU(2)$ models with an adjoint scalar. First, we discuss a redundancy in this class of models and use it to identify seemingly different, yet physically equivalent models. Next, we construct the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) limit and derive analytic monopole solutions. In contrast to the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole, included here as a special case, these solutions tend to exhibit more complex energy density profiles. Typically, we obtain monopoles with a hollow cavity at their core where virtually no energy is concentrated; accordingly, most of the monopole's energy is stored in a spherical shell around its core. Moreover, the shell itself can be structured, with several "sub-shells". A recipe for the construction of these analytic solutions is presented.</description>
