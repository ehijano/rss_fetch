      <title>Positivity at 1-Loop: Bounds on Photon and Gluon EFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we attempt to derive ``positivity" bounds on Photon and Gluon Effective Field Theories (EFTs) at one loop level. While for the Photon case, the one loop amplitude is IR finite and well defined in the forward limit, earlier studies failed to obtain a dispersive bound on dimension-12 operators due to the dependence of the ``arc integral" on the artificial low-energy scale. We show that this awkward dependence can be taken care of by analysing the ultra-violet (UV) side of dispersion relation closely. In particular, we derive an IR safe and RG improved bound at 1-loop. Thereafter, we perform a similar analysis on the Gluon EFT, which has additional complications due to ill-defined forward limit and IR divergences at 1-loop. We show that even in this case, one can get a meaningful bound at 1-loop.</description>

      <title>Small radius inclusive jet production at the LHC through NNLO+NNLL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of hadronic jets and their substructure at hadronic colliders is crucial for improving our understanding of QCD, and searching for new physics. As such, there has been a significant effort to improve their theoretical description. In the small radius limit, inclusive jet production exhibits a universal factorization, enabling the resummation of logarithms which greatly stabilizes theoretical predictions. In this paper, we show how to combine a recently introduced framework for small-$R$ resummation with the STRIPPER subtraction formalism for fragmentation, enabling next-to-next-to-leading order calculations of small-$R$ inclusive jet production for a wide variety of processes at the LHC. We extract the two-loop constants for the jet functions, enabling for the first time next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic resummation matched to next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative calculation. We compare with CMS data for small-$R$ jet production, and find that our results greatly improve the accuracy of the predictions at small-$R$, and stabilize the perturbative convergence and error estimates at larger $R$. Our approach is applicable to a wide class of jet substructure observables exhibiting similar factorization theorems, opening the door to an NNLO jet substructure program at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Visualizing How Jet Structure Shapes Jet Wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ATLAS Collaboration has developed a method to analyze large-radius jets composed of skinny $R=0.2$ subjets in heavy-ion collisions. We first demonstrate that the measurements pioneered by ATLAS constrain the value of $L_{\rm res}$, the resolution length of QGP -- and rule out any picture in which an entire parton shower loses energy coherently as a single entity. We then analyze the response of the medium to the passage of large-radius $R=2$ jets containing two skinny subjets in gamma-jet events. We introduce novel jet-shape observables that allow us to visualize how the internal structure of large-radius jets shapes the wakes they excite in the QGP. We find that even when the subjets are $\sim 0.8$ radians apart, the angular shape of the soft hadrons originating from their wake forms a single broad structure. Only when the two subjets are even farther apart are two sub-wakes revealed. We show that the way in which jet structure shapes the structure of jet-induced wakes can be visualized with similar clarity in experiments by using only low-$p_T$ hadrons. The observables we introduce offer a new and distinctive way of seeing jet-induced wakes -- and wake substructure -- in heavy-ion collision data.</description>

      <title>Proposal for a shared transverse LLP detector for FCC-ee and FCC-hh and a forward LLP detector for FCC-hh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the particle physics community has explored most of the conventional avenues for new physics, the more elusive areas are becoming increasingly appealing.
  One such potential region, where new physics might be hiding, involves light and weakly interacting long-lived particles (LLPs).
  To probe deeper into this region, where the possibility of highly displaced scenarios weakens the role of general-purpose collider detectors, dedicated LLP detectors are our best option.
  However, their potential can only be fully realized if we optimize their position and dimensions to suit our physics goals.
  This is possible at the upcoming Future Circular Collider (FCC) facility, where the feasibility and design studies are still ongoing and can accommodate new proposals focused specifically on LLP searches.
  We propose optimized dedicated detectors in both the transverse and forward directions, significantly enhancing the sensitivity to previously unchartered regions of the new physics parameter space.
  Our proposed DELIGHT detector can additionally serve as a shared transverse detector during both the FCC-ee and FCC-hh runs.
  The concept of a shared transverse detector is novel and sustainable, utilizing the proximity of the interaction points of the lepton and hadron colliders at the FCC.
  This minimizes costs and boosts the LLP physics case at FCC.
  Furthermore, we emphasize the impact of our proposed forward detector, FOREHUNT, along the FCC-hh beam pipe, in probing LLPs from meson decays.</description>

      <title>$U$-spin conjugate $CP$ violation relations in bottom baryon decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the first observation of $CP$ violation in baryon decays, we study the relations for $CP$ asymmetries of bottom baryon decays. It is found that all the $CP$ violation ratios of two $U$-spin conjugate decay channels satisfy a simple equation in the $U$-spin limit. As examples, we present the $U$-spin conjugate channels in the four-body decays of bottom baryons. The $CP$ violation ratio between them might provide predictions for unobserved channels and be tested in future experiments.</description>

      <title>The equivalent Electric Dipole Moment in SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electric Dipole Moment of the electron (eEDM) is typically investigated in experiments using paramagnetic molecules. However, the physical observable in these searches consists in a linear combination of CP-violating interactions, rather than the eEDM alone, which is commonly referred to as the equivalent EDM of the system. Assuming the presence of new CP-odd physics from heavy degrees of freedom, we parameterize its effects within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework. We systematically compute the contributions to the full low-energy direction probed by EDM searches, focusing on leading-order effects at dimension six and one-loop level, while also discussing selected two-loop and dimension-eight contributions. We find that eEDM experiments are sensitive to a broader class of SMEFT operators than previously recognized.</description>

      <title>Advances for QCD and the Standard Model: Color-Confining Light-Front Holography and the Principle of Maximum Conformality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I review how the application of superconformal quantum mechanics and light-front holography leads to new insights into the physics of color confinement, the spectroscopy and dynamics of hadrons, as well as surprising supersymmetric relations between the masses of mesons, baryons, and tetraquarks. Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is automatically fulfilled by supersymmetric Light-Front QCD. The light-front holographic approach (HLFQCD) also predicts the behavior of the QCD running coupling and other observables from the nonperturbative color-confining domain to the perturbative domain. One can determine the QCD running coupling to high precision from the data of just a single experiment over the entire perturbative regime by using the Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC). The PMC, which generalizes the conventional Gell-Mann-Low method for scale-setting in perturbative QED to non-Abelian QCD, provides a rigorous method for achieving unambiguous scheme-independent, fixed-order Standard Model predictions, consistent with the principles of the renormalization group. I also briefly review a novel feature of hadronic physics predicted by QCD: intrinsic heavy quarks.</description>

      <title>Big Bang Nucleosynthesis as a probe of non-standard neutrino interactions and non-unitary three-neutrino mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the impact of two phenomenological Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios concerning the role of neutrinos in the early universe: non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) and non-unitary three-neutrino mixing. We evaluate the impact of these frameworks on two key cosmological observables: the effective number of relativistic neutrino species ($N_{\rm eff}$), related to neutrino decoupling, and the abundances of light elements produced at Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For the first time, neutrino CC-NSI with quarks and non-unitary three-neutrino mixing are studied in the context of BBN, and the constraints on such interactions are found to be remarkably competitive with terrestrial experiments. In the case of non-unitarity, the combination between neutrino decoupling and BBN imposes stringent constraints that can either mildly favour the existence of New Physics (NP), or reinforce the SM, depending on the choice of the experimental nuclear rates involved in the BBN calculation.</description>

      <title>QCD corrections to Higgs boson pair production and decay to the $b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$ final state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of next-to-leading order (NLO) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) corrections to Higgs boson pair production and subsequent decay into $b\bar{b}\tau^+ \tau^-$. We adopt the narrow width approximation to separate the production and decay contributions, and employ the dipole subtraction method to address infrared divergences inherent in perturbative QCD corrections. After applying a set of typical experimental cuts, we show that NLO QCD corrections to the decay process induce a significant reduction of the fiducial cross section and reshape important kinematic distributions at the 13.6 TeV LHC, such as the invariant mass of the Higgs boson pair and the transverse momentum of the leading $b$-jet. We also investigate the dependence of the kinematic distributions on the Higgs self-coupling and provide the signal acceptance as a function of the Higgs self-coupling modifier with full QCD corrections.</description>

      <title>Spinor Representations for Fields with any Spin: Lorentz Tensor Basis for Operators and Covariant Multipole Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses a framework to parametrize and decompose operator matrix elements for particles with higher spin $(j &gt; 1/2)$ using chiral representations of the Lorentz group, i.e. the $(j,0)$ and $(0,j)$ representations and their parity-invariant direct sum. Unlike traditional approaches that require imposing constraints to eliminate spurious degrees of freedom, these chiral representations contain exactly the $2j+1$ components needed to describe a spin-$j$ particle. The central objects in the construction are the $t$-tensors, which are generalizations of the Pauli four-vector $\sigma^\mu$ for higher spin. For the generalized spinors of these representations, we demonstrate how the algebra of the $t$-tensors allows to formulate a generalization of the Dirac matrix basis for any spin. For on-shell bilinears, we show that a set consisting exclusively of covariant multipoles of order $0\leq m \leq 2j$ forms a complete basis. We provide explicit expressions for all bilinears of the generalized Dirac matrix basis, which are valid for any spin value. As a byproduct of our derivations we present an efficient algorithm to compute the $t$-tensor matrix elements. The formalism presented here paves the way to use a more unified approach to analyze the non-perturbative QCD structure of hadrons and nuclei across different spin values, with clear physical interpretation of the resulting distributions as covariant multipoles.</description>

      <title>Crystalline Phases in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For decades now, low-energy models of QCD have shown indications that a crystalline quark phase could be stable at high chemical potentials. Beyond models, however, there are numerous difficulties in investigating such a hypothesis in full QCD, such as the sign problem. Functional methods do not suffer from the sign problem, and thus, can access the high--$\mu$ side of the QCD phase diagram. The main tool used to look for signs of inhomogeneous/crystalline phases in low-energy models is the so-called ``stability analysis''. In this talk, I show how the standard stability analysis was generalised to be applicable in any theory, including QCD.</description>

      <title>Blazar-Boosted Dark Matter: Novel Signatures via Elastic and Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazar-Boosted Dark Matter (BBDM) is a novel mechanism whereby dark matter (DM) particles are accelerated to ultrarelativistic energies through interactions with blazar jets. Focusing on a vector portal DM model, we systematically investigate both elastic and inelastic scattering processes between DM and protons. By analyzing multi-messenger data from ground- and space-based observatories, we derive stringent constraints on the DM-proton scattering cross section $\sigma_{\chi p}$. Our results improve upon previous limits from the constant cross section and pure elastic scattering scenarios by several orders of magnitude. The distinctive high-energy gamma ray and neutrino fluxes produced through deep inelastic scattering provide powerful signatures for BBDM indirect detection, enabling constraints that significantly surpass those from traditional direct detection experiments. Notably, our results suggest that DM could be a new source of high-energy neutrinos from blazars, potentially offering an explanation for IceCube's observation of TXS 0506+056.</description>

      <title>Probing the Left-Right Symmetric Model from Displaced Shower at CMS Muon System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the potential collider discovery for the right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) in the minimal left-right symmetric model (LRSM). In this model, the RHNs can be either produced from the right-handed gauge boson $W_R^\pm$, or the scalar triplet $\Delta$ decays. The RHNs can subsequently decay via the heavy $W_R^\pm$, making them potentially long-lived. In looking for such long-lived RHNs, a search for displaced shower at CMS muon system is reinterpreted for either the processes, $pp \rightarrow W_R^\pm \rightarrow \ell^\pm N$ or $pp \rightarrow \Delta \rightarrow N N$. From the former process, we exclude $M_{W_R} \lesssim 3.6$ TeV using current CMS data, or $\lesssim 8.0$ TeV at the future HL-LHC. For the $pp \rightarrow \Delta \rightarrow N N$ process, HL-LHC is able to probe much larger parameter space as long as the proper decay length of the RHNs, 0.01 m $ \lesssim L_0 \lesssim$ 1 m. This implies that the displaced shower searches are able to explore the parameter space of the LRSM which have not been excluded yet.</description>

      <title>Characterizing CJPL's Site-Specific Neutrino Floor as the Neutrino Fog Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutrino floor, a theoretical sensitivity limit for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) in direct dark matter (DM) detection experiments, is redefined as the boundary of a dynamic ``neutrino fog", where neutrino signals become inevitable, obscuring DM detection due to the statistical and systematic uncertainties. This study provides the first site-specific analysis of the neutrino floor at China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL), leveraging its unique geographic and environmental characteristics. We quantify how CJPL's suppressed atmospheric neutrino flux (around 30\% lower than LNGS) reshapes the neutrino floor, thereby enabling improved sensitivity to high-mass WIMPs ($m_{\rm DM}&gt;10 \rm GeV$). Using a gradient-based framework, we derive CJPL's neutrino floor and estimate the detection prospects for the PandaX-xT experiment. Our results demonstrate that a 500 tonne-year exposure with PandaX-xT could touch the floor, probing cross-sections down to $\sigma_{\chi N}\sim 3\times 10^{-49} \rm cm^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the increasing precision of experimental measurements and the growing need for equally precise theoretical predictions, we provide in this paper an analytic calculation of the Higgs boson to gluons decay width up to next-to-leading order in quantum chromodynamics, i.e., order $\alpha_s^3$ with $\alpha_s$ being the strong coupling, including full dependence on the bottom quark mass. Our results improve the theoretical understanding of this process, such as the logarithms in the small bottom quark mass limit, and provide an accurate prediction for the decay width that can be compared with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Topological amplitudes of bottom baryon decays in the $SU(3)_F$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the first observation of $CP$ violation in baryon decays, we study the topological amplitudes of bottom baryon decays in the $SU(3)_F$ limit. The topological diagrams of charmless two-body decays of bottom baryons are presented in detail. The linear relations between topologies and $SU(3)$ irreducible amplitudes are derived through tensor contraction and $SU(3)$ decomposition. It is found that there are thirteen independent amplitudes that contribute to charmless two-body decays of bottom baryons in the $SU(3)_F$ limit, and four amplitudes among them are critical in the $CP$ asymmetries.</description>

      <title>stanhf: HistFactory models in the probabilistic programming language Stan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In collider physics, experiments are often based on counting the numbers of events in bins of a histogram. We present a new way to build and analyze statistical models that describe these experiments, based on the probabilistic programming language Stan and the HistFactory specification. A command-line tool transpiles HistFactory models into Stan code and data files. Because Stan is an imperative language, it enables richer and more detailed modeling, as modeling choices defined in the HistFactory declarative specification can be tweaked and adapted in the Stan language. Stan was constructed with automatic differentiation, allowing modern computational algorithms for sampling and optimization.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang zeros in heavy-quark QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the distribution of Lee-Yang zeros around the critical point that appears in the heavy-quark region of QCD at nonzero temperature in lattice numerical simulations. With the aid of the hopping-parameter expansion that is well justified around the critical point in our setting, our numerical analysis is capable of analyzing the partition function for complex parameters with high accuracy. This enables precise analyses of the Lee-Yang zeros around the critical point. We study their finite-size scaling around the critical point. We also propose new methods to utilize the scaling behavior of the Lee-Yang zeros for fixing the location of the critical point.</description>

      <title>Conformal Phase Transition in Supersymmetric QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional supersymmetric QCD in conformal window with a marginally relevant deformation which triggers the spontaneous breaking of (approximate) scale invariance and the subsequent confinement, generating a mass gap, at an energy scale hierarchically smaller than the Planck scale without fine-tuning. We analyze the finite temperature system and show that the phase transition associated with the breaking of conformal invariance is of the strong first order. When such a phase transition takes place at a temperature of the Universe around the electroweak scale, it generates a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background probed by future space-based interferometers, while a conformal phase transition in a dark sector at $\mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV generates GWs to explain the reported pulsar timing array signal.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of heavy quarks by elastic and radiative scatterings in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our investigation of heavy quark transport coefficients in the effective dynamical quasiparticle model (DQPM) -- which reproduces nonperturbative QCD phenomena in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) according to lattice QCD data -- by including inelastic $2 \to 3$ processes with massive gluon radiation, in addition to elastic $2 \to 2$ parton scattering. Both elastic and inelastic reactions are evaluated at leading order using DQPM-based effective propagators and vertices, accounting for all channels and their interferences. Based on the obtained matrix elements, we calculate various observables connected to a charm quark. First, we calculate the total cross section of a charm quark with the medium partons as functions of temperature and collision energy. Second, we obtain the drag $\mathcal{A}$ coefficient and $\hat{q}$ coefficient of a charm quark as functions of temperature and momentum and also compare our results with those obtained using the Zakharov model for the momentum-dependent strong coupling for the elastic and radiative vertices with a heavy quark, highlighting the importance of the choice of the strong coupling in the determination of transport coefficients. Third, we calculate the spatial diffusion coefficient of a charm quark and compare our results with those obtained using other approaches. Finally, we explore the mass dependence of the diffusion coefficient by comparing the results for charm quark, bottom quark, and infinitely-heavy quark. We found that inelastic processes can play a significant role in the determination of the transport coefficients at large transverse momenta, but are strongly suppressed at low transverse momenta.</description>

      <title>Prompt inclusive production of $J/\psi$, $\psi'$ and $\chi_{c}$ mesons at $\sqrt{s}$ $=$ $68.5$ $GeV$ energy within NRQCD $k_t$-factorization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss prompt production of $J/\psi$ mesons in proton-proton collisions at the $\sqrt{s}$ $=$ $68.5$ $GeV$ energy within NRQCD $k_t$-factorization approach using different unintegrated gluon distributions functions (UGDFs). We include both direct color-singlet production ($g g \to J/\psi g$) as well as a feed-down from $\chi_c \to J/\psi \gamma$ and $\psi' \to J/\psi X$ decays. The production of the decaying mesons $\chi_c$ or $\psi'$ is also calculated within NRQCD $k_t$-factorization approach. Differential distributions in rapidity and transverse momentum of $J/\psi$ are calculated and compared with experimental data of the LHCb collaborations. The LHCb fixed target data allow to test UGDFs in a new range of $x$.</description>

      <title>Explaining Belle Data on $B\to K^{(*)}\nu\bar{\nu}$ Decays via Dark Photon Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Belle II collaboration reported the first measurement on ${\rm Br}(B^+\rightarrow K^+\nu\bar{\nu})$, which lies 2.7$\sigma$ away from the Standard Model expectation. This result may be manifestation of new physics beyond the Standard Model. In present work, motivated by the Belle II measurement, we investigate the effect of a dark photon on the rare B meson decay $B^+\rightarrow K^+\nu\bar{\nu}$ and show that the ${\rm Br}(B^+\rightarrow K^+\nu\bar{\nu})$ excess from Belle II over SM expectation explained by the appearance of the dark photon especially in resonances. We also derive constraints on various parameters of the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model extended with a dark abelian gauge group, in the light of measurement of the ${\rm Br}(B^+\rightarrow K^+\nu\bar{\nu})$ by the Belle-II collaboration as well as the upper bound on ${\rm Br}(B^0\rightarrow K^{*0}\nu\bar{\nu})$ decay, set by the Belle data. Our results indicate that there exist common region where both experimental results for a dark photon mass around 4.5 GeV with suitable values of the other parameters.</description>

      <title>Heavy-quark corner of the Columbia plot from the center-symmetric Curci-Ferrari model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the heavy-quark corner of the Columbia plot using the gluon potential derived from the Curci-Ferrari extension of the Faddeev-Popov gauge fixing in the center-symmetric Landau gauge, as a proxy for the Polyakov loop potential. In line with the observation that Landau gauge couplings are not that large in the case of heavy-quark QCD, we consider a one-loop approximation and test its consistency by using various renormalization schemes while investigating the dependence of our results on the renormalization scale. We find that the main qualitative features of the phase structure in the heavy-quark regime are reproduced. Our results agree quantitatively with those of simulations to $10\%$ accuracy, which is the expected precision of the one-loop calculations in applications of the Curci-Ferrari model to Yang-Mills or heavy-quark QCD theories.</description>

      <title>Colour structure of next-to-eikonal Cwebs at three loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlators of Wilson-line, which capture eikonal contributions, are known to exponentiate in non-abelian gauge theories, and their logarithms can be organised in terms of collections of Feynman diagrams called webs. In~\cite{Agarwal:2020nyc} the concept of correlator web (Cweb), which is a set of skeleton diagrams built with connected gluon correlators and provides a generalisation of webs was introduced. The part of next-to-eikonal contributions to the scattering amplitude which exponentiates is given in terms of next-to-eikonal Cwebs~\cite{Gardi:2010rn,Laenen:2008gt}. In the present article we study next-to-eikonal Cwebs at three loop order, the order at which non trivial Cweb mixing matrices appear for the first time. The methods developed in~\cite{Agarwal:2022wyk} to construct mixing matrices directly without use of replica trick are used in this article to obtain the mixing matrices for next-to-eikonal Cwebs after we establish a relationship between next-to-eikonal and eikonal Cwebs.</description>

      <title>Leptoquark-mediated Dirac neutrino mass and its impact on $B \to K \nu \bar{\nu}$ and $K \to \pi \nu \bar{\nu}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Right-handed neutrinos $\nu_R$ play a crucial role in flavor-changing neutral-current processes with missing energy, such as $b\to s + \slashed{E} $ and $d\to s + \slashed{E} $, where Belle-II reports unexpectedly large branching fraction in $B\to K \nu \bar\nu$ decays. Assuming $\nu_R$ is the partner of the active neutrino $\nu_L$ in the standard model, a Dirac-type neutrino framework emerges. We investigate a scenario of radiative Dirac neutrino mass generation in a scalar leptoquark (LQ) model with a global $U(1)_X$ symmetry to suppress Majorana mass, tree-level Dirac mass, and diquark couplings. The simplest LQ realization consists of two $S_1 = (3,1,-1/3)$ LQs with distinct $U(1)_X$ charges. A non-Casas-Ibarra parametrization is proposed to match neutrino data with fewer model parameters. Imposing current experimental constraints from meson mixing and lepton flavor-violating processes, we find that right-handed neutrino effects can significantly enhance $B\to K^{(*)} \nu\bar{\nu}$ and $K^+\to \pi^+ \nu\bar{\nu}$. Additionally, the model predicts excesses in $R_D$ from $B\to D\tau\bar{\nu}$ that remain within $1\sigma$ of current experimental data.</description>

      <title>Studying the $K\Lambda$ strong interaction with femtoscopic correlation functions and the $N^*(1535)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $K \Lambda$ strong interaction dynamics around the energy region of $N^*(1535)$ resonance through femtoscopic correlation functions within the Koonin-Pratt formalism, where coupled-channel effects of $\pi N$, $K\Lambda$, $K \Sigma$ and $\eta N$ channels are taken into account, by means of which the $N^*(1535)$ resonance can be dynamically generated in the chiral unitary approach. Two-body scattering amplitudes are calculated using the chiral unitary approach, and the corresponding wave functions and correlation functions are obtained. Our analysis shows that the $\pi N$ channel becomes important to the $K^+\Lambda$ correlation function through coupled channel effects, even if its mass threshold is far from the energy region of the $N^*(1535)$. Furthermore, with the picture that the $N^*(1535)$ is a dynamically generated state, we can get a good reproduction of the experimental data on the $K^+\Lambda$ correlation function. This work establishes femtoscopic correlation functions as a sensitive probe for coupled-channel dynamics and validates the Koonin-Pratt framework in multi-channel hadronic systems, offering critical insights into some exotic hadron states and strong interaction mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Origin of the KM3-230213A event and associated Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel cosmological scenario to explain the exceptional KM3-230213A neutrino event reported at an energy scale of $\mathcal{O}(100)$~PeV by the KM3NeT collaboration, along with its associated gravitational wave (GW) signatures. In our framework, ultra high energy neutrinos originate from the decay of a super-heavy sterile neutrino produced via the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early Universe. Employing an ultraviolet complete type-I seesaw model, we demonstrate that while two sterile neutrinos are responsible for light neutrino masses as required by oscillation data, one sterile neutrino can have an exceedingly feeble coupling, allowing its lifetime to be tuned so that its decay yields a neutrino flux consistent with the observed event. Furthermore, our scenario predicts two distinct GW signatures: one arising from gravitons emitted during PBH evaporation and another from the Bremsstrahlung process during the decay of the sterile neutrino. These complementary signals provide a multi-messenger probe of the underlying physics. Our results thus offer a compelling explanation for the KM3-230213A event and open new avenues for investigating the interplay between high-energy neutrino astronomy and gravitational wave cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an overview of recent developments in the computation of the anomalous dimension matrix of composite operators in non-forward kinematics. The elements of this matrix set the evolution of non-perturbative parton distributions such as the generalized parton distribution functions. The latter provide important information about hadronic structure and are accessible experimentally in hard exclusive scattering processes. We focus our discussion on a recent method that exploits consistency relations for the anomalous dimensions which follow from the renormalization structure of quark and gluon operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mirror matter from the dark hidden sector with the same particle content and gauge interactions as in the standard model is still an interesting candidate for dark matter. Several experiments on search for positronium and neutron oscillations into their mirror partner have been conducted recently. In this work we consider the transitions $K^0-K^0_m$ of a neutral kaon into a hidden mirror kaon. It is shown that their probability can be probed with the sensitivity of $P(K^0-K^0_m )\lesssim 10^{-7}$ from the search for missing-energy events in the NA64 experiment at the CERN SPS with $\sim 10^{11}$ $K^+$ on target.</description>

      <title>Bottomonium suppression in pNRQCD and open quantum system approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing the potential non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (pNRQCD) effective field theory within an open quantum system framework, we derive a Lindblad equation governing the evolution of the heavy-quarkonium reduced density matrix, accurate to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the ratio of the state's binding energy to the medium's temperature [1]. The derived NLO Lindblad equation provides a more reliable description of heavy-quarkonium evolution in the quark-gluon plasma at low temperatures compared to the leading-order truncation. For phenomenological applications, we numerically solve this equation using the quantum trajectories algorithm. By averaging over Monte Carlo-sampled quantum jumps, we obtain solutions without truncation in the angular momentum quantum number of the considered states. Our analysis highlights the importance of quantum jumps in the nonequilibrium evolution of bottomonium states within the quark-gluon plasma [2]. Additionally, we demonstrate that the quantum regeneration of singlet states from octet configurations is essential to explain experimental observations of bottomonium suppression. The heavy-quarkonium transport coefficients used in our study align with recent lattice QCD determinations.</description>

      <title>Spin Polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons from Dissipative Spin Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for spin dynamics in the quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Under the approximation of small polarization, macroscopic spin degrees of freedom decouple from the background, and their evolution equations and transport coefficients have been computed using quantum kinetic theory of massive particles with non-local collisions. Employing this theory, we numerically solve dissipative relativistic spin hydrodynamics for the first time. We explore three interaction scenarios between constituent particles and apply this framework to compute both global and local spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. Our results show that the initially vanishing spin potential relaxes toward thermal vorticity, driving global polarization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the sign of longitudinal polarization is sensitive to the interaction type, emphasizing the need for a consistent treatment of dissipative effects in spin hydrodynamics to describe experimental data.</description>

      <title>Towards a Quantum Information Theory of Hadronization: Dihadron Fragmentation and Neutral Polarization in Heavy Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pioneer the application of quantum information theory to experimentally distinguish between classes of hadronization models. We adapt the CHSH inequality to the fragmentation of a single parton to hadron pairs, a violation of which would rule out classical dynamics of hadronization altogether. Furthermore, we apply and extend the theory of quantum contextuality and local quantum systems to the neutral polarization of a single spin-1 hadronic system, namely the light constituents of excited Sigma baryons $\Sigma^{*}_{c,b}$ formed in the fragmentation of heavy quarks.</description>

      <title>Precision Tests in $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ ($\ell=e,\mu$) at FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare semi-leptonic decays $B\to K^\ast \ell^+\ell^-$, with $\ell=e, \mu$, are highly sensitive to new physics (NP) due to their suppression in the Standard Model (SM). Current LHCb measurements in the muon channel exhibit a significant tension with state-of-the-art SM theory predictions. The proposed tera-$Z$ run at FCC-ee provides a unique opportunity to untangle the origin of this tension by producing a very large sample of $B$-mesons in a clean $e^+e^-$ environment. We explore the expected precision of $B\to K^\ast \ell^+\ell^-$ ($\ell=e, \mu$) measurements at FCC-ee, complementing existing studies with $\tau^+\tau^-$ in the final state, and compare with HL-LHC projections. For the case of muons in the final state, we show that HL-LHC and FCC-ee are expected to deliver a similar number of events, while the latter performs much better in the case of final state electrons. Regardless of the lepton flavour, we expect the FCC-ee environment to be much cleaner than at HL-LHC, with subleading systematics. We also find that a significant reduction in theory uncertainties on the SM predictions is required to capitalize on the advantage going from HL-LHC to FCC-ee. We demonstrate the power of such measurements at FCC-ee to extract information on the long-distance contribution to these decays, and to reveal evidence for new physics even if no deviations are seen in electroweak precision tests.</description>

      <title>Rotational Metric: A Solution to Einstein's Clock-Rate Problem and Its Magnetospheric Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rotational metric offers an exact solution to Einstein's clock-rate problem in curved spacetime regarding whether time flows more slowly at the equator of a compact object like a neutron star than at its poles. Similar to what Einstein had done for a uniformly rotating disk, the metric can be obtained directly from the Schwarzschild metric through rotational transformations. In accordance with the equivalence of inertia and gravity, the rotational metric exhibits more complex geometric structures due to the effects of inertia-gravity arising from rotation. For instance, it has an extra ergosphere compared to the original Schwarzschild metric. The presence of the ergosphere could serve as a compelling example that illustrates how the rotational transformations can introduce new structures into a gravitational system. Exactly, there are additional physical degrees of freedom, carried by the rotational transformations, that are 'eaten' by the gravitational system to form an extra ergosphere inside the system itself, which is in analogy to the Higgs mechanism in particle physics. In this process, the rotational transformations play a role of 'symmetry breaking'. Besides, the rotational metric can describe the gravitational system that rigidly corotates with a spinning mass. It has potential applications in describing the rotationally-induced gravitational effects within various rotating magnetospheres and relevant astronomical phenomena. The understanding of the rotational metric is therefore expected to bring novel insights into general relativity and high-energy astrophysics.</description>

      <title>On Measuring Stimulated Photon-photon Scattering using Multiple Ultraintense Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stimulated photon-photon scattering is a predicted consequence of quantum electrodynamics that has yet to be measured directly. Measuring the cross-section for stimulated photon-photon scattering is the aim of a flagship experiment for NSF OPAL, a proposed laser user facility with two, 25-PW beamlines. We present optimized experimental designs for achieving this challenging and canonical measurement. A family of experimental geometries is identified that satisfies the momentum- and energy-matching conditions for two selected laser frequency options. Numerical models predict a maximum signal exceeding 1000 scattered photons per shot at the experimental conditions envisaged at NSF OPAL. Experimental requirements on collision geometry, polarization, cotiming and copointing, background suppression, and diagnostic technologies are investigated numerically. These results confirm that a beam cotiming shorter than the pulse duration and control of the copointing on a scale smaller than the shortest laser wavelength are needed to robustly scatter photons on a per-shot basis. Finally, we assess the bounds that a successful execution of this experiment may place on the mass scale of Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics beyond the Standard Model of physics.</description>

      <title>Wave Interference in Self-Interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) scenario, the dark matter is composed of an ultra-light scalar field with coherence length and wave interference on astrophysical scales. Scalar fields generically have quartic self-interactions that modify their dispersion relation and the associated evolution of density perturbations. We perform the first dedicated analysis of the role of wave interference on this evolution due to self-interactions in FDM and vice versa, developing a perturbative treatment applicable at early times and then comparing against a suite of fully nonlinear benchmark simulations, varying the dark matter density, interaction strength, and fiducial momentum scale. We explicitly simulate the limit where this momentum scale is relatively high compared with the scale of the simulation volume, applicable to cases where the dark matter is initially ``warm" due to causal constraints on a post-inflationary production or in virialized halos and other ``thermalized" cases with initially cold production. We find that in such scenarios, density perturbations are unable to grow on the expected self interaction time scale because of interference effects, instead saturating on the much shorter de Broglie crossing time, with a dependence on the sign of the interaction. Finally, we comment on the implications of our results for astrophysical systems such as high-density ultra-faint dwarf galaxies where wave interference plays an important role.</description>

      <title>Conformal Collider Physics at Large Charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study energy correlators and other event shapes in states created by operators with large global $U(1)$ charge $Q$ in Conformal Field Theories. Focusing on theories whose large charge sector is described by the superfluid Effective Field Theory (EFT), we develop a systematic framework to compute event shapes within the EFT. As formerly observed, event shapes at leading order in $1/Q$ factorize into a product of classical expectation values determined by symmetry. In contrast, the subleading contribution to energy-energy and charge-charge correlators is a nontrivial prediction of the EFT, which we compute explicitly. Our results reveal a sharp collinear enhancement of the correlation between detectors, induced by the propagation of sound. We also generalize our findings to a broad class of event shapes.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Bogoliubov vs Boltzmann approaches in gravitational production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral behavior of scalar fluctuations generated by gravity during inflation and the subsequent reheating phase. We consider a non-perturbative Bogoliubov treatment within the context of pure gravitational reheating. We compute both long and short-wavelength spectra, first for a massless scalar field, revealing that the spectral index in part of the infrared (IR) regime varies between $-6$ and $-3$, depending on the post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $0\leq w_\phi\leq1$. Furthermore, we study the mass-breaking effect of the IR spectrum by including finite mass, $m_{\chi}$, of the daughter scalar field. We show that for $m_{\chi}/H_{\rm e} \gtrsim 3/2$, where $H_{\rm e}$ is the Hubble parameter during inflation, the IR spectrum of scalar fluctuations experiences exponential mass suppression, while for smaller masses, $m_{\chi}/\He&lt;3/2$, the spectrum remains flat in the IR regime regardless of the post-inflationary EoS. For any general EoS, we also compute a specific IR scale, $k_m$, of fluctuations below which the IR spectrum will suffer from this finite mass effect. In the UV regime, oscillations of the inflaton background lead to interference terms that explain the high-frequency oscillations in the spectrum. Interestingly, we find that for any EoS, $1/9 \lesssim w_\phi \lesssim 1$, the spectral behavior turns out to be independent of the EoS, with a spectral index $ -6$. We have compared this Bogoliubov treatment for the UV regime to perturbative computations with solutions to the Boltzmann equation and found an agreement between the two approaches for any EoS, $0 \lesssim w_\phi \lesssim 1$. We also explore the relationship between the gravitational reheating temperature and the reheating EoS employing the non-perturbative analytic approach, finding that reheating can occur for $w_\phi \gtrsim 0.6$.</description>

      <title>Singularities in Cosmological Loop Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we perform a systematic study of the singularity structure of inflationary correlations at 1-loop. We explicitly compute a few diagrams and find a pattern emerging in the singularities produced. Motivated by this, we derive diagrammatic rules to extract the singularities of any two-site 1-loop diagram. Using these rules, the poles and branch cuts produced can be predicted by simply identifying the energies flowing through certain subgraphs, without having to perform complicated integrals. We demonstrate how these rules follow by analyzing the general structure of the time and momentum integrals of the correlators. An interesting feature of de-Sitter correlators at 1-loop is the presence of an off-shell total energy branch point, which is present in dimensional regularization as well as cutoff regularization. We probe the source of this branch cut in detail, while revisiting the cosmological KLN theorem (arXiv:2308.00680) in this context. Finally, we show that the branch cuts produced in a renormalised correlator always repackage themselves in a dilatation invariant form to produce logarithms of ratios of comoving scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the multi-collinear behavior of tree amplitudes in the six-dimensional N = (1,1) super Yang-Mills theory (sYM). A generalized dimensional reduction of the latter yields the four-dimensional N = 4 sYM on the Coulomb branch, which is of interest for considerations of massive or off-shell scattering. To this end, we revisit the calculation of tree scattering in the former theory employing the collinear bootstrap and known massless limits. Assuming the universality of the double-collinear asymptotics, the result for six-leg superamplitudes differs from the one available in the literature. We further extract the triple-collinear splitting superamplitudes from these.</description>

Abstract: The effort to speed up the Madgraph5_aMC@NLO generator by exploiting CPU vectorization and GPUs, which started at the beginning of 2020, has delivered the first production release of the code for leading-order (LO) processes in October 2024. To achieve this goal, many new features, tests and fixes have been implemented in recent months. This process benefitted also from the early feedback of the CMS experiment. In this contribution, we report on these activities and on the status of the LO software at the time of CHEP2024.</description>

      <title>Exploring sub-GeV Dark Matter Physics with Cosmic Ray and Future Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If sub-GeV Dark matter(DM) annihilates to the charged particles such as $e^+ e^-$, $\mu^+ \mu^-$, or $\pi^+ \pi^-$, it generates an additional source of electrons and positrons in the cosmic ray (CR) population within our Milky Way. During propagation, these secondary electrons and positrons undergo reacceleration processes, boosting their energies to the GeV scale. Observatories like AMS-02 can detect these high-energy particles, enabling constraints on the properties of sub-GeV DM. By analyzing AMS-02 electron and positron data, the 95\% upper limits on the DM annihilation cross-section have been established in the range of $10^{-28}$ to $10^{-27}$ cm$^3\,$s$^{-1}$, corresponding to DM masses ranging from 100 MeV to 1 GeV. Meanwhile, MeV telescopes will provide complementary constraints on DM properties by detecting photon emissions from such annihilation processes. Notably, the sensitivity of future MeV gamma-ray observatories is projected to approach or match the constraints derived from CR data.</description>

Additionally, the comment critiques the fundamental distinction between the kinetic freeze-out temperature and the critical temperature, as the authors erroneously treat them as identical in their article. The authors also assert that the critical temperature is system dependent which contradicts established lattice QCD calculations. Furthermore, there are flaws in their handling of data uncertainties, which could significantly affect the quality of the fit. Furthermore, they misrepresent AMPT-simulated data as experimental data, which undermines the validity of their analysis. Flaws in their handling of data uncertainties also cast doubt on the robustness of their fits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss properties of thermal Quantum Chromodynamics obtained by means of lattice simulations with overlap fermions. This fermion discretisation preserves chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing. We present details of the formulation and results for the chiral observables. We determine the topological susceptibility from simulations at fixed global topological charge based on the slab method. Using the measured values of the topological susceptibility we sum the chiral observables over all topological sectors. The volume dependence of the chiral susceptibility is in agreement with the crossover nature of the thermal QCD phase transition. Additionally we discuss the spectrum of the overlap Dirac operator and its volume and temperature dependence. Presented results are obtained at the temporal lattice extent $N_t=8$.</description>

      <title>Casimir pressure with dissipation and quantum corrections from axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of the oscillating axion field present in our environment on the Casimir pressure between two metallic plates. We take into account the finite conductivity of the boundary plates and model the interactions between matter and photons in the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. This allows us to take into account dissipation in the quantum field description of this open quantum system and retrieve the Lifschitz results for the Casimir interaction between two metallic plates. We then compute the leading correction to the Lifschitz theory in inverse powers of the axion suppression scale and show that the Casimir pressure receives oscillating corrections depending on the product of the axion mass and the distance between the plates. This contribution is repulsive at large distance compared to the axion Compton wavelength as a consequence of the breaking of parity invariance by the axion dark matter background.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Multi-Horizon Solutions in Quartic Quasitopological Gravity: A Power-Maxwell Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive exact black hole solutions within the framework of fourth-order quasitopological gravity (4QTG) coupled to power-law Maxwell electrodynamics in five-dimensional spacetimes. We explore the thermodynamic properties of these solutions, including entropy, temperature, and electric potential, and verify the validity of the first law of thermodynamics. Our analysis spans asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS), de Sitter (dS), and flat spacetimes, revealing that thermal stability is exclusively achievable in asymptotically AdS black holes, while dS and flat solutions exhibit universal instability. The study highlights the unique role of higher-curvature terms in modifying black hole thermodynamics and horizon structures, providing new insights into the interplay between geometry, thermodynamics, and quantum gravity via the AdS/CFT correspondence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 4QTG supports multi-horizon black holes even in the absence of charge, a feature absent in Einstein gravity. These findings underscore the importance of higher-curvature corrections in resolving classical limitations of general relativity and offer new avenues for exploring quantum gravity and holographic duality.</description>

      <title>Learnable cut flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tasks in high energy physics, yet their opaque training process renders them as a black box. In contrast, the traditional cut flow method offers simplicity and interpretability but demands human effort to identify optimal boundaries. To merge the strengths of both approaches, we propose the Learnable Cut Flow (LCF), a neural network that transforms the traditional cut selection into a fully differentiable, data-driven process. LCF implements two cut strategies-parallel, where observable distributions are treated independently, and sequential, where prior cuts shape subsequent ones-to flexibly determine optimal boundaries. Building on this, we introduce the Learnable Importance, a metric that quantifies feature importance and adjusts their contributions to the loss accordingly, offering model-driven insights unlike ad-hoc metrics. To ensure differentiability, a modified loss function replaces hard cuts with mask operations, preserving data shape throughout the training process. LCF is tested on six varied mock datasets and a realistic diboson vs. QCD dataset. Results demonstrate that LCF (1) accurately learns cut boundaries across typical feature distributions in both parallel and sequential strategies, (2) assigns higher importance to discriminative features with minimal overlap, (3) handles redundant or correlated features robustly, and (4) performs effectively in real-world scenarios. In diboson dataset, LCF initially underperforms boosted decision trees and multiplayer perceptrons when using all observables. However, pruning less critical features-guided by learned importance-boosts its performance to match or exceed these baselines. LCF bridges the gap between traditional cut flow method and modern black-box neural networks, delivering actionable insights into the training process and feature importance.</description>

      <title>To CPL, or not to CPL? What we have not learned about the dark energy equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that using a Taylor expansion for the dark energy equation-of-state parameter and limiting it to the zeroth and first-order terms, i.e., the so-called Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, instead of allowing for higher-order terms and then marginalizing over them, adds extra information not present in the data and leads to markedly different and potentially misleading conclusions. Fixing the higher-order terms to zero, one concludes that vacuum energy that is currently non-dynamical (e.g., the cosmological constant) is excluded at several $\sigma$ significance as the explanation of cosmic acceleration, even in Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI) DR1 data. Meanwhile, instead marginalizing over the higher-order terms shows that we know neither the current dark energy equation of state nor its current rate of change well enough to make such a claim. This issue has become more prominent now with the recent release of high-quality Stage IV galaxy survey data. The results of analyses using simple Taylor expansions should be interpreted with great care.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric and continuous extraction of amplitudes in electroweak penguin decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to extract the decay-amplitudes in $B\to V(\to M_1M_2)\ell^+\ell^-$ processes, where $V$ represents a meson with either $J = 0$ (S-wave) or $J = 1$ (P-wave). This approach enables the decay-amplitudes across the dihadron and dilepton invariant-masses to be extracted from data in a model-independent and continuous way. To achieve this, the angular decay rate is expressed in a way that allows the application of the \sPlot technique to likelihood fits of the decay angles. We illustrate the abilities of this method on simulated $B^0\to K^+\pi^-\ell^+\ell^-$ data, containing both S- and P-wave contributions to the $K^+\pi^-$ system. We provide the weight functions and show that they allow the extraction of the absolute value of the P-wave and S-wave transversity amplitudes as a function of the dihadron and dimuon invariant-masses in a continuous, unbiased, and statistically-powerful way, while only relying on the angular distribution. As a consequence, the extracted amplitude shapes are model-independent -- up to the angular terms included in the fit -- and can be directly compared to theoretical predictions. A measurement using this technique can improve the sensitivity to potential new physics effects in $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ transitions, as well as the understanding of hadronic form factors, particularly in the S-wave system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the physics-informed renormalisation group (PIRG) for the construction of gauge invariant renormalisation group flows. The respective effective action is a sum of a gauge invariant quantum part and the classical gauge fixing part which arranges for invertibility of the gauge field two-point function. Thus, the BRST transformations simply accommodate the gauge consistency of the gauge fixing sector, while the quantum part of the effective action is gauge and BRST invariant. We apply this physics-informed approach to Yang-Mills theory and gravity and show how the flowing gauge fields arrange for full gauge invariance. We also embed the background field approximation to the functional renormalisation group (fRG) in an exact gauge invariant PIRG flow. This allows us to discuss the dynamics of the correction terms, and the non-trivial ultraviolet or infrared relevant terms are elucidated within a one-loop approximation. The background field approximation of the latter is known for violating one-loop universality for specific regulators and we show how the present setup reinstates universality in a constructive way. Finally, we discuss the landscape of fRG flows in gauge theories through the lens of the novel PIRG approach as well as potential applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Higgs-gluon interaction is crucial for LHC phenomenology. To improve the constraints on the CP structure of this coupling, we investigate Higgs production with two jets using machine learning. In particular, we exploit the CP sensitivity of the so far neglected phase space region that differs from the typical vector boson fusion-like kinematics. Our results indicate that further improvements in the current experimental limits could be achievable using our techniques. We also discuss the most relevant observables and how CP violation in the Higgs-gluon interaction can be disentangled from CP violation in the interaction between the Higgs boson and massive vector bosons. Assuming the absence of CP-violating Higgs interactions with coloured beyond-the-Standard-Model states, our projected limits on a CP-violating top-Yukawa coupling are competitive with more direct probes like top-associated Higgs production and limits from a global fit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When considering the renormalization of composite operators for the description of hard exclusive scattering processes, two types of operator basis called the derivative basis and the Gegenbauer basis are often used in the literature. In this work we set up the explicit similarity transformations between these two bases, both for quark and gluon operators. This way, one can use the properties of both bases to their advantage in the computation of the operator anomalous dimensions, which describe the scale dependence of non-perturbative non-forward parton distributions. We provide several applications of our framework. As an application of the gluon transformation formula, we compute the one-loop non-forward purely gluonic anomalous dimension matrix. For the rest of the applications we focus on the transformation formula of the quark operator. We derive the Gegenbauer anomalous dimensions, in the limit of a large number of quark flavors $n_f$, to all orders in the strong coupling $\alpha_s$, extending the computation previously performed in the derivative basis. Next a numeric calculation of the two-loop anomalous dimensions in the derivative basis beyond the leading-color limit is presented. Finally, we discuss a novel way of validating existing computations of the conformal anomaly based on the leading-color anomalous dimensions in the derivative basis.</description>

Abstract: We present a next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) global QCD analysis of the proton's helicity parton distribution functions (PDFs), the first of its kind. To obtain the distributions, we use data for longitudinal spin asymmetries in inclusive and semi-inclusive lepton-nucleon scattering as well as in weak-boson and hadron or jet production in proton-proton scattering. We analyze the data using QCD perturbation theory at NNLO accuracy, employing approximations provided by the threshold resummation formalism in cases where full NNLO results for partonic hard-scattering functions are not readily available. Our numerical results suggest a remarkable perturbative stability of the extracted helicity PDFs.</description>

Abstract: We present quantitative results for masses and the internal structure of four-quark states with two heavy quarks, i.e. $QQ'\bar{q}\bar{q}'$ with $Q,Q'\in \{c,b\}$ and $q,q' \in \{u,d,s\}$, and $J^{P} \in {1^+}$. The composition of these states in terms of meson-meson and diquark-antidiquark pairs, extracted from a relativistic four-body Faddeev-Yakubowski equation, is dynamically determined from underlying QCD forces. We find states at energy levels in very good agreement with lattice QCD and, where available, with experimental states. Their internal structure, most notably between the $T^+_{cc}$, $T_{bc}$ and $T^-_{bb}$, show significant and sizeable variations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as powerful observables for probing the fragmentation dynamics of high-energy collisions. We introduce the first numerical strategy for calculating energy correlators using the Hamiltonian lattice approach, providing access to the intriguing nonperturbative dynamics of these observables. Furthermore, motivated by rapid advances in quantum computing hardware and algorithms, we propose a quantum algorithm for calculating energy correlators in quantum field theories. This algorithm includes ground state preparation, the application of source, sink, energy flux and real-time evolution operators, and the Hadamard test. We validate our approach by applying it to the SU(2) pure gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on $3\times 3$ and $5\times 5$ honeycomb lattices with $j_{\rm max} = \frac{1}{2}$ at various couplings, utilizing both classical methods and the quantum algorithm, the latter tested using the IBM emulator for specific configurations. The results are consistent with the expected behavior of the strong coupling regime and motivate a more comprehensive study to probe the confinement dynamics across the weak and strong coupling regimes.</description>

Abstract: The interference between amplitudes corresponding to different intermediate resonances plays an important role in generating large CP asymmetries in phase space in multi-body decays of bottom and charmed mesons. In this paper, we study the CP violation in the decay channel ${\overline{B}}^{0}\rightarrow K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{0}$ in phase space region where the intermediate resonances $\overline{K}^{*}(892)^{0}$ and ${\overline{K}^{*}_{0}(700)}$ dominate. The Forward-Backward Asymmetry (FBA) and the CP asymmetry induced by FBA (FB-CPA), which are closely related to the interference effects between the two aforementioned resonances, are especially investigated. The correlation of the behaviour of FBA and FB-CPA with the relative strong phase between the amplitude is analyzed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the isospin-breaking corrections relating the $e^+e^-$ hadronic cross-section and the tau decay spectral function, focusing on the di-pion channel, that gives the dominant contribution to the hadronic vacuum polarization piece of the muon $g-2$. We test different types of electromagnetic and weak form factors and show that both, the Gounaris-Sakurai and a dispersive-based approach, describe accurately $\tau$ lepton and $e^+e^-$ data (less when KLOE measurements are included in the fits) and comply reasonably well with analyticity constraints. From these results we obtain the isospin-breaking contribution to the conserved vector current (CVC) prediction of the ${\rm BR}(\tau \to \pi\pi\nu_{\tau})$ and to the $2\pi$ hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the muon $g-2$, in agreement with previous determinations and with similar precision. Our results abound in the convenience of using tau data-based results in the updated data-driven prediction of the muon $g-2$ in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>NNLO phase-space integrals for semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the phase-space integrals that arise in double real emission diagrams for semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD. Utilizing the reverse unitarity technique, we convert these integrals into loop integrals, allowing us to employ integration-by-parts identities and reduce them to a set of master integrals. The master integrals are then solved using the method of differential equations and expressed in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms. By examining the series expansion in the dimensional regulator, we discover additional relations among some of the master integrals. As an alternative approach, we solve the master integrals by decomposing them into angular and radial components. The angular parts are evaluated using Mellin-Barnes representation, while special attention is given to the singular structures of the radial integrals to handle them accurately. Here the results are provided in terms of one-fold integrals over classical polylogarithms. This approach provides a clearer understanding of the origin of soft and collinear singularities.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Bayesian Exploration of Froggatt-Nielsen Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism successfully explains the hierarchical structure of fermion Yukawa couplings by introducing a U(1) flavor symmetry with distinct charge assignments for different fermion generations. While some FN charge assignments have been proposed, their evaluation has largely relied on heuristic approaches. This paper systematically investigates viable FN charge assignments within the Standard Model, including both the quark and lepton sectors, using Bayesian statistical analysis. The study explores scenarios involving both the seesaw mechanism and dimension-five operators for neutrino mass generation. A comprehensive parameter scan over FN charges reveals a wide range of charge assignments consistent with observed fermion masses and mixing angles. Interestingly, negative FN charges and significant generational differences in charges are found to be viable, contrary to conventional assumptions. The analysis also compares the seesaw mechanism and dimension-five operator scenarios, finding no strong preference between them for optimal charge assignments. Furthermore, predictions for the lightest neutrino mass and effective Majorana mass relevant for neutrinoless double-beta decay are presented, highlighting regions of parameter space accessible to upcoming experiments. Finally, implications for nucleon decay are studied, demonstrating that different FN charge assignments predict significantly different nucleon decay lifetimes and branching ratios, providing a potential experimental probe for FN models.</description>

      <title>Precise measurement of CP violating $\tau$ EDM through $e^+ e^- \to \gamma^*, \psi(2s) \to \tau^+ \tau^-$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nonzero electric dipole moment of a tauon, $d_\tau$, signals CP violation and provides an important probe for new physics. We study methods to measure $d_\tau$ at low energy $e^+ e^-$ colliders through the processes $e^+e^- \to \gamma^*, \psi(2S) \to \tau^+\tau^-$ with $\tau^\pm$ decays into a charged hadron and a tau neutrino. We point out that, with measuring energies of the charged hadron, Im$(d_\tau)$ can be measured. On the other hand, selecting events of $\tau$ decays after traveling more than the detector resolution distance, Re$(d_\tau)$ can also be determined. We find that the precision at Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF) running at the center energy of $m_{\psi (2S)}$ for 10 year data accumulation, the precision of Im$(d_\tau)$ and Re$(d_\tau)$ are found to be 1.8 and 11 in unit of $ 10^{-18}~e\,\text{cm}$, respectively. The sensitivity for $d_\tau$ measurement precision at the STCF can be reached its optimum at a central energy of $6.3~\text{GeV}$, achieving a precision of $0.7$ for Im$(d_\tau)$ and $2.8$ for Re$(d_\tau)$ in unit of $ 10^{-18}~e\,\text{cm}$.</description>

      <title>Pion condensation versus 2SC, speed of sound, and charge neutrality effects in the quark-meson diquark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the two-flavor quark-meson diquark model as a low-energy model for QCD at non-zero quark and isospin chemical potentials $\mu$ and $\mu_I$, and at zero temperature. We map out the phase diagram in the $\mu$-$\mu_I$ plane, which has four phases: a vacuum phase, a phase with condensed charged pions/Cooper pairs of $u$ and $\bar{d}$ quarks, a normal quark matter phase, and a color superconducting phase (2SC phase). %In the 2SC phase, we study the effects of imposing color and %electric charge neutrality. The global symmetry breaking $SU(3)_c\rightarrow SU(2)_c$ in the 2SC phase gives rise to a number of Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We classify them and briefly discuss their properties. We calculate the speed of sound $c_s$ in the two special cases, finite $\mu_I$ and $\mu=0$, and finite $\mu$ and $\mu_I=0$. In both cases, the speed of sound exhibits a maximum and approaches the conformal limit from above as the density increases. For non-zero isospin $\mu_I$, this behavior is in agreement with the speed of sound obtained from lattice simulations. In the 2SC phase, the behavior is qualitatively the same if we impose local charge neutrality. Finally, we discuss the possibility of having a mixed phase of negatively charged normal quark matter and positively charged 2SC matter with global color charge neutrality imposed on the latter.</description>

      <title>The Higgs Self-Coupling at FCC-ee</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single Higgs production at FCC-ee probes the Higgs self-coupling at next-to-leading order (NLO). Extracting a bound requires a global analysis accounting for other possible new physics contributions up to NLO. We determine the FCC-ee sensitivity to Higgs self-coupling modifications $\delta\kappa_\lambda$ within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework, including for the first time flavour, LEP, LHC, and FCC-ee observables in a global analysis with all leading NLO effects via one-loop renormalisation group evolution, as well as incorporating finite NLO contributions to electroweak precision and $ZH$ observables. The global sensitivity to $\delta\kappa_\lambda$ is estimated by marginalising over the effects of all other operators, bringing flavour considerations to the fore. We find that, under reasonable assumptions, FCC-ee sensitivity to $\delta\kappa_\lambda$ can exceed that of the HL-LHC.</description>

Abstract: This article summarizes the main ideas behind creating an open database proposed for use in the exploration of generalized parton distributions (GPDs). This lightweight database is well suited for GPD phenomenology and is designed to store both experimental and lattice-QCD data. It can also aid in benchmarking GPD-related developments, such as GPD models. The database utilizes a new data format based on the YAML serialization language, enabling the storage of essential information for modern analyses, such as replica values. It includes interfaces for both Python and C++, allowing straightforward integration with analysis codes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational $p \to \Delta^+ $ transition form factors in chiral perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proton to $\Delta^+$ resonance transitional gravitational form factors are calculated to leading one-loop order using chiral perturbation theory in our recent work [1]. We take into account the leading electromagnetic and strong isospin-violating effects to obtain non-vanishing contributions. The loop contributions to the transition form factors are found to be free of power-counting violating pieces, which is consistent with the absence of tree-level diagrams at the considered order. Our results involve no free parameters and can be regarded as predictions of chiral perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Revised bounds on local cosmic strings from NANOGrav observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, the NANOGrav collaboration studied new physics explanations of the observed pulsar timing residuals consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), including cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto (NG) approximation. Analysing one of current models for the loop distribution, it was found that the cosmic string model is disfavored compared to other sources, for example, super massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). When both SMBHB and cosmic string models are included in the analysis, an upper bound on a string tension $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-10}$ was derived. However, the analysis did not accommodate results from cosmic string simulations in an underlying field theory, which indicate that at most a small fraction of string loops survive long enough to emit GW. Following and extending our previous study, we suppose that a fraction $f_{\rm NG}$ of string loops follow NG dynamics and emit only GWs, and study the three different models of the loop distribution discussed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration analyses. We re-analyze the NANOGrav 15yrs data with our signal models by using the NANOGrav $\texttt{ENTERPRISE}$ analysis code via the wrapper $\texttt{PTArcade}$. We find that loop distributions similar to LVK Model B and C yield higher Bayes factor than Model A analyzed in the NANOGrav paper, as they can more easily accommodate a blue-tilted spectrum of the observed amplitude. Furthermore, because of the degeneracy of $G\mu$ and $f_{\rm NG}$ in determining the signal amplitude, our posterior distribution extends to higher values of $G\mu$, and in some cases the uppermost value of credible intervals is close to the Cosmic Microwave Background limit $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-7}$. Hence, in addition to the pulsar timing array data, further information about the fraction of long-lived loops in a cosmic string network is required to constrain the string tension.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos and gamma rays from beta decays in an active galactic nucleus NGC 1068 jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that TeV neutrinos and high-energy gamma rays detected from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068 can simultaneously be explained in a model based on the beta decays of neutrons produced in the photodisintegration of 4He nuclei on ultraviolet photons in the jet. The photodisintegration of nuclei occurs at energies above several PeV, which explains the 1-100 TeV energies of the observed neutrinos. The TeV gamma-ray flux accompanying the beta decays is expected to be much lower than the neutrino flux, which agrees with the observations of NGC 1068 showing a gamma-ray deficit as compared to the expectations from proton-photon interactions. Furthermore, the synchrotron and inverse Compton gamma-ray flux associated with protons' Bethe-Heitler pair production and the photopion processes in the jet can be consistent with the observed gamma-ray flux at GeV energies for a plausible range of magnetic fields of jets. This scenario, combining beta decay and Bethe-Heitler, can be applied to other jet Seyfert galaxies such as NGC 4151. Future measurements of the neutrino flavor ratio can help confirm the beta-decay origin of the observed neutrinos.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological first-order phase transition (FOPT) sources the stochastic gravitational wave background (SWGB) through bubble collisions, sound waves, and turbulence. So far, most studies on the fluid profile of an expanding bubble are limited to transitions that complete in a much shorter time scale than the cosmic expansion. In this study, we investigate gravitational effects on the fluid profile beyond the self-similar regime. For this purpose we combine a hydrodynamic scheme in the presence of gravity with a fluid computation scheme under energy injection from the bubble wall. By performing (1+1)d simulations of spherical bubble for constant wall velocities, we find that the fluid generally develops a thinner shell in our cosmological setup, which qualitatively agrees with previous studies discussing the late-time behavior of fluid in expanding spacetime. We also observe reduction in the energy budget for the fluid kinetic energy. Furthermore, we find that the fluid profile develops sub-structure for accelerating bubble walls. We also comment on the possible broadening of the SGWB spectral plateau.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization observations indicate that in the best-fit $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model of the Universe, the local geometry is consistent with at most a small amount of positive or negative curvature, i.e., $\vert\Omega_K\vert\ll1$. However, whether the geometry is flat ($E^3$), positively curved ($S^3$) or negatively curved ($H^3$), there are many possible topologies. Among the topologies of $S^3$ geometry, the lens spaces $L(p,q)$, where $p$ and $q$ ($p&gt;1$ and $0&lt;q&lt;p$) are positive integers, are quotients of the covering space of $S^3$ (the three-sphere) by ${\mathbb{Z}}_p$, the cyclic group of order $p$. We use the absence of any pair of circles on the CMB sky with matching patterns of temperature fluctuations to establish constraints on $p$ and $q$ as a function of the curvature scale that are considerably stronger than those previously asserted for most values of $p$ and $q$. The smaller the value of $\vert\Omega_K\vert$, i.e., the larger the curvature radius, the larger the maximum allowed value of $p$. For example, if $\vert\Omega_K\vert\simeq 0.05$ then $p\leq 9 $, while if $\vert\Omega_K\vert\simeq 0.02$, $p$ can be as high as 24. Future work will extend these constraints to a wider set of $S^{3}$ topologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a numerical method for simulating stochastic fluid dynamics near a critical point in the Ising universality class. This theory is known as model H, and is expected to govern the non-equilibrium dynamics of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) near a possible critical endpoint of the phase transition between a hadron liquid and the quark-gluon plasma. The numerical algorithm is based on a Metropolis scheme, and automatically ensures that the distribution function of the hydrodynamic variables in equilibrium is independent of the transport coefficients and only governed by the microscopic free energy. We verify dynamic scaling near the critical point of a two and three-dimensional fluid and extract the associated critical exponent $z$. We find $z\simeq 3$ in three dimensions, and $z\simeq 2$ for a two-dimensional fluid. In a finite system, we observe a crossover between the mean field value $z=4$ and the true critical exponent $z\simeq 3$ ($z \simeq 2$ in $d=2$). This crossover is governed by the values of the correlation length and the renormalized shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Conformal geometry as a gauge theory of gravity: covariant equations of motion &amp; conservation laws</title>

Abstract: We study Weyl conformal geometry as a general gauge theory of the Weyl group (of Poincar\'e and dilatations symmetries) in a manifestly Weyl gauge covariant formalism in which this geometry is automatically metric and physically relevant. This gives a realistic (quadratic) gauge theory of gravity, with Einstein-Hilbert gravity recovered in its spontaneously broken phase, motivating our interest in this geometry. For the most general action we compute the manifestly Weyl gauge covariant equations of motion and present the conservation laws for the energy-momentum tensor and Weyl gauge current. These laws are valid both in Weyl conformal geometry (with respect to the Weyl gauge covariant derivative) but also in the Riemannian geometry equivalent picture (with respect to its associated covariant derivative). This interesting result is a consequence of gauged diffeomorphism invariance of the former versus usual diffeomorphism invariance of the latter. These results are first derived in $d=4$ dimensions. We then successfully derive the conservation laws and equations of motion in Weyl conformal geometry in arbitrary $d$ dimensions, while maintaining manifest Weyl gauge invariance/covariance. The results are useful in physical applications with this symmetry.</description>
