      <title>Moments of characteristic polynomials for classical $\beta$ ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the case of the circular unitary ensemble of Haar distributed unitary matrices, the large $N$ form of the moments of the absolute value of the characteristic polynomial is known to be of relevance to the moments of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line, and further to relate to Fisher-Hartwig asymptotics in the theory of Toeplitz determinants. The constant (with respect to $N$) in this asymptotic expansion, involving the Barnes $G$ function, is known to appear in the analogous expansion for the moments of the characteristic polynomial in other classical ensembles with unitary symmetry, for example the Gaussian unitary ensemble. Using certain duality formulas for averages over powers of characteristic polynomials, this same effect is studied for classical $\beta$ ensembles, which is tractable in the case of even moments. For a given value of $\beta$, a distinguished factor in the asymptotic expansion can be identified which is universal with respect to the particular $\beta$ ensemble.</description>

      <title>Exact Schwinger functions for a class of bounded interactions in $d\geq 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a scalar Euclidean QFT with interaction given by a bounded, measurable function $V$ such that $V^{\pm}:=\lim_{w\to \pm\infty}V(w)$ exist. We find a field renormalization such that all the $n$-point connected Schwinger functions for $n\neq 2$ exist non-perturbatively in the UV limit. They coincide with the tree-level one-particle irreducible Schwinger functions of the $\mathrm{erf}(\phi/\sqrt{2})$ interaction with a coupling constant $\frac{1}{2} (V^+ - V^-)$. By a slight modification of our construction we can change this coupling constant to $\frac{1}{2} (V_+ - V_-)$, where $V_{\pm}:= \lim_{w\to 0^{\pm}} V(w)$. Thereby non-Gaussianity of these latter theories is governed by a discontinuity of $V$ at zero. The open problem of controlling also the two-point function of these QFTs is discussed.</description>

      <title>A least Action principle for visco-resistive Hall Magnetohydrodynamic with metriplectic reformulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new variational formulation for Viscous and resistive Hall Magnetohydrodynamic. We first find a variational principle for ideal HMHD by applying the physical assumptions leading to HMHD at the lagrangian level, and then we add the viscous and resistive terms by the means of constrained variations. We also provide a metriplectic reformulation of our formulation, based on two canonical Lie-Poisson brackets for the ideal part and metric 4-brackets for the dissipative part.</description>

      <title>Volterra map and related recurrences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze recent work \cite{Hone1} by Hone, Roberts and Vanhaecke, where the so-called Volterra map was introduced via the Lax equation that looks similar to the Lax representation for the Mumford's system \cite{Vanhaecke}. This map turns out to be birational and a corresponding dynamical system on an affine space $M_g$ of dimension $3g+1$ was associated with it. This mapping is related to some discrete equation of the order $2g+1$ associated with the Stieltjes continued fraction expansion of a certain function on a hyperelliptic (elliptic) curve of genus $g\geq 1$. The authors of the paper provides examples of this equation for the simplest cases $g=1$ and $g=2$, but for higher values of $g$, corresponding equation turns out to be too cumbersome to write them out.
  We present an approach in which the mentioned $(2g+1)$-order equation can be written out for all values of $g\geq 1$ in a compact form. This equation is not new and can be found, for example, in \cite{Svinin3}. An essential point in our framework is the use of special class of discrete polynomials which as shown to be closely related to the Stieltjes continued fraction. On the one hand, this allows us to generalize some of the results of the work \cite{Hone1}. On the other hand, many things in this approach can be presented in a more compact and unified form. Ultimately, we believe that this allows us to give a new perspective on this topic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06951v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mostly inspired by recent work by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, and Shehsmani, combined with previous work by Aganagic, Ooguri, Saulina and Vafa with regard to BPS black hole microstate counting in terms of topological field theory calculations, we will show how these tools can be applied to concrete setups arising from String Theory, and why the formalism of functorial Homological Mirror Symmetry needs to be further developed.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of magnetic geodesic flows on surfaces of revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study magnetic geodesic flows invariant under rotations on the 2-sphere. The dynamical system is given by a generic pair of functions $(f,\Lambda)$ in one variable. Topology of the Liouville fibration of the given integrable system near its singular orbits and singular fibers is described. Types of these singularities are computed. Topology of the Liouville fibration on regular 3-dimensional isoenergy manifolds is described by computing the Fomenko--Zieschang invariant. All possible bifurcation diagrams of the momentum maps of such integrable systems are described. It is shown that the bifurcation diagram consists of two curves in the $(h,k)$-plane. One of these curves is a line segment $h=0$, and the other lies in the half-plane $h\ge0$ and can be obtained from the curve $(a:-1:k) = (f:\Lambda:1)^*$ projectively dual to the curve $(f:\Lambda:1)$ by the transformation $(a:-1:k)\mapsto(a^2/2,k)=(h,k)$.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Free Field and Discrete Gaussians in Periodic Dimer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze height fluctuations in Aztec diamond dimer models with nearly arbitrary periodic edge weights. We show that the centered height function approximates the sum of two independent components: a Gaussian free field on the multiply connected liquid region and a harmonic function with random liquid-gas boundary values. The boundary values are jointly distributed as a discrete Gaussian random vector. This discrete Gaussian distribution maintains a quasi-periodic dependence on $N$, a phenomenon also observed in multi-cut random matrix models.</description>

      <title>Gauge Origami and BPS/CFT correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge origami is a generalized supersymmetric gauge theory defined on several intersecting space-time components. It provides a systematic way to consider generalizations of instantons. In this thesis, we explore the gauge origami system in $\mathbb{R}^{1,1}\times \mathbb{C}^{4}$ and its BPS/CFT correspondence. String theoretically, instantons of the gauge origami system arise from D0-branes bound to D$(2p)$-branes wrapping cycles in $\mathbb{C}^{4}$. The low energy theory of the D0-branes is understood as an $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanical system and the Witten index of it produces the instanton partition function. We define a $q$-deformed quiver Cartan matrix associated to this quiver structure and introduce vertex operators associated with the D-branes and show that the contour integral formula for the Witten index has a nice free field realization. Such free field realization leads to the concept of BPS $qq$-characters or BPS quiver W-algebras, which are generalizations of the conventional deformed W-algebras. The $qq$-characters of D2 and D4-branes correspond to screening charges and generators of the affine quiver W-algebra, respectively. On the other hand, the $qq$-characters of D6 and D8-branes represent novel types of $qq$-characters, where monomial terms are characterized by plane partitions and solid partitions. The composition of these $qq$-characters yields the instanton partition functions of the gauge origami system, eventually establishing the BPS/CFT correspondence. Additionally, we demonstrate that the fusion of $qq$-characters of D-branes in lower dimensions results in higher-dimensional D-brane $qq$-characters. We also investigate quadratic relations among these $qq$-characters. Furthermore, we explore the relationship with the representations of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review some recent developments in 1-st order GLSM construction, or so-called Gross-Neveu formalism for sigma models. We recall the general idea behind this framework and describe a 1-st order GLSM data from which the general generalized Gross-Neveu model can be constructed, using $\mathbb{CP}^{n-1}$ sigma model as simplest example. Then, we formulate a general statement that answers the question of which generalized Gross-Neveu models are equivalent to sigma models on compact homogeneous Hermitian spaces of classical groups endowed with the normal metrics.</description>

      <title>Classification of Gapped Domain Walls of Topological Orders in 2+1 dimensions: A Levin-Wen Model Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel systematic construction of gapped domain walls (GDWs) within the Levin-Wen (LW) model, advancing our understanding of topological phases. By gluing two LW models along their open sides in a compatible way, we achieve a complete GDW classification by subsets of bulk input data, encompassing $e$-$m$ exchanging GDWs. A generalized bimodule structure is introduced to capture domain-wall excitations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that folding along any GDW yields a gapped boundary (GB) described by a Frobenius algebra of the input UFC for the folded model, thus bridging GDW and GB classifications within a unified framework.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the conformally coupled scalar gravitational theory. This is the simplest local-scale invariant theory of gravity which is linear in the curvature scalar. We demonstrate that, if incorporate local-scale symmetry into the variational procedure, it is not required that the trace of the stress-energy tensor of the matter fields vanished for this symmetry to be preserved. The relevance of this result for the understanding of local-scale symmetry along with its physical consequences, is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to derive mean-field limits for first- and second-order particle systems with singular interactions. It is based on a duality approach combined with the analysis of linearized dual correlations, and it allows to cover for the first time arbitrary square-integrable interaction forces at possibly vanishing temperature. In case of first-order systems, it allows to recover in particular the mean-field limit to the 2d Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. The approach also provides convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Almost-idempotent quantum channels and approximate $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Phi$ be a unital completely positive (UCP) map on the space of operators on some Hilbert space. We assume that $\Phi$ is $\eta$-idempotent, namely, $\|\Phi^2-\Phi\|_{\mathrm{cb}} \le\eta$, and construct an associated $\varepsilon$-$C^*$ algebra (of almost-invariant observables) for $\varepsilon=O(\eta)$. This type of structure has the axioms of a unital $C^*$ algebra but the associativity and other axioms involving the multiplication and the unit hold up to $\varepsilon$. We prove that any finite-dimensional $\varepsilon$-$C^*$ algebra $A$ is $O(\varepsilon)$-isomorphic to some genuine $C^*$ algebra $B$. These bounds are universal, i.e. do not depend on the dimensionality or other parameters. When $A$ comes from a finite-dimensional $\eta$-idempotent UCP map $\Phi$, the $O(\eta)$-isomorphism and its inverse can be realized by UCP maps. This gives an approximate factorization of the quantum channel $\Phi^*$ into a decoding channel, producing a state on $B$, and an encoding channel.</description>

      <title>A uniform trigonometric R-matrix for the exceptional series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exceptional series is a finite list of points on a projective line with a simple Lie algebra attached to each point. This list of Lie algebras includes the five exceptional Lie algebras. We give a uniform trigonometric $R$-matrix for the exceptional series in the representation $L\oplus I$, where $L$ is the quantum deformation of the adjoint representation and $I$ is the trivial representation. We construct a sixteen dimensional algebra, $A^\square(\mathit2)$, which interpolates the algebras $\mathrm{End}(\otimes^2(L\oplus I))$ and a 287 dimensional algebra, $A^\square(\mathit3)$, which interpolates the algebras $\mathrm{End}(\otimes^3(L\oplus I))$. The $R$-matrix lives in $A^\square(\mathit2)$ and satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation in $A^\square(\mathit3)$; it interpolates the trigonometric $R$-matrices for the points in the exceptional series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate here the deformations of Berglund H\"ubsch loop and chain mirrors where the original manifolds are defined in the same weighted projective space. We show that the deformations are equivalent by two methods. First, we map directly the two models to each other and show that the deformations are the same for $79$ "Good" models, but not for the $77$ "Bad" ones. We then investigate the orbifold of the mirror pair by the maximal symmetry group and show that the number of deformations is the same and that they are almost the same, i.e., the first four exponents of the deformations are identical.</description>

      <title>Nicolai maps for supersymmetric sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18855v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetric field theories can be characterized by their Nicolai map, which is a nonlinear and nonlocal field transformation to their free-field limit. The systematic construction of such maps has recently been outlined for actions with power more than two in the fermions, which produces a perturbative expansion in loop-decorated fermionic tree diagrams. We thoroughly investigate the nonlinear $\mathbb C P^1$ sigma model in ($3{+}1$)-dimensional Minkowski space as a paradigmatical example. We construct and test a chiral form of the Nicolai map, to third order in the coupling, including all (regularized) quantum parts. In addition, all trees with one or two edges are summed up. The free-action condition determines only the one-edge part of the map. We resolve the fermion loop decoration of the Nicolai trees by injecting an auxiliary vector field and present the ensuing classical Nicolai map to second order in a dimensionful coupling.</description>

      <title>On some states minimizing uncertainty relations: A new look at these relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing Heisenberg--Robertson (HR) and Schr\"{o}dinger uncertainty relations we found, that there can exist a large set of states of the quantum system under considerations, for which the lower bound of the product of the standard deviations of a pair of non--commuting observables, $A$ and $B$, is zero. These states are not eigenstates of either the observable $A$ or $B$. The correlation function for these observables in such states is equal to zero. We have also shown that the so--called "sum uncertainty relations" also do not provide any information about lower bounds on the standard deviations calculated for these states. We additionally show that the uncertainty principle in its most general form has two faces: one is that it is a lower bound on the product of standard deviations, and the other is that the product of standard deviations is an upper bound on the modulus of the correlation function of a pair of the non--commuting observables in the state under consideration.</description>

      <title>Large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories: A pedagogical overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The different large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories in three, four, and five dimensions are reviewed. We distinguish between the planar limit of SQCD theories, the M-theory limit suited in three and five dimensions, and the long quiver limit. The method to solve exactly the sphere partition functions in each type of limit is spelled out in a pedagogical way. After a comprehensive general treatment of the saddle point approximation in the large $N$ limit, we present an extensive list of examples and detail the calculations. The scope of this overview is to provide an entry-level, computation-oriented understanding of the techniques featured in the field theory side of the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Partition Function Zeros of Paths and Normalization Zeros of ASEPS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exploit the equivalence between the partition function of an adsorbing Dyck walk model and the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ASEP) normalization to obtain the thermodynamic limit of the locus of the ASEP normalization zeros from a conformal map. We discuss the equivalence between this approach and using an electrostatic analogy to determine the locus, both in the case of the ASEP and the random allocation model.</description>

      <title>Exact Floquet solutions in a Parity-Time-Symmetric Rabi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that a semiclassical Rabi model with parity-time (PT) symmetry has a hidden $sl(2)$ symmetry and hence possesses quasi-exact solutions. These are located precisely at the exceptional points of the spectrum, the boundaries of the PT-symmetric phase. The corresponding constraints on the model parameters can be interpreted as a resonance relationship between the constant and periodic driving terms.</description>

      <title>A switching identity for cable-graph loop soups and Gaussian free fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a "switching identity" that can be stated for critical Brownian loop-soups or for the Gaussian free field on a cable graph: It basically says that at the level of cluster configurations and at the more general level of the occupation time fields, conditioning two points on the cable-graph to belong to the same cluster of Brownian loops (or equivalently to the same sign-cluster of the GFF) amounts to adding a random odd number of independent Brownian excursions between these points to an otherwise unconditioned configuration. This explicit simple description of the conditional law of the clusters when a connection occurs has various direct consequences, in particular about the large scale behaviour of these sign-clusters on infinite graphs.</description>
