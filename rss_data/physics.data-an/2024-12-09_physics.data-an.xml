      <title>DPGIIL: Dirichlet Process-Deep Generative Model-Integrated Incremental Learning for Clustering in Transmissibility-based Online Structural Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Clustering based on vibration responses, such as transmissibility functions (TFs), is promising in structural anomaly detection, but most existing approaches struggle with determining the optimal cluster number and handling high-dimensional streaming data, while their shallow structures also make them sensitive to manually-engineered feature quality. To bridge this gap, this work proposes the Dirichlet process-deep generative model-integrated incremental learning (DPGIIL) for clustering by combining the advantages of deep generative models (DGMs) in representation learning and the Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) in identifying distinct patterns in observed data. By introducing a DPMM prior into the latent space of DGMs, DPGIIL automatically captures dissimilarities in extracted latent representations, enabling both generative modeling and clustering. Within the context of variational Bayesian inference, a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood of DPGIIL, tighter than the evidence lower bound given sufficient training data, is derived analytically, which enables the joint optimization of DGM and DPMM parameters, thereby allowing the DPMM to regularize the DGM's feature extraction process. Additionally, a greedy split-merge scheme-based coordinate ascent variational inference method is devised to accelerate the optimization. The summary statistics of the DPMM, along with the network parameters, are used to retain information about previous data for incremental learning. Notably, this study uses variational autoencoder (VAE) within DPGIIL as an illustrative example, while this framework is adaptable to other DGMs. Two case studies show that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art approaches in structural anomaly detection and clustering, while also dynamically generating new clusters to indicate the emergence of new structural conditions for online monitoring.</description>

Abstract: Incorporating novelties into deep learning systems remains a challenging problem. Introducing new information to a machine learning system can interfere with previously stored data and potentially alter the global model paradigm, especially when dealing with non-stationary sources. In such cases, traditional approaches based on validation error minimization offer limited advantages. To address this, we propose a training algorithm inspired by Stuart Kauffman's notion of the Adjacent Possible. This novel training methodology explores new data spaces during the learning phase. It predisposes the neural network to smoothly accept and integrate data sequences with different statistical characteristics than expected. The maximum distance compatible with such inclusion depends on a specific parameter: the sampling temperature used in the explorative phase of the present method. This algorithm, called Dreaming Learning, anticipates potential regime shifts over time, enhancing the neural network's responsiveness to non-stationary events that alter statistical properties. To assess the advantages of this approach, we apply this methodology to unexpected statistical changes in Markov chains and non-stationary dynamics in textual sequences. We demonstrated its ability to improve the auto-correlation of generated textual sequences by $\sim 29\%$ and enhance the velocity of loss convergence by $\sim 100\%$ in the case of a paradigm shift in Markov chains.</description>
