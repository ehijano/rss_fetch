      <title>Rabi oscillations with close-range quantum vortex states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum vortices separated through distances much larger than their core size interact via their long-range velocity field. At smaller separations, however, the influence of the core's compressibility strongly influences the vortex dynamics. Using the example of a compact ring of five vortices, it is shown that close-range effects lead to a new (slower) state of orbital motion which is not predicted by the usual long-range theory. This secondary state can be created starting from the usual orbital state by modulating the interaction strength to induce Rabi oscillations between the states.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Energy Injection in Turbulent Neutron Star Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron star glitches -- sudden increases in rotational frequency -- are thought to result from angular momentum transfer via quantized vortices in the superfluid core. Using a two-dimensional rotating atomic Bose-Einstein condensate with phenomenological damping and a pinning potential to mimic the crust, we model the dynamics underlying these events. Our simulations reveal a transient Kolmogorov-like turbulent cascade ($k^{-5/3}$) that transitions to a Vinen-like scaling ($k^{-1}$). We identify an anomalous secondary injection mechanism driven primarily by quantum pressure, which sustains turbulent fluctuations in pulsar glitches. By tuning the damping coefficient $\gamma$, we determine an optimal regime for energy transfer. These findings provide a robust analogy for neutron star glitch phenomena and offer new insights into turbulence in extreme astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Error-resilient Reversal of Quantum Chaotic Dynamics Enabled by Scramblons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the arrow of time in quantum many-body systems stems from the inherent tendency of Hamiltonian evolution to scramble quantum information and increase entanglement. While, in principle, one might counteract this temporal directionality by engineering a perfectly inverted Hamiltonian to reverse entanglement growth, such a scenario is fundamentally unstable because even minor imperfections in the backward evolution can be exponentially amplified, a hallmark of quantum many-body chaos. Therefore, successfully reversing quantum many-body dynamics demands a deep understanding of the underlying structure of quantum information scrambling and chaotic dynamics. Here, by using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance on a macroscopic ensemble of randomly interacting spins, we measure the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) and validate key predictions of scramblon theory, a universal theoretical framework for information scrambling. Crucially, this theory enables us to isolate and mitigate errors in the OTOC caused by imperfections in the backward evolution. As a result, this protocol uncovers the anticipated exponential behavior of quantum many-body chaos and extracts the quantum Lyapunov exponent in a many-body experimental system for the first time. Our results push the fundamental limits of dynamical reversibility of complex quantum systems, with implications for quantum simulation and metrology.</description>

      <title>Probing the Physical Reality of Projective Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a protocol to test whether the postulate of a measurement acting as an instantaneous projection onto an eigenstate of the measurement apparatus is compatible with physical reality. This approach is solely based on repeated measurements of local quantities with frequencies that are within reach of analog quantum simulation platforms, for instance Rydberg atom arrays or ultracold gases in optical lattices. Crucially, we also develop a continuous description of a quantum measurement finding that its repeated-measurement statistics (RMS) drastically differ from the projective case. This description is based on very general assumptions about quantum systems, most importantly maintaining continuous dynamics of the coherent part of the state. Our findings imply that the significantly different measurement statistics in the collapse-free description should be qualitatively replicated by any modification of standard quantum theory that is lacking explicit wave-function collapses.</description>

      <title>Continuous operation of a coherent 3,000-qubit system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atoms are a promising platform for quantum science, enabling advances in areas ranging from quantum simulations and computation to metrology, atomic clocks and quantum networking. While atom losses typically limit these systems to a pulsed mode, continuous operation could significantly enhance cycle rates, remove bottlenecks in metrology, and enable deep-circuit quantum evolution through quantum error correction. Here we demonstrate an experimental architecture for high-rate, continuous reloading and operation of a large-scale atom array system while realizing coherent storage and manipulation of quantum information. Our approach utilizes a series of two optical lattice conveyor belts to transport atom reservoirs into the science region, where atoms are repeatedly extracted into optical tweezers without affecting the coherence of qubits stored nearby. Using a reloading rate of 300,000 atoms in tweezers per second, we create over 30,000 initialized qubits per second, which we leverage to assemble and maintain an array of over 3,000 atoms for more than two hours. Furthermore, we demonstrate persistent refilling of the array with atomic qubits in either a spin-polarized or a coherent superposition state while preserving the quantum state of stored qubits. Our results pave the way for realization of large-scale continuously operated atomic clocks, sensors, and fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Architectural mechanisms of a universal fault-tolerant quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is believed to be essential for the realization of large-scale quantum computers. However, due to the complexity of operating on the encoded `logical' qubits, understanding the physical principles for building fault-tolerant quantum devices and combining them into efficient architectures is an outstanding scientific challenge. Here we utilize reconfigurable arrays of up to 448 neutral atoms to implement all key elements of a universal, fault-tolerant quantum processing architecture and experimentally explore their underlying working mechanisms. We first employ surface codes to study how repeated QEC suppresses errors, demonstrating 2.14(13)x below-threshold performance in a four-round characterization circuit by leveraging atom loss detection and machine learning decoding. We then investigate logical entanglement using transversal gates and lattice surgery, and extend it to universal logic through transversal teleportation with 3D [[15,1,3]] codes, enabling arbitrary-angle synthesis with logarithmic overhead. Finally, we develop mid-circuit qubit re-use, increasing experimental cycle rates by two orders of magnitude and enabling deep-circuit protocols with dozens of logical qubits and hundreds of logical teleportations with [[7,1,3]] and high-rate [[16,6,4]] codes while maintaining constant internal entropy. Our experiments reveal key principles for efficient architecture design, involving the interplay between quantum logic and entropy removal, judiciously using physical entanglement in logic gates and magic state generation, and leveraging teleportations for universality and physical qubit reset. These results establish foundations for scalable, universal error-corrected processing and its practical implementation with neutral atom systems.</description>

      <title>Droplets of Bosons at a Narrow Resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider bosons interacting through a narrow $s$-wave resonance. Such a resonance is characterized by an infinite scattering length and a large and negative effective range $r_0$. We argue that any number $N\ge3$ of bosons can form a self-bound cluster with the binding energy per particle increasing as $N^2$ for $1\ll N\ll (-r_0/a_\text{bg})^{1/2}$, where $a_\text{bg}$ is the background scattering length (between atoms and molecules). In the opposite limit $N\gg (-r_0/a_\text{bg})^{1/2}$, bosons form droplets with binding energy per particle saturating to a constant value independent of the particle number. The stability of clusters and droplets when the interaction is detuned from the resonance is also studied.</description>

      <title>Universal coherent atom-molecule oscillations in the dynamics of the unitary Bose gas near a narrow Feshbach resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quench experiments on a unitary Bose gas around a broad Feshbach resonance have led to the discovery of universal dynamics. This universality is manifested in the measured atomic momentum distributions where, asymptotically, a quasi-equilibrated metastable state is found in which both the momentum distribution and the time scales are determined by the particle density. In this paper we present counterpart studies but for the case of a very narrow Feshbach resonance of $^{133}$Cs atoms having a width of 8.3 mG. In dramatic contrast to the behavior reported earlier, a rapid quench of an atomic condensate to unitarity is observed to ultimately lead to coherent oscillations involving dynamically produced condensed and non-condensed molecules and atoms. The same characteristic frequency, determined by the Feshbach coupling, is observed in all types of particles. To understand these quench dynamics and how these different particle species are created, we develop a beyond Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov dynamical framework including a new type of cross correlation between atoms and molecules. This leads to a quantitative consistency with the measured frequency. Our results, which can be applied to the general class of bosonic superfluids associated with narrow Feshbach resonances, establish a new paradigm for universal dynamics dominated by quantum many-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Stabilization of Floquet States Using Static Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering, in which the properties of a quantum system are modified through the application of strong periodic drives, is an indispensable tool in atomic and condensed matter systems. However, it is inevitably limited by intrinsic heating processes. We describe a simple autonomous scheme, which exploits a static coupling between the driven system and a lossy auxiliary, to cool large classes of Floquet systems into desired states. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for the stabilization of a chosen quasienergy state in a strongly modulated transmon qubit coupled to an auxiliary microwave cavity with fixed frequency and photon loss. The scheme naturally extends to Floquet systems with multiple degrees of freedom. As an example, we demonstrate the stabilization of topological photon pumping in a driven cavity-QED system numerically. The coupling to the auxiliary cavity increases the average photon current and the fidelity of non-classical states, such as high photon number Fock states, that can be prepared in the system cavity.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected Bell-cat states in a simple spin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the topological properties of the so-called central spin model that consists of $N$ identical spins coupled to a single distinguishable central spin which arises in physical systems such as circuit-QED and bosonic Josephson junctions coupled to an impurity atom. The model closely corresponds to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model except that the chain of sites in the SSH model is replaced by a chain of states in Fock space specifying the magnetization. We find that the model accommodates topologically protected eigenstates that are `Bell-cat' states consisting of a Schr\"{o}dinger cat state of the $N$ spins that is maximally entangled with the central spin, and show how this state can be adiabatically created and moved along the chain by driving the central spin. The Bell-cat states are visualized by plotting their Wigner function and we explore their robustness against random noise by solving the master equation for the density matrix. We also explain the essential topological difference between identical spins and the excitations of a bosonic mode.</description>
