      <title>The Landscape of GPU-Centric Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, GPUs have become the preferred accelerators for HPC and ML applications due to their parallelism and fast memory bandwidth. While GPUs boost computation, inter-GPU communication can create scalability bottlenecks, especially as the number of GPUs per node and cluster grows. Traditionally, the CPU managed multi-GPU communication, but advancements in GPU-centric communication now challenge this CPU dominance by reducing its involvement, granting GPUs more autonomy in communication tasks, and addressing mismatches in multi-GPU communication and computation.
  This paper provides a landscape of GPU-centric communication, focusing on vendor mechanisms and user-level library supports. It aims to clarify the complexities and diverse options in this field, define the terminology, and categorize existing approaches within and across nodes. The paper discusses vendor-provided mechanisms for communication and memory management in multi-GPU execution and reviews major communication libraries, their benefits, challenges, and performance insights. Then, it explores key research paradigms, future outlooks, and open research questions. By extensively describing GPU-centric communication techniques across the software and hardware stacks, we provide researchers, programmers, engineers, and library designers insights on how to exploit multi-GPU systems at their best.</description>

      <title>CARMA: Collocation-Aware Resource Manager</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GPUs running deep learning (DL) workloads are frequently underutilized. Collocating multiple DL training tasks on the same GPU can improve utilization but introduces two key risks: (1) out-of-memory (OOM) crashes for newly scheduled tasks, and (2) severe performance interference among co-running tasks, which can negate any throughput gains. These issues reduce system robustness, quality of service, and energy efficiency. We present CARMA, a task-level, collocation-aware resource manager for the server-scale. CARMA addresses collocation challenges via (1) fine-grained monitoring and bookkeeping of GPUs and a collocation risk analysis that filters out the high-risk GPUs; (2) task placement policies that cap GPU utilization to limit OOMs and interference; (3) integration of GPU memory need estimators for DL tasks to minimize OOMs during collocation; and (4) a lightweight recovery method that relaunches jobs crashed due to OOMs. Our evaluation on a DL training workload derived from real-world traces shows that CARMA uses GPUs more efficiently by making more informed collocation decisions: for the best-performing collocation policy, CARMA increases GPU streaming multiprocessor (SM) utilization by 54%, the parallelism achieved per SM by 61%, and memory use by 62%. This results in a ~35% and ~15% reduction in the end-to-end execution time (makespan) and GPU energy consumption, respectively, for this workload.</description>

      <title>SweetSpot: An Analytical Model for Predicting Energy Efficiency of LLM Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inference is central to modern AI applications, dominating worldwide datacenter workloads, making it critical to predict its energy footprint. Existing approaches estimate energy consumption as a simple linear function of input and output sequence. However, by analyzing the autoregressive structure of Transformers, which implies a fundamentally non-linear relationship between input and output sequence lengths and energy consumption, we demonstrate the existence of a generation energy minima. Peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs. Consequently, we propose SweetSpot, an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, which accurately characterizes the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess accuracy, we measure energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite. We test input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens and achieve a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency "sweet spots" reduce energy usage, up to 33.41x, enabling informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.</description>
