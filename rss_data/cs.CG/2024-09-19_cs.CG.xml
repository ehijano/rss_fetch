      <title>Tiling with Three Polygons is Undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the following problem is co-RE-complete and thus undecidable: given three simple polygons, is there a tiling of the plane where every tile is an isometry of one of the three polygons (either allowing or forbidding reflections)? This result improves on the best previous construction which requires five polygons.</description>

      <title>Minimum Plane Bichromatic Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a set of red and blue points in the plane, a minimum bichromatic spanning tree (MinBST) is a shortest spanning tree of the points such that every edge has a red and a blue endpoint. A MinBST can be computed in $O(n\log n)$ time where $n$ is the number of points. In contrast to the standard Euclidean MST, which is always plane (noncrossing), a MinBST may have edges that cross each other. However, we prove that a MinBST is quasi-plane, that is, it does not contain three pairwise crossing edges, and we determine the maximum number of crossings.
  Moreover, we study the problem of finding a minimum plane bichromatic spanning tree (MinPBST) which is a shortest bichromatic spanning tree with pairwise noncrossing edges. This problem is known to be NP-hard. The previous best approximation algorithm, due to Borgelt et al. (2009), has a ratio of $O(\sqrt{n})$. It is also known that the optimum solution can be computed in polynomial time in some special cases, for instance, when the points are in convex position, collinear, semi-collinear, or when one color class has constant size. We present an $O(\log n)$-factor approximation algorithm for the general case.</description>

      <title>Evolving Distributions Under Local Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric data sets arising in modern applications are often very large and change dynamically over time. A popular framework for dealing with such data sets is the evolving data framework, where a discrete structure continuously varies over time due to the unseen actions of an evolver, which makes small changes to the data. An algorithm probes the current state through an oracle, and the objective is to maintain a hypothesis of the data set's current state that is close to its actual state at all times. In this paper, we apply this framework to maintaining a set of $n$ point objects in motion in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. To model the uncertainty in the object locations, both the ground truth and hypothesis are based on spatial probability distributions, and the distance between them is measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence (relative entropy). We introduce a simple and intuitive motion model where with each time step, the distance that any object can move is a fraction of the distance to its nearest neighbor. We present an algorithm that, in steady state, guarantees a distance of $O(n)$ between the true and hypothesized placements. We also show that for any algorithm in this model, there is an evolver that can generate a distance of $\Omega(n)$, implying that our algorithm is asymptotically optimal.</description>

      <title>Exact Wavefront Propagation for Globally Optimal One-to-All Path Planning on 2D Cartesian Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient $\mathcal{O}(n)$ compute and memory complexity algorithm for globally optimal path planning on 2D Cartesian grids. Unlike existing marching methods that rely on approximate discretized solutions to the Eikonal equation, our approach achieves exact wavefront propagation by pivoting the analytic distance function based on visibility. The algorithm leverages a dynamic-programming subroutine to efficiently evaluate visibility queries. Through benchmarking against state-of-the-art any-angle path planners, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both speed and accuracy, particularly in cluttered environments. Notably, our method inherently provides globally optimal paths to all grid points, eliminating the need for additional gradient descent steps per path query. The same capability extends to multiple starting positions. We also provide a greedy version of our algorithm as well as open-source C++ implementation of our solver.</description>

      <title>Computing the Matching Distance of 2-Parameter Persistence Modules from Critical Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exact computation of the matching distance for multi-parameter persistence modules is an active area of research in computational topology. Achieving an easily obtainable exact computation of this distance would allow multi-parameter persistent homology to be a viable option for data analysis. In this paper, we provide theoretical results for the computation of the matching distance in two dimensions along with a geometric interpretation of the lines through parameter space realizing this distance. The crucial point of the method we propose is that it can be easily implemented.</description>

      <title>On polynomials associated to Voronoi diagrams of point sets and crossing numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three polynomials are defined for given sets $S$ of $n$ points in general position in the plane: The Voronoi polynomial with coefficients the numbers of vertices of the order-$k$ Voronoi diagrams of $S$, the circle polynomial with coefficients the numbers of circles through three points of $S$ enclosing $k$ points of $S$, and the $E_{\leq k}$ polynomial with coefficients the numbers of (at most $k$)-edges of $S$. We present several formulas for the rectilinear crossing number of $S$ in terms of these polynomials and their roots. We also prove that the roots of the Voronoi polynomial lie on the unit circle if, and only if, $S$ is in convex position. Further, we present bounds on the location of the roots of these polynomials.</description>

      <title>CPAFT: A Consistent Parallel Advancing Front Technique for Unstructured Triangular/Tetrahedral Mesh Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compared with the remarkable progress made in parallel numerical solvers of partial differential equations,the development of algorithms for generating unstructured triangular/tetrahedral meshes has been relatively sluggish. In this paper, we propose a novel, consistent parallel advancing front technique (CPAFT) by combining the advancing front technique, the domain decomposition method based on space-filling curves, the distributed forest-of-overlapping-trees approach, and the consistent parallel maximal independent set algorithm. The newly proposed CPAFT algorithm can mathematically ensure that the generated unstructured triangular/tetrahedral meshes are independent of the number of processors and the implementation of domain decomposition. Several numerical tests are conducted to validate the parallel consistency and outstanding parallel efficiency of the proposed algorithm, which scales effectively up to two thousand processors. This is, as far as we know, the first parallel unstructured triangular/tetrahedral mesh generator with scalability to O(1,000) CPU processors.</description>
