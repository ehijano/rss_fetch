      <title>Optimization of random phase approximation calculations for improved energies of molecules, solids, and surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optimized random phase approximation method (optRPA26) that significantly improves upon conventional RPA. The method employs an empirically constructed hybrid functional to generate DFT orbitals to evaluate the RPA correlation energy, which is then scaled by a constant. Comprehensive benchmarks across molecules, bulk solids, and surface systems demonstrate that optRPA26 consistently achieves high accuracy, with mean absolute errors of 0.05 eV for W4-11 reaction energies, 0.07 eV for cohesive energies, 0.09 eV for metal oxide formation energies, 0.11-0.12 eV for adsorption of small molecules on metals, and 0.06 eV for adsorption on oxides. In addition, optRPA26 correctly captures phase stability in metal oxides and magnetic metals. The optRPA26 approach can be run using standard RPA implementations, highlighting its potential as a general-purpose reference method that can accurately capture covalent, ionic, and metallic, and van der Waals bonding in molecules, solids, and interfaces.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Differentiable Learning of a Single Functional for DFT and Linear-Response TDDFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) and linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) rely on an exchange-correlation (xc) approximation that provides not only energy but also its functional derivatives that enter the self-consistent potential and the response kernel. Here we present an end-to-end differentiable workflow to optimize a single deep-learned energy functional using targets from both Kohn-Sham DFT and adiabatic LR-TDDFT within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation. Implemented in a JAX-based two-component quantum chemistry code (IQC), the learned functional yields a consistent potential and LR kernel via automatic differentiation, enabling gradient-based training through the SCF fixed point and the Casida equation. As a proof of concept in a fixed finite basis (cc-pVDZ), we learn an exchange-correlation functional on the helium spectrum while incorporating one-electron self-interaction cancelation and the Lieb-Oxford inequality as penalty terms, and we assess its possible transfer to molecular test cases.</description>

      <title>Generalized Path Reweighting and History-Dependent Free Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition interface sampling (TIS) and replica exchange TIS (RETIS) are powerful methods for computing rates of rare events inaccessible to straightforward molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Path reweighting extends their output, enabling the evaluation of diverse thermodynamic and kinetic quantities, including reaction prediction metrics, activation barriers, committor functions, and free energies. The recently developed Infinity-RETIS algorithm boosts parallel efficiency through asynchronous replica exchanges in the infinite-swap limit, eliminating the wall-time bottlenecks of conventional RETIS. This approach introduces fractional samples and biased sampling distributions, requiring a generalized path reweighting framework, for which we derive expressions demonstrating how it can be used to compute exact dynamic and thermodynamic variables. We then focus on a special class of free energy surfaces defined by history-dependent conditions, whose values are influenced by kinetic factors such as particle mass and friction, unlike standard unconditional free energy surfaces. These conditional free energies can reveal kinetically relevant barriers even with suboptimal reaction coordinates and therefore provide a rigorous and versatile tool for characterizing complex molecular transitions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic hierarchical data-driven optimization: application to plasma-surface kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a stochastic hierarchical optimization framework inspired by Sloppy Model theory for the efficient calibration of physical models. Central to this method is the use of a reduced Hessian approximation, which identifies and targets the stiff parameter subspace using minimal simulation queries. This strategy enables efficient navigation of highly anisotropic landscapes, avoiding the computational burden of exhaustive sampling. To ensure rigorous inference, we integrate this approach with a probabilistic formulation that derives a principled objective loss function directly from observed data. We validate the framework by applying it to the problem of plasma-surface interactions, where accurate modelling is strictly limited by uncertainties in surface reactivity parameters and the computational cost of kinetic simulations. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms baseline optimization techniques in sample efficiency. This approach offers a general and scalable tool for optimizing models of complex reaction systems, ranging from plasma chemistry to biochemical networks.</description>

      <title>Near-frustration-free electronic structure Hamiltonian representations and lower bound certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian representations based on the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy provide rigorous lower bounds on ground-state energies and facilitate the design of efficient classical and quantum simulation algorithms. This work presents a unified framework connecting SOS decompositions with variational two-particle reduced density matrix (v2RDM) theory. We demonstrate that the ``weighted'' SOS ansatz naturally recovers the dual of the v2RDM program, enabling the strict enforcement of symmetry constraints such as particle number and spin. We provide explicit SOS constructions for the Hubbard model and electronic structure Hamiltonians, ranging from spin-free approximations to full rank-2 expansions. We also highlight theoretical connections to block-invariant symmetry shifts. Numerical benchmarks on molecular systems and Iron-Sulfur clusters validate these near frustration-free representations, demonstrating their utility in improving spectral gap amplification and reducing block encoding costs in quantum algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study by Jung et al. (Jung H, Covino R, Arjun A, et al., Nat Comput Sci. 3:334-345 (2023)) introduced Artificial Intelligence for Molecular Mechanism Discovery (AIMMD), a novel sampling algorithm that integrates machine learning to enhance the efficiency of transition path sampling (TPS). By enabling on-the-fly estimation of the committor probability and simultaneously deriving a human-interpretable reaction coordinate, AIMMD offers a robust framework for elucidating the mechanistic pathways of complex molecular processes. This commentary provides a discussion and critical analysis of the core AIMMD framework, explores its recent extensions, and offers an assessment of the method's potential impact and limitations.</description>

      <title>A waveguide kinetics framework for electrochemical polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen electrocatalysis (HER/HOR) exhibits an anomalous, non-Nernstian pH dependence that has motivated competing mechanistic narratives yet still lacks a unified, transferable, and quantitatively predictive description across conditions. Here, we introduce a theory-neutral waveguide kinetics framework that reinterprets the polarization curve as a power-flow-like response, enabling a compact modal representation of interfacial kinetics. Without presuming any specific mechanism, the model quantitatively fits four representative polarization datasets historically explained by divergent theories. From each fit, we extract interpretable diagnostics, including a reflection amplitude and a useful-output density, that provide transferable metrics for interfacial efficiency. The framework thus establishes a computational experiment platform for mechanistic triangulation, operating-regime diagnosis, and the rational design of hydrogen electrocatalysts across the pH spectrum.</description>

      <title>Report on the second Toulouse Tensor Workshop</title>

Abstract: This report documents the program of the second Toulouse Tensor Workshop which took place at the University of Toulouse on September 17-19, 2025, and summarizes the main points of discussion. This workshop follows the first Workshop (CECAM workshop on Tensor Contraction Library Standardization), which took place in Toulouse one year earlier, on May 24-25, 2024 and led to the formation of a tensor standardization working group, which has since specified a low-level standard interface for tensor operations available freely on GitHub. The 2025 workshop brought together developers of applications which rely extensively on tensor computations such as quantum many-body simulations in chemistry and physics (material science and electronic structure calculations), as well as developers and experts of tensor software who have the know-how to provide the technical support for such applications. The workshop enabled the community to provide feedback on the specified low-level interface and how it can be further refined. It also initiated a discussion on how the standardization efforts should be oriented in the near feature, in particular on what should be higher-level interfaces and how to tackle other requirements of the community such as tensor decompositions, symmetric tensors and structured sparsity support.</description>

      <title>Boundary values for the charge transferred during an electronic transition: insights from matrix analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.13465v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution we start by proving and generalizing a conjecture that has been established few decades ago, relating the value of the integral of the detachment/attachment density in two pictures - one accounting for transition-induced basis relaxation and one which does not account for such a relaxation. To this end, we show that it is possible to follow two ways: one combines Haynsworth and Courant-Fischer theorems with a corollary to Lidskii-Wielandt theorem, the other combines two twin theorems extending Cauchy's interlacing theorem, together with the abovementioned corollary to Lidskii-Wielandt theorem. These derivations allow us to provide an upper bound for the electronic charge that is effectively displaced during the molecular electronic transition from one electronic quantum state to another. This quantity can be regarded as the neat charge that has been transferred during the transition. Our derivations ultimately show that this boundary value can be determined from a simple singular value decomposition and at most two matrix trace-computing operations.</description>

      <title>Accurate and scalable exchange-correlation with deep learning</title>

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometry for Spin-Adapted Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and numerically analyze an algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory. Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride.</description>

      <title>Exponential quantum speedups for near-term molecular electronic structure methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove classical simulation hardness, under the generalized $\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$ conjecture, for quantum circuit families with applications in near-term chemical ground state estimation. The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum non-orthogonal multi-reference methods designed for near-term hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements between reference states. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of ansatz that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: linear combinations of orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and linear combinations of states prepared by generalized UCCSD circuits of polynomial depth, for which computing the expectation values of local fermionic observables up to a constant additive error is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete. We discuss the implications for achieving practical quantum advantage in resolving the electronic structure of catalytic systems composed from multivalent transition metal atoms using near-term quantum hardware.</description>
