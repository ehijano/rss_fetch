      <title>HADUA: Hierarchical Attention and Dynamic Uniform Alignment for Robust Cross-Subject Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust cross-subject emotion recognition from multimodal physiological signals remains a challenging problem, primarily due to modality heterogeneity and inter-subject distribution shift. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel adaptive learning framework named Hierarchical Attention and Dynamic Uniform Alignment (HADUA). Our approach unifies the learning of multimodal representations with domain adaptation. First, we design a hierarchical attention module that explicitly models intra-modal temporal dynamics and inter-modal semantic interactions (e.g., between electroencephalogram(EEG) and eye movement(EM)), yielding discriminative and semantically coherent fused features. Second, to overcome the noise inherent in pseudo-labels during adaptation, we introduce a confidence-aware Gaussian weighting scheme that smooths the supervision from target-domain samples by down-weighting uncertain instances. Third, a uniform alignment loss is employed to regularize the distribution of pseudo-labels across classes, thereby mitigating imbalance and stabilizing conditional distribution matching. Extensive experiments on multiple cross-subject emotion recognition benchmarks show that HADUA consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and robustness, validating its effectiveness in handling modality gaps, noisy pseudo-labels, and class imbalance. Taken together, these contributions offer a practical and generalizable solution for building robust cross-subject affective computing systems.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Fusion: Disentangled Learning of Shared and Modality-Specific Information for Stance Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal stance detection (MSD) aims to determine an author's stance toward a given target using both textual and visual content. While recent methods leverage multi-modal fusion and prompt-based learning, most fail to distinguish between modality-specific signals and cross-modal evidence, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose DiME (Disentangled Multi-modal Experts), a novel architecture that explicitly separates stance information into textual-dominant, visual-dominant, and cross-modal shared components. DiME first uses a target-aware Chain-of-Thought prompt to generate reasoning-guided textual input. Then, dual encoders extract modality features, which are processed by three expert modules with specialized loss functions: contrastive learning for modality-specific experts and cosine alignment for shared representation learning. A gating network adaptively fuses expert outputs for final prediction. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that DiME consistently outperforms strong unimodal and multi-modal baselines under both in-target and zero-shot settings.</description>

      <title>MIDI-LLaMA: An Instruction-Following Multimodal LLM for Symbolic Music Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLM) for audio music have demonstrated strong capabilities in music understanding, yet symbolic music, a fundamental representation of musical structure, remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce MIDI-LLaMA, the first instruction-following MLLM for symbolic music understanding. Our approach aligns the MIDI encoder MusicBERT and Llama-3-8B via a two-stage pipeline comprising feature alignment and instruction tuning. To support training, we design a scalable annotation pipeline that annotates GiantMIDI-Piano with fine-grained metadata, resulting in a MIDI-text dataset. Compared with the baseline trained on converting MIDI into ABC notation under the same instruction-tuning procedure, MIDI-LLaMA substantially outperforms in captioning and semantic alignment in question answering. Human evaluation further confirms the advantages of MIDI-LLaMA in music understanding, emotion recognition, creativity, and overall preference. These findings demonstrate that incorporating symbolic music into large language models enhances their capacity for musical understanding.</description>

      <title>ViTMAlis: Towards Latency-Critical Mobile Video Analytics with Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge-assisted mobile video analytics (MVA) applications are increasingly shifting from using vision models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to those built on vision transformers (ViTs) to leverage their superior global context modeling and generalization capabilities. However, deploying these advanced models in latency-critical MVA scenarios presents significant challenges. Unlike traditional CNN-based offloading paradigms where network transmission is the primary bottleneck, ViT-based systems are constrained by substantial inference delays, particularly for dense prediction tasks where the need for high-resolution inputs exacerbates the inherent quadratic computational complexity of ViTs. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic mixed-resolution inference strategy tailored for ViT-backboned dense prediction models, enabling flexible runtime trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Building on this, we introduce ViTMAlis, a ViT-native device-to-edge offloading framework that dynamically adapts to network conditions and video content to jointly reduce transmission and inference delays. We implement a fully functional prototype of ViTMAlis on commodity mobile and edge devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art accuracy-centric, content-aware, and latency-adaptive baselines, ViTMAlis significantly reduces end-to-end offloading latency while improving user-perceived rendering accuracy, providing a practical foundation for next-generation mobile intelligence.</description>

      <title>TraceRouter: Robust Safety for Large Foundation Models via Path-Level Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their capabilities, large foundation models (LFMs) remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Current defenses predominantly rely on the "locality hypothesis", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility. Our code will be publicly released. WARNING: This paper contains unsafe model responses.</description>

      <title>Vidmento: Creating Video Stories Through Context-Aware Expansion With Generative Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video storytelling is often constrained by available material, limiting creative expression and leaving undesired narrative gaps. Generative video offers a new way to address these limitations by augmenting captured media with tailored visuals. To explore this potential, we interviewed eight video creators to identify opportunities and challenges in integrating generative video into their workflows. Building on these insights and established filmmaking principles, we developed Vidmento, a tool for authoring hybrid video stories that combine captured and generated media through context-aware expansion. Vidmento surfaces opportunities for story development, generates clips that blend stylistically and narratively with surrounding media, and provides controls for refinement. In a study with 12 creators, Vidmento supported narrative development and exploration by systematically expanding initial materials with generative media, enabling expressive video storytelling aligned with creative intent. We highlight how creators bridge story gaps with generative content and where they find this blending capability most valuable.</description>

      <title>EditYourself: Audio-Driven Generation and Manipulation of Talking Head Videos with Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current generative video models excel at producing novel content from text and image prompts, but leave a critical gap in editing existing pre-recorded videos, where minor alterations to the spoken script require preserving motion, temporal coherence, speaker identity, and accurate lip synchronization. We introduce EditYourself, a DiT-based framework for audio-driven video-to-video (V2V) editing that enables transcript-based modification of talking head videos, including the seamless addition, removal, and retiming of visually spoken content. Building on a general-purpose video diffusion model, EditYourself augments its V2V capabilities with audio conditioning and region-aware, edit-focused training extensions. This enables precise lip synchronization and temporally coherent restructuring of existing performances via spatiotemporal inpainting, including the synthesis of realistic human motion in newly added segments, while maintaining visual fidelity and identity consistency over long durations. This work represents a foundational step toward generative video models as practical tools for professional video post-production.</description>

      <title>MusicWeaver: Composer-Style Structural Editing and Minute-Scale Coherent Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in music generation produce impressive samples, however, practical creation still lacks two key capabilities: composer-style structural editing and minute-scale coherence. We present MusicWeaver, a framework for generating and editing long-range music using a human-interpretable intermediate representation with guaranteed edit locality. MusicWeaver decomposes generation into two stages: it first predicts a structured plan, a multi-level song program encoding musical attributes that composers can directly edit, and then renders audio conditioned on this plan. To ensure minute-scale coherence, we introduce a Global-Local Diffusion Transformer, where a global path captures long-range musical progression via compressed representations and memory, while a local path synthesizes fine-grained acoustic detail. We further propose a Motif Memory Retrieval module that enables consistent motif recurrence with controllable variation. For editing, we propose Projected Diffusion Inpainting, an inpainting method that denoises only user-specified regions and preserves unchanged content, allowing repeated edits without drift. Finally, we introduce Structure Coherence Score and Edit Fidelity Score to evaluate long-range form and edit realization. Experiments demonstrate that MusicWeaver achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, controllability, and long-range coherence.</description>

      <title>Learning What To Hear: Boosting Sound-Source Association For Robust Audiovisual Instance Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audiovisual instance segmentation (AVIS) requires accurately localizing and tracking sounding objects throughout video sequences. Existing methods suffer from visual bias stemming from two fundamental issues: uniform additive fusion prevents queries from specializing to different sound sources, while visual-only training objectives allow queries to converge to arbitrary salient objects. We propose Audio-Centric Query Generation using cross-attention, enabling each query to selectively attend to distinct sound sources and carry sound-specific priors into visual decoding. Additionally, we introduce Sound-Aware Ordinal Counting (SAOC) loss that explicitly supervises sounding object numbers through ordinal regression with monotonic consistency constraints, preventing visual-only convergence during training. Experiments on AVISeg benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements: +1.64 mAP, +0.6 HOTA, and +2.06 FSLA, validating that query specialization and explicit counting supervision are crucial for accurate audiovisual instance segmentation.</description>

      <title>MotionBeat: Motion-Aligned Music Representation via Embodied Contrastive Learning and Bar-Equivariant Contact-Aware Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music is both an auditory and an embodied phenomenon, closely linked to human motion and naturally expressed through dance. However, most existing audio representations neglect this embodied dimension, limiting their ability to capture rhythmic and structural cues that drive movement. We propose MotionBeat, a framework for motion-aligned music representation learning. MotionBeat is trained with two newly proposed objectives: the Embodied Contrastive Loss (ECL), an enhanced InfoNCE formulation with tempo-aware and beat-jitter negatives to achieve fine-grained rhythmic discrimination, and the Structural Rhythm Alignment Loss (SRAL), which ensures rhythm consistency by aligning music accents with corresponding motion events. Architecturally, MotionBeat introduces bar-equivariant phase rotations to capture cyclic rhythmic patterns and contact-guided attention to emphasize motion events synchronized with musical accents. Experiments show that MotionBeat outperforms state-of-the-art audio encoders in music-to-dance generation and transfers effectively to beat tracking, music tagging, genre and instrument classification, emotion recognition, and audio-visual retrieval.

      <title>Listen, Look, Drive: Coupling Audio Instructions for User-aware VLA-based Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Action (VLA) models promise an open-vocabulary interface that can translate perceptual ambiguity into semantically grounded driving decisions, yet they still treat language as a static prior fixed at inference time. As a result, the model must infer continuously shifting objectives from pixels alone, yielding delayed or overly conservative maneuvers. We argue that effective VLAs for autonomous driving need an online channel in which users can influence driving with specific intentions. To this end, we present EchoVLA, a user-aware VLA that couples camera streams with in situ audio instructions. We augment the nuScenes dataset with temporally aligned, intent-specific speech commands generated by converting ego-motion descriptions into synthetic audios. Further, we compose emotional speech-trajectory pairs into a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for fine-tuning a Multimodal Large Model (MLM) based on Qwen2.5-Omni. Specifically, we synthesize the audio-augmented dataset with different emotion types paired with corresponding driving behaviors, leveraging the emotional cues embedded in tone, pitch, and speech tempo to reflect varying user states, such as urgent or hesitant intentions, thus enabling our EchoVLA to interpret not only the semantic content but also the emotional context of audio commands for more nuanced and emotionally adaptive driving behavior. In open-loop benchmarks, our approach reduces the average L2 error by $59.4\%$ and the collision rate by $74.4\%$ compared to the baseline of vision-only perception. More experiments on nuScenes dataset validate that EchoVLA not only steers the trajectory through audio instructions, but also modulates driving behavior in response to the emotions detected in the user's speech.</description>
