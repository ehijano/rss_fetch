      <title>Evolutionary dynamics under coordinated reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using past behaviors to guide future actions is essential for fostering cooperation in repeated social dilemmas. Traditional memory-based strategies that focus on recent interactions have yielded valuable insights into the evolution of cooperative behavior. However, as memory length increases, the complexity of analysis grows exponentially, since these strategies need to map every possible action sequence of a given length to subsequent responses. Due to their inherent reliance on exhaustive mapping and a lack of explicit information processing, it remains unclear how individuals can handle extensive interaction histories to make decisions under cognitive constraints. To fill this gap, we introduce coordinated reciprocity strategies ($CORE$), which incrementally evaluate the entire game history by tallying instances of consistent actions between individuals without storing round-to-round details. Once this consistency index surpasses a threshold, $CORE$ prescribes cooperation. Through equilibrium analysis, we derive an analytical condition under which $CORE$ constitutes an equilibrium. Moreover, our numerical results show that $CORE$ effectively promotes cooperation between variants of itself, and it outperforms a range of existing strategies including memory-$1$, memory-$2$, and those from a documented strategy library in evolutionary dynamics. Our work thus underscores the pivotal role of cumulative action consistency in enhancing cooperation, developing robust strategies, and offering cognitively low-burden information processing mechanisms in repeated social dilemmas.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis of an epidemic model with a mass vaccination program of a homogeneous population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic forced the rapid development of vaccines and the implementation of mass vaccination programs around the world. However, many hesitated to take the vaccine due to concerns about its effectiveness. By looking at an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of disease spread that incorporates a mass vaccination program, this study aims to determine the sensitivity of the cumulative count of infected individuals ($W$) and the cumulative death count ($D$) to the following model parameters: disease transmission rate ($\beta$), reciprocal of the disease latency period ($\kappa$), reciprocal of the infectious period ($\gamma$), death ratio ($\alpha$), vaccine efficacy rate ($r$), and vaccine rollout rate ($\delta$). This was implemented using Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation coefficient. Results show that $D$ is highly sensitive to $\alpha$ and shows increasing sensitivity to $\delta$ in the long run. On the other hand, $W$ is highly sensitive to $\kappa$ at the beginning of the simulation, but this weakens over time. In contrast, $W$ is not very sensitive to $\delta$ initially but becomes very significant in the long run. This supports the importance of the vaccine rollout rate over the vaccine efficacy rate in curbing the spread of the disease in the population. It is also worthwhile to reduce the death ratio by developing a cure for the disease or improving the healthcare system as a whole.</description>

      <title>Prebiotic Functional Programs: Endogenous Selection in an Artificial Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial chemistry simulations produce many intriguing emergent behaviors, but they are often difficult to steer or control. This paper proposes a method for steering the dynamics of a classic artificial chemistry model, known as AlChemy (Algorithmic Chemistry), which is based on untyped lambda calculus. Our approach leverages features that are endogenous to AlChemy without constructing an explicit external fitness function or building learning into the dynamics. We demonstrate the approach by synthesizing non-trivial lambda functions, such as Church addition and succession, from simple primitives. The results provide insight into the possibility of endogenous selection in diverse systems such as autocatalytic chemical networks and software systems.</description>

      <title>Mixed-feedback oscillations in the foraging dynamics of arboreal turtle ants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a model for the dynamics of the flow into and out of a nest for the arboreal turtle ant $\textit{Cephalotes goniodontus}$ during foraging to investigate a possible mechanism for the emergence of oscillations. In our model, there is mixed dynamic feedback between the flow of ants between different behavioral compartments and the amount of pheromone along trails. On one hand, the ants deposit pheromone along the trail, which provides a positive feedback by increasing rates of return to the nest. On the other hand, pheromone evaporation is a source of negative feedback, as it depletes the pheromone and inhibits the return rate. We prove that the model is globally asymptotically stable in the absence of pheromone feedback. Then we show that pheromone feedback can lead to a loss of stability of the equilibrium and onset of sustained oscillations in the flow in and out of the nest via a Hopf bifurcation. This analysis sheds light on a potential key mechanism that enables arboreal turtle ants to effectively optimize their trail networks to minimize traveled path lengths and eliminate graph cycles.</description>

      <title>Finding Inter-species Associations on Large Citizen Science Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining associations among different species from citizen science databases is challenging due to observer behavior and intrinsic density variations that give rise to correlations that do not imply species associations. This paper introduces a method that can efficiently analyze large datasets to extract likely species associations. It tiles space into small blocks chosen to be of the accuracy of the data coordinates, and reduces observations to presence/absence per tile, in order to compute pairwise overlaps. It compares these overlaps with a spatial Poisson process that serves as a null model. For each species $i$, an expected overlap $\mu_i$ is estimated by averaging normalized overlaps over other species in the same vicinity. This gives a $z$-score for significance of a species-species association and a correlation index for the strength of this association. This was tested on $874,263$ iNaturalist observations spanning $15,975$ non-avian taxa in the Santa Cruz, California region ($\approx 4.68\times10^{6}$ tiles). The method recovers well-known insect host-plant obligate relationships, particularly many host-gall relationships, as well as the relationship between Yerba Santa Beetles and California Yerba Santa. This approach efficiently finds associations on $\sim10^{8}$ species pairs on modest hardware, filtering correlations arising from heterogeneous spatial prevalence and user artifacts. It produces a ranked shortlist of ecological interactions that can be further pursued. Extensions to this method are possible, such as investigating the effects of time and elevation. It could also be useful in the determination of microhabitats and biomes.</description>
