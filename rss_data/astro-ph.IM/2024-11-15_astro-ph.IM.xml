      <title>Faint white dwarf flux standards: data and models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fainter standard stars are essential for the calibration of larger telescopes. This work adds to the CALSPEC (calibration spectra) database 19 faint white dwarfs (WDs) with all-sky coverage and V magnitudes between 16.5 and 18.7. Included for these stars is new UV (ultraviolet) HST (Hubble Space Telescope) STIS (Space Telescope Imaging Spectrometer) spectrophotometry between 1150 and 3000~\AA\ with a resolution of $\sim$500. Pure hydrogen WD models are fit to these UV spectra and to six-band HST/WFC3 (Wide Field Camera 3) photometry at 0.28 to 1.6~\micron\ to construct predicted model SEDs (spectral energy distributions) covering wavelengths from 900~\AA\ to the JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) limit of 30~\micron\ using well-established CALSPEC procedures for producing flux standards with the goal of 1\% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Progress towards a megapixel linear-mode avalanche photodiode array for ultra-low background shortwave infrared astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopy of Earth-like exoplanets and ultra-faint galaxies are priority science cases for the coming decades. Here, broadband source flux rates are measured in photons per square meter per hour, imposing extreme demands on detector performance, including dark currents lower than \mbox{1 e-/pixel/kilosecond}, read noise less than \mbox{1 e-/pixel/frame}, and large formats. There are currently no infrared detectors that meet these requirements. The University of Hawai'i and industrial partners are developing one promising technology, linear mode avalanche photodiodes (LmAPDs), which is on track to meet the above-mentioned requirements.
  We present progress towards developing a science-grade, megapixel format linear-mode avalanche photodiode array for low background shortwave (1 - 2.4 um) infrared astronomy. Our latest results show outstanding performance, with dark current \textless 1e-4 electrons/pixel/second and read noise reducing by 30\% per volt of bias, reaching less than 1e-/pixel/frame in correlated double-sampling, and able to average down to $\sim$0.3 e-/pixel/frame when using multiple non-destructive reads. We present some on-sky data as well as comment on prospects for photon number resolving capability.</description>

      <title>KMT-2021-BLG-0284, KMT-2022-BLG-2480, and KMT-2024-BLG-0412: Three microlensing events involving two lens masses and two source stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carried out a project involving the systematic analysis of microlensing data from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network survey. The aim of this project is to identify lensing events with complex anomaly features that are difficult to explain using standard binary-lens or binary-source models. Our investigation reveals that the light curves of microlensing events KMT-2021-BLG-0284, KMT-2022-BLG-2480, and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 display highly complex patterns with three or more anomaly features. These features cannot be adequately explained by a binary-lens (2L1S) model alone. However, the 2L1S model can effectively describe certain segments of the light curve. By incorporating an additional source into the modeling, we identified a comprehensive model that accounts for all the observed anomaly features. Bayesian analysis, based on constraints provided by lensing observables, indicates that the lenses of KMT-2021-BLG-0284 and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 are binary systems composed of M dwarfs. For KMT-2022-BLG-2480, the primary lens is an early K-type main-sequence star with an M dwarf companion. The lenses of KMT-2021-BLG-0284 and KMT-2024-BLG-0412 are likely located in the bulge, whereas the lens of KMT-2022-BLG-2480 is more likely situated in the disk. In all events, the binary stars of the sources have similar magnitudes due to a detection bias favoring binary source events with a relatively bright secondary source star, which increases detection efficiency.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous rotation of a nanosatellite FITSAT-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous rotation of an ultra-small satellite was observed and its driving torque was explained by the thermal interaction between the air molecules and the surfaces of the satellite heated by the radiation from the earth. This mechanism has the similarity with a usual radiometer, except the point that the velocity of the satellite is sufficiently faster than that of the thermal velocity of the air molecules, and that the mean free path of the air molecules is sufficiently longer than the characteristic length of the satellite. Using dimension analysis, the torque was found to be significant to a small size of satellite. This rotation mechanism can be applied to any small objects, which are revolting around a planet radiating a black body radiation and has the atmospheric gas.</description>

      <title>Constraint on Lorentz Invariance Violation for spectral lag transition in GRB 160625B using profile likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reanalyze the spectral lag data for of GRB 160625B using frequentist inference to constrain the energy scale ($E_{QG}$) of Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). For this purpose, we use profile likelihood to deal with the astrophysical nuisance parameters. This is in contrast to Bayesian inference implemented in previous works, where marginalization was carried out over the nuisance parameters. We show that with profile likelihood, we do not find a global minimum for $\chi^2$ as a function of $E_{QG}$ below the Planck scale for both the linear and quadratic models of LIV, whereas bounded credible intervals were obtained using Bayesian inference. Therefore, we can set lower limits in a straightforward manner. We find that $E_{QG} \geq 3.7 \times 10^{16}$ GeV and $E_{QG} \geq 2.6 \times 10^7$ GeV at 68\% c.l., for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively. Therefore, this is the first proof of principles application of profile likelihood method to the analysis of GRB spectral lag data to constrain LIV.</description>

      <title>Compression Method for Solar Polarization Spectra Collected from Hinode SOT/SP Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex structure and extensive details of solar spectral data, combined with a recent surge in volume, present significant processing challenges. To address this, we propose a deep learning-based compression technique using deep autoencoder (DAE) and 1D-convolutional autoencoder (CAE) models developed with Hinode SOT/SP data. We focused on compressing Stokes I and V polarization spectra from the quiet Sun, as well as from active regions, providing a novel insight into comprehensive spectral analysis by incorporating spectra from extreme magnetic fields. The results indicate that the CAE model outperforms the DAE model in reconstructing Stokes profiles, demonstrating greater robustness and achieving reconstruction errors around the observational noise level. The proposed method has proven effective in compressing Stokes I and V spectra from both the quiet Sun and active regions, highlighting its potential for impactful applications in solar spectral analysis, such as detection of unusual spectral signals.</description>

      <title>Solar flares in the Solar Orbiter Era: Short exposure EUI/FSI observations of STIX flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of short-exposure extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations of solar flares in the study of particle acceleration, heating and energy partition in flares. This work highlights the observations now available from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instrument suite onboard Solar Orbiter while operating in short exposure mode.
  Methods: A selection of noteworthy flares observed simultaneously by the Spectrometer Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) and the Full Sun Imager of EUI (EUI/FSI) are detailed. New insights are highlighted and potential avenues of investigation are demonstrated, including forward modelling the atmospheric response to a non-thermal beam of electrons using the RADYN 1D hydrodynamic code, in order to compare the predicted and observed EUV emission.
  Results: The examples given in this work demonstrate that short exposure EUI/FSI observations are providing important diagnostics during flares. A dataset of more than 9000 flares observed by STIX (from November 2022 until December 2023) with at least one short exposure EUI/FSI 174 \r{A} image is currently available. The observations reveal that the brightest parts of short-exposure observations consist of substructure in flaring ribbons which spatially overlap with the hard X-ray emission observed by STIX in the majority of cases. We show that these observations provide an opportunity to further constrain the electron energy flux required for flare modelling, among other potential applications.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Cosmic Rays and Associated MeV Gamma-Ray Emissions in the Protoplanetary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-energy cosmic rays (LECRs) play a crucial role in the formation of planetary systems, and detecting and reconstructing the properties of early LECRs is essential for understanding the mechanisms of planetary system formation. Given that LECRs interact with the surrounding medium to produce nuclear de-excitation line emissions, which are gamma-ray emissions with energy mainly within 0.1--10 MeV and are unaffected by stellar wind modulation, these emissions can accurately reflect the properties of LECRs. This study introduces an innovative method for using gamma-ray emissions to infer LECR properties. We employed the Parker transport equation to simulate the propagation and spectral evolution of LECRs in a protoplanetary disk and calculated the characteristic gamma-ray emissions resulting from interactions between LECRs and disk material. These gamma-ray emissions encapsulate the spectral information of LECRs, providing a powerful tool to reconstruct the cosmic ray environment at that time. This method, supported by further theoretical developments and observations, will fundamentally enhance our understanding of the impact of CRs on the origin and evolution of planetary systems and address significant scientific questions regarding the cosmic ray environment at the origin of life.</description>

      <title>FANSIC: a Fast ANalog SiPM Integrated Circuit for the readout of large silicon photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon photo-multipliers (SiPM) have been replacing traditional photomultiplier tubes in most light sensing applications. However, when large detection surface coverage is needed, photomultipliers (PMTs) are still the preferred choice. The main reasons are the sensor thermal noise and the duration of the fast component of its signal, both increasing with the sensor surface. In this work we propose an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), called Fast ANalog SiPM Integrated Circuit (FANSIC), for the readout of large SiPMs addressing these limitations. The ASIC has an active summation stage, which allows to divide a large detection surface into smaller ones offering faster response both in single ended and differential outputs. The high input bandwidth allows to reach full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) signals or the order of 3--5 ns which limits the impact of internal and external uncorrelated noise. The results of the first implementation of FANSIC, designed in CMOS 65 nm technology, is described in this paper.</description>

      <title>Skipper-in-CMOS: Non-Destructive Readout with Sub-Electron Noise Performance for Pixel Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Skipper-in-CMOS image sensor integrates the non-destructive readout capability of Skipper Charge Coupled Devices (Skipper-CCDs) with the high conversion gain of a pinned photodiode in a CMOS imaging process, while taking advantage of in-pixel signal processing. This allows both single photon counting as well as high frame rate readout through highly parallel processing. The first results obtained from a 15 x 15 um^2 pixel cell of a Skipper-in-CMOS sensor fabricated in Tower Semiconductor's commercial 180 nm CMOS Image Sensor process are presented. Measurements confirm the expected reduction of the readout noise with the number of samples down to deep sub-electron noise of 0.15rms e-, demonstrating the charge transfer operation from the pinned photodiode and the single photon counting operation when the sensor is exposed to light. The article also discusses new testing strategies employed for its operation and characterization.</description>

      <title>Modeling the refractive index profile n(z) of polar ice for ultra-high energy neutrino experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed an in-situ index of refraction profile n(z) for cold polar ice, using the transit times of radio signals broadcast from an englacial transmitter to 2-5 km distant radio-frequency receivers, deployed at depths up to 200 m. For propagation through a non-uniform medium, Maxwell's equations generally admit two ray propagation solutions from a given transmitter, corresponding to a direct path (D) and a refracted or reflected path (R); the measured D vs. R timing differences (dt(D,R)) are determined by the refractive index profile. We constrain n(z) near South Pole, where the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) neutrino observatory is located, by simulating D and R ray paths via ray tracing and comparing simulations to measured dt(D,R) values. Using previous ice density data as a proxy for n(z), we demonstrate that our data strongly favors a glaciologically-motivated three-phase densification model rather than a single exponential scale height model. Effective volume simulations for a detector of ARA station antenna depths yield a 14\% increase in neutrino sensitivity over a range of $10^{17} - 10^{21}$ eV using the three-phase model compared to a single exponential.</description>

      <title>Astronomaly Protege: Discovery Through Human-Machine Collaboration</title>

Abstract: Modern telescopes generate catalogs of millions of objects with the potential for new scientific discoveries, but this is beyond what can be examined visually. Here we introduce Astronomaly: Protege, an extension of the general purpose machine learning-based active anomaly detection framework Astronomaly. Protege is designed to provide well-selected recommendations for visual inspection, based on a small amount of optimized human labeling. The resulting sample contains rare or unusual sources which are simultaneously as diverse as the human trainer chooses, and of scientific interest to them. We train Protege on images from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey, leveraging the self-supervised deep learning algorithm Bootstrap Your Own Latent to find a low-dimensional representation of the radio galaxy cutouts. By operating in this feature space, Protege is able to recommend interesting sources with completely different morphologies in image space to those it has been trained on. This provides important advantages over similarity searches, which can only find more examples of known sources, or blind anomaly detection, which selects unusual, but not necessarily scientifically interesting sources. Using an evaluation subset, we show that, with minimal training, Protege provides excellent recommendations and find that it is even able to recommend sources that the authors missed. We briefly highlight some of Protege's top recommendations, which include X- and circular-shaped sources, filamentary structures and one-sided structures. These results illustrate the power of an optimized human-machine collaboration such as Protege to make unexpected discoveries in samples beyond human-accessible scales.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Object Accessibility and Mission Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs) represent a compelling and under-explored category of celestial bodies, providing physical laboratories to understand the formation of our solar system and probe the composition and properties of material formed in exoplanetary systems. In this work, we investigate existing approaches to designing successful flyby missions to ISOs, including a deep learning-driven guidance and control algorithm for ISOs traveling at velocities over 60 km/s. We have generated spacecraft trajectories to a series of synthetic representative ISOs, simulating a ground campaign to observe the target and resolve its state, thereby determining the cruise and close approach delta-Vs required for the encounter. We discuss the accessibility of and mission design to ISOs with varying characteristics, with special focuses on 1) state covariance estimation throughout the cruise, 2) handoffs from traditional navigation approaches to novel autonomous navigation for fast flyby regimes, and 3) overall recommendations about preparing for the future in situ exploration of these targets. The lessons learned also apply to the fast flyby of other small bodies, e.g., long-period comets and potentially hazardous asteroids, which also require tactical responses with similar characteristics.</description>

      <title>Dual balanced readout for scattered light noise mitigation in Michelson interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to detect the minuscule distance change between test masses caused by gravitational waves. Stray light that scatters back into the interferometer causes transient signals that can cover the same frequency range as a potential gravitational wave signal. Scattered light noise is a potentially limiting factor in current and future detectors thus making it relevant to find new ways to mitigate it. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a technique for the subtraction of scattered light noise from the displacement readout of a Michelson interferometer. It is based on using a balanced homodyne detector at both the symmetric and the antisymmetric port. While we have been able to demonstrate a noise reduction of \SI{13.2}{\decibel}, the readout scheme seems to be only limited by the associated noise couplings, with no theoretical limit to the scattered light suppression itself other than shot noise. We also discuss challenges for using the dual balanced homodyne detection scheme in more complex interferometer topologies, which could lead to improvements in scattered light noise mitigation of gravitational wave detectors.</description>
