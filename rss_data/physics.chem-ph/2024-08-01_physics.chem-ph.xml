      <title>Non-markovian neural quantum propagator and its application to the simulation of ultrafast nonlinear spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate solution of dissipative quantum dynamics plays an important role on the simulation of open quantum systems. Here we propose a machine-learning-based universal solver for the hierarchical equations of motion, one of the most widely used approaches which takes into account non-markovian effects and nonperturbative system-environment interactions in a numerically exact manner. We develop a neural quantum propagator model by utilizing the neural network architecture, which avoids time-consuming iterations and can be used to evolve any initial quantum state for arbitrarily long times. To demonstrate the efficacy of our model, we apply it to the simulation of population dynamics and linear and two-dimensional spectra of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Liquid State Modeling from Experimental Scattering Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This doctoral thesis is founded on the central notion that structural correlations in dense fluids, such as dense gases, liquids, and glasses, are directly related to fundamental interatomic forces. This relationship was identified early in the development of statistical theories of fluids through the mathematical formulations of Gibbs in the 1910s. However, it took nearly 80 years before practical implementations of structure-based theories became widely used for interpreting and understanding the atomic structures of fluids from experimental X-ray and neutron scattering data. The breakthrough in successfully applying structure-potential relations is largely attributed to the advancements in molecular mechanics simulations and the enhancement of computational resources. Despite advancements in understanding the relationship between structure and interatomic forces, a significant gap remains. Current techniques for interpreting experimental scattering measurements are widely used, yet there is little evidence that they yield physically accurate predictions for interatomic forces. In fact, it is generally assumed that these methods produce interatomic forces that poorly model the atomistic and thermodynamic behavior of fluids, rendering them unreliable and non-transferable. This thesis aims to address these limitations by refining the statistical theory, computational methods, and philosophical approach to structure-based analyses, thereby developing more robust and accurate techniques for characterizing structure-potential relationships.</description>

      <title>Nanostructured Fe2O3/CuxO Heterojunction for Enhanced Solar Redox Flow Battery Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar redox flow batteries (SRFB) have received much attention as an alternative integrated technology for simultaneous conversion and storage of solar energy. Yet, the photocatalytic efficiency of semiconductor-based single photoelectrode, such as hematite, remains low due to the trade-off between fast electron hole recombination and insufficient light utilization, as well as inferior reaction kinetics at the solid/liquid interface. Herein, we present an {\alpha}-Fe2O3/CuxO p-n junction, coupled with a readily scalable nanostructure, that increases the electrochemically active sites and improves charge separation. Thanks to light-assisted scanning electrochemical microscopy (Photo-SECM), we elucidate the morphology-dependent carrier transfer process involved in the photo-oxidation reaction at a {\alpha}-Fe2O3 photoanode. The optimized nanostructured is then exploited in the {\alpha}-Fe2O3/CuxO p-n junction, achieving an outstanding unbiased photocurrent density of 0.46 mA/cm2, solar-to-chemical (STC) efficiency over 0.35% and a stable photocharge-discharge cycling. The average solar-to-output energy efficiency (SOEE) for this unassisted {\alpha}-Fe2O3-based SRFB system reaches 0.18%, comparable to previously reported DSSC-assisted hematite SRFBs. The use of earth-abundant materials and the compatibility with scalable nanostructuring and heterojunction preparation techniques, offer promising opportunities for cost-effective device deployment in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Simulating Vibrationally-Resolved X-ray Photoelectron Spectra of Flexible Molecules: Linear Alkanes C$_{n}$H$_{2n+2}$ ($n$=1-8)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We integrated full core-hole density functional theory with Franck-Condon calculations, considering Duschinsky rotation, to simulate vibrationally-resolved C1s X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of eight linear alkanes, from methane to octane (C$_{n}$H$_{2n+2}$, $n$=1--8). Results align excellently with experimental absolute binding energies and profiles. The spectrum of ethane serves as a ``spectral seed'', with each longer alkane's atom-specific spectrum displaying similar characteristics, albeit with shifts and slight intensity adjustments. Detailed assignments clarify the distinct spectra in short alkanes ($n$=1--4) and their stabilization in long alkanes ($n$=5--8). Carbons are classified as central or distal (C$_1$ and C$_2$), with central carbons contributing nearly identically to the lowest-energy feature A, while distal carbons contribute to the second lowest-energy feature B (both are 0-0 transitions). Increasing molecule size adds more central carbons, enhancing feature A and weakening feature B. Our analysis identifies two dominant Franck-Condon-active vibrations: C$^*$--H stretching ($\sim$3400-3500 cm$^{-1}$) and bending ($\sim$1400-1500 cm$^{-1}$) modes. Structural analysis shows that core ionization minimally affects alkane geometry, less than in ring compounds from previous studies. This work extends our protocol from rigid ring compounds to flexible molecules, contributing to building a high-resolution theoretical XPS library and enhancing the understanding of vibronic coupling.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Probing of Coherent Vibrational Dynamics in CBr$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coherent vibrational wavepacket is launched and manipulated in the symmetric stretch (a$_1$) mode of CBr$_4$, by impulsive stimulated Raman scattering from non-resonant 400 nm laser pump pulses with various peak intensities on the order of tens of 10$^{12}$ W/cm$^2$. Extreme ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) records the wavepacket dynamics as temporal oscillations in XUV absorption energy at the bromine M$_{4,5}$ 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ edges around 70 eV. The results are augmented by nuclear time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation simulations. Slopes of the (Br-3d$_{3/2,5/2}$)$^{-1}$10a$_1^*$ core-excited state potential energy surface (PES) along the a$_1$ mode are calculated to be -9.4 eV/{\AA} from restricted open-shell Kohn-Sham calculations. Using analytical relations derived for the small-displacement limit with the calculated slopes of the core-excited state PES, a deeper insight into the vibrational dynamics is obtained by retrieving the experimental excursion amplitude of the vibrational wavepacket and the amount of population transferred to the vibrational first-excited state, as a function of pump-pulse peak intensity. Experimentally, the results show that XUV ATAS is capable of easily resolving oscillations in the XUV absorption energy on the order of few to tens of meV and tens of femtosecond time precision, limited only by the averaging times in the experimental scans. This corresponds to oscillations of C-Br bond length on the order of 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-3}$ {\AA}. The results and the analytic relationships offer a clear physical picture, on multiple levels of understanding, for how the pump-pulse intensity controls the vibrational dynamics launched by non-resonant ISRS in the small-displacement limit.</description>

      <title>Temporal Subspace Clustering for Molecular Dynamics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MOSCITO (MOlecular Dynamics Subspace Clustering with Temporal Observance), a subspace clustering for molecular dynamics data. MOSCITO groups those timesteps of a molecular dynamics trajectory together into clusters in which the molecule has similar conformations. In contrast to state-of-the-art methods, MOSCITO takes advantage of sequential relationships found in time series data. Unlike existing work, MOSCITO does not need a two-step procedure with tedious post-processing, but directly models essential properties of the data. Interpreting clusters as Markov states allows us to evaluate the clustering performance based on the resulting Markov state models. In experiments on 60 trajectories and 4 different proteins, we show that the performance of MOSCITO achieves state-of-the-art performance in a novel single-step method. Moreover, by modeling temporal aspects, MOSCITO obtains better segmentation of trajectories, especially for small numbers of clusters.</description>

      <title>Diffracting molecular matter-waves at deep-ultraviolet standing-light waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry with molecules is intriguing both because it demonstrates a fundamental quantum phenomenon and because it opens avenues to quantum-enhanced measurements in physical chemistry. One great challenge in such experiments is to establish matter-wave beam splitting mechanisms that are efficient and applicable to a wide range of particles. In the past, continuous standing light waves in the visible spectral range were used predominantly as phase gratings, while pulsed vacuum ultraviolet light found applications in photo-ionisation gratings. Here, we explore the regime of continuous, intense deep-ultraviolet ($\rm &gt;1 MW/cm^2$, $\rm 266\,nm$) light masks, where a rich variety of photo-physical and photo-chemical phenomena and relaxation pathways must be considered. The improved understanding of the mechanisms in this interaction opens new potential pathways to protein interferometry and to matter-wave enhanced sensing of molecular properties.</description>

      <title>Line tension from dual-geometry sessile droplet measurements: Combining contact angle size dependence data for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets to determine the line tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a thermodynamic analysis of various contributions to the size dependence of the contact angle cosine for axisymmetric and cylindrical sessile droplets. This shows that a widely used method to determine the line tension from the slope of the contact angle cosine dependence on the three-phase contact line curvature (for axisymmetric droplets) provides a certain combination of the line tension, adsorptions at the three interfaces, and the macroscopic contact angle. To extract the leading-order contact-line-related contribution and determine the line tension, we propose a simple technique using contact angle size dependences for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets at the same conditions.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the elEmBERT model for chemical classification tasks. It is based on deep learning techniques, such as a multilayer encoder architecture. We demonstrate the opportunities offered by our approach on sets of organic, inorganic and crystalline compounds. In particular, we developed and tested the model using the Matbench and Moleculenet benchmarks, which include crystal properties and drug design-related benchmarks. We also conduct an analysis of vector representations of chemical compounds, shedding light on the underlying patterns in structural data. Our model exhibits exceptional predictive capabilities and proves universally applicable to molecular and material datasets. For instance, on the Tox21 dataset, we achieved an average precision of 96%, surpassing the previously best result by 10%.</description>

      <title>Experimental and theoretical justifications for the observed discriminations between enantiomers of prochiral alcohols by chirally blind EI-MS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01141v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To all appearances, electron impact mass spectrometer (EI-MS) is considered a "chirally blind" instrument. Yet, numerous non-identical R (right) and S (left) configurations of prochiral alcohols' mass spectra alcohols have appeared in the literature with almost no justification. Such observations are often attributed to impurities, experimental circumstances, inaccurate measurements, etc. In an experimental attempt to explain this phenomenon, here we have avoided the above mentioned pitfalls by conducting control experiments using different pure enantiomers under the same circumstances. Hence, we report the mass spectra of R- and S-enantiomers of 2-octanol (1R, 1S) and 1-octyn-3-ol (2R, 2S) collected by running 20 independent experiments for each R- and S-enantiomer. Statistical analyses confirmed that the peak intensities were significant to an acceptable level of confidence. The 1R and 1S enantiomers were separated reasonably in the PC space, implying that the chirally blind EI-MS is able to discriminate between R and S prochiral alcohols. Theoretically, self-complexation through H-bonding for S (or R) appears to give a new chiral center at the H-bonded oxygen atom, producing a new dimeric pair of diastereomers SRS and SSS (or RRR and RSR) before ionization, and SRS.+ and SSS.+ (or RRR.+ and RSR.+) after ionization. The results of our calculations have explicitly shown that these hydrogen bonds formed. Interestingly, the latter four ionized diastereomers appear with different structural and thermodynamic parameters at the M06-2X/6-311++g (d,p) level of theory.</description>

      <title>Grappa -- A Machine Learned Molecular Mechanics Force Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating large molecular systems over long timescales requires force fields that are both accurate and efficient. In recent years, E(3) equivariant neural networks have lifted the tension between computational efficiency and accuracy of force fields, but they are still several orders of magnitude more expensive than established molecular mechanics (MM) force fields. Here, we propose Grappa, a machine learning framework to predict MM parameters from the molecular graph, employing a graph attentional neural network and a transformer with symmetry-preserving positional encoding. The resulting Grappa force field outperformstabulated and machine-learned MM force fields in terms of accuracy at the same computational efficiency and can be used in existing Molecular Dynamics (MD) engines like GROMACS and OpenMM. It predicts energies and forces of small molecules, peptides, RNA and - showcasing its extensibility to uncharted regions of chemical space - radicals at state-of-the-art MM accuracy. We demonstrate Grappa's transferability to macromolecules in MD simulations from a small fast folding protein up to a whole virus particle. Our force field sets the stage for biomolecular simulations closer to chemical accuracy, but with the same computational cost as established protein force fields.</description>

      <title>Topological Woodward-Hoffmann classification for cycloadditions in polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of cycloaddition mechanisms is central to the fabrication of extended sp2 carbon nanostructures. Reaction modeling in this context has focused mostly on putative, energetically preferred, exothermic products with limited consideration for symmetry allowed or forbidden mechanistic effects. Here, we introduce a scheme for classifying symmetry-forbidden reaction coordinates in Woodward-Hoffmann correlation diagrams. Topological classifiers grant access to the study of reaction pathways and correlation diagrams in the same footing, for the purpose of elucidating mechanisms and products of polycyclic aromatic azomethine ylide (PAMY) cycloadditions with pentacene-yielding polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with an isoindole core in the solid-state and on surfaces as characterized by mass spectrometry and scanning tunneling microscopy, respectively. By means of a tight-binding reaction model and density functional theory (DFT) we find topologically-allowed pathways if a product is endothermic, and topologically-forbidden if a product is exothermic. Our work unveils topological classification as a crucial element for reaction modeling for nanographene engineering, and highlights its fundamental role in the design of cycloadditions in on-surface and solid-state chemical reactions, while underscoring that exothermic pathways can be topologically-forbidden.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Simulation of Anharmonic Rattler Dynamics in Type-I Clathrates with Vibrational Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use vibrational dynamical mean-field theory (VDMFT) to study the vibrational structure of type-I clathrate solids, specifically X$_8$Ga$_{16}$Ge$_{30}$, where X=Ba,Sr. These materials are cage-like chemical structures hosting loosely bound guest atoms, resulting in strong anharmonicity, short phonon lifetimes, and ultra-low thermal conductivities. Presenting the methodological developments necessary for this first application to three-dimensional, atomistic materials, we validate our approach through comparison to molecular dynamics simulations and show that VDMFT is extremely accurate at a fraction of the cost. Through the use of nonperturbative methods, we find that anharmonicity is dominated by four-phonon and higher-order scattering processes, and it causes rattler modes to shift up in frequency by 50% (10 cm$^{-1}$) and to have lifetimes of less than 1 ps; this behavior is not captured by traditional perturbation theory. Furthermore, we analyze the phonon self-energy and find that anharmonicity mixes guest rattling modes and cage acoustic modes, significantly changing the character of the harmonic phonons.</description>
