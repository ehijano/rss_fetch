      <title>The modulated Fourier expansion for waves propagating through time-modulated media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling waves by actively changing the material parameters of a medium enables the development of new acoustic and electrical devices. Modulating the material breaks classical properties like reciprocity and the conservation of energy, which complicates the mathematical analysis. Without a limiting amplitude principle, time-harmonic formulations are generally inapplicable. The present manuscript develops an alternative tool for the time-modulated acoustic wave equation, that is based on a modulated Fourier expansion (MFE). The solution is characterized by multiple smoothly varying coefficient functions, which solve a coupled system of evolutionary partial differential equations with temporally constant coefficients. For small-amplitude fast-time modulations, this system of evolutionary partial differential equations is shown to possess a smoothly varying solution, which characterizes the exact solution up to a small defect.
  Discretization of the derived coupled system yields integrators that are stable and accurate when larger time steps are used, compared to those schemes that are applied to the time-modulated acoustic wave equation directly. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results and the use of the approach.</description>

      <title>Geometric Kernel Interpolation and Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting the variational interpretation of kernel interpolation we exhibit a direct connection between interpolation and regression, where interpolation appears as a limiting case of regression. By applying this framework to point clouds or samples of smooth manifolds (hypersurfaces, in particular), we show how fundamental geometric quantities such as tangent plane and principal curvatures can be computed numerically using a kernel based (approximate) level set function (often a defining function) for smooth hypersurfaces. In the case of point clouds, the approach generates an interpolated hypersurface, which is an approximation of the underlying manifold when the cloud is a sample of it. It is shown how the geometric quantities obtained can be used in the numerical approximation/computation of geometric operators like the surface gradient or the Laplace-Beltrami operator in the spirit of kernel based meshfree methods. Kernel based interpolation can be extremely ill-posed, especially when using smooth kernels, and the regression approximation offers a natural regularization that proves also quite useful when dealing with geometric or functional data that are affected by errors or noise.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence rate of the explicit adaptive time-stepping methods for stochastic diffusion systems with locally Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive time-stepping mothods for stochastic diffusion systems whose drift and diffusion coefficients are locally Lipschitz continuous and may exhibit polynomial growth. By controlling the growth of both the drift and diffusion coefficients, we give the choice of the state-dependent adaptive timestep and establish strong convergence of the proposed scheme with the optimal order $1/2$. The performance of the adaptive time-stepping scheme is compared with several widely used explicit and implicit schemes, including tamed EM, truncated EM, and backward EM schemes. Numerical experiments on stiff, non-stiff and high-dimensional stochastic diffusion systems verify the improved computational efficiency of the proposed scheme and validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Entropy analysis and entropy stable DG methods for the shallow water moment equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the shallow water moment equations satisfy an auxiliary entropy conservation law, where the entropy function corresponds to the total energy. Additionally, we show that the classical Newtonian slip friction and Manning friction terms are entropy dissipative with respect to the developed entropy variables. The results from the continuous entropy analysis are used to construct an entropy stable and well-balanced nodal discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method for the spatial approximation. Key to ensure the entropy stability of the scheme is the derivation of entropy conservative numerical fluxes that satisfy a discrete version of the entropy flux compatibility condition. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the performance of the scheme and validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Low-Rank Ensemble Kalman filter for State/Parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Dynamical Low-Rank Ensemble Kalman Filter (DLR-ENKF) for efficient joint state-parameter estimation in high-dimensional dynamical systems. The method extends the DLR-ENKF formulation of arXiv:2509.11210 to the augmented state-parameter framework, tracking the filtering density within a dynamically evolving low-dimensional subspace. Key developments include a time-integration strategy that combines the Basis Update &amp; Galerkin scheme with forecast/analysis discretisation, and a DEIM-based hyper-reduction technique for efficient evaluation of nonlinear terms. We demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and computational advantages of the proposed approach on benchmark problems. The results highlight the potential of dynamically evolving reduced bases to achieve accurate filtering and parameter estimation at reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>On the Role of the Double Fourier Sphere Method in Fast Algorithms on SO(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the Double Fourier Sphere (DFS) method on the rotation group $\mathcal{SO}(3)$ in the frequency domain and demonstrate its central role in fast algorithms. Fast Fourier algorithms on $\mathcal{SO}(3)$ are commonly formulated as a Wigner transform - mapping harmonic to Fourier coefficients - followed by a Fourier transform. We revisit this formulation and interpret the Wigner transform as an explicit realization of the DFS method, lifting functions from $\mathcal{SO}(3)$ to $\mathbb{T}^3$. In this context, we analyze the Sobolev regularity loss induced by this lifting. Furthermore, we compare different Wigner transform implementations, examine additional symmetry enhancements, and observe that the direct method is often faster and more stable than the fast polynomial transform approaches.</description>

      <title>Laguerre-Sobolev orthogonal Polynomials and Boundary Value Problems on a semi-infinite domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of Laguerre--Sobolev orthogonal polynomials associated with a Sobolev inner product arising from second--order boundary value problems on the semi--infinite interval $(0,+\infty)$. These polynomials generate an orthogonal basis of test functions vanishing at the endpoints and are especially well suited for the spectral approximation of Schr\"odinger--type problems with singular potentials. Explicit connection formulas with classical Laguerre polynomials are obtained, together with recurrence relations and asymptotic properties of the corresponding coefficients. A generating function involving Bessel functions is also derived. As an application, we develop a fully diagonalized Laguerre--Sobolev spectral method for Dirichlet problems with singular potentials. The method avoids the solution of linear systems and can be implemented recursively. Numerical experiments for a Schr\"odinger--type equation with inverse--distance potential confirm spectral accuracy and exponential convergence.</description>

      <title>Dynamical low-rank approximation for the semiclassical Schrodinger equation with uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dynamical low-rank (DLR) approximation framework for solving the semiclassical Schrodinger equation with uncertainties. The primary numerical challenges arise from the dual nature of the oscillations: the spatial oscillations inherent in the semiclassical limit and the high-frequency oscillations in the random space induced by uncertainties. We extend two robust integrators -- the projector-splitting integrator and the unconventional integrator -- to the semiclassical regime to evolve the solution on a low-rank manifold. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the DLR method is significantly more computationally efficient than the standard stochastic Galerkin method, as it captures the essential quantum dynamics using a much smaller number of basis functions. Our findings reveal that despite the complex oscillatory patterns of the wave function, its evolution remains concentrated in a low-rank subspace for the cases investigated. Specifically, we observe that the DLR method achieves high fidelity with a remarkably small numerical rank, which remains robust even as the semiclassical parameter $\varepsilon$ decreases. Within our problem settings, the results further suggest that the rank growth is primarily driven by the randomness and regularity of the potential. These results provide practical insights into the low-rank structure of uncertain quantum systems and offer an efficient approach for high-dimensional uncertainty quantification in the semiclassical regime.</description>

      <title>Are Deep Learning Based Hybrid PDE Solvers Reliable? Why Training Paradigms and Update Strategies Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based hybrid iterative methods (DL-HIMs) integrate classical numerical solvers with neural operators, utilizing their complementary spectral biases to accelerate convergence. Despite this promise, many DL-HIMs stagnate at false fixed points where neural updates vanish while the physical residual remains large, raising questions about reliability in scientific computing. In this paper, we provide evidence that performance is highly sensitive to training paradigms and update strategies, even when the neural architecture is fixed. Through a detailed study of a DeepONet-based hybrid iterative numerical transferable solver (HINTS) and an FFT-based Fourier neural solver (FNS), we show that significant physical residuals can persist when training objectives are not aligned with solver dynamics and problem physics. We further examine Anderson acceleration (AA) and demonstrate that its classical form is ill-suited for nonlinear neural operators. To overcome this, we introduce physics-aware Anderson acceleration (PA-AA), which minimizes the physical residual rather than the fixed-point update. Numerical experiments confirm that PA-AA restores reliable convergence in substantially fewer iterations. These findings provide a concrete answer to ongoing controversies surrounding AI-based PDE solvers: reliability hinges not only on architectures but on physically informed training and iteration design.</description>

      <title>$hp$-a posteriori error estimates for hybrid high-order methods applied to biharmonic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a residual-based $hp$-a posteriori error estimator for hybrid high-order (HHO) methods on simplicial meshes applied to the biharmonic problem posed on two- and three-dimensional polytopal Lipschitz domains. The a posteriori error estimator hinges on an error decomposition into conforming and nonconforming components. To bound the nonconforming error, we use a $C^1$-partition of unity constructed via Alfeld splittings, combined with local Helmholtz decompositions on vertex stars. For the conforming error, we design two residual-based estimators, each associated with a specific interpolation operator. In the first setting, the upper bound for the conforming error involves only the stabilization term and the data oscillation. In the second setting, the bound additionally incorporates bulk residuals, normal flux jumps, and tangential jumps. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed estimators.</description>

      <title>Single- and Multi-Level Fourier-RQMC Methods for Multivariate Shortfall Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate shortfall risk measures provide a principled framework for quantifying systemic risk and determining capital allocations prior to aggregation in interconnected financial systems. Despite their well established theoretical properties, the numerical estimation of multivariate shortfall risk and the corresponding optimal allocations remains computationally challenging, as existing Monte Carlo based approaches can be numerically expensive due to slow convergence.
  In this work, we develop a new class of single and multilevel numerical algorithms for estimating multivariate shortfall risk and the associated optimal allocations, based on a combination of Fourier inversion techniques and randomized quasi Monte Carlo (RQMC) sampling. Rather than operating in physical space, our approach evaluates the relevant expectations appearing in the risk constraint and its optimization in the frequency domain, where the integrands exhibit enhanced smoothness properties that are well suited for RQMC integration. We establish a rigorous mathematical framework for the resulting Fourier RQMC estimators, including convergence analysis and computational complexity bounds. Beyond the single level method, we introduce a multilevel RQMC scheme that exploits the geometric convergence of the underlying deterministic optimization algorithm to reduce computational cost while preserving accuracy.
  Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed Fourier RQMC methods outperform sample average approximation and stochastic optimization benchmarks in terms of accuracy and computational cost across a range of models for the risk factors and loss structures. Consistent with the theoretical analysis, these results demonstrate improved asymptotic convergence and complexity rates relative to the benchmark methods, with additional savings achieved through the proposed multilevel RQMC construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MVSDEs) whose drift coefficients grow super-linearly in both state variables and measure arguments, and whose diffusion coefficients exhibit super-linear growth in the state variables. By constructing an Euler-like sequence, we establish the strong well-posedness of such MVSDEs under a locally monotone condition. Furthermore, the propagation of chaos is studied on both finite and infinite horizons, demonstrating convergence of the interacting particle system to the corresponding non-interacting system. To illustrate the rationality of the theoretical results, we provide examples whose drifts contain the high powers and multiple integrals of distributions, with numerical simulations presented in Section 6.</description>

      <title>Optimal bounds for numerical approximations of infinite horizon problems based on dynamic programming approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.07371v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we get error bounds for fully discrete approximations of infinite horizon problems via the dynamic programming approach. It is well known that considering a time discretization with a positive step size $h$ an error bound of size $h$ can be proved for the difference between the value function (viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation corresponding to the infinite horizon) and the value function of the discrete time problem. However, including also a spatial discretization based on elements of size $k$ an error bound of size $O(k/h)$ can be found in the literature for the error between the value functions of the continuous problem and the fully discrete problem. In this paper we revise the error bound of the fully discrete method and prove, under similar assumptions to those of the time discrete case, that the error of the fully discrete case is in fact $O(h+k)$ which gives first order in time and space for the method. This error bound matches the numerical experiments of many papers in the literature in which the behaviour $1/h$ from the bound $O(k/h)$ have not been observed.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Matrix Decomposition and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11337v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sole aim of this book is to give a self-contained introduction to concepts and mathematical tools in Bayesian matrix decomposition in order to seamlessly introduce matrix decomposition techniques and their applications in subsequent sections. However, we clearly realize our inability to cover all the useful and interesting results concerning Bayesian matrix decomposition and given the paucity of scope to present this discussion, e.g., the separated analysis of variational inference for conducting the optimization. We refer the reader to literature in the field of Bayesian analysis for a more detailed introduction to the related fields.
  This book is primarily a summary of purpose, significance of important Bayesian matrix decomposition methods, e.g., real-valued decomposition, nonnegative matrix factorization, Bayesian interpolative decomposition, and the origin and complexity of the methods which shed light on their applications. The mathematical prerequisite is a first course in statistics and linear algebra. Other than this modest background, the development is self-contained, with rigorous proof provided throughout.</description>

      <title>Can Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) coarse spaces perform well for indefinite Helmholtz problems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18378v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave propagation problems governed by the Helmholtz equation remain among the most challenging in scientific computing, due to their indefinite nature. Domain decomposition methods with spectral coarse spaces have emerged as some of the most effective preconditioners, yet their theoretical guarantees often lag behind practical performance. In this work, we introduce and analyse the $\Delta_k$-GenEO coarse space within the two-level additive Schwarz preconditioners for heterogeneous Helmholtz problems. This is an adaptation of the $\Delta$-GenEO coarse space. Our results sharpen the $k$-explicit conditions for GMRES convergence, reducing the restrictions on the subdomain size and eigenvalue threshold. This narrows the long-standing gap between pessimistic theory and empirical evidence, and reveals why GenEO spaces based on SPD (symmetric positive definite) eigenvalue problems remain surprisingly effective despite their apparent limitations. Numerical experiments confirm the theory, demonstrating scalability, robustness to heterogeneity for low to moderate frequencies (while experiencing limitations in the high frequency cases), and significantly milder coarse-space growth than conservative estimates predict.</description>

      <title>An Arbitrarily Higher-Order Time Implicit Scheme for Maxwell's Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an arbitrarily higher (even) order implicit leapfrog scheme for time discretization of a three-field formulation of Maxwell's equations. We use this in conjunction with an arbitrarily higher-order and compatible discretization using finite element spaces that form a de Rham complex. In doing so, we provide a generalization of an earlier work building from~\cite{ArKa2025} and~\cite{ArKa2026}. We prove stability, demonstrate energy conservation, and characterize the asymptotic convergence of the error for the time semidiscretization as well as for the full spatial and temporal discretization of this Maxwell's system. We also provide some numerical validation using computational examples in $\mathbb{R}^2$.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning without a preconditioner: faster ridge-regression and Gaussian sampling with randomized block Krylov subspace methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a randomized variant of the block conjugate gradient method for solving a single positive-definite linear system of equations. Our method provably outperforms preconditioned conjugate gradient with a broad-class of Nystr\"om-based preconditioners, without ever explicitly constructing a preconditioner. In analyzing our algorithm, we derive theoretical guarantees for new variants of Nystr\"om preconditioned conjugate gradient which may be of separate interest. We also describe how our approach yields state-of-the-art algorithms for key data-science tasks such as computing the entire ridge regression regularization path and generating multiple independent samples from a high-dimensional Gaussian distribution.</description>

      <title>On the randomized SVD in infinite dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized methods, such as the randomized SVD (singular value decomposition) and Nystr\"om approximation, are an effective way to compute low-rank approximations of large matrices. Motivated by applications to operator learning, Boull\'e and Townsend (FoCM, 2023) recently proposed an infinite-dimensional extension of the randomized SVD for a Hilbert-Schmidt operator $A$ that invokes randomness through a Gaussian process with a covariance operator $K$. While the non-isotropy introduced by $K$ allows one to incorporate prior information on $A$, an unfortunate choice may lead to unfavorable performance and large constants in the error bounds. In this work, we introduce a novel infinite-dimensional extension of the randomized SVD that does not require such a choice and enjoys error bounds that match those for the finite-dimensional case. Our extension implicitly uses isotropic random vectors, reflecting a choice commonly made in the finite-dimensional case. In fact, the theoretical results of this work show how the usual randomized SVD applied to a discretization of $A$ approaches our infinite-dimensional extension as the discretization gets refined, both in terms of error bounds and the Wasserstein distance. We also present and analyze a novel extension of the Nystr\"om approximation for self-adjoint positive semi-definite trace class operators.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid DEC-SIE Framework for Potential-Based Electromagnetic Analysis of Heterogeneous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing electromagnetic fields in complex, multi-material environments presents substantial computational challenges. To address these, we propose a hybrid numerical method that couples discrete exterior calculus (DEC) with surface integral equations (SIE) in the potential-based formulation of Maxwell's equations. The method employs the magnetic vector and electric scalar potentials ($\mathbf{A}$-$\Phi$) under the Lorenz gauge, offering natural compatibility with multi-physics couplings and inherent immunity to low-frequency breakdown. To effectively handle both bounded and unbounded regions, we divide the computational domain: the inhomogeneous interior is discretized using DEC, a coordinate-free framework that preserves topological invariants and enables structure-preserving discretization on unstructured meshes, while the homogeneous exterior is treated using SIEs, which inherently satisfy the radiation condition and eliminate the need for artificial domain truncation. A key contribution of this work is a scalar reformulation of the SIEs, which reduces the number of surface integral operators from fourteen to two by expressing the problem in terms of the Cartesian components of the vector potential and their normal derivatives. This simplification motivates a corresponding adaptation in the DEC domain: each vector potential component is represented as a discrete 0-form, in contrast to the conventional 1-form representation. This novel treatment improves compatibility at the interface and significantly enhances numerical performance. The proposed hybrid method thus offers a unified, efficient, and physically consistent framework for solving electromagnetic scattering and radiation problems in complex geometries and heterogeneous materials</description>

Abstract: The proximal Galerkin (PG) method is a finite element method for solving variational problems with inequality constraints. It has several advantages, including constraint-preserving approximations and mesh independence. This paper presents the first abstract a priori error analysis of PG methods, providing a general framework to establish convergence and error estimates. As applications of the framework, we demonstrate optimal convergence rates for both the obstacle and Signorini problems using various finite element subspaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to analyze the finite element approximation of the two-dimensional stationary Navier-Stokes equations with non-smooth Dirichlet boundary data. The discrete approximation is obtained by considering the Navier-Stokes system with a regularized boundary solution. Based on the existence of the very weak solution for the Navier-Stokes system with L2 boundary data, and a suitable decomposition of this solution, we obtain a priori error estimates between the approximation of the Navier-Stokes system with non-smooth data and the finite element solution of the associated regularized problem. These estimates allow us to conclude that our approach converges with optimal order.</description>

Abstract: This work presents error analysis for a finite element method applied to a two-dimensional singularly perturbed convection-diffusion turning point problem. Utilizing a layer-adapted Shishkin mesh, we prove uniform convergence in the maximum norm in the x-layer regions and $\varepsilon$-independent bounds for the coarse region. The analysis, critically based on the properties of a discrete Green's function, guarantees the method's robustness and accuracy in capturing sharp solution layers.</description>

      <title>Deep learning methods for inverse problems using connections between proximal operators and Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse problems are important mathematical problems that seek to recover model parameters from noisy data. Since inverse problems are often ill-posed, they require regularization or incorporation of prior information about the underlying model or unknown variables. Proximal operators, ubiquitous in nonsmooth optimization, are central to this because they provide a flexible and convenient way to encode priors and build efficient iterative algorithms. They have also recently become key to modern machine learning methods, e.g., for plug-and-play methods for learned denoisers and deep neural architectures for learning priors of proximal operators. The latter was developed partly due to recent work characterizing proximal operators of nonconvex priors as subdifferential of convex potentials. In this work, we propose to leverage connections between proximal operators and Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (HJ PDEs) to develop novel deep learning architectures for learning the prior. In contrast to other existing methods, we learn the prior directly without recourse to inverting the prior after training. We present several numerical results that demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Extracting Manifold Information from Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A kernel based method is proposed for the construction of signature (defining) functions of subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$. The subsets can range from full dimensional manifolds (open subsets) to point clouds (a finite number of points) and include bounded (closed) smooth manifolds of any codimension. The interpolation and analysis of point clouds are the main application. Two extreme cases in terms of regularity are considered, where the data set is interpolated by an analytic surface, at the one extreme, and by a H\"older continuous surface, at the other. The signature function can be computed as a combination of translated kernels, the coefficients of which are the solution of a Fredholm integral equation (matrix equation in the finite dimensional case). Once it is obtained, it can be used to estimate the dimension as well as the normal and the curvatures of the interpolated manifold. The method is global and does not require the data set to be organized or structured in any particular way. It admits a variational formulation with a natural regularized counterpart, that proves useful in dealing with data sets corrupted by numerical error or noise. The underlying analytical structure of the approach is presented in general before it is applied to the case of point clouds.</description>

      <title>Physics vs Distributions: Pareto Optimal Flow Matching with Physics Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-constrained generative modeling aims to produce high-dimensional samples that are both physically consistent and distributionally accurate, a task that remains challenging due to often conflicting optimization objectives. Recent advances in flow matching and diffusion models have enabled efficient generative modeling, but integrating physical constraints often degrades generative fidelity or requires costly inference-time corrections. Our work is the first to recognize the trade-off between distributional and physical accuracy. Based on the insight of inherently conflicting objectives, we introduce Physics-Based Flow Matching (PBFM) a method that enforces physical constraints at training time using conflict-free gradient updates and unrolling to mitigate Jensen's gap. Our approach avoids manual loss balancing and enables simultaneous optimization of generative and physical objectives. As a consequence, physics constraints do not impede inference performance. We benchmark our method across three representative PDE benchmarks. PBFM achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off, competitive inference speed, and generalizes to a wide range of physics-constrained generative tasks, providing a practical tool for scientific machine learning.

      <title>A Unified Framework for Lifted Training and Inversion Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The training of deep neural networks predominantly relies on a combination of gradient-based optimisation and back-propagation for the computation of the gradient. While incredibly successful, this approach faces challenges such as vanishing or exploding gradients, difficulties with non-smooth activations, and an inherently sequential structure that limits parallelisation. Lifted training methods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem into a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the constraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms. This chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted training strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and Proximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from convex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates distributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations, and can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the implementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies, including deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive optimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods. Furthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems, detailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g., unrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks. Numerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and stability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training, particularly for architectures employing proximal activations.</description>

      <title>Collagen and myocyte interplay in cardiac volume overload: a multi-constituent growth and remodeling framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hearts subjected to volume overload (VO) are prone to detrimental anatomical and functional changes in response to elevated mechanical loading, ultimately leading to heart failure. Experimental findings now emphasize that organ-scale changes following VO cannot be explained by myocyte growth alone, as traditionally proposed in the literature. Collagen degradation, in particular, has been associated with VO and assumed to play a central role in both its acute and chronic stages. This hypothesis, however, remains to be substantiated by comprehensive mechanistic evidence, and each constituent contribution to myocardial growth and remodeling (G&amp;R) processes is yet to be quantified. In this work, we present a multi-constituent G&amp;R framework that integrates a mixture-based constitutive model within the kinematic growth formulation. This framework enables us to mechanistically assess the relative contributions of collagen and myocyte changes to alterations in tissue properties, ventricular dimensions, and growth phenotype. Our numerical results confirm that collagen remodeling affects the passive mechanical response of the myocardium, whereas myocytes predominantly influence the extent and phenotype of VO-induced growth. Importantly, collagen degradation exacerbates myocyte hypertrophy, revealing a synergistic interplay that accelerates the left ventricular eccentric growth and thereby promotes systolic dysfunction. This work constitutes an important step towards an integrated characterization of the early compensatory stages of VO-induced cardiac G&amp;R.</description>

      <title>Radon--Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Interacting-Particle Sampling in High Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient flows of the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence, such as the Fokker--Planck equation and Stein Variational Gradient Descent, evolve a distribution toward a target density known only up to a normalizing constant. We introduce new gradient flows of the KL divergence with a remarkable combination of properties: they admit accurate interacting-particle approximations in high dimensions, and the per-step cost scales linearly in both the number of particles and the dimension. These gradient flows are based on new transportation-based Riemannian geometries on the space of probability measures: the Radon--Wasserstein geometry and the related Regularized Radon--Wasserstein (RRW) geometry. We define these geometries using the Radon transform so that the gradient-flow velocities depend only on one-dimensional projections. This yields interacting-particle-based algorithms whose per-step cost follows from efficient Fast Fourier Transform-based evaluation of the required 1D convolutions. We additionally provide numerical experiments that study the performance of the proposed algorithms and compare convergence behavior and quantization. Finally, we prove some theoretical results including well-posedness of the flows and long-time convergence guarantees for the RRW flow.</description>
