      <title>Morphology-Preserving Remeshing Approach to Particulate Microstructures via Harmonic Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harmonic decomposition of surfaces, such as spherical and spheroidal harmonics, is used to analyze morphology, reconstruct, and generate surface inclusions of particulate microstructures. However, obtaining high-quality meshes of engineering microstructures using these approaches remains an open question. In harmonic approaches, we usually reconstruct surfaces by evaluating the harmonic bases on equidistantly sampled simplicial complexes of the base domains (e.g., triangular spheroids and disks). However, this traditional sampling does not account for local changes in the Jacobian of the basis functions, resulting in nonuniform discretization after reconstruction or generation. As it impacts the accuracy and time step, high-quality discretization of microstructures is crucial for efficient numerical simulations (e.g., finite element and discrete element methods). To circumvent this issue, we propose an efficient hierarchical diffusion-based approach for resampling the surface-i.e., performing a reparameterization-to yield an equalized mesh triangulation. Analogous to heat problems, we use nonlinear diffusion to resample the curvilinear coordinates of the analysis domain, thereby enlarging small triangles at the expense of large triangles on surfaces. We tested isotropic and anisotropic diffusion schemes on the recent spheroidal and hemispheroidal harmonics methods. The results show a substantial improvement in the quality metrics for surface triangulation. Unlike traditional surface reconstruction and meshing techniques, this approach preserves surface morphology, along with the areas and volumes of surfaces. We discuss the results and the associated computational costs for large 2D and 3D microstructures, such as digital twins of concrete and stone masonry, and their future applications.</description>

      <title>CameraVDP: Perceptual Display Assessment with Uncertainty Estimation via Camera and Visual Difference Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of images produced by electronic displays is critical for the evaluation of both traditional and computational displays. Traditional display measurement methods based on sparse radiometric sampling and fitting a model are inadequate for capturing spatially varying display artifacts, as they fail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions. While cameras offer sufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and photometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined with a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to be visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a combination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference predictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and visual difference prediction. The reconstruction pipeline combines HDR image stacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion, homography transformation, and color correction, enabling cameras to function as precise display measurement instruments. By incorporating a Visual Difference Predictor (VDP), our system models the visibility of various stimuli under different viewing conditions for the human visual system. We validate the proposed CameraVDP framework through three applications: defective pixel detection, color fringing awareness, and display non-uniformity evaluation. Our uncertainty analysis framework enables the estimation of the theoretical upper bound for defect pixel detection performance and provides confidence intervals for VDP quality scores.</description>

      <title>Objectness Similarity: Capturing Object-Level Fidelity in 3D Scene Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality, leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify advancements in this field. The code is available at https://github.com/Objectness-Similarity/OSIM.</description>

      <title>Lifting the Winding Number: Precise Discontinuities in Neural Fields for Physics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cutting thin-walled deformable structures is common in daily life, but poses significant challenges for simulation due to the introduced spatial discontinuities. Traditional methods rely on mesh-based domain representations, which require frequent remeshing and refinement to accurately capture evolving discontinuities. These challenges are further compounded in reduced-space simulations, where the basis functions are inherently geometry- and mesh-dependent, making it difficult or even impossible for the basis to represent the diverse family of discontinuities introduced by cuts.
  Recent advances in representing basis functions with neural fields offer a promising alternative, leveraging their discretization-agnostic nature to represent deformations across varying geometries. However, the inherent continuity of neural fields is an obstruction to generalization, particularly if discontinuities are encoded in neural network weights.
  We present Wind Lifter, a novel neural representation designed to accurately model complex cuts in thin-walled deformable structures. Our approach constructs neural fields that reproduce discontinuities precisely at specified locations, without baking in the position of the cut line. Crucially, our approach does not embed the discontinuity in the neural network's weights, opening avenues to generalization of cut placement.
  Our method achieves real-time simulation speeds and supports dynamic updates to cut line geometry during the simulation. Moreover, the explicit representation of discontinuities makes our neural field intuitive to control and edit, offering a significant advantage over traditional neural fields, where discontinuities are embedded within the network's weights, and enabling new applications that rely on general cut placement.</description>
