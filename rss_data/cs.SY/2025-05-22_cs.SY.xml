      <title>SecCAN: An Extended CAN Controller with Embedded Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the vulnerability of in-vehicle network protocols such as controller area networks (CAN) and proposed machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) as an effective mitigation technique. However, their efficient integration into vehicular architecture is non-trivial, with existing methods relying on electronic control units (ECUs)-coupled IDS accelerators or dedicated ECUs as IDS accelerators. Here, initiating IDS requires complete reception of a CAN message from the controller, incurring data movement and software overheads. In this paper, we present SecCAN, a novel CAN controller architecture that embeds IDS capability within the datapath of the controller. This integration allows IDS to tap messages directly from within the CAN controller as they are received from the bus, removing overheads incurred by existing ML-based IDSs. A custom-quantised machine-learning accelerator is developed as the IDS engine and embedded into SecCAN's receive data path, with optimisations to overlap the IDS inference with the protocol's reception window. We implement SecCAN on AMD XCZU7EV FPGA to quantify its performance and benefits in hardware, using multiple attack datasets. We show that SecCAN can completely hide the IDS latency within the CAN reception window for all CAN packet sizes and detect multiple attacks with state-of-the-art accuracy with zero software overheads on the ECU and low energy overhead (73.7 uJ per message) for IDS inference. Also, SecCAN incurs limited resource overhead compared to a standard CAN controller (&lt; 30% LUT, &lt; 1% FF), making it ideally suited for automotive deployment.</description>

      <title>Green Hacks: Generating Sustainability-Targeting Attacks For Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustainability-targeting attacks (STA) or "Green Hacks" are a growing threat to cyber-physical system (CPS)-based infrastructure, as its performance objectives are increasingly linked to sustainability goals. These attacks exploit the interdependence between control, energy efficiency, and environmental impact to degrade systems' overall performance. Thus, in this work, we propose a general mathematical framework for modeling such STA and derive the feasibility conditions for generating a worst-case STA on a linear CPS using a max-min formulation. A gradient ascent descent algorithm is used to construct the worst-case attack policy. We simulated the worst-case STA for a linear CPS to illustrate its impacts on the CPS performance and sustainability cost.</description>

      <title>Co-optimize condenser water temperature and cooling tower fan using high-fidelity synthetic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for optimizing HVAC systems in buildings by integrating a high-fidelity physics-based simulation model with machine learning and measured data. The method enables a real-time building advisory system that provides optimized settings for condenser water loop operation, assisting building operators in decision-making. The building and its HVAC system are first modeled using eQuest. Synthetic data are then generated by running the simulation multiple times. The data are then processed, cleaned, and used to train the machine learning model. The machine learning model enables real-time optimization of the condenser water loop using particle swarm optimization. The results deliver both a real-time online optimizer and an offline operation look-up table, providing optimized condenser water temperature settings and the optimal number of cooling tower fans at a given cooling load. Potential savings are calculated by comparing measured data from two summer months with the energy costs the building would have experienced under optimized settings. Adaptive model refinement is applied to further improve accuracy and effectiveness by utilizing available measured data. The method bridges the gap between simulation and real-time control. It has the potential to be applied to other building systems, including the chilled water loop, heating systems, ventilation systems, and other related processes. Combining physics models, data models, and measured data also enables performance analysis, tracking, and retrofit recommendations.</description>

      <title>Comparing Parameterizations and Objective Functions for Maximizing the Volume of Zonotopic Invariant Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In formal safety verification, many proposed algorithms use parametric set representations and convert the computation of the relevant sets into an optimization problem; consequently, the choice of parameterization and objective function have a significant impact on the efficiency and accuracy of the resulting computation. In particular, recent papers have explored the use of zonotope set representations for various types of invariant sets. In this paper we collect two zonotope parameterizations that are numerically well-behaved and demonstrate that the volume of the corresponding zonotopes is log-concave in the parameters. We then experimentally explore the use of these two parameterizations in an algorithm for computing the maximum volume zonotope invariant under affine dynamics within a specified box constraint over a finite horizon. The true volume of the zonotopes is used as an objective function, along with two alternative heuristics that are faster to compute. We conclude that the heuristics are much faster in practice, although the relative quality of their results declines as the dimension of the problem increases; however, our conclusions are only preliminary due to so-far limited availability of compute resources.</description>

      <title>A Risk-Based Probabilistic Transient Stability Approach for Ranking of Circuit Breakers in a Power System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power systems are getting more complex than ever and are consequently operating close to their limit of stability. Moreover, with the increasing demand of renewable wind generation, and the requirement to maintain a secure power system, the importance of transient stability cannot be overestimated. Current deterministic industry practices of transient stability assessment ignore the probability of variables involved. With increasing system uncertainties and widespread electricity market deregulation, there is a strong inevitability to incorporate probabilistic transient stability analysis. Circuit breakers play a critical role in fault clearing and consequently in determining the system transient stability. It is important that they undergo timely and appropriate maintenance procedures based on some criterion. Considering the need of incorporating risk in modern power systems, this paper proposes a risk-based probabilistic transient stability approach for ranking of circuit breakers in a power system. A novel priority index was proposed to rank the circuit breakers based on the system transient stability risk. DIgSILENT PowerFactory software was used to conduct the required simulations on IEEE 14 bus system. The proposed risk-based framework was deemed to be efficient in identification of the circuit breakers based on their priority rank index which can aid in power system planning process.</description>

      <title>Impact of Wind Generation on Risk-based Security Assessment of Power System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric power system is one of the largest and most intricate infrastructures. Therefore, it is critical to assess and maintain its security. A power system security assessment is indispensable for identifying post-contingency issues, taking corrective measures, and protecting the system from blackouts. This paper examined the impact of wind generation on the risk-based security assessment of a power transmission network in the context of planning. DIgSILENT PowerFactory software was used to conduct the analysis using a combination of the brute force technique and the nonsequential Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method on the IEEE 39-bus transmission test system. Optimal power flow (OPF) was used to quantify security, considering (N-1), (N-2), and (N-3) line outages and an (N-1) bus outage. Moreover, the average cost deviation from the mean optimal system operating cost was proposed as a novel security indicator. The results obtianed accurately depicted the effects of changing wind generation levels on system security in terms of risk. The most and least critical line(s) and bus in the system, for different wind generation levels, were also determined. Moreover, the worst-case wind-generation threshold level using two different cost functions for wind was identified.</description>

      <title>AI-based Decision Support System for Heritage Aircraft Corrosion Prevention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a decision support system for the long-term preservation of aeronautical heritage exhibited/stored in sheltered sites. The aeronautical heritage is characterized by diverse materials of which this heritage is constituted. Heritage aircraft are made of ancient aluminum alloys, (ply)wood, and particularly fabrics. The decision support system (DSS) designed, starting from a conceptual model, is knowledge-based on degradation/corrosion mechanisms of prevailing materials of aeronautical heritage. In the case of historical aircraft wooden parts, this knowledge base is filled in by the damage function models developed within former European projects. Model-based corrosion prediction is implemented within the new DSS for ancient aluminum alloys. The novelty of this DSS consists of supporting multi-material heritage protection and tailoring to peculiarities of aircraft exhibition/storage hangars and the needs of aviation museums. The novel DSS is tested on WWII aircraft heritage exhibited in the Aviation Museum Kbely, Military History Institute Prague, Czech Republic.</description>

      <title>From learning to safety: A Direct Data-Driven Framework for Constrained Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safety in the sense of constraint satisfaction for learning-based control is a critical challenge, especially in the model-free case. While safety filters address this challenge in the model-based setting by modifying unsafe control inputs, they typically rely on predictive models derived from physics or data. This reliance limits their applicability for advanced model-free learning control methods. To address this gap, we propose a new optimization-based control framework that determines safe control inputs directly from data. The benefit of the framework is that it can be updated through arbitrary model-free learning algorithms to pursue optimal performance. As a key component, the concept of direct data-driven safety filters (3DSF) is first proposed. The framework employs a novel safety certificate, called the state-action control barrier function (SACBF). We present three different schemes to learn the SACBF. Furthermore, based on input-to-state safety analysis, we present the error-to-state safety analysis framework, which provides formal guarantees on safety and recursive feasibility even in the presence of learning inaccuracies. The proposed control framework bridges the gap between model-free learning-based control and constrained control, by decoupling performance optimization from safety enforcement. Simulations on vehicle control illustrate the superior performance regarding constraint satisfaction and task achievement compared to model-based methods and reward shaping.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time iterative linear-quadratic regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a continuous-time equivalent to the well-known iterative linear-quadratic algorithm including an implementation of a backtracking line-search policy and a novel regularization approach based on the necessary conditions in the Riccati pass of the linear-quadratic regulator. This allows the algorithm to effectively solve trajectory optimization problems with non-convex cost functions, which is demonstrated on the cart-pole swing-up problem. The algorithm compatibility with state-of-the-art suites of numerical integration solvers allows for the use of high-order adaptive-step methods. Their use results in a variable number of time steps both between passes of the algorithm and across iterations, maintaining a balance between the number of function evaluations and the discretization error.</description>

      <title>SpanTrain: Highly Efficient Cross-domain Model Distributed Training System under Heterogeneous GPUs and Networks in CEE Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing training systems focus on a single region. In contrast, we envision that cross-region training offers more flexible GPU resource allocation and yields significant potential. However, the hierarchical cluster topology and unstable networks in the cloud-edge-end (CEE) environment, a typical cross-region scenario, pose substantial challenges to building an efficient and autonomous model training system. We propose SpanTrain, a geo-distributed model training system tailored for heterogeneous GPUs and networks in CEE environments. SpanTrain adopts a communication-centric design philosophy to tackle challenges arising from slow and unstable inter-region networks. It begins with a heterogeneous device profiler that identifies and groups devices based on both network and compute characteristics. Leveraging device groups, SpanTrain implements compact, zero-bubble pipeline parallelism, automatically deriving optimal parallel strategies. To further adapt to runtime variability, SpanTrain integrates a dynamic environment adapter that reacts to network fluctuations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SpanTrain achieves 1.3-2.8x higher training throughput compared to widely used and SOTA training systems.</description>

      <title>Decreasing Utilization of Systems with Multi-Rate Cause-Effect Chains While Reducing End-to-End Latencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Logical Execution Time (LET) model has deterministic properties which dramatically reduce the complexity of analyzing temporal requirements of multi-rate cause-effect chains. The configuration (length and position) of task's communication intervals directly define which task instances propagate data through the chain and affect end-to-end latencies. Since not all task instances propagate data through the chain, the execution of these instances wastes processing resources. By manipulating the configuration of communication intervals, it is possible to control which task instances are relevant for data propagation and end-to-end latencies. However, since tasks can belong to more than one cause-effect chain, the problem of configuring communication intervals becomes non-trivial given the large number of possible configurations. In this paper, we present a method to decrease the waste of processing resources while reducing end-to-end latencies. We use a search algorithm to analyze different communication interval configurations and find the combination that best decrease system utilization while reducing end-to-end latencies. By controlling data propagation by means of precedence constraints, our method modifies communication intervals and controls which task instances affect end-to-end latencies. Despite the sporadic release time of some task instances during the analysis, our method transforms those instances into periodic tasks. We evaluate our work using synthetic task sets and the automotive benchmark proposed by BOSCH for the WATERS industrial challenge.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart contact lenses are at the forefront of integrating microelectronics, biomedical engineering, and optics into wearable technologies. This work addresses a key obstacle in their development: achieving autonomous power without compromising safety or miniaturization. We examine energy harvesting strategies using intrinsic ocular sources-particularly tear salinity and eyelid motion-to enable sustainable operation without external batteries. The study emphasizes compact loop antennas operating between 900 MHz and 1.1 GHz as critical for wireless data transmission and power management. Material choices, signal integrity, and biocompatibility are also discussed. By presenting recent advances in 3D-printed optics, antenna integration, and energy systems, we propose a conceptual framework for the next generation of smart lenses, enabling real-time health monitoring and vision enhancement through self-powered, compact devices.</description>

      <title>Path Planning Algorithm Comparison Analysis for Wireless AUVs Energy Sharing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly used in marine research, military applications, and undersea exploration. However, their operational range is significantly affected by battery performance. In this paper, a framework for a wireless energy sharing system among AUVs is proposed, enabling rapid energy replenishment. Path planning plays a crucial role in the energy-sharing process and autonomous navigation, as it must generate feasible trajectories toward designated goals. This article focuses on efficient obstacle avoidance in complex underwater environments, including irregularly shaped obstacles and narrow passages. The proposed method combines Rapidly-exploring Random Trees Star (RRT*) with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to improve path planning efficiency. Comparative analysis of the two algorithms is presented through simulation results in both random and irregular obstacle environments. Index Terms: Wireless charging, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), path planning, irregular obstacles, narrow passages, RRT*, particle swarm optimization (PSO).</description>

Abstract: Purpose: In conventional fluoroscopy-guided interventions, the 2D projective nature of X-ray imaging limits depth perception and leads to prolonged radiation exposure. Virtual fluoroscopy, combined with spatially tracked surgical instruments, is a promising strategy to mitigate these limitations. While magnetic tracking shows unique advantages, particularly in tracking flexible instruments, it remains under-explored due to interference from ferromagnetic materials in the C-arm room. This work proposes a virtual fluoroscopy workflow by effectively integrating magnetic tracking, and demonstrates its clinical efficacy. Methods: An automatic virtual fluoroscopy workflow was developed using a radiolucent tabletop field generator prototype. Specifically, we developed a fluoro-CT registration approach with automatic 2D-3D shared landmark correspondence to establish the C-arm-patient relationship, along with a general C-arm modelling approach to calculate desired poses and generate corresponding virtual fluoroscopic images. Results: Testing on a dataset with views ranging from RAO 90 degrees to LAO 90 degrees, simulated fluoroscopic images showed visually imperceptible differences from the real ones, achieving a mean target projection distance error of 1.55 mm. An endoleak phantom insertion experiment highlighted the effectiveness of simulating multiplanar views with real-time instrument overlays, achieving a mean needle tip error of 3.42 mm. Conclusions: Results demonstrated the efficacy of virtual fluoroscopy integrated with magnetic tracking, improving depth perception during navigation. The broad capture range of virtual fluoroscopy showed promise in improving the users understanding of X-ray imaging principles, facilitating more efficient image acquisition.</description>

      <title>Learning POMDPs with Linear Function Approximation and Finite Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning with linear function approximation and finite-memory approximations for partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs). We first present an algorithm for the value evaluation of finite-memory feedback policies. We provide error bounds derived from filter stability and projection errors. We then study the learning of finite-memory based near-optimal Q values. Convergence in this case requires further assumptions on the exploration policy when using general basis functions. We then show that these assumptions can be relaxed for specific models such as those with perfectly linear cost and dynamics, or when using discretization based basis functions.</description>

      <title>Understanding 6G through Language Models: A Case Study on LLM-aided Structured Entity Extraction in Telecom Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge understanding is a foundational part of envisioned 6G networks to advance network intelligence and AI-native network architectures. In this paradigm, information extraction plays a pivotal role in transforming fragmented telecom knowledge into well-structured formats, empowering diverse AI models to better understand network terminologies. This work proposes a novel language model-based information extraction technique, aiming to extract structured entities from the telecom context. The proposed telecom structured entity extraction (TeleSEE) technique applies a token-efficient representation method to predict entity types and attribute keys, aiming to save the number of output tokens and improve prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, TeleSEE involves a hierarchical parallel decoding method, improving the standard encoder-decoder architecture by integrating additional prompting and decoding strategies into entity extraction tasks. In addition, to better evaluate the performance of the proposed technique in the telecom domain, we further designed a dataset named 6GTech, including 2390 sentences and 23747 words from more than 100 6G-related technical publications. Finally, the experiment shows that the proposed TeleSEE method achieves higher accuracy than other baseline techniques, and also presents 5 to 9 times higher sample processing speed.</description>

      <title>Customized Interior-Point Methods Solver for Embedded Real-Time Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a customized convex optimization solver tailored for embedded real-time optimization, which frequently arise in modern guidance and control (G&amp;C) applications. The solver employs a practically efficient predictor-corrector type primal-dual interior-point method (PDIPM) combined with a homogeneous embedding framework for infeasibility detection. Unlike conventional homogeneous self-dual embedding formulations, the adopted approach can directly handle quadratic cost functions without requiring problem reformulation. To support a systematic workflow, we also develop a code generation tool that analyzes the sparsity pattern of the provided problem family and generates customized solver code using a predefined code template. The generated solver code is written in C with no external dependencies other than the standard library math.h, and it supports complete static allocation of all data. Additionally, it provides parsing information to facilitate the use of the solver API by end users. Benchmark results and numerical experiments on an embedded platform demonstrate that the developed solver outperforms existing solvers in both efficiency and reliability.</description>

      <title>Reliable Vertical Federated Learning in 5G Core Network Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a new algorithm to mitigate model generalization loss in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) operating under client reliability constraints within 5G Core Networks (CNs). Recently studied and endorsed by 3GPP, VFL enables collaborative and load-balanced model training and inference across the CN. However, the performance of VFL significantly degrades when the Network Data Analytics Functions (NWDAFs) - which serve as primary clients for VFL model training and inference - experience reliability issues stemming from resource constraints and operational overhead. Unlike edge environments, CN environments adopt fundamentally different data management strategies, characterized by more centralized data orchestration capabilities. This presents opportunities to implement better distributed solutions that take full advantage of the CN data handling flexibility. Leveraging this flexibility, we propose a method that optimizes the vertical feature split among clients while centrally defining their local models based on reliability metrics. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, showing improved performance over traditional baseline methods.</description>

      <title>FAV-NSS: An HIL Framework for Accelerating Validation of Automotive Network Security Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex electronic control unit (ECU) architectures, software models and in-vehicle networks are consistently improving safety and comfort functions in modern vehicles. However, the extended functionality and increased connectivity introduce new security risks and vulnerabilities that can be exploited on legacy automotive networks such as the controller area network (CAN). With the rising complexity of vehicular systems and attack vectors, the need for a flexible hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test fixture that can inject attacks and validate the performance of countermeasures in near-real-world conditions in real time is vital. This paper presents an FPGA-based HIL framework tailored towards validating network security approaches (IDS, IPS) and smart integration strategies of such capabilities for an automotive CAN bus. FAV-NSS replicates an actual vehicular system environment with functional ECUs and network infrastructure on an FPGA, allowing functional validation of IDS/IPS algorithms, accelerator designs and integration schemes (software task on ECU, dedicated accelerator). To show the efficacy of FAV-NSS, we evaluate an IDS accelerator integration problem, both as a traditional coupled accelerator (to the ECU), and secondly close to the CAN controller (mimicking an extended CAN controller). We show that the latter strategy can be fully validated by our framework, which would otherwise require integration of specialised CAN modules into otherwise standard HIL fixtures with ability to instrument internal signals for characterising timing performance. The tests demonstrate a promising latency reduction of 6.3x when compared to the traditional coupled accelerator. Our case study demonstrates the potential of FAV-NSS for accelerating the optimisation, integration and verification of smart ECUs and communication controllers in current and future vehicular systems.</description>

      <title>Certified Neural Approximations of Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks hold great potential to act as approximate models of nonlinear dynamical systems, with the resulting neural approximations enabling verification and control of such systems. However, in safety-critical contexts, the use of neural approximations requires formal bounds on their closeness to the underlying system. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel, adaptive, and parallelizable verification method based on certified first-order models. Our approach provides formal error bounds on the neural approximations of dynamical systems, allowing them to be safely employed as surrogates by interpreting the error bound as bounded disturbances acting on the approximated dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method on a range of established benchmarks from the literature, showing that it outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we highlight the flexibility of our framework by applying it to two novel scenarios not previously explored in this context: neural network compression and an autoencoder-based deep learning architecture for learning Koopman operators, both yielding compelling results.</description>

      <title>World Models as Reference Trajectories for Rapid Motor Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying learned control policies in real-world environments poses a fundamental challenge. When system dynamics change unexpectedly, performance degrades until models are retrained on new data. We introduce Reflexive World Models (RWM), a dual control framework that uses world model predictions as implicit reference trajectories for rapid adaptation. Our method separates the control problem into long-term reward maximization through reinforcement learning and robust motor execution through rapid latent control. This dual architecture achieves significantly faster adaptation with low online computational cost compared to model-based RL baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance. The approach combines the benefits of flexible policy learning through reinforcement learning with rapid error correction capabilities, providing a principled approach to maintaining performance in high-dimensional continuous control tasks under varying dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a model-based deep-learning approach to solve finite-horizon continuous-time stochastic control problems with jumps. We iteratively train two neural networks: one to represent the optimal policy and the other to approximate the value function. Leveraging a continuous-time version of the dynamic programming principle, we derive two different training objectives based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, ensuring that the networks capture the underlying stochastic dynamics. Empirical evaluations on different problems illustrate the accuracy and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving complex, high-dimensional stochastic control tasks.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Planning of Hydrogen-Electrical Microgrids for Sea Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a distributionally robust planning method for hydrogen-electrical microgrids over islands, where the cross-island energy exchange is supported by a maritime hydrogen transport network. This planning problem is complicated due to heterogeneous off-shore wind-driven uncertainties (i.e., renewable power, transport availability, demand fluctuations, and grid faulting), a subset of which exhibit endogenous uncertainty, as they can be affected by proactive measures (e.g., grid hardening) or infrastructure investment. To capture these features, a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model is developed considering decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU), which encompasses variation of the underlying distributional ambiguity due to the change of the first stage decisions. Notably, the complete recourse property is missing, which is often neglected in existing DRO studies. Nevertheless, different from the case for land-based microgrids, this issue is critical and fundamental for sea island systems due to their particular physical and logistical requirements. To address these issues, we develop a C&amp;CG algorithm that is customized with strong cutting planes to handle DRO with a varying DDU ambiguity set and feasibility requirements. Numerical results demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and resilience of the proposed planning framework, along with the nontrivial improvements of the algorithm in both solution accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Remote Estimation of Multiple Markov Sources Under Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the remote estimation of multiple Markov sources over a lossy and rate-constrained channel. Unlike most existing studies that treat all source states equally, we exploit the \emph{semantics of information} and consider that the remote actuator has different tolerances for the estimation errors. We aim to find an optimal scheduling policy that minimizes the long-term \textit{state-dependent} costs of estimation errors under a transmission frequency constraint. The optimal scheduling problem is formulated as a \emph{constrained Markov decision process} (CMDP). We show that the optimal Lagrangian cost follows a piece-wise linear and concave (PWLC) function, and the optimal policy is, at most, a randomized mixture of two simple deterministic policies. By exploiting the structural results, we develop a new \textit{intersection search} algorithm that finds the optimal policy using only a few iterations. We further propose a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to compute the optimal policy without knowing \textit{a priori} the channel and source statistics. To avoid the ``curse of dimensionality" in MDPs, we propose an online low-complexity \textit{drift-plus-penalty} (DPP) algorithm. Numerical results show that continuous transmission is inefficient, and remarkably, our semantic-aware policies can attain the optimum by strategically utilizing fewer transmissions by exploiting the timing of the important information.</description>

      <title>Optimal Privacy-Aware Stochastic Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a stochastic sampling framework for privacy-aware data sharing, where a sensor observes a process correlated with private information. A sampler determines whether to retain or discard sensor observations, balancing the tradeoff between data utility and privacy. Retained samples are shared with an adversary who may attempt to infer the private process, with privacy leakage quantified using mutual information. The sampler design is formulated as an optimization problem with two objectives: $\left(\romannumeral1\right)$ minimizing the reconstruction error of the observed process using the sampler's output, $\left(\romannumeral2\right)$ reducing the privacy leakages. For a general class of processes, we show that the optimal reconstruction policy is deterministic and derive the optimality conditions for the sampling policy using a dynamic decomposition method, which enables the sampler to control the adversary's belief about private inputs. For linear Gaussian processes, we propose a simplified design by restricting the sampling policy to a specific collection, providing analytical expressions for the reconstruction error, belief state, and sampling objectives based on conditional means and covariances. Additionally, we develop a numerical optimization algorithm to optimize the sampling and reconstruction policies, wherein the policy gradient theorem for the optimal sampling design is derived based on the implicit function theorem. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving accurate state reconstruction, privacy protection, and data size reduction.</description>

      <title>Learning-Enabled Iterative Convex Optimization for Safety-Critical Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Safety remains a central challenge in control of dynamical systems, particularly when the boundaries of unsafe sets are complex or unknown. This paper proposes a learning-enabled framework for safety-critical Model Predictive Control (MPC) that integrates Discrete-Time High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBFs) with iterative convex optimization. Unlike existing methods that primarily address CBFs of relative degree one with fully known unsafe set boundaries, our approach generalizes to arbitrary relative degrees and addresses scenarios where the unsafe set boundaries must be inferred. We extract pixel-based data specifically from unsafe set boundaries and train a neural network to approximate local linearizations of these boundaries. The learned models are incorporated into the linearized DHOCBF constraints at each time step, enabling real-time constraint satisfaction within the MPC framework. An iterative convex optimization procedure is developed to accelerate computation while maintaining formal safety guarantees. The benefits of computational performance and safe avoidance of obstacles with diverse shapes are examined and confirmed through numerical results. By bridging model-based control with learning-based environment modeling, this framework advances safe autonomy for discrete-time systems operating in complex and partially known settings.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a potent paradigm for autonomous decision-making in complex environments. However, the integration of event-driven decision processes within RL remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel architecture that combines a Discrete Event Supervisory (DES) model with a standard RL framework to create a hybrid decision-making system. Our model leverages the DES's capabilities in managing event-based dynamics with the RL agent's adaptability to continuous states and actions, facilitating a more robust and flexible control strategy in systems characterized by both continuous and discrete events. The DES model operates alongside the RL agent, enhancing the policy's performance with event-based insights, while the environment's state transitions are governed by a mechanistic model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulations that show improved performance metrics over traditional RL implementations. Our results suggest that this integrated approach holds promise for applications ranging from industrial automation to intelligent traffic systems, where discrete event handling is paramount.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Stacked-Residual PINN for State Reconstruction of Hyperbolic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a more connected world, modeling multi-agent systems with hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) offers a compact, physics-consistent description of collective dynamics. However, classical control tools need adaptation for these complex systems. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful framework to fix this issue by inferring solutions to PDEs by embedding governing equations into the neural network. A major limitation of original PINNs is their inability to capture steep gradients and discontinuities in hyperbolic PDEs. To tackle this problem, we propose a stacked residual PINN method enhanced with a vanishing viscosity mechanism. Initially, a basic PINN with a small viscosity coefficient provides a stable, low-fidelity solution. Residual correction blocks with learnable scaling parameters then iteratively refine this solution, progressively decreasing the viscosity coefficient to transition from parabolic to hyperbolic PDEs. Applying this method to traffic state reconstruction improved results by an order of magnitude in relative $\mathcal{L}^2$ error, demonstrating its potential to accurately estimate solutions where original PINNs struggle with instability and low fidelity.</description>

      <title>Reachable Sets-based Trajectory Planning Combining Reinforcement Learning and iLQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The driving risk field is applicable to more complex driving scenarios, providing new approaches for safety decision-making and active vehicle control in intricate environments. However, existing research often overlooks the driving risk field and fails to consider the impact of risk distribution within drivable areas on trajectory planning, which poses challenges for enhancing safety. This paper proposes a trajectory planning method for intelligent vehicles based on the risk reachable set to further improve the safety of trajectory planning. First, we construct the reachable set incorporating the driving risk field to more accurately assess and avoid potential risks in drivable areas. Then, the initial trajectory is generated based on safe reinforcement learning and projected onto the reachable set. Finally, we introduce a trajectory planning method based on a constrained iterative quadratic regulator to optimize the initial solution, ensuring that the planned trajectory achieves optimal comfort, safety, and efficiency. We conduct simulation tests of trajectory planning in high-speed lane-changing scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed method can guarantee trajectory comfort and driving efficiency, with the generated trajectory situated outside high-risk boundaries, thereby ensuring vehicle safety during operation.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Sim-to-real Gap: A Control Framework for Imitation Learning of Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the computational challenges of Model Predictive Control (MPC), recent research has studied on using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) trained through imitation learning to approximate the MPC. However, this introduces a common issue in learning-based control: the simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) gap. Therefore, Domain Randomization (DR) has been widely used to mitigate this gap by introducing perturbations in the source domain. However, this led to low data collection efficiency and an overly conservative control strategy. This study proposes a new control framework that deals with this issue from a control perspective inspired by Robust Tube MPC. The framework ensures the DNN operates in the same environment as the source domain, handling the sim-to-real gap with great data collection efficiency. Moreover, a parameter governor is introduced to address the DNN's inability to adapt to model parameter variations, enabling the system to satisfy MPC constraints more robustly under changing conditions. The proposed framework was validated through a cart-pole system case study compared by DR baselines, demonstrating that a single MPC-demonstrated trajectory in the source domain was sufficient for controlling the cart-pole in the target domain. Furthermore, the system effectively handled model parameter variations, allowing for a less conservative control.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic State Estimation of Timed Probabilistic Discrete Event Systems via Artificial Neural Networks [Draft Version]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is about the state estimation of timed probabilistic discrete event systems. The main contribution is to propose general procedures for developing state estimation approaches based on artificial neural networks. It is assumed that no formal model of the system exists but a data set is available, which contains the history of the timed behaviour of the systems. This dataset will be exploited to develop a neural network model that uses both logical and temporal information gathered during the functioning of the system as inputs and provides the state probability vector as output. Two main approaches are successively proposed (i) state estimation of timed probabilistic discrete event systems over observations: in this case the state estimate is reconstructed at the occurrence of each new observation; (ii) state estimation of timed probabilistic discrete event systems over time: in this case the state estimate is reconstructed at each clock time increment. For each approach, the paper outlines the process of data preprocessing, model building and implementation. This paper not only proposes groundbreaking approaches but also opens the door to further exploitation of artificial neural networks for the benefit of discrete event systems.</description>

      <title>Controlling a Social Network of Individuals with Coevolving Actions and Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a population of individuals who have actions and opinions, which coevolve, mutually influencing one another on a complex network structure. In particular, we formulate a control problem for this social network, in which we assume that we can inject into the network a committed minority -- a set of stubborn nodes -- with the objective of steering the population, initially at a consensus, to a different consensus state. Our study focuses on two main objectives: i) determining the conditions under which the committed minority succeeds in its goal, and ii) identifying the optimal placement for such a committed minority. After deriving general monotone convergence result for the controlled dynamics, we leverage these results to build a computationally-efficient algorithm to solve the first problem and an effective heuristics for the second problem, which we prove to be NP-complete. For both algorithms, we establish theoretical guarantees. The proposed methodology is illustrated though academic examples, and demonstrated on a real-world case study.</description>

      <title>Integrating Koopman theory and Lyapunov stability for enhanced model predictive control in nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper delves into the challenges posed by the increasing complexity of modern control systems, specifically focusing on bilinear systems, a prevalent subclass of non-linear systems characterized by state dynamics influenced by the interaction of state and control variables. Traditional control strategies, such as PID controllers, often fall short in adequately addressing the intricacies of such systems due to their predictive limitations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Model Predictive Control (MPC), a sophisticated technique that utilizes system models to forecast future behaviors, allowing for the computation of an optimal control sequence by minimizing deviations and control efforts. The Koopman operator emerges as a pivotal tool in this framework by providing a means to linearize the nonlinear dynamics of bilinear systems. By integrating the principles of Lyapunov theory with the linearizing capabilities of the Koopman operator into the MPC framework, we give rise to Koopman Lyapunov-based Model Predictive Control (Koopman LMPC). This approach not only retains MPC's predictive capabilities but also harnesses the Koopman operator's ability to transform complex nonlinear behaviors into a linear framework, thereby enhancing the robustness and applicability of LMPC. With the stability assurances from Lyapunov theory, Koopman LMPC presents a robust solution to effectively control and stabilize bilinear systems. The paper underscores the efficacy of Koopman LMPC, emphasizing its significance in achieving optimal performance and system stability, marking it as a promising approach for the future of advanced control systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Blocking Robustness Analysis in Discrete Event Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for characterizing state blocking in discrete event systems (DES) under transition deletions. We introduce a path-based analysis approach that determines whether systems maintain non-blocking properties when transitions are removed. Through formal analysis and case studies, we establish three key contributions: a mathematical characterization of transition-induced blocking with necessary and sufficient conditions, a definition of robust deviations that preserve non-blocking properties, and an algorithm for identifying critical transitions and analyzing system behavior under deletions. Our algorithm reduces computational complexity by leveraging minimal blocking sets, achieving significant reduction in computational requirements. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through manufacturing system and autonomous vehicle case studies, showing substantial improvements in identifying critical transitions and predicting potential blocking scenarios across different application domains.</description>

      <title>Development of a Scaled Setup for Experimental Study of the Effect of Lateral Dynamics on Energy Consumption in Electric Vehicles: An Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of the existing state-of-the-art approaches for energy consumption analysis do not account for the effect of lateral dynamics on energy consumption in electric vehicles (EVs) during vehicle maneuvers. This paper aims to validate this effect through an experimental study. We develop a scaled model using a radio-controlled (RC) car, modified to achieve dynamic similitude with on-road vehicles, to conduct scaled experiments. The experimental results confirm the impact of lateral dynamics on both energy demand and driving range in electric vehicles, aligning with our previous findings [1], and emphasize the need to incorporate these factors into energy consumption models. This is an extended version of a paper accepted at IEEE ITEC 2025. It includes additional results and analysis.</description>

      <title>Underapproximating Safe Domains of Attraction for Discrete-Time Systems Using Implicit Representations of Backward Reachable Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing and certifying stability and attractivity of nonlinear systems is a topic of research interest that has been extensively investigated by control theorists and engineers for many years. Despite that, accurately estimating domains of attraction for nonlinear systems remains a challenging task, where available estimation approaches are either conservative or limited to low-dimensional systems. In this work, we propose an iterative approach to accurately underapproximate safe (i.e., state-constrained) domains of attraction for general discrete-time autonomous nonlinear systems. Our approach relies on implicit representations of safe backward reachable sets of safe regions of attraction, where such regions can be be easily constructed using, e.g., quadratic Lyapunov functions. The iterations of our approach are monotonic (in the sense of set inclusion), where each iteration results in a safe region of attraction, given as a sublevel set, that underapproximates the safe domain of attraction. The sublevel set representations of the resulting regions of attraction can be efficiently utilized in verifying the inclusion of given points of interest in the safe domain of attraction. We illustrate our approach through two numerical examples, involving two- and four-dimensional nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Policy Gradient Methods Without Batch Updates, Target Networks, or Replay Buffers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern deep policy gradient methods achieve effective performance on simulated robotic tasks, but they all require large replay buffers or expensive batch updates, or both, making them incompatible for real systems with resource-limited computers. We show that these methods fail catastrophically when limited to small replay buffers or during incremental learning, where updates only use the most recent sample without batch updates or a replay buffer. We propose a novel incremental deep policy gradient method -- Action Value Gradient (AVG) and a set of normalization and scaling techniques to address the challenges of instability in incremental learning. On robotic simulation benchmarks, we show that AVG is the only incremental method that learns effectively, often achieving final performance comparable to batch policy gradient methods. This advancement enabled us to show for the first time effective deep reinforcement learning with real robots using only incremental updates, employing a robotic manipulator and a mobile robot.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Sampling for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is fundamentally challenging because the size of the joint state and action spaces grows exponentially in the number of agents. These difficulties are exacerbated when balancing sequential global decision-making with local agent interactions. In this work, we propose a new algorithm $\texttt{SUBSAMPLE-MFQ}$ ($\textbf{Subsample}$-$\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield-$\textbf{Q}$-learning) and a decentralized randomized policy for a system with $n$ agents. For any $k\leq n$, our algorithm learns a policy for the system in time polynomial in $k$. We prove that this learned policy converges to the optimal policy on the order of $\tilde{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ as the number of subsampled agents $k$ increases. In particular, this bound is independent of the number of agents $n$.</description>

      <title>The Role of Integrity Monitoring in Connected and Automated Vehicles: Current State-of-Practice and Future Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positioning integrity refers to the trust in the performance of a navigation system. Accurate and reliable position information is needed to meet the requirements of connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) applications, particularly in safety-critical scenarios. Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) and its variants have been widely studied for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based vehicle positioning, often fused with kinematic (e.g., Odometry) and perception sensors (e.g., camera). However, integrity monitoring (IM) for cooperative positioning solutions leveraging Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication has received comparatively limited attention. This paper reviews existing research in the field of positioning IM and identifies various research gaps. Particular attention has been placed on identifying research that highlights cooperative IM methods. It also examines key automotive safety standards and public V2X datasets to map current research priorities and uncover critical gaps. Finally, the paper outlines promising future directions, highlighting research topics aimed at advancing and benchmarking positioning integrity.</description>

      <title>A Review of Stop-and-Go Traffic Wave Suppression Strategies: Variable Speed Limit vs. Jam-Absorption Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main form of freeway traffic congestion is the familiar stop-and-go wave, characterized by wide moving jams that propagate indefinitely upstream provided enough traffic demand. They cause severe, long-lasting adverse effects, such as reduced traffic efficiency, increased driving risks, and higher vehicle emissions. This underscores the crucial importance of artificial intervention in the propagation of stop-and-go waves. Over the past two decades, two prominent strategies for stop-and-go wave suppression have emerged: variable speed limit (VSL) and jam-absorption driving (JAD). Although they share similar research motivations, objectives, and theoretical foundations, the development of these strategies has remained relatively disconnected. To synthesize fragmented advances and drive the field forward, this paper first provides a comprehensive review of the achievements in the stop-and-go wave suppression-oriented VSL and JAD, respectively. It then focuses on bridging the two areas and identifying research opportunities from the following perspectives: fundamental diagrams, secondary waves, generalizability, traffic state estimation and prediction, robustness to randomness, scenarios for strategy validation, and field tests and practical deployment. We expect that through this review, one area can effectively address its limitations by identifying and leveraging the strengths of the other, thus promoting the overall research goal of freeway stop-and-go wave suppression.</description>

      <title>On Signed Network Coordination Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study binary-action pairwise-separable network games that encompass both coordinating and anti-coordinating behaviors. Our model is grounded in an underlying directed signed graph, where each link is associated with a weight that describes the strenght and nature of the interaction. The utility for each agent is an aggregation of pairwise terms determined by the weights of the signed graph in addition to an individual bias term. We consider a scenario that assumes the presence of a prominent cohesive subset of players, who are either connected exclusively by positive weights, or forms a structurally balanced subset that can be bipartitioned into two adversarial subcommunities with positive intra-community and negative inter-community edges. Given the properties of the game restricted to the remaining players, our results guarantee the existence of Nash equilibria characterized by a consensus or, respectively, a polarization within the first group, as well as their stability under best response transitions. Our results can be interpreted as robustness results, building on the supermodular properties of coordination games and on a novel use of the concept of graph cohesiveness.</description>
