      <title>Achieving Generalization in Orchestrating GNSS Interference Monitoring Stations Through Pseudo-Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers is significantly compromised by interference from jamming devices. Consequently, the detection of these jammers are crucial to mitigating such interference signals. However, robust classification of interference using machine learning (ML) models is challenging due to the lack of labeled data in real-world environments. In this paper, we propose an ML approach that achieves high generalization in classifying interference through orchestrated monitoring stations deployed along highways. We present a semi-supervised approach coupled with an uncertainty-based voting mechanism by combining Monte Carlo and Deep Ensembles that effectively minimizes the requirement for labeled training samples to less than 5% of the dataset while improving adaptability across varying environments. Our method demonstrates strong performance when adapted from indoor environments to real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Time and Angle Measurements for Digital-Twin-Aided Probabilistic 3D Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies explained how the 2D positioning problem in indoor non line-of-sight environments can be addressed using ray tracing with noisy angle of arrival (AoA) measurements. In this work, we generalize these results on two aspects. First, we outline how to adapt the proposed methods to address the 3D positioning problem. Second, we introduce efficient algorithms for data fusion, where propagation-time or relative propagation-time measurements (obtained via e.g., the time difference of arrival) are used in addition to AoA measurements. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the advantages of the approach.</description>

      <title>A New Adaptive Balanced Augmented Lagrangian Method with Application to ISAC Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of convex programming problems with linear equality constraints, which finds broad applications in machine learning and signal processing. We propose a new adaptive balanced augmented Lagrangian (ABAL) method for solving these problems. The proposed ABAL method adaptively selects the stepsize parameter and enjoys a low per-iteration complexity, involving only the computation of a proximal mapping of the objective function and the solution of a linear equation. These features make the proposed method well-suited to large-scale problems. We then custom-apply the ABAL method to solve the ISAC beamforming design problem, which is formulated as a nonlinear semidefinite program in a previous work. This customized application requires careful exploitation of the problem's special structure such as the property that all of its signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) constraints hold with equality at the solution and an efficient computation of the proximal mapping of the objective function. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed ABAL method.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Noise Approach to Modelling of Free-Space Satellite Quantum Communication Channel for Continuous-Variable QKD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper significantly advances the application of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) in Free- Space Optics (FSO) satellite-based quantum communication. We propose an innovative satellite quantum channel model and derive the secret quantum key distribution rate achievable through this channel. Unlike existing models that approximate the noise in quantum channels as merely Gaussian distributed, our model incorporates a hybrid noise analysis, accounting for both quantum Poissonian noise and classical Additive-White-Gaussian Noise (AWGN). This hybrid approach acknowledges the dual vulnerability of continuous variables (CV) Gaussian quantum channels to both quantum and classical noise, thereby offering a more realistic assessment of the quantum Secret Key Rate (SKR). This paper delves into the variation of SKR with the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) under various influencing parameters. We identify and analyze critical factors such as reconciliation efficiency, transmission coefficient, transmission efficiency, the quantum Poissonian noise parameter, and the satellite altitude. These parameters are pivotal in determining the SKR in FSO satellite quantum channels, highlighting the challenges of satellitebased quantum communication. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and optimizing SKR in satellite-based QKD systems, paving the way for more efficient and secure quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Towards Kriging-informed Conditional Diffusion for Regional Sea-Level Data Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given coarser-resolution projections from global climate models or satellite data, the downscaling problem aims to estimate finer-resolution regional climate data, capturing fine-scale spatial patterns and variability. Downscaling is any method to derive high-resolution data from low-resolution variables, often to provide more detailed and local predictions and analyses. This problem is societally crucial for effective adaptation, mitigation, and resilience against significant risks from climate change. The challenge arises from spatial heterogeneity and the need to recover finer-scale features while ensuring model generalization. Most downscaling methods \cite{Li2020} fail to capture the spatial dependencies at finer scales and underperform on real-world climate datasets, such as sea-level rise. We propose a novel Kriging-informed Conditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (Ki-CDPM) to capture spatial variability while preserving fine-scale features. Experimental results on climate data show that our proposed method is more accurate than state-of-the-art downscaling techniques.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Minimum BER Precoder Design for ISAC Systems: A Delay-Doppler Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is anticipated to be a promising candidate for supporting integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, which is considered as a pivotal technique for realizing next generation wireless networks. In this paper, we develop a minimum bit error rate (BER) precoder design for an OTFS-based ISAC system. In particular, the BER minimization problem takes into account the maximum available transmission power budget and the required sensing performance. Different from prior studies that considered ISAC in the time-frequency (TF) domain, we devise the precoder from the perspective of the delay-Doppler (DD) domain by exploiting the equivalent DD domain channel due to the fact that the DD domain channel generally tends to be sparse and quasi-static, which can facilitate a low-overhead ISAC system design. To address the non-convex optimization design problem, we resort to optimizing the lower bound of the derived average BER by adopting Jensen's inequality. Subsequently, the formulated problem is decoupled into two independent sub-problems via singular value decomposition (SVD) methodology. We then theoretically analyze the feasibility conditions of the proposed problem and present a low-complexity iterative solution via leveraging the Lagrangian duality approach. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed precoder compared to the benchmark schemes and reveal the interplay between sensing and communication for dual-functional precoder design, indicating a trade-off where transmission efficiency is sacrificed for increasing transmission reliability and sensing accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Block Quantum Genetic Interference Mitigation Algorithm for Dynamic Metasurface Antennas and Field Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a quantum algorithm for Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMA) beamforming to suppress interference for an amplify-and-forward relay system in multi-base station environments. This algorithm introduces an efficient dynamic block initialization and overarching block update strategy, which can enhance the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) of the target base station (BS) signal without any channel information. Furthermore, we built a relay system with DMA as the receiving antenna and conducted outdoor 5G BS interference suppression tests. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to experiment DMA in commercial 5G networks. The field trial results indicate an SINR improvement of over 10 dB for the signal of the desired BS.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (HRISs) constitute a new paradigm of truly smart metasurfaces with the additional features of signal reception and processing, which have been primarily considered for channel estimation and self-reconfiguration. In this paper, leveraging the simultaneous tunable reflection and signal absorption functionality of HRIS elements, we present a novel framework for the joint design of transmit beamforming and the HRIS parameters with the goal to maximize downlink communications, while simultaneously illuminating an area of interest for guaranteed localization coverage performance. Our simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and showcase the interplay of the various system parameters on the achievable Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) performance.</description>

      <title>On the Design and Performance of Machine Learning Based Error Correcting Decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the design and competitiveness of four neural network (NN) architectures recently proposed as decoders for forward error correction (FEC) codes. We first consider the so-called single-label neural network (SLNN) and the multi-label neural network (MLNN) decoders which have been reported to achieve near maximum likelihood (ML) performance. Here, we show analytically that SLNN and MLNN decoders can always achieve ML performance, regardless of the code dimensions -- although at the cost of computational complexity -- and no training is in fact required. We then turn our attention to two transformer-based decoders: the error correction code transformer (ECCT) and the cross-attention message passing transformer (CrossMPT). We compare their performance against traditional decoders, and show that ordered statistics decoding outperforms these transformer-based decoders. The results in this paper cast serious doubts on the application of NN-based FEC decoders in the short and medium block length regime.</description>

      <title>Sum-Rate Maximization of RIS-Aided Digital and Holographic Beamformers in MU-MISO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHS) are intrinsically amalgamated with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), for beneficially ameliorating the signal propagation environment. This potent architecture significantly improves the system performance in non-line-of-sight scenarios at a low power consumption. Briefly, the RHS technology integrates ultra-thin, lightweight antennas onto the transceiver, for creating sharp, high-gain directional beams. We formulate a user sum-rate maximization problem for our RHS-RIS-based hybrid beamformer. Explicitly, we jointly design the digital, holographic, and passive beamformers for maximizing the sum-rate of all user equipment (UE). To tackle the resultant nonconvex optimization problem, we propose an alternating maximization (AM) framework for decoupling and iteratively solving the subproblems involved. Specifically, we employ the zero-forcing criterion for the digital beamformer, leverage fractional programming to determine the radiation amplitudes of the RHS and utilize the Riemannian conjugate gradient algorithm for optimizing the RIS phase shift matrix of the passive beamformer. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RHS-RIS-based hybrid beamformer outperforms its conventional counterpart operating without an RIS in multi-UE scenarios. The sum-rate improvement attained ranges from 8 bps/Hz to 13 bps/Hz for various transmit powers at the base station (BS) and at the UEs, which is significant.</description>

      <title>Resilient Temporal GCN for Smart Grid State Estimation Under Topology Inaccuracies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State Estimation is a crucial task in power systems. Graph Neural Networks have demonstrated significant potential in state estimation for power systems by effectively analyzing measurement data and capturing the complex interactions and interrelations among the measurements through the system's graph structure. However, the information about the system's graph structure may be inaccurate due to noise, attack or lack of accurate information about the topology of the system. This paper studies these scenarios under topology uncertainties and evaluates the impact of the topology uncertainties on the performance of a Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN) for state estimation in power systems. In order to make the model resilient to topology uncertainties, modifications in the TGCN model are proposed to incorporate a knowledge graph, generated based on the measurement data. This knowledge graph supports the assumed uncertain system graph. Two variations of the TGCN architecture are introduced to integrate the knowledge graph, and their performances are evaluated and compared to demonstrate improved resilience against topology uncertainties. The evaluation results indicate that while the two proposed architecture show different performance, they both improve the performance of the TGCN state estimation under topology uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Differential Evolution-Based End-Fire Realized Gain Optimization of Active and Parasitic Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for boosting the realized gain in enhanced directivity arrays with both active and parasitic dipoles as radiating elements. The optimization process involves two main objectives: maximizing the end-fire gain and minimizing the reflection coefficient to ensure high realized gain. In the first step, the current excitation vector of the fully driven array is selected to maximize the end-fire gain. Then, all but one of the dipoles are reactively loaded according to their input impedance. Following that, the optimization focuses on the inter-element distance, computing the one that offers a favorable balance between the gain and the total efficiency. This multi-objective optimization leverages the differential evolution (DE) algorithm and utilizes a simple wire dipole as the unit element. Full-wave simulations further confirm the accuracy of our theoretical results. Our two- and three-element parasitic arrays achieve realized gain comparable to state-of-the-art designs, without relying on intricate unit elements or resource-intensive simulations. Moreover, our four- and five-element parasitic arrays deliver the highest realized gain values reported in the literature. The simplicity of our approach is validated by significant time savings, with theoretical models completing optimizations much faster than full-wave simulations. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the proposed optimization algorithm, demonstrating that the optimized design parameters remain effective even under small deviations in loads and element positions. Finally, the proposed parasitic arrays are well-suited for base station antennas due to their compact design, reduced power consumption, and simplified hardware requirements, making them ideal for modern communication systems.</description>

      <title>Blind Equalization using a Variational Autoencoder with Second Order Volterra Channel Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing communication hardware is being exerted to its limits to accommodate for the ever increasing internet usage globally. This leads to non-linear distortion in the communication link that requires non-linear equalization techniques to operate the link at a reasonable bit error rate. This paper addresses the challenge of blind non-linear equalization using a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a second-order Volterra channel model. The VAE framework's costfunction, the evidence lower bound (ELBO), is derived for real-valued constellations and can be evaluated analytically without resorting to sampling techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations on a synthetic Wiener-Hammerstein channel and a simulated intensity modulated direct detection (IM/DD) optical link. The results show significant improvements in equalization performance, compared to a VAE with linear channel assumptions, highlighting the importance of appropriate channel modeling in unsupervised VAE equalizer frameworks.</description>

      <title>PuLsE: Accurate and Robust Ultrasound-based Continuous Heart-Rate Monitoring on a Wrist-Worn IoT Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the feasibility of employing ultrasound (US) US technology in a wrist-worn IoT device for low-power, high-fidelity heart-rate (HR) extraction. US offers deep tissue penetration and can monitor pulsatile arterial blood flow in large vessels and the surrounding tissue, potentially improving robustness and accuracy compared to PPG.
  We present an IoT wearable system prototype utilizing a commercial microcontroller MCU employing the onboard ADC to capture high frequency US signals and an innovative low-power US pulser. An envelope filter lowers the bandwidth of the US signal by a factor of &gt;5x, reducing the system's acquisition requirements without compromising accuracy (correlation coefficient between HR extracted from enveloped and raw signals, r(92)=0.99, p&lt;0.001). The full signal processing pipeline is ported to fixed point arithmetic for increased energy efficiency and runs entirely onboard. The system has an average power consumption of 5.8mW, competitive with PPG based systems, and the HR extraction algorithm requires only 68kB of RAM and 71ms of processing time on an ARM Cortex-M4 MCU. The system is estimated to run continuously for more than 7 days on a smartwatch battery.
  To accurately evaluate the proposed circuit and algorithm and identify the anatomical location on the wrist with the highest accuracy for HR extraction, we collected a dataset from 10 healthy adults at three different wrist positions. The dataset comprises roughly 5 hours of HR data with an average of 80.6+-16.3 bpm. During recording, we synchronized the established ECG gold standard with our US-based method. The comparisons yields a Pearson correlation coefficient of r(92)=0.99, p&lt;0.001 and a mean error of 0.69+-1.99 bpm in the lateral wrist position near the radial artery.
  The dataset and code have been open-sourced at https://github.com/mgiordy/Ultrasound-Heart-Rate</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Effect of Electrode Shift &amp; Sensor Reapplication on Common sEMG Features in Lower Limb Muscles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16262</link>

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of electrode shift and sensor reapplication on common surface electromyography (sEMG) features in lower limb muscles, factors which have, thus far, precluded clinicians from being able to attribute inter-session changes in sEMG signal properties to physiological changes in patients under the context of stroke recovery monitoring. To explore these inter-session errors, we recruited 12 healthy participants to perform a selection of isometric and dynamic exercises seen within stroke assessment sessions while instrumented with high-density sEMG (HDsEMG) arrays on the gastrocnemius medialis, tibialis anterior, semitendinosus, and tensor fascia latae. Between exercise sets, the electrode arrays were intentionally shifted and reapplied to quantify errors in signal features, using 3D scanning equipment to extract the ground truth shift performed. Results revealed that while frequency-domain features (mean, median, and peak frequency) demonstrated high resilience to the inter-session changes, the time-domain features (integrated EMG and max envelope amplitude) showed a greater, yet predictable, variability. In all, these findings suggest that should we be able to quantify placement shift, this can support direct inter-session feature comparisons, improving the reliability of sEMG-based stroke recovery assessments and offering insights for improving remote stroke rehabilitation technologies.</description>

      <title>Learning Cortico-Muscular Dependence through Orthonormal Decomposition of Density Ratios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cortico-spinal neural pathway is fundamental for motor control and movement execution, and in humans it is typically studied using concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) recordings. However, current approaches for capturing high-level and contextual connectivity between these recordings have important limitations. Here, we present a novel application of statistical dependence estimators based on orthonormal decomposition of density ratios to model the relationship between cortical and muscle oscillations. Our method extends from traditional scalar-valued measures by learning eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and projection spaces of density ratios from realizations of the signal, addressing the interpretability, scalability, and local temporal dependence of cortico-muscular connectivity. We experimentally demonstrate that eigenfunctions learned from cortico-muscular connectivity can accurately classify movements and subjects. Moreover, they reveal channel and temporal dependencies that confirm the activation of specific EEG channels during movement.</description>

      <title>A Phenomenological AI Foundation Model for Physical Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to develop an AI foundation model for physical signals that can generalize across diverse phenomena, domains, applications, and sensing apparatuses. We propose a phenomenological approach and framework for creating and validating such AI foundation models. Based on this framework, we developed and trained a model on 0.59 billion samples of cross-modal sensor measurements, ranging from electrical current to fluid flow to optical sensors. Notably, no prior knowledge of physical laws or inductive biases were introduced into the model. Through several real-world experiments, we demonstrate that a single foundation model could effectively encode and predict physical behaviors, such as mechanical motion and thermodynamics, including phenomena not seen in training. The model also scales across physical processes of varying complexity, from tracking the trajectory of a simple spring-mass system to forecasting large electrical grid dynamics. This work highlights the potential of building a unified AI foundation model for diverse physical world processes.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Full Potential of High-Density Surface EMG: Novel Non-Invasive High-Yield Motor Unit Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decomposition of high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) signals into motor unit discharge patterns has become a powerful tool for investigating the neural control of movement, providing insights into motor neuron recruitment and discharge behavior. However, current algorithms, while very effective under certain conditions, face significant challenges in complex scenarios, as their accuracy and motor unit yield are highly dependent on anatomical differences among individuals. This can limit the number of decomposed motor units, particularly in challenging conditions. To address this issue, we recently introduced Swarm-Contrastive Decomposition (SCD), which dynamically adjusts the separation function based on the distribution of the data and prevents convergence to the same source. Initially applied to intramuscular EMG signals, SCD is here adapted for HD-sEMG signals. We demonstrated its ability to address key challenges faced by existing methods, particularly in identifying low-amplitude motor unit action potentials and effectively handling complex decomposition scenarios, like high-interference signals. We extensively validated SCD using simulated and experimental HD-sEMG recordings and compared it with current state-of-the-art decomposition methods under varying conditions, including different excitation levels, noise intensities, force profiles, sexes, and muscle groups. The proposed method consistently outperformed existing techniques in both the quantity of decoded motor units and the precision of their firing time identification. For instance, under certain experimental conditions, SCD detected more than three times as many motor units compared to previous methods, while also significantly improving accuracy. These advancements represent a major step forward in non-invasive EMG technology for studying motor unit activity in complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Independent Feature Enhanced Crossmodal Fusion for Match-Mismatch Classification of Speech Stimulus and EEG Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is crucial for auditory attention decoding to classify matched and mismatched speech stimuli with corresponding EEG responses by exploring their relationship. However, existing methods often adopt two independent networks to encode speech stimulus and EEG response, which neglect the relationship between these signals from the two modalities. In this paper, we propose an independent feature enhanced crossmodal fusion model (IFE-CF) for match-mismatch classification, which leverages the fusion feature of the speech stimulus and the EEG response to achieve auditory EEG decoding. Specifically, our IFE-CF contains a crossmodal encoder to encode the speech stimulus and the EEG response with a two-branch structure connected via crossmodal attention mechanism in the encoding process, a multi-channel fusion module to fuse features of two modalities by aggregating the interaction feature obtained from the crossmodal encoder and the independent feature obtained from the speech stimulus and EEG response, and a predictor to give the matching result. In addition, the causal mask is introduced to consider the time delay of the speech-EEG pair in the crossmodal encoder, which further enhances the feature representation for match-mismatch classification. Experiments demonstrate our method's effectiveness with better classification accuracy, as compared with the baseline of the Auditory EEG Decoding Challenge 2023.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop an MRI technique for free-breathing 3D whole-liver quantification of water T1, water T2, proton density fat fraction (PDFF), R2*. Methods: An Eight-echo spoiled gradient echo pulse sequence with spiral readout was developed by interleaving inversion recovery and T2 magnetization preparation. We propose a neural network based on a 4D and a 3D implicit neural representation (INR) which simultaneously learns the motion deformation fields and the static reference frame MRI subspace images respectively. Water and fat singular images were separated during network training, with no need of performing retrospective water-fat separation. T1, T2, R2* and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) produced by the proposed method were validated in vivo on 10 healthy subjects, using quantitative maps generated from conventional scans as reference. Results: Our results showed minimal bias and narrow 95% limits of agreement on T1, T2, R2* and PDFF values in the liver compared to conventional breath-holding scans. Conclusions: INR-MRF enabled co-registered 3D whole liver T1, T2, R2* and PDFF mapping in a single free-breathing scan.</description>

      <title>Robust Low-rank Tensor Train Recovery</title>

Abstract: Tensor train (TT) decomposition represents an $N$-order tensor using $O(N)$ matrices (i.e., factors) of small dimensions, achieved through products among these factors. Due to its compact representation, TT decomposition has found wide applications, including various tensor recovery problems in signal processing and quantum information. In this paper, we study the problem of reconstructing a TT format tensor from measurements that are contaminated by outliers with arbitrary values. Given the vulnerability of smooth formulations to corruptions, we use an $\ell_1$ loss function to enhance robustness against outliers. We first establish the $\ell_1/\ell_2$-restricted isometry property (RIP) for Gaussian measurement operators, demonstrating that the information in the TT format tensor can be preserved using a number of measurements that grows linearly with $N$. We also prove the sharpness property for the $\ell_1$ loss function optimized over TT format tensors. Building on the $\ell_1/\ell_2$-RIP and sharpness property, we then propose two complementary methods to recover the TT format tensor from the corrupted measurements: the projected subgradient method (PSubGM), which optimizes over the entire tensor, and the factorized Riemannian subgradient method (FRSubGM), which optimizes directly over the factors. Compared to PSubGM, the factorized approach FRSubGM significantly reduces the memory cost at the expense of a slightly slower convergence rate. Nevertheless, we show that both methods, with diminishing step sizes, converge linearly to the ground-truth tensor given an appropriate initialization, which can be obtained by a truncated spectral method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete cosine transform (DCT) is a central tool for image and video coding because it can be related to the Karhunen-Lo\`eve transform (KLT), which is the optimal transform in terms of retained transform coefficients and data decorrelation. In this paper, we introduce 16-, 32-, and 64-point low-complexity DCT approximations by minimizing individually the angle between the rows of the exact DCT matrix and the matrix induced by the approximate transforms. According to some classical figures of merit, the proposed transforms outperformed the approximations for the DCT already known in the literature. Fast algorithms were also developed for the low-complexity transforms, asserting a good balance between the performance and its computational cost. Practical applications in image encoding showed the relevance of the transforms in this context. In fact, the experiments showed that the proposed transforms had better results than the known approximations in the literature for the cases of 16, 32, and 64 blocklength.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Hybrid Precoding for Massive MU-MIMO ISAC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a very promising technology designed to provide both high rate communication capabilities and sensing capabilities. However, in Massive Multi User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (Massive MU MIMO-ISAC) systems, the dense user access creates a serious multi-user interference (MUI) problem, leading to degradation of communication performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) precoding method. We first model the MUI of dense user scenarios with minimizing Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) as an objective function.Hybrid precoding is an attractive ISAC technique, and hybrid precoding using Partially Connected Structures (PCS) can effectively reduce hardware cost and power consumption. We mitigate the MUI between dense users based on ThomlinsonHarashima Precoding (THP). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through simulation experiments. Compared with the existing methods, it can effectively improve the communication data rates and energy efficiency in dense user access scenario, and reduce the hardware complexity of Massive MU MIMO-ISAC systems. The experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of our method for improving the MUI problem in ISAC systems for dense user access scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing exploitation of Machine Learning (ML) in safety-critical applications necessitates rigorous safety analysis. Hardware reliability assessment is a major concern with respect to measuring the level of safety. Quantifying the reliability of emerging ML models, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), is highly complex due to their enormous size in terms of the number of parameters and computations. Conventionally, Fault Injection (FI) is applied to perform a reliability measurement. However, performing FI on modern-day DNNs is prohibitively time-consuming if an acceptable confidence level is to be achieved. In order to speed up FI for large DNNs, statistical FI has been proposed. However, the run-time for the large DNN models is still considerably long.
  In this work, we introduce DeepVigor+, a scalable, fast and accurate semi-analytical method as an efficient alternative for reliability measurement in DNNs. DeepVigor+ implements a fault propagation analysis model and attempts to acquire Vulnerability Factors (VFs) as reliability metrics in an optimal way. The results indicate that DeepVigor+ obtains VFs for DNN models with an error less than 1\% and 14.9 up to 26.9 times fewer simulations than the best-known state-of-the-art statistical FI enabling an accurate reliability analysis for emerging DNNs within a few minutes.</description>

      <title>Molecular Signal Reception in Complex Vessel Networks: The Role of the Network Topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of synthetic molecular communication (MC) refers to the transmission of information via molecules and is largely foreseen for use within the human body, where traditional electromagnetic wave (EM)-based communication is impractical. MC is anticipated to enable innovative medical applications, such as early-stage tumor detection, targeted drug delivery, and holistic approaches like the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). Many of these applications involve parts of the human cardiovascular system (CVS), here referred to as networks, posing challenges for MC due to their complex, highly branched vessel structures. To gain a better understanding of how the topology of such branched vessel networks affects the reception of a molecular signal at a target location, e.g., the network outlet, we present a generic analytical end-to-end model that characterizes molecule propagation and reception in linear branched vessel networks (LBVNs). We specialize this generic model to any MC system employing superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as signaling molecules and a planar coil as receiver (RX). By considering components that have been previously established in testbeds, we effectively isolate the impact of the network topology and validate our theoretical model with testbed data. Additionally, we propose two metrics, namely the molecule delay and the multi-path spread, that relate the LBVN topology to the molecule dispersion induced by the network, thereby linking the network structure to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the target location. This allows the characterization of the SNR at any point in the network solely based on the network topology. Consequently, our framework can, e.g., be exploited for optimal sensor placement in the CVS or identification of suitable testbed topologies for given SNR requirements.</description>

Abstract: The unique cost, flexibility, speed, and efficiency of modern UAVs make them an attractive choice in many applications in contemporary society. This, however, causes an ever-increasing number of reported malicious or accidental incidents, rendering the need for the development of UAV detection and classification mechanisms essential. We propose a methodology for developing a system that fuses already processed multi-sensor data into a new Deep Neural Network to increase its classification accuracy towards UAV detection. The DNN model fuses high-level features extracted from individual object detection and classification models associated with thermal, optronic, and radar data. Additionally, emphasis is given to the model's Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architecture that combines the features of the three sensor modalities by stacking the extracted image features of the thermal and optronic sensor achieving higher classification accuracy than each sensor alone.</description>

      <title>A Deep Unfolding-Based Scalarization Approach for Power Control in D2D Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing network utility in device-to-device networks is typically formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. This paper addresses the scenario where the optimization variables are from a bounded but continuous set, allowing each device to perform power control. The power at each link is optimized to maximize a desired network utility. Specifically, we consider the weighted-sum-rate. The state of the art benchmark for this problem is fractional programming with quadratic transform, known as FPLinQ. We propose a scalarization approach to transform the weighted-sum-rate, developing an iterative algorithm that depends on step sizes, a reference, and a direction vector. By employing the deep unfolding approach, we optimize these parameters by presenting the iterative algorithm as a finite sequence of steps, enabling it to be trained as a deep neural network. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the unfolded algorithm performs comparably to the benchmark in most cases while exhibiting lower complexity. Furthermore, the unfolded algorithm shows strong generalizability in terms of varying the number of users, the signal-to-noise ratio and arbitrary weights. The weighted-sum-rate maximizer can be integrated into a low-complexity fairness scheduler, updating priority weights via virtual queues and Lyapunov Drift Plus Penalty. This is demonstrated through experiments using proportional and max-min fairness.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Multistatic Target Detection in Cell-Free Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the target detection problem in a multistatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenario characterized by the cell-free MIMO communication network deployment, where multiple radio units (RUs) in the network cooperate with each other for the sensing task. By exploiting the angle resolution from multiple arrays deployed in the network and the delay resolution from the communication signals, i.e., orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, we formulate a cooperative sensing problem with coherent data fusion of multiple RUs' observations and propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based method, where the global coordinates of target locations are directly detected. Intensive numerical results indicate promising target detection performance of the proposed SBL-based method. Additionally, a theoretical analysis of the considered cooperative multistatic sensing task is provided using the pairwise error probability (PEP) analysis, which can be used to provide design insights, e.g., illumination and beam patterns, for the considered problem.</description>

      <title>ApSense: Data-driven Algorithm in PPG-based Sleep Apnea Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is essential for diagnosing and managing sleep health. Traditionally, this involves clinical settings with hardly accessible processes. We propose that the automated detection of OSA events is achievable using features extracted from fingertip photoplethysmography (PPG) signals combined with modern deep learning (DL) techniques. Utilizing two benchmark data sets with extensive PPG recordings, we introduce ApSense, a DL model designed for the OSA event onset recognition from PPG features. ApSense presents a custom neural architecture and domain-specific feature extraction from PPG waveforms. We benchmark it against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms, including RRWaveNet, PPGNetSA, AIOSA, DRIVEN, and LeNet-5. In our evaluations, ApSense demonstrated improved sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) on the test data sets. Furthermore, an ablation study highlighted strategic customizations of ApSense, enhancing its performance and adaptability to different data sets. ApSense demonstrates high reliability, as its outstanding results were confirmed even in high-variance data sets. By detecting OSA events, ApSense enables the estimation of the predicted apnea-hypopnea index (pAHI), which can be used for prescreening individuals for sleep apnea in a low-cost setup. ApSense shows the potential for the PPG-based OSA detection and clinical applications for prescreening in the future.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a pivotal clinical diagnostic tool, yet its extended scanning times often compromise patient comfort and image quality, especially in volumetric, temporal and quantitative scans. This review elucidates recent advances in MRI acceleration via data and physics-driven models, leveraging techniques from algorithm unrolling models, enhancement-based methods, and plug-and-play models to the emerging full spectrum of generative model-based methods. We also explore the synergistic integration of data models with physics-based insights, encompassing the advancements in multi-coil hardware accelerations like parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice imaging, and the optimization of sampling patterns. We then focus on domain-specific challenges and opportunities, including image redundancy exploitation, image integrity, evaluation metrics, data heterogeneity, and model generalization. This work also discusses potential solutions and future research directions, with an emphasis on the role of data harmonization and federated learning for further improving the general applicability and performance of these methods in MRI reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Multi-Layer Network Formation through HAPS Base Station and Transmissive RIS-Equipped UAV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to bolster future wireless networks, there has been a great deal of interest in non-terrestrial networks, especially aerial platforms including high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). These platforms can integrate advanced technologies such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In this regard, this paper proposes a multi-layer network architecture consisting of HAPS and UAV, where the former acts as a HAPS super macro base station (HAPS-SMBS), while the latter serves as a relay node for the ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The UAV is equipped with active transmissive RIS, which is a novel technology with promising benefits. We also utilize multiple-input single-output (MISO) technology, i.e., multiple antennas at the HAPS-SMBS and a single antenna at the IoT devices. Additionally, we consider NOMA as the multiple access technology as well as the existence of hardware impairments as a practical limitation. We compare the proposed system model with various scenarios, all involving the HAPS-SMBS and RIS-equipped UAV relay combination, but with different types of RIS, antenna configurations, and access technologies. Sum rate and energy efficiency are used as performance metrics, and the findings demonstrate that, in comparison to all benchmarks, the proposed system yields significant performance gains. Moreover, the hardware impairment limits the system performance at high transmit power levels.</description>

      <title>Du-IN: Discrete units-guided mask modeling for decoding speech from Intracranial Neural signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Invasive brain-computer interfaces with Electrocorticography (ECoG) have shown promise for high-performance speech decoding in medical applications, but less damaging methods like intracranial stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) remain underexplored. With rapid advances in representation learning, leveraging abundant recordings to enhance speech decoding is increasingly attractive. However, popular methods often pre-train temporal models based on brain-level tokens, overlooking that brain activities in different regions are highly desynchronized during tasks. Alternatively, they pre-train spatial-temporal models based on channel-level tokens but fail to evaluate them on challenging tasks like speech decoding, which requires intricate processing in specific language-related areas. To address this issue, we collected a well-annotated Chinese word-reading sEEG dataset targeting language-related brain networks from 12 subjects. Using this benchmark, we developed the Du-IN model, which extracts contextual embeddings based on region-level tokens through discrete codex-guided mask modeling. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 61-word classification task, surpassing all baselines. Model comparisons and ablation studies reveal that our design choices, including (i) temporal modeling based on region-level tokens by utilizing 1D depthwise convolution to fuse channels in the lateral sensorimotor cortex (vSMC) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) and (ii) self-supervision through discrete codex-guided mask modeling, significantly contribute to this performance. Overall, our approach -- inspired by neuroscience findings and capitalizing on region-level representations from specific brain regions -- is suitable for invasive brain modeling and represents a promising neuro-inspired AI approach in brain-computer interfaces.</description>

      <title>Medformer: A Multi-Granularity Patching Transformer for Medical Time-Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical time series (MedTS) data, such as Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electrocardiography (ECG), play a crucial role in healthcare, such as diagnosing brain and heart diseases. Existing methods for MedTS classification primarily rely on handcrafted biomarkers extraction and CNN-based models, with limited exploration of transformer-based models. In this paper, we introduce Medformer, a multi-granularity patching transformer tailored specifically for MedTS classification. Our method incorporates three novel mechanisms to leverage the unique characteristics of MedTS: cross-channel patching to leverage inter-channel correlations, multi-granularity embedding for capturing features at different scales, and two-stage (intra- and inter-granularity) multi-granularity self-attention for learning features and correlations within and among granularities. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets under both subject-dependent and challenging subject-independent setups. Results demonstrate Medformer's superiority over 10 baselines, achieving top averaged ranking across five datasets on all six evaluation metrics. These findings underscore the significant impact of our method on healthcare applications, such as diagnosing Myocardial Infarction, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. We release the source code at https://github.com/DL4mHealth/Medformer.</description>

      <title>Interbeat Interval Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A number of inhibitory and excitatory factors regulate the beating of the heart. Consequently, the inter-beat intervals (IBIs) are not constant but vary around a mean value, even in the absence of external factors like exercise or stress. Various statistics have been proposed to capture the heart rate variability (HRV) to provide a glimpse into this balance. These statistics usually require accurate estimation of IBIs as a first step. However, estimating IBIs accurately can be challenging in practice, especially for signals recorded in ambulatory conditions. We propose a lightweight state-space filter that models the IBIs as samples of an inverse Gaussian distribution with time-varying parameters. We make the filter robust against outliers by adapting the probabilistic data association filter to the setup. We demonstrate that the resulting filter can accurately identify outliers and the parameters of the tracked distribution can be used to compute a specific HRV statistic (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals) without further analysis.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Property Sensing Based on Diffusion Model in ISAC System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has opened up numerous game-changing opportunities for future wireless systems. In this paper, we develop a novel ISAC scheme that utilizes the diffusion model to sense the electromagnetic (EM) property of the target in a predetermined sensing area. Specifically, we first estimate the sensing channel by using both the communications and the sensing signals echoed back from the target. Then we employ the diffusion model to generate the point cloud that represents the target and thus enables 3D visualization of the target's EM property distribution. In order to minimize the mean Chamfer distance (MCD) between the ground truth and the estimated point clouds, we further design the communications and sensing beamforming matrices under the constraint of a maximum transmit power and a minimum communications achievable rate for each user equipment (UE). Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in achieving high-quality reconstruction of the target's shape, relative permittivity, and conductivity. Besides, the proposed method can sense the EM property of the target effectively in any position of the sensing area.</description>

Abstract: The use of Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRSs) is considered a potential enabling technology for enhancing the spectral and energy efficiency of beyond 5G communication systems. In this paper, a joint relay and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted communication is considered to investigate the gains of optimizing both the phase angles and selection of relays. The combination of successive refinement and reinforcement learning is proposed. Successive refinement algorithm is used for phase optimization and reinforcement learning is used for relay selection. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach offers improved achievable rate performance and scales better with number of relays compared to considered benchmark approaches.</description>

      <title>Upper limb surface electromyography -- geometry, spectral characteristics, temporal evolution, and demographic confounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain-body-computer interfaces aim to provide a fluid and natural way for humans to interact with technology. Among noninvasive interfaces, surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals have shown particular utility. However, much remains unknown about how sEMG is affected by various physiological and anatomical factors and how these confounds might affect gesture decoding across individuals or groups. In this article, we show that sEMG signals evince non-Euclidean graph data structure that is defined by a set of orthogonal axes and explain the signal distribution shift across individuals. We provide a dataset of upper limb sEMG signals and physiological measures of 91 adults as they perform 10 different hand gestures. Participants were selected to be representative of various age groups (18to 92 years) and BMI (healthy, overweight, and obese). Additional anatomical or physiological measures that might impact sEMG signals were also collected, such as skin hydration and elasticity. The article describes the inherent structure of sEMG data and provides methods to construct differentiable signal features that can be used with machine learning algorithms that use backpropagation. We then analyze how those parameters correlate with various physiological measures to probe if they can induce bias against (or towards) certain population groups. We find that higher frequencies in sEMG, although comprising less power than lower ones, provide better gesture decoding and show less bias with regard to demographic, circumstantial, and physiological confounds (such as age, skin hydration, and skin elasticity).</description>

      <title>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) for Mobile Communications: A Diffusion Model Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article targets at unlocking the potentials of a class of prominent generative artificial intelligence (GAI) method, namely diffusion model (DM), for mobile communications. First, a DM-driven communication architecture is proposed, which introduces two key paradigms, i.e., conditional DM and DM-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL), for wireless data generation and communication management, respectively. Then, we discuss the key advantages of DM-driven communication paradigms. To elaborate further, we explore DM-driven channel generation mechanisms for channel estimation, extrapolation, and feedback in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We showcase the numerical performance of conditional DM using the accurate DeepMIMO channel datasets, revealing its superiority in generating high-fidelity channels and mitigating unforeseen distribution shifts in sophisticated scenes. Furthermore, several DM-driven communication management designs are conceived, which is promising to deal with imperfect channels and task-oriented communications. To inspire future research developments, we highlight the potential applications and open research challenges of DM-driven communications.

      <title>GBSense: A GHz-Bandwidth Compressed Spectrum Sensing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents GBSense, an innovative compressed spectrum sensing system designed for GHz-bandwidth signals in dynamic spectrum access (DSA) applications. GBSense introduces an efficient approach to periodic nonuniform sampling, capturing wideband signals using significantly lower sampling rates compared to traditional Nyquist sampling. By integrating time-interleaved analog-to-digital conversion, GBSense overcomes the hardware complexity typically associated with traditional multicoset sampling, providing precise, real-time adjustable sampling patterns without the need for analog delay circuits. The system's ability to process signals with a 2 GHz radio frequency bandwidth using only a 400 MHz average sampling rate enables more efficient spectrum monitoring and access in wideband cognitive radios. Lab tests demonstrate 100\% accurate spectrum detection when the spectrum occupancy is below 100 MHz and over 80\% accuracy for occupancy up to 200 MHz. Additionally, an integrated system utilizing a low-power Raspberry Pi processor achieves a low processing latency of around 30 ms per frame, demonstrating the system's potential for real-time applications in cognitive radio networks, 5G, and future 6G infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Comparing Differentiable and Dynamic Ray Tracing: Introducing the Multipath Lifetime Map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing presence of dynamic scenarios, such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle communications, radio propagation modeling tools must adapt to the rapidly changing nature of the radio channel. Recently, both Differentiable and Dynamic Ray Tracing frameworks have emerged to address these challenges. However, there is often confusion about how these approaches differ and which one should be used in specific contexts. In this paper, we provide an overview of these two techniques and a comparative analysis against two state-of-the-art tools: 3DSCAT from UniBo and Sionna from NVIDIA. To provide a more precise characterization of the scope of these methods, we introduce a novel simulation-based metric, the Multipath Lifetime Map, which enables the evaluation of spatial and temporal coherence in radio channels only based on the geometrical description of the environment. Finally, our metrics are evaluated on a classic urban street canyon scenario, yielding similar results to those obtained from measurement campaigns.</description>

      <title>Conditioning and Sampling in Variational Diffusion Models for Speech Super-Resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have been increasingly used in audio processing tasks, including speech super-resolution (SR), which aims to restore high-frequency content given low-resolution speech utterances. This is commonly achieved by conditioning the network of noise predictor with low-resolution audio. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling algorithm that communicates the information of the low-resolution audio via the reverse sampling process of DMs. The proposed method can be a drop-in replacement for the vanilla sampling process and can significantly improve the performance of the existing works. Moreover, by coupling the proposed sampling method with an unconditional DM, i.e., a DM with no auxiliary inputs to its noise predictor, we can generalize it to a wide range of SR setups. We also attain state-of-the-art results on the VCTK Multi-Speaker benchmark with this novel formulation.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware and Reliable Neural MIMO Receivers via Modular Bayesian Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02436</link>

Abstract: Deep learning is envisioned to play a key role in the design of future wireless receivers. A popular approach to design learning-aided receivers combines deep neural networks (DNNs) with traditional model-based receiver algorithms, realizing hybrid model-based data-driven architectures. Such architectures typically include multiple modules, each carrying out a different functionality dictated by the model-based receiver workflow. Conventionally trained DNN-based modules are known to produce poorly calibrated, typically overconfident, decisions. Consequently, incorrect decisions may propagate through the architecture without any indication of their insufficient accuracy. To address this problem, we present a novel combination of Bayesian deep learning with hybrid model-based data-driven architectures for wireless receiver design. The proposed methodology, referred to as modular Bayesian deep learning, is designed to yield calibrated modules, which in turn improves both accuracy and calibration of the overall receiver. We specialize this approach for two fundamental tasks in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers - equalization and decoding. In the presence of scarce data, the ability of modular Bayesian deep learning to produce reliable uncertainty measures is consistently shown to directly translate into improved performance of the overall MIMO receiver chain.</description>

      <title>A Rainbow in Deep Network Black Boxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central question in deep learning is to understand the functions learned by deep networks. What is their approximation class? Do the learned weights and representations depend on initialization? Previous empirical work has evidenced that kernels defined by network activations are similar across initializations. For shallow networks, this has been theoretically studied with random feature models, but an extension to deep networks has remained elusive. Here, we provide a deep extension of such random feature models, which we call the rainbow model. We prove that rainbow networks define deterministic (hierarchical) kernels in the infinite-width limit. The resulting functions thus belong to a data-dependent RKHS which does not depend on the weight randomness. We also verify numerically our modeling assumptions on deep CNNs trained on image classification tasks, and show that the trained networks approximately satisfy the rainbow hypothesis. In particular, rainbow networks sampled from the corresponding random feature model achieve similar performance as the trained networks. Our results highlight the central role played by the covariances of network weights at each layer, which are observed to be low-rank as a result of feature learning.</description>

      <title>Limiting Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14566v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various problems in engineering and natural science demand binary sequences that do not resemble translates of themselves, that is, the sequences must have small aperiodic autocorrelation at every nonzero shift. If $f$ is a sequence, then the demerit factor of $f$ is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the autocorrelations at all nonzero shifts for the sequence obtained by normalizing $f$ to unit Euclidean norm. The demerit factor is the reciprocal of Golay's merit factor, and low demerit factor indicates low self-similarity of a sequence under translation. We endow the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ with uniform probability measure and consider the distribution of their demerit factors. Earlier works used combinatorial techniques to find exact formulas for the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution as a function of $\ell$. These revealed that for $\ell \geq 4$, the $p$th central moment of this distribution is strictly positive for every $p \geq 2$. This article shows that for every $p$, the $p$th central moment is $\ell^{-2 p}$ times a quasi-polynomial function of $\ell$ with rational coefficients. It also shows that, in the limit as $\ell$ tends to infinity, the $p$th standardized moment is the same as that of the standard normal distribution.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Semantic Communication: Architecture, Challenges, and Outlook</title>

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) is expected to be a core paradigm in future communication networks, yielding significant benefits in terms of spectrum resource saving and information interaction efficiency. However, the existing SemCom structure is limited by the lack of context-reasoning ability and background knowledge provisioning, which, therefore, motivates us to seek the potential of incorporating generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technologies with SemCom. Recognizing GAI's powerful capability in automating and creating valuable, diverse, and personalized multimodal content, this article first highlights the principal characteristics of the combination of GAI and SemCom along with their pertinent benefits and challenges. To tackle these challenges, we further propose a novel GAI-integrated SemCom network (GAI-SCN) framework in a cloud-edge-mobile design. Specifically, by employing global and local GAI models, our GAI-SCN enables multimodal semantic content provisioning, semantic-level joint-source-channel coding, and AIGC acquisition to maximize the efficiency and reliability of semantic reasoning and resource utilization. Afterward, we present a detailed implementation workflow of GAI-SCN, followed by corresponding initial simulations for performance evaluation in comparison with two benchmarks. Finally, we discuss several open issues and offer feasible solutions to unlock the full potential of GAI-SCN.</description>

      <title>Distributed Error-Identification and Correction using Block-Sparse Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conventional solutions for fault-detection, identification, and reconstruction (FDIR) require centralized decision-making mechanisms which are typically combinatorial in their nature, necessitating the design of an efficient distributed FDIR mechanism that is suitable for multi-agent applications. To this end, we develop a general framework for efficiently reconstructing a sparse vector being observed over a sensor network via nonlinear measurements. The proposed framework is used to design a distributed multi-agent FDIR algorithm based on a combination of the sequential convex programming (SCP) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimization approaches. The proposed distributed FDIR algorithm can process a variety of inter-agent measurements (including distances, bearings, relative velocities, and subtended angles between agents) to identify the faulty agents and recover their true states. The effectiveness of the proposed distributed multi-agent FDIR approach is demonstrated by considering a numerical example in which the inter-agent distances are used to identify the faulty agents in a multi-agent configuration, as well as reconstruct their error vectors.</description>

      <title>Fourier Analysis of Signals on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) Using Graph Zero-Padding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are used for modeling causal relationships, dependencies, and flows in various systems. However, spectral analysis becomes impractical in this setting because the eigendecomposition of the adjacency matrix yields all eigenvalues equal to zero. This inherent property of DAGs results in an inability to differentiate between frequency components of signals on such graphs. This problem can be addressed by {alternating the Fourier basis or adding edges in a DAG}. However, these approaches change the physics of the considered problem. To address this limitation, we propose a \textit{graph zero-padding} approach. This approach involves augmenting the original DAG with additional vertices that are connected to the existing structure. The added vertices are characterized by signal values set to zero. The proposed technique enables the spectral evaluation of system outputs on DAGs (in almost all cases), that is the computation of vertex-domain convolution without the adverse effects of aliasing due to changes in a graph structure, { with the ultimate goal of preserving the output of the system on a graph as if the changes in the graph structure were not performed}.</description>

      <title>Joint Sensing and Semantic Communications with Multi-Task Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of deep learning techniques for joint sensing and communications, with an extension to semantic communications. The integrated system comprises a transmitter and receiver operating over a wireless channel, subject to noise and fading. The transmitter employs a deep neural network (DNN), namely an encoder, for joint operations of source coding, channel coding, and modulation, while the receiver utilizes another DNN, namely a decoder, for joint operations of demodulation, channel decoding, and source decoding to reconstruct the data samples. The transmitted signal serves a dual purpose, supporting communication with the receiver and enabling sensing. When a target is present, the reflected signal is received, and another DNN decoder is utilized for sensing. This decoder is responsible for detecting the target's presence and determining its range. All these DNNs, including one encoder and two decoders, undergo joint training through multi-task learning, considering data and channel characteristics. This paper extends to incorporate semantic communications by introducing an additional DNN, another decoder at the receiver, operating as a task classifier. This decoder evaluates the fidelity of label classification for received signals, enhancing the integration of semantics within the communication process. The study presents results based on using the CIFAR-10 as the input data and accounting for channel effects like Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading. The results underscore the effectiveness of multi-task deep learning in achieving high-fidelity joint sensing and semantic communications.</description>

      <title>Covariance-Based Activity Detection in Cooperative Multi-Cell Massive MIMO: Scaling Law and Efficient Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the covariance-based activity detection problem in a multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. In this system, active devices transmit their signature sequences to multiple base stations (BSs), and the BSs cooperatively detect the active devices based on the received signals. While the scaling law for the covariance-based activity detection in the single-cell scenario has been extensively analyzed in the literature, this paper aims to analyze the scaling law for the covariance-based activity detection in the multi-cell massive MIMO system. Specifically, this paper demonstrates a quadratic scaling law in the multi-cell system, under the assumption that the path-loss exponent of the fading channel $\gamma &gt; 2.$ This finding shows that, in the multi-cell massive MIMO system, the maximum number of active devices that can be correctly detected in each cell increases quadratically with the length of the signature sequence and decreases logarithmically with the number of cells (as the number of antennas tends to infinity). Moreover, in addition to analyzing the scaling law for the signature sequences randomly and uniformly distributed on a sphere, the paper also establishes the scaling law for signature sequences based on a finite alphabet, which are easier to generate and store. Finally, this paper proposes two efficient accelerated coordinate descent (CD) algorithms with a convergence guarantee for solving the device activity detection problem. The first algorithm reduces the complexity of CD by using an inexact coordinate update strategy. The second algorithm avoids unnecessary computations of CD by using an active set selection strategy. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms exhibit excellent performance in terms of computational efficiency and detection error probability.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Labels: Unveiling Text-Dependency in Paralinguistic Speech Recognition Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Paralinguistic traits like cognitive load and emotion are increasingly recognized as pivotal areas in speech recognition research, often examined through specialized datasets like CLSE and IEMOCAP. However, the integrity of these datasets is seldom scrutinized for text-dependency. This paper critically evaluates the prevalent assumption that machine learning models trained on such datasets genuinely learn to identify paralinguistic traits, rather than merely capturing lexical features. By examining the lexical overlap in these datasets and testing the performance of machine learning models, we expose significant text-dependency in trait-labeling. Our results suggest that some machine learning models, especially large pre-trained models like HuBERT, might inadvertently focus on lexical characteristics rather than the intended paralinguistic features. The study serves as a call to action for the research community to reevaluate the reliability of existing datasets and methodologies, ensuring that machine learning models genuinely learn what they are designed to recognize.</description>

      <title>Improving Galileo OSNMA Time To First Authenticated Fix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galileo is the first global navigation satellite system to authenticate their civilian signals through the Open Service Galileo Message Authentication (OSNMA) protocol. However, OSNMA delays the time to obtain a first position and time fix, the Time To First Authentication Fix (TTFAF). Reducing the TTFAF as much as possible is crucial to integrate the technology seamlessly into the current products. In the cases where the receiver already has cryptographic data available, the so-called hot start mode and focus of this article, the currently available implementations achieve an average TTFAF of around 100 seconds in ideal environments. In this work, we explore the TTFAF optimizations available to general OSNMA capable receivers and to receivers with a tighter time synchronization than the required by the OSNMA guidelines. We dissect the TTFAF process, describe the optimizations, and benchmark them in three distinct scenarios with recorded real data (open-sky, soft urban, and hard urban) and the official OSNMA test vectors. The first block of optimizations centers on extracting as much information as possible from broken sub-frames by processing them at page level and combining redundant data from multiple satellites. The second block of optimizations aims to reconstruct missed navigation data by the intelligent use of fields in the authentication tags belonging to the same sub-frame as the authentication key. Combining both optimization ideas improves the TTFAF substantially for all considered scenarios. We obtain an average TTFAF of 60.9 and 68.8 seconds for the test vectors and the open-sky scenario, respectively, with a lowest TTFAF of 44.0 seconds in both. Likewise, the urban scenarios see a drastic reduction of the average TTFAF between the non-optimized and optimized cases. These optimizations have been made available as part of the open-source OSNMAlib library on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Time-of-arrival Estimation and Phase Unwrapping of Head-related Transfer Functions With Integer Linear Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In binaural audio synthesis, aligning head-related impulse responses (HRIRs) in time has been an important pre-processing step, enabling accurate spatial interpolation and efficient data compression. The maximum correlation time delay between spatially nearby HRIRs has previously been used to get accurate and smooth alignment by solving a matrix equation in which the solution has the minimum Euclidean distance to the time delay. However, the Euclidean criterion could lead to an over-smoothing solution in practice. In this paper, we solve the smoothing issue by formulating the task as solving an integer linear programming problem equivalent to minimising an $L^1$-norm. Moreover, we incorporate 1) the cross-correlation of inter-aural HRIRs, and 2) HRIRs with their minimum-phase responses to have more reference measurements for optimisation. We show the proposed method can get more accurate alignments than the Euclidean-based method by comparing the spectral reconstruction loss of time-aligned HRIRs using spherical harmonics representation on seven HRIRs consisting of human and dummy heads. The extra correlation features and the $L^1$-norm are also beneficial in extremely noisy conditions. In addition, this method can be applied to phase unwrapping of head-related transfer functions, where the unwrapped phase could be a compact feature for downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Automatic AI Model Selection for Wireless Systems: Online Learning via Digital Twinning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern wireless network architectures, such as O-RAN, artificial intelligence (AI)-based applications are deployed at intelligent controllers to carry out functionalities like scheduling or power control. The AI "apps" are selected on the basis of contextual information such as network conditions, topology, traffic statistics, and design goals. The mapping between context and AI model parameters is ideally done in a zero-shot fashion via an automatic model selection (AMS) mapping that leverages only contextual information without requiring any current data. This paper introduces a general methodology for the online optimization of AMS mappings. Optimizing an AMS mapping is challenging, as it requires exposure to data collected from many different contexts. Therefore, if carried out online, this initial optimization phase would be extremely time consuming. A possible solution is to leverage a digital twin of the physical system to generate synthetic data from multiple simulated contexts. However, given that the simulator at the digital twin is imperfect, a direct use of simulated data for the optimization of the AMS mapping would yield poor performance when tested in the real system. This paper proposes a novel method for the online optimization of AMS mapping that corrects for the bias of the simulator by means of limited real data collected from the physical system. Experimental results for a graph neural network-based power control app demonstrate the significant advantages of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Gemini: Integrating Full-fledged Sensing upon Millimeter Wave Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04174v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating millimeter wave (mmWave)technology in both communication and sensing is promising as it enables the reuse of existing spectrum and infrastructure without draining resources. Most existing systems piggyback sensing onto conventional communication modes without fully exploiting the potential of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in mmWave radios (not full-fledged). In this paper, we design and implement a full-fledged mmWave ISAC system Gemini; it delivers raw channel states to serve a broad category of sensing applications. We first propose the mmWave self-interference cancellation approach to extract the weak reflected signals for near-field sensing purposes. Then, we develop a joint optimization scheduling framework that can be utilized in accurate radar sensing while maximizing the communication throughput. Finally, we design a united fusion sensing algorithm to offer a better sensing performance via combining monostatic and bistatic modes. We evaluate our system in extensive experiments to demonstrate Gemini's capability of simultaneously operating sensing and communication, enabling mmWave ISAC to perform better than the commercial off-the-shelf mmWave radar for 5G cellular networks.</description>

Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) is a state estimation algorithm that optimally combines system knowledge and measurements to minimize the mean squared error of the estimated states. While KF was initially designed for linear systems, numerous extensions of it, such as extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), cubature Kalman filter (CKF), etc., have been proposed for nonlinear systems. Although different types of nonlinear KFs have different pros and cons, they all use the same framework of linear KF, which, according to what we found in this paper, tends to give overconfident and less accurate state estimations when the measurement functions are nonlinear. Therefore, in this study, we designed a new framework for nonlinear KFs and showed theoretically and empirically that the new framework estimates the states and covariance matrix more accurately than the old one. The new framework was tested on four different nonlinear KFs and five different tasks, showcasing its ability to reduce the estimation errors by several orders of magnitude in low-measurement-noise conditions, with only about a 10 to 90% increase in computational time. All types of nonlinear KFs can benefit from the new framework, and the benefit will increase as the sensors become more and more accurate in the future. As an example, EKF, the simplest nonlinear KF that was previously believed to work poorly for strongly nonlinear systems, can now provide fast and fairly accurate state estimations with the help of the new framework.

      <title>GroupCDL: Interpretable Denoising and Compressed Sensing MRI via Learned Group-Sparsity and Circulant Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal self-similarity within images has become an increasingly popular prior in deep-learning models. Despite their successful image restoration performance, such models remain largely uninterpretable due to their black-box construction. Our previous studies have shown that interpretable construction of a fully convolutional denoiser (CDLNet), with performance on par with state-of-the-art black-box counterparts, is achievable by unrolling a convolutional dictionary learning algorithm. In this manuscript, we seek an interpretable construction of a convolutional network with a nonlocal self-similarity prior that performs on par with black-box nonlocal models. We show that such an architecture can be effectively achieved by upgrading the L1 sparsity prior (soft-thresholding) of CDLNet to an image-adaptive group-sparsity prior (group-thresholding). The proposed learned group-thresholding makes use of nonlocal attention to perform spatially varying soft-thresholding on the latent representation. To enable effective training and inference on large images with global artifacts, we propose a novel circulant-sparse attention. We achieve competitive natural-image denoising performance compared to black-box nonlocal DNNs and transformers. The interpretable construction of our network allows for a straightforward extension to Compressed Sensing MRI (CS-MRI), yielding state-of-the-art performance. Lastly, we show robustness to noise-level mismatches between training and inference for denoising and CS-MRI reconstruction.</description>

      <title>An Electrocardiogram Foundation Model Built on over 10 Million Recordings with External Evaluation across Multiple Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in ECG analysis and cardiovascular disease assessment. Recently, foundation models have played a remarkable role in advancing medical AI. The development of an ECG foundation model holds the promise of elevating AI-ECG research to new heights. However, building such a model faces several challenges, including insufficient database sample sizes and inadequate generalization across multiple domains. Additionally, there is a notable performance gap between single-lead and multi-lead ECG analyses. We introduced an ECG Foundation Model (ECGFounder), a general-purpose model that leverages real-world ECG annotations from cardiology experts to broaden the diagnostic capabilities of ECG analysis. ECGFounder was trained on over 10 million ECGs with 150 label categories from the Harvard-Emory ECG Database, enabling comprehensive cardiovascular disease diagnosis through ECG analysis. The model is designed to be both an effective out-of-the-box solution, and a to be fine-tunable for downstream tasks, maximizing usability. Importantly, we extended its application to lower rank ECGs, and arbitrary single-lead ECGs in particular. ECGFounder is applicable to supporting various downstream tasks in mobile monitoring scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ECGFounder achieves expert-level performance on internal validation sets, with AUROC exceeding 0.95 for eighty diagnoses. It also shows strong classification performance and generalization across various diagnoses on external validation sets. When fine-tuned, ECGFounder outperforms baseline models in demographic analysis, clinical event detection, and cross-modality cardiac rhythm diagnosis. The trained model and data will be publicly released upon publication through the bdsp.io. Our code is available at https://github.com/bdsp-core/ECGFounder</description>

      <title>SensorBench: Benchmarking LLMs in Coding-Based Sensor Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective processing, interpretation, and management of sensor data have emerged as a critical component of cyber-physical systems. Traditionally, processing sensor data requires profound theoretical knowledge and proficiency in signal-processing tools. However, recent works show that Large Language Models (LLMs) have promising capabilities in processing sensory data, suggesting their potential as copilots for developing sensing systems.
  To explore this potential, we construct a comprehensive benchmark, SensorBench, to establish a quantifiable objective. The benchmark incorporates diverse real-world sensor datasets for various tasks. The results show that while LLMs exhibit considerable proficiency in simpler tasks, they face inherent challenges in processing compositional tasks with parameter selections compared to engineering experts. Additionally, we investigate four prompting strategies for sensor processing and show that self-verification can outperform all other baselines in 48% of tasks. Our study provides a comprehensive benchmark and prompting analysis for future developments, paving the way toward an LLM-based sensor processing copilot.</description>

      <title>Wireless Human-Machine Collaboration in Industry 5.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless Human-Machine Collaboration (WHMC) represents a critical advancement for Industry 5.0, enabling seamless interaction between humans and machines across geographically distributed systems. As the WHMC systems become increasingly important for achieving complex collaborative control tasks, ensuring their stability is essential for practical deployment and long-term operation. Stability analysis certifies how the closed-loop system will behave under model randomness, which is essential for systems operating with wireless communications. However, the fundamental stability analysis of the WHMC systems remains an unexplored challenge due to the intricate interplay between the stochastic nature of wireless communications, dynamic human operations, and the inherent complexities of control system dynamics. This paper establishes a fundamental WHMC model incorporating dual wireless loops for machine and human control. Our framework accounts for practical factors such as short-packet transmissions, fading channels, and advanced HARQ schemes. We model human control lag as a Markov process, which is crucial for capturing the stochastic nature of human interactions. Building on this model, we propose a stochastic cycle-cost-based approach to derive a stability condition for the WHMC system, expressed in terms of wireless channel statistics, human dynamics, and control parameters. Our findings are validated through extensive numerical simulations and a proof-of-concept experiment, where we developed and tested a novel wireless collaborative cart-pole control system. The results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and provide a robust framework for future research on WHMC systems in more complex environments.</description>
