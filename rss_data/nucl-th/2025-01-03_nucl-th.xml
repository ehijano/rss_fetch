      <title>Erratum: Exact solutions to the fermion propagator Schwinger-Dyson equation in Minkowski space with on-shell renormalization for quenched QED \newline [Phys. Rev. D 96, 036021 (2017)]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the introduction of a spectral representation, the Schwinger--Dyson equation (SDE) for the fermion propagator is formulated in Minkowski space in QED. After imposing the on-shell renormalization conditions, numeric solutions for the fermion propagator spectral functions are obtained in four dimensions with a renormalizable version of the Gauge Technique Ansatz for the fermion-photon vertex in the quenched approximation in the Yennie gauge. Despite the limitations of this model, having an explicit solution provides a guiding example of the fermion propagator with the correct analytic structure.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of hybrid neutron star EoS constraints within a nonlocal color superconducting quark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a physics-informed Bayesian analysis of equation of state constraints using observational data for masses, radii and tidal deformability of pulsars and a generic class of hybrid neutron star equation of state with color superconducting quark matter on the basis of a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model. The nuclear matter phase is described within a relativistic density functional model of the DD2 class and the phase transition is obtained by a Maxwell construction. We find the region in the two-dimensional parameter space spanned by the vector meson coupling and the scalar diquark coupling, where three conditions are fulfilled: 1) the Maxwell construction can be performed, 2) the maximum mass of the hybrid neutron star is not smaller than 2.0 M$_\odot$ and 3) the onset density of the phase transition is not below the nuclear saturation density $n_0=0.15$ fm$^{-3}$. The result of this study shows that the favorable neutron star equation of state has low onset masses for the occurrence of a color superconducting quark matter core between $0.5-0.7~M_\odot$ and maximum masses in the range $2.15 - 2.22~M_\odot$. In the typical mass range of $1.2 - 2.0~M_\odot$, the radii of these stars are between 11.9 and 12.4 km, almost independent of the mass. In principle, hybrid stars would allow for larger maximum masses than provided by the hadronic reference equation of state.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of large-momentum distribution in nuclei with the operator product expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operator product expansion (OPE) is applied in conjunction with Pionless effective field theory to study the short-rang structure of nuclei. By matching the OPE with the selected nuclear potentials for nucleon-nucleon scattering states, we obtain the Wilson coefficients. The nucleon momentum distribution in the deuteron is then used to test the OPE against the predictions of these nuclear potentials. In order to achieve a systematic separation of short-range and long-range interactions, we discuss how the OPE approximation can be improved by including higher-order EFT potentials and higher-dimension local operators.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for exploring hadron-hadron interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this proceeding, we introduce deep learning technologies for studying hadron-hadron interactions. To extract parameterized hadron interaction potentials from collision experiments, we employ a supervised learning approach using Femtoscopy data. The deep neural networks (DNNs) are trained to learn the inverse mapping from observations to potentials. To link between experiments and first-principles simulations, we further investigate hadronic interactions in Lattice QCD simulations from the HAL QCD method perspective. Using an unsupervised learning approach, we construct a model-free potential function with symmetric DNNs, aiming to learn hadron interactions directly from simulated correlation functions (equal-time Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes). On both fronts, deep learning methods show great promise in advancing our understanding of hadron interactions.</description>

      <title>Closed-form formulas in number-conserved pairing theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, I present closed-form formulas for the norm and many-body density matrices between general wave functions with exact particle numbers in pairing theory, using properties of the generalized Kronecker delta. These formulas, expressed as sums of minors and Pfaffians, apply to both even and odd particle-number systems and accommodate pair condensate as well as broken-pair configurations. This formalism directly facilitates applications in the generator coordinate method and symmetry restoration techniques, including angular momentum projection.</description>

      <title>Reexamination of nuclear structure properties and shape coexistence of nuclei around A70</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reexamine the nuclear structure properties of waiting point nuclei around A70 using the interacting boson model 1 (IBM 1) and the relativistic mean field (RMF) model. Effective density dependent meson exchange functional (DD ME2) and density dependent point coupling functional (DD PC1) were used for the RMF calculations. We calculated the energy levels, the geometric shapes, binding and separation energies of nucleons and quadrupole deformation parameters (\b{eta}2). The shape coexistence phenomena in A 70 nuclei (68Se, 70Se, 70Br, 70Kr, 72Kr, 74Kr, 74Rb, and 74Sr) was later investigated. Spherical and deformed shapes of the selected waiting point nuclei were computed using the IBM 1 and RMF models, respectively. The proton neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (pn QRPA) model was used to calculate \b{eta} decay properties (Gamow Teller strength distributions, \b{eta} decay half lives, and branching ratios) of selected nuclei as a function of \b{eta}2. The results revealed a significant variation in calculated half lives and Gamow Teller strength distributions as the shape parameter was changed. The \b{eta}2 computed via DD ME2 functional resulted in half lives in best agreement with the measured data.</description>

      <title>General features of the stellar matter equation of state from microscopic theory, new maximum-mass constraints, and causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The profile of a neutron star probes a very large range of densities, from the density of iron up to several times the density of saturated nuclear matter, and thus no theory of hadrons can be considered reliable if extended to those regions. We emphasize the importance of taking contemporary ab initio theories of nuclear and neutron matter as the baseline for any extension method, which will unavoidably involve some degree of phenomenology. We discuss how microscopic theory, on the one end, with causality and maximum-mass constraints, on the other, set strong boundaries to the high-density equation of state. We present our latest neutron star predictions where we combine polytropic extensions and parametrizations guided by speed of sound considerations. The predictions we show include our baseline neutron star cooling curves.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Rise in Nuclear Collectivity from Short-Range Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover a surprising relation between the collective motion of nucleons within atomic nuclei, traditionally understood to be driven by long-range correlations, and short-range nucleon-nucleon interactions. Specifically, we find that quadrupole collectivity in low-lying states of $^6$Li and $^{12}$C, calculated with state-of-the-art ab initio techniques, is significantly influenced by two opposing $S$-wave contact couplings that subtly alter the surface oscillations of one largely deformed nuclear shape, without changing that shape's overall contribution within the nucleus. The results offer new insights into the nature of emergent nuclear collectivity and its link to the underlying nucleon-nucleon interaction at short distances.</description>

      <title>Isospin effect on the liquid-gas phase transition for finite nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of nuclear liquid-gas phase transition is a topic of contemporary interest. In heavy-ion collisions, there is no direct way of accessing the thermodynamic variables like pressure, density, free energy, entropy etc., and unambiguous detection of phase transition becomes difficult. A peak in the first order derivative of total multiplicity with respect to temperature (commonly abbreviated as the multiplicity derivative) has been established as a new experimentally accessible signature of the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition. In this work, the effect of isospin asymmetry in the fragmenting system, as well as the nuclear equation of state, on the multiplicity derivative and specific heat at constant volume is investigated within the framework of the Canonical Thermodynamical Model (CTM) with a semi-microscopic cluster functional.</description>

      <title>Validation and extrapolation of atomic mass with physics-informed fully connected neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning offers a powerful framework for validating and predicting atomic mass. We compare three improved neural network methods for representation and extrapolation for atomic mass prediction. The powerful method, adopting a macroscopic-microscopic approach and treating complex nuclear effects as output labels, achieves superior accuracy in AME2020, yielding a much lower root-mean-square deviation of 0.122 MeV in the test set, significantly lower than alternative methods. It also exhibits a better extrapolation performance when predicting AME2020 from AME2016, with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.191 MeV. We further conduct sensitivity analyses against the model inputs to verify interpretable alignment beyond statistical metrics. Incorporating theoretical predictions of magic numbers and masses, our fully connected neural networks reproduce key nuclear phenomena including nucleon pairing correlation and magic number effects. The extrapolation capability of the framework is discussed and the accuracy of predicting new mass measurements for isotope chains has also been tested.</description>

      <title>Twist-3 contributions to wide-angle photoproduction of pions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:1802.06597v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate wide-angle pi^0 photoproduction within the handbag approach to twist-3 accuracy. In contrast to earlier work both the 2-particle as well as the 3-particle twist-3 contributions are taken into account. It is shown that both are needed for consistent results that respect gauge invariance and crossing properties. The numerical studies reveal the dominance of the twist-3 contribution. With it fair agreement with the recent CLAS measurement of the pi^0 cross section is obtained. We briefly comment also on wide-angle photoproduction of other pseudoscalar mesons.</description>

      <title>On the Wiedemann-Franz law violation in Graphene and quark-gluon plasma systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comparative study of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the ultra-relativistic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in Heavy ion collisions (HIC) with the "quasi-relativistic" massless electron-hole plasma in graphene sample has been performed. We observe that the enthalpy per net carrier density emerges as a useful physical quantity determining the hydrodynamic domain's transport variables. Lorenz ratio is defined as thermal to electrical conductivity ratio, normalized by temperature. In searching whether the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law is obeyed or violated by checking the Lorenz ratio as one or deviated from one, we find that the Lorenz ratio determined from the fluid-based framework will always be responsible for the violation of the WF law. The reason is the proportional relation between Lorenz ratio and enthalpy per particle in the fluid. Based on the experimental observation, graphene, and QGP, both systems at low net charge density, exhibit WF law violation due to their fluid nature. However, graphene at high net charge density obeys the WF law, followed by metals with high Fermi energy or density. It indicates a fluid to the non-fluid transition of the graphene system from low to high-density domain. In this regard, the fluid or non-fluid aspect of QGP at high density is yet to be explored by future facilities like Compressed Baryonic matter (CBM) and Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) experiments.</description>

      <title>Tricritical behavior of a relativistic field theory in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tricritical behavior in a class of one-dimensional (1D) field theories that exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking at zero temperature and chemical potential is analyzed. In the Gross-Neveu (GN)-type models of massless fermions the discrete chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. After doping, the symmetry is restored at a critical chemical potential. We investigate the temperature effects on this doped 1D system under an external constant Zeeman magnetic field $B_0$. We find that $B_0$ suppresses the gapless behavior present for certain values of chemical potential and is able to induce a gapless-gapped phase transition at a critical field strength. We also discuss about the consequences of the consideration of inhomogeneous condensates to the tricritical point, within the Ginzburg-Landau expansion.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in tellurium-based dark matter searches stemming from nuclear structure uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using tellurium dioxide as a target, we calculate uncertainties on 90% upper confidence limits of Galilean effective field theory (Galilean EFT) couplings to a WIMP dark matter particle due to uncertainties in nuclear shell models. We find that these uncertainties in naturally-occurring tellurium isotopes are comparable across the different Galilean EFT couplings to uncertainties in xenon, with some reaching over 100%. We also consider the effect these nuclear uncertainties have on estimates of the annual modulation of dark matter from these searches, finding that the uncertainties in the modulation amplitude are proportional to the non-modulating upper confidence limit uncertainties. We also show that the determination of the modulation phase is insensitive to changes in the nuclear model for a given isotope.</description>

Abstract: We perform a global QCD analysis of unpolarized parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the proton, including new $W +\,$charm production data from $pp$ collisions at the LHC, which have been suggested for constraining the strange quark PDF. In particular, we assess the impact of the $W +\,$charm data relative to that of semi-inclusive pion and kaon production data in lepton-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering. Compared with a baseline global fit that does not include these datasets, we find that semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering and $W +\,$charm data combined favor a larger strange distribution, but smaller than the SU(3) symmetric sea suggested in previous analyses of ATLAS data. Combined, the ratio of strange to nonstrange sea quark distributions is $R_s = (s+\bar s)/(\bar u+\bar d) \approx \{ 0.72,\, 0.48,\, 0.26 \}$ for $x = \{ 0.01,\, 0.04,\, 0.1 \}$.</description>

      <title>Collins-Soper Kernel in the QCD Instanton Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline a general framework for evaluating the non-perturbative soft functions in the QCD instanton vacuum. In particular, from the soft function we derive the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel, which drives the rapidity evolution of the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions. The resulting CS kernel, when supplemented with the perturbative contribution, agrees well with recent lattice results and some phenomenological parameterizations. Moreover, our CS kernel depends logarithmically on the large quark transverse separation, providing a key constraint on its phenomenological parametrization. Finally, a lattice calculation can be directly compared to our generic results in Euclidean signature, thus providing a new approach for evaluating the soft function and extracting the CS kernel by analytical continuation.</description>

      <title>Exploring QGP-like phenomena with Charmonia in $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ultra-relativistic collisions of nuclei at the Large Hadron Collider, the created QCD environment rapidly changes, leading to a non-adiabatic evolution of the quantum states involved. Considering this, we first examine the pre-equilibrium state of QCD matter and its effect on the initially produced charmonium using a temperature-independent Hamiltonian. As the QCD matter reaches local thermal equilibrium, this Hamiltonian transforms to its finite temperature counterpart. To model the pre-equilibrium stage, we use the bottom-up thermalization approach to determine the effective temperature of the QCD matter, followed by a Gubser-type expansion for the thermalized medium. Additionally, we consider collisional damping, gluonic dissociation, and regeneration mechanisms, which specifically modify the charmonium yield in the thermalized medium. Mainly, the gluonic dissociation and collisional damping cause a reduction in the yield conversely, regeneration through gluonic de-excitation enhances the yield of charmonium. Further, we explore the combined effects of these mechanisms on the collective yield of charmonium states with transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) and event multiplicity in the proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. Based on our findings, we contend that the combined effects of these mechanisms can serve as a robust probe for determining the possible existence of a thermalized QCD medium in such a small collision system.</description>

      <title>First-order phase transition in dynamical 3-flavor QCD at imaginary isospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit QCD with three mass-degenerate quark flavors at an imaginary isospin chemical potential set to 4 pi T/3. This choice corresponds to a special point in the parameter space, where the theory possesses an exact Z(3) center symmetry. Through a finite-size scaling analysis, we demonstrate that in this case the finite temperature QCD transition is of first order and entails singular behavior both in the Polyakov loop and in the quark condensate. Our results are based on simulations with stout-smeared staggered quarks and a dedicated multi-histogram analysis.</description>

      <title>Stellar Weak Rates and Mass Fractions of 20 Most Important $fp$-shell Nuclei with $A &lt; 65$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents stellar weak rates and mass fractions of 20 most important electron capture (ec) and beta decay (bd) nuclei with $A &lt; 65$ according to a recent study during the presupernova evolution of massive stars. The mass fractions of these nuclei were calculated using the Sahas equation which assumes nuclear statistical equilibrium for a set of initial conditions ($T_9$, $\rho$ and $Y_e$) that represents the trajectory which a massive stars central region takes after its silicon core burns. Our computed mass fractions were found in decent comparison in most cases, and up to a factor 4 difference was noted when compared with the Independent Particle Model results. The weak interaction (ec and bd) rates were calculated in a totally microscopic fashion using the proton neutron quasiparticle random phase ap proximation model and without assuming the Brink Axel hypothesis. The rates were computed for a wide range of density ($10$-$10^{11}$) g/cm$^3$ and temperature (0.01-30) GK. In comparison with large scale shell model, our computed rates were found bigger at high values of core temperature. The current study may contribute in a more realistic simu lation of stellar evolution processes and modeling of core collapse supernovae.</description>

      <title>Gluon mass scale through the Schwinger mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been argued that the action of the Schwinger mechanism in the gauge sector of Quantum Chromodynamics leads to the generation of a gluon mass scale. Within this scenario, the analytic structure of the fundamental vertices is modified by the creation of scalar colored excitations with vanishing mass. In the limit of zero momentum transfer, these terms act as massless poles, providing the required conditions for the infrared stabilization of the gluon propagator, and producing a characteristic displacement to the associated Ward identities. In this article we offer an extensive overview of the salient notions and techniques underlying this dynamical picture. We place particular emphasis on recent developments related to the exact renormalization of the mass, the nonlinear nature of the pole equation, and the key role played by Fredholm's alternatives theorem.</description>

      <title>Measurement of $\rm ^{6}H$ ground state energy in an electron scattering experiment at MAMI-A1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time the neutron-rich hydrogen isotope $\rm ^{6}H$ was produced in an electron scattering experiment in the reaction $\rm ^{7}Li(e,~e'p\pi^{+})^{6}H$ using the spectrometer facility of the A1 Collaboration at the Mainz Microtron accelerator. By measuring the triple coincidence between the scattered electron, the produced proton, and $\pi^{+}$, the missing mass spectrum of $\rm ^{6}H$ was obtained. A clear peak above $^3$H+n+n+n energy threshold was seen resulting in a ground state energy of $\rm ^{6}H$ at $2.3\pm0.5({\rm stat.})\pm0.4({\rm syst.})$ MeV with a width of $1.9\pm1.0({\rm stat.})\pm0.4({\rm syst.})$ MeV. This work challenges the understandings of multi-nucleon interactions and presents a new method to study light neutron-rich nuclei with electron scattering experiments.</description>

      <title>Impact of QCD sum rules coupling constants on neutron stars structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation on the structure of neutron stars, incorporating the presence of hyperons within a relativistic model under the mean-field approximation. Employing coupling constants derived from QCD sum rules, we explore the particle fraction in beta equilibrium and establish the mass-radius relationship for neutron stars with hyperonic matter. Additionally, we compute the stellar Love number ($\mathcal{K}_{2}$) and the tidal deformability parameter ($\varLambda$), providing valuable insights into the dynamical properties of these celestial objects. Through comparison with theoretical predictions and observational data, our results exhibit good agreement, affirming the validity of our approach. These findings contribute significantly to refining the understanding of neutron star physics, particularly in environments containing hyperons, and offer essential constraints on the equation of state governing such extreme astrophysical conditions.</description>

      <title>Perturbative treatment of nonlocal chiral interactions in auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear many-body systems, ranging from nuclei to neutron stars, are some of the most interesting physical phenomena in our universe, and Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) approaches are among the most accurate many-body methods currently available to study them. In recent decades, interactions derived from chiral effective field theory (EFT) have been widely adopted in the study of nuclear many-body systems. One drawback of the QMC approach is the requirement that the nuclear interactions need to be local, whereas chiral EFT interactions usually contain nonlocalities. In this work, we leverage the capability of computing second-order perturbative corrections to the ground-state energy in order to develop a self-consistent approach to including nonlocal operators in QMC calculations. We investigate both the deuteron and the neutron-matter equation of state in order to show the robustness of our technique, and pave the way for future QMC calculations at higher orders in the EFT, where nonlocal operators cannot be avoided.</description>

Abstract: We present the first simulations of core-collapse supernovae in axial symmetry with feedback from fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC). Our schematic treatment of FFCs assumes instantaneous flavor equilibration under the constraint of lepton-number conservation individually for each flavor. Systematically varying the spatial domain where FFCs are assumed to occur, we find that they facilitate SN explosions in low-mass (9-12 solar masses) progenitors that otherwise explode with longer time delays, whereas FFCs weaken the tendency to explode of higher-mass (around 20 solar masses) progenitors.</description>

      <title>Electric field induction in quark-gluon plasma due to thermoelectric effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic heavy-ion collisions produce quark-gluon plasma (QGP), which is locally thermalized. Due to electrically charged particles (quarks), QGP exhibits interesting thermoelectric phenomena during its evolution, resulting in an electromagnetic (EM) field in the medium. In this study, for the first time, we estimate the induced electric field in QGP due to the thermoelectric effect. This phenomenon can induce an EM field even in QGP produced by the head-on heavy-ion collision. In peripheral heavy-ion collisions, the presence of a spectator current generates a transient magnetic field at the early stage, which disrupts the isotropy of the induced electric field. For the numerical estimation, we use a quasiparticle-based model that incorporates the lattice quantum chromodynamics equation of state for QGP. The induced electric field is estimated with cooling rates derived from Gubser hydrodynamic flow. Thermoelectric coefficients such as Seebeck, magneto-Seebeck, and Nernst coefficients play a crucial role in determining the induced field. Additionally, we account for the temperature evolution of QGP using different hydrodynamic cooling rates to calculate the transport coefficients. We also estimate the transport coefficients and the induced electric field in the presence of an external time-varying magnetic field, including the quantum effect of Landau quantization, and explore the effects of the intensity and decay parameter of the magnetic field on the induced electric field. Our findings reveal that the space-time profile of the induced electric field is zero at the center and increases as we go away from the center. During the early stages of evolution, the electric field can reach a maximum value of $eE \approx 1~m_\pi^2$, decreasing in strength over time.</description>

      <title>The Fox-Wolfram Moment of Jet Production in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical investigation of Fox-Wolfram moments (FWMs) for multi-jet production in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this work, jet productions in p+p collisions are computed with a Monte Carlo event generator SHERPA, while the Linear Boltzmann Transport model is utilized to simulate the multiple scattering of energetic partons in the hot and dense QCD matter. The event-normalized distributions of the lower-order FWM, $H_1^T$ in p+p and Pb+Pb collisions are calculated. It is found that for events with jet number $n_\text{jet} = 2$ the $H_1^T$ distribution in Pb+Pb is suppressed at small $H_1^T$ while enhanced at large $H_1^T$ region as compared to p+p. For events with $n_\text{jet}&gt;2$, the jet number reduction effect due to jet quenching in the QGP decreases the $H_1^T$ distribution at large $H_1^T$ in Pb+Pb relative to p+p. The medium modification of the Fox-Wolfram moment $H_1^T$ for events with $n_\text{jet}\ge 2$ are also presented, which resemble those of events with $n_\text{jet} = 2$. Its reason is revealed through the relative contribution fractions of events with different final-state jet numbers to $H_1^T$.</description>

      <title>Investigating the $p$-$\Omega$ Interaction and Correlation Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by experimental measurements, we investigate the $p$-$\Omega$ correlation functions and interactions on the basis of a quark model. By solving the inverse scattering problem with channel coupling, we renormalize the coupling to other channels into an effective single-channel $p$-$\Omega$ potentials. The effects of Coulomb interaction and spin-averaging are also discussed. According to our results, the depletion of the $p$-$\Omega$ correlation functions, which is attributed to the $J^P = 2^+$ bound state not observed in the ALICE Collaboration's measurements [Nature \textbf{588}, 232 (2020)], can be explained by the contribution of the attractive $J^P = 1^+$ component in spin-averaging. So far, we have provided a consistent description of the $p$-$\Omega$ system from the perspective of the quark model, including the energy spectrum, scattering phase shifts, and correlation functions. The existence of the $p$-$\Omega$ bound state has been supported by all three aspects. Additionally, a sign of the $p$-$\Omega$ correlation function's subtle sub-unity part can be seen in experimental measurements, which warrants more precise verification in the future.</description>

Abstract: We examine the framework of relativistic spin-hydrodynamics in the context of electron hydrodynamics in graphene. We develop a spin-hydrodynamic model for a (2 + 1)-dimensional system of fermions under the condition of small spin polarization. Our analysis confirms that thermal vorticity, which satisfies the global equilibrium condition, is also a solution to the spin-hydrodynamic equations. Additionally, we calculate the magnetization of the system in global equilibrium and introduce a novel phenomenon - thermovortical magnetization - resulting from thermal vorticity, which can be experimentally observed in graphene.</description>

We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete $4\times 4$ block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. The least correlated static kernel reproduces the known finite-temperature quasiparticle random phase approximation, while the dynamical kernel was previously largely unknown in the finite-temperature superfluid theory. The major focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is completed and advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem with keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex as well as the components of the dynamical kernel acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.</description>
