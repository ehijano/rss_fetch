      <title>Position-space renormalization schemes for four-quark operators in HQET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-space schemes are gauge-invariant, regulator-independent renormalization schemes that are defined by requiring position-space correlation functions of gauge invariant operators to be equal to their noninteracting values at particular kinematic points. These schemes can be used to nonperturbatively renormalize composite operators in Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD), and by computing matching coefficients between the X-space scheme and MSbar in the dimensionally-regulated continuum, matrix elements calculated with LQCD can be converted to MSbar-renormalized matrix elements. Using X-space schemes for Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) operators has the additional benefit that appropriate ratios of position-space correlation functions cancel the power divergent static-quark self-energy of Lattice HQET nonperturbatively. This work presents the O($\alpha_S$) matching coefficients between X-space renormalized four-quark flavor-nonsinglet HQET operators relevant for the lifetimes of charm- and bottom-hadrons, and four-quark HQET operators relevant for mixing between neutral mesons containing a heavy quark, such as B-Bbar mixing.</description>

      <title>Conserved currents in five-dimensional proposals for lattice chiral gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the Grabowska-Kaplan framework, originally proposed for lattice chiral gauge theories, to QCD. We show that the resulting theory contains a conserved and gauge invariant singlet axial current, both on the lattice and in the continuum limit. This must give rise to a difference with QCD, with the simplest possibility being a superfluous Nambu-Goldstone boson in the physical spectrum not present in QCD. We find a similar unwanted conserved current in the recent "disk" formalism [Kaplan, Kaplan &amp; Sen], this time limiting ourselves to the continuum formulation. A similar problem is expected when either of these formalisms is used for its original goal of constructing lattice chiral gauge theories. Finally we discuss a conjecture about the possible dynamics that might be associated with the unwanted conserved current, and the fate of 't Hooft vertices.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned flow as a solution to the hierarchical growth problem in the generalized Lefschetz thimble method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Lefschetz thimble method is a promising approach that attempts to solve the sign problem in Monte Carlo methods by deforming the integration contour using the flow equation. Here we point out a general problem that occurs due to the property of the flow equation, which extends a region on the original contour exponentially to a region on the deformed contour. Since the growth rate for each eigenmode is governed by the singular values of the Hessian of the action, a huge hierarchy in the singular value spectrum, which typically appears for large systems, leads to various technical problems in numerical simulations. We solve this hierarchical growth problem by preconditioning the flow so that the growth rate becomes identical for every eigenmode. As an example, we show that the preconditioned flow enables us to investigate the real-time quantum evolution of an anharmonic oscillator with the system size that can hardly be achieved by using the original flow.</description>

      <title>Generalized boost transformations in finite volumes and application to Hamiltonian methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of hadron interactions within lattice QCD has been facilitated by the well-known quantisation condition, linking scattering phase shifts to finite-volume energies. Additionally, the ability to utilise systems at finite total boosts has been pivotal in smoothly charting the energy-dependent behaviour of these phase shifts. The existing implementations of the quantization condition at finite boosts rely on momentum transformations between rest and moving frames, defined directly in terms of the energy eigenvalues. This energy dependence is unsuitable in the formulation of a Hamiltonian.In this work, we introduce a novel approach to generalise the three-momentum boost prescription, enabling the incorporation of energy-independent finite-volume Hamiltonians within moving frames. We demonstrate the application of our method through numerical comparisons, employing a phenomenological $\pi\pi$ scattering example.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories by dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of lattice gauge theories on noisy quantum hardware inherently suffer from violations of the gauge symmetry due to coherent and incoherent errors of the underlying physical system that implements the simulation. These gauge violations cause the simulations to become unphysical requiring the result of the simulation to be discarded. We investigate an active correction scheme that relies on detecting gauge violations locally and subsequently correcting them by dissipatively driving the system back into the physical gauge sector. We show that the correction scheme not only ensures the protection of the gauge symmetry, but it also leads to a longer validity of the simulation results even within the gauge-invariant sector. Finally, we discuss further applications of the scheme such as preparation of the many-body ground state of the simulated system.</description>

      <title>Probing the pole origin of $X(3872)$ with the coupled-channel dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $X(3872)$, as the first and the most crucial member in the exotic charmoniumlike $XYZ$ family, has been studied for a long time. However, its dynamical origin, whether stemming from a $D\bar{D}^*$ hadronic molecule or the first excited $P$-wave charmonium $\chi_{c1}(2P)$, remains controversial. In this Letter, we demonstrate that the $X(3872)$ definitely does not result from the mass shift of the higher bare $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ resonance pole in the coupled-channel dynamics involving a short-distance $c\bar{c}$ core and the long-distance $D\bar{D}^*$ channels. Instead, it originates from either the $D\bar{D}^*$ molecular pole or the shadow pole associated with the $P$-wave charmonium, which depends on the concrete coupling mode between the $c\bar{c}$ and $D\bar{D}^*$. In order to further exploit the nature of $X(3872)$, we carefully investigate potential mechanisms that contribute to its pole width, which suggests that the coupled-channel dynamics plays a critical role in causing a noticeable discrepancy between the pole widths of $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}^+$. Interestingly, we bridge the quantitative connection among the dynamics origin of $X(3872)$, its pole width and the properties of the predicted new resonance. The precise measurement of the pole width of $X(3872)$ and the search for the new charmoniumlike resonance become highly significant and can be anticipated in future LHCb, BESIII and Belle II experiments.</description>

      <title>First-Order Phase Transition of the Schwinger Model with a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the first-order phase transition in the lattice Schwinger model in the presence of a topological $\theta$-term by means of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Using two different fermion discretizations, Wilson and staggered fermions, we develop parametric ansatz circuits suitable for both discretizations, and compare their performance by simulating classically an ideal VQE optimization in the absence of noise. The states obtained by the classical simulation are then prepared on the IBM's superconducting quantum hardware. Applying state-of-the art error-mitigation methods, we show that the electric field density and particle number, observables which reveal the phase structure of the model, can be reliably obtained from the quantum hardware. To investigate the minimum system sizes required for a continuum extrapolation, we study the continuum limit using matrix product states, and compare our results to continuum mass perturbation theory. We demonstrate that taking the additive mass renormalization into account is vital for enhancing the precision that can be obtained with smaller system sizes. Furthermore, for the observables we investigate we observe universality, and both fermion discretizations produce the same continuum limit.</description>

      <title>New Physics couplings from angular coefficient functions of $\bar B \to D^* (D \pi) \ell \bar \nu_\ell$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Belle Collaboration has recently measured the complete set of angular coefficient functions for the exclusive decays $\bar B \to D^* (D \pi) \ell \bar \nu_\ell$, with $\ell=e,\,\mu$, in four bins of the parameter $w=\displaystyle\frac{m_B^2+m_{D^*}^2-q^2}{2m_B m_{D^*}}$, with $q$ the lepton pair momentum. Under the assumption that physics beyond the Standard Model does not contribute to such modes, the measurements are useful to determine the hadronic form factors describing the $B \to D^*$ matrix elements of the Standard Model weak current, and to improve the determination of $|V_{cb}|$. On the other hand, they can be used to assess the impact of possible new physics contributions. In a bottom-up approach, we extend the Standard Model effective Hamiltonian governing this mode with the inclusion of the full set of Lorentz invariant d=6 operators compatible with the gauge symmetry of the theory. The measured angular coefficient functions can tightly constrain the couplings in the generalized Hamiltonian. We present the first results of this analysis, discussing how improvements can be achieved when more complete data on the angular coefficient functions will be available.</description>

      <title>QCD parameters and SM-high precision from $e^+e^-$ to Hadrons: Updated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13983v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 1. I update my previous comparison of the theoretical value of the muon anomaly with the new measurement and found $\Delta a_\mu\equiv a_\mu^{exp}-a_\mu^{th} = (143\pm 42_{th}\pm 22_{exp})\times 10^{-11}$ which is about 3$\sigma$ discrepancy between the SM predictions and experiment. 2. I improve the estimate of QCD power corrections up to dimension D=12 and provide a new estimate of the ones up to D=20 within the SVZ expansion by combining the ratio of the Laplace sum rules (LSR) with the BNP $\tau$-like decay moments for the I=1 vector current. The results in Table 1 confirm a violation of the factorization of the four-quark condensates and the value of the gluon one $ &lt;\alpha_s G^2&gt;$ from some other sources. Up to D=20, I there is not any factorial nor exponential growth of the size of these power corrections. 3. I use these new values of power corrections to extract $\alpha_s$ from the BNP lowest moment. To order $\alpha_s^4$, I find within the SVZ expansion: $\alpha_s(M_\tau)= 0.3081(50)_{fit}(71)_{\alpha_s^5}$ [resp. $0.3260 (47)_{fit}(62)_{\alpha_s^5}]$ implying $\alpha_s(M_Z)= 0.1170(6)(3)_{evol}$ [resp. $0.1192(6)(3)_{evol}$] for Fixed Order (FO) [resp. Contour Improved (CI)] PT series. They lead to the mean: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)\vert_{SVZ}=0.3179(58)_{fit}(81)_{syst}$ and $ \alpha_s(M_Z)\vert_{SVZ}= 0.1182(12)(3)_{evol}$ where the systematic error(syst) takes into account the discrepancy between FO and CI. Using the lowest BNP moment, we also obtain from the vector (V) component of $\tau$-decay the mean: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)\vert_{\tau,V}=0.3219(52)(91)_{syst}$ giving: $\alpha_s(M_Z)\vert_{\tau,V}=0.1187(13)(3)_{evol}$. The average of the two determinations leads to: $ \alpha_s(M_\tau)=0.3198(72)$ and $\alpha_s(M_Z)= 0.1185(9)(3)_{evol}$. 4. Some contributions beyond the SVZ expansion ($1/Q^2$, instantons and duality violation) expected to be small are discussed in Sections 10,11.</description>
