      <title>Acoustic resonators above 100 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piezoelectric resonators are a common building block for signal processing because of their miniature size, low insertion loss, and high quality factor. As consumer electronics push to millimeter waves frequencies, designers must increase the operating frequency of the resonator. The current state-of-the-art approach to increase the operating frequency is to decrease the thickness of the piezoelectric film to shorten the acoustic wavelength or to use higher order modes. Unfortunately, maintaining high crystal quality typically requires thicker piezoelectric layers. Thinner layers suffer from higher defect densities and increased surface damping, which degrade the electromechanical coupling and quality factor. While acoustic high order modes can also increase operating frequency, the electromechanical coupling rapidly decreases with increasing mode number. Here, we overcome these limitations by utilizing a piezoelectric stack of three layers of lithium niobate with alternating crystallographic orientations to preferentially support higher order modes and thereby enhance the electromechanical coupling without degrading the quality factor. Our approach improves the figure of merit of millimeter-wave acoustic resonators by roughly an order of magnitude greater compared to state-of-the-art piezoelectric resonators above 60 GHz. This concept of alternating crystallographic orientations facilitates a new path to develop millimeter wave resonators with high figures of merit, low insertion loss, and miniature footprints, enabling new applications in millimeter wave signal processing and computing.</description>

      <title>Superior probabilistic computing using operationally stable probabilistic-bit constructed by manganite nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic computing has emerged as a viable approach to treat optimization problems. To achieve superior computing performance, the key aspect during computation is massive sampling and tuning on the probability states of each probabilistic bit (p-bit), demanding its high stability under extensive operations. Here, we demonstrate a p-bit constructed by manganite nanowire that shows exceptionally high stability. The p-bit contains an electronic domain that fluctuates between metallic (low resistance) and insulating (high resistance) states near its transition temperature. The probability for the two states can be directly controlled by nano-ampere electrical current. Under extensive operations, the standard error of its probability values is less than 1.3%. Simulations show that our operationally stable p-bit plays the key role to achieve correct inference in Bayesian network by strongly suppressing the relative error, displaying the potential for superior computing performance. Our p-bit also serves as high quality random number generator without extra data-processing, beneficial for cryptographic applications.</description>

      <title>Experimental validation of the diverse incident angle performance of a pulse-width-dependent antenna based on a waveform-selective metasurface in a reverberation chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental validation results of a pulse-width-dependent antenna based on a waveform-selective metasurface that behaves differently according to the incoming waveform, more specifically, the incoming pulse width, even at a fixed frequency. This waveform-selective behavior is integrated with an antenna design to preferentially accept a predetermined incoming waveform while rejecting another waveform at the same frequency. In particular, we report how the waveform-selective antenna performance can be evaluated for diverse incident angles, which is enabled by a measurement method based on a reverberation chamber. This method facilitates variation of the electromagnetic fields and modes inside the chamber and mimicking of complicated wireless communication environments through rotation of the internal stirrer. The experimental results verify that our antenna design concept based on waveform-selective metasurfaces can filter different signals with a wide range of incident angles, opening the door to utilizing such pulse-width-dependent antennas to suppress electromagnetic noise in more realistic wireless communication environments.</description>

      <title>Fundamental mechanisms of high-electric-field vacuum arc initiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review brings together a body of experimental, theoretical, and simulation work addressing the behaviour of high-field devices and the fundamental process of vacuum arcing, also referred to as vacuum breakdown. Detailed experimental observations and results relating to a wide range of aspects of high-field devices including conditioning, field and temperature dependence of breakdown rate, and the field-holding capability as a function of device geometry and of different materials are presented. The different observations are then addressed theoretically, and with simulation, capturing the sequence of processes that lead to vacuum breakdown and explaining the major observed experimental dependencies. The core of the work described in this review was carried out by a broad multi-disciplinary collaboration in an over a decade-long program to develop high-gradient, 100 MV/m-range, accelerating structures for the CLIC project, a possible future linear-collider high-energy physics facility. Connections are made to the broader linear collider, high-field, and breakdown communities.</description>

      <title>A Multiscale Approach to Structural Relaxation and Diffusion in Metallic Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic glasses are promising materials with unique mechanical and thermal properties, but their atomic-scale dynamics remain challenging to understand. In this work, we develop a unified approach to investigate the glass transition and structural relaxation in CoCrNi, Zr46Cu46Al8, Zr50Cu40Al10, and Zr64.13Cu15.75Ni10.12Al10 metallic glasses. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is employed to analyze the radial distribution function at different temperatures and accurately determine the glass transition temperature. We then combine this temperature with the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory to predict the temperature dependence of the structural relaxation time, tau_alpha(T). By connecting $\tau_\alpha(T)$ to the diffusion constant, the ECNLE predictions of tau_alpha(T) can be compared with those calculated from MD simulations or estimated based on the diffusion constant. By combining atomistic simulation with force-level statistical mechanics, our multiscale approach offers deeper insights into relaxation dynamics and diffusion across various timescales. The relationship between the glass transition and the liquidus temperature is elucidated. This study enhances understanding of the glassy dynamics and properties in complex amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>The Role of Tunneling Oxide in the Low Frequency Noise of Multi-level Silicon Nitride ReRAMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research explores the characteristics of two CMOS-compatible RRAM cells utilizing silicon nitride as the switching material. By employing SET/RESET pulse sequences, the study successfully attains four distinct and stable resistance states. To gain deeper insights, a Low-Frequency Noise (LFN) statistical analysis is conducted to investigate the role of a tunneling oxide between the bottom electrode and SiNx at various resistance levels. The findings from the LFN measurements strongly suggest that the multilevel high resistance switching primarily arises from variations in the number of nitrogen vacancies, which in turn modulate the conductivity of conductive filaments (CF). Notably, this modulation does not compromise the quality of the filament's surrounding interface. This research sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of RRAM cells and their potential for advanced memory applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Optimized, Fabrication Error-Tolerant Photonic Crystal Nanobeam Cavities for Scalable On-Chip Diamond Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity-enhanced diamond color center qubits can be initialized, manipulated, entangled, and read individually with high fidelity, which makes them ideal for large-scale, modular quantum computers, quantum networks, and distributed quantum sensing systems. However, diamond's unique material properties pose significant challenges in manufacturing nanophotonic devices, leading to fabrication-induced structural imperfections and inaccuracies in defect implantation, which hinder reproducibility, degrade optical properties and compromise the spatial coupling of color centers to small mode-volume cavities. A cavity design tolerant to fabrication imperfections, such as surface roughness, sidewall slant, and non-optimal emitter positioning, can improve coupling efficiency while simplifying fabrication. To address this challenge, a deep learning-based optimization methodology is developed to enhance the fabrication error tolerance of nanophotonic devices. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied to promising designs, such as L2 and fishbone nanobeam cavities, predicting Q-factors up to one million times faster than traditional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations, enabling efficient optimization of complex, high-dimensional parameter spaces. The CNNs achieve prediction errors below 3.99% and correlation coefficients up to 0.988. Optimized structures demonstrate a 52% reduction in Q-factor degradation, achieving quality factors of 5e4 under real-world conditions and a two-fold expansion in field distribution, enabling efficient coupling of non-optimally positioned emitters. This methodology enables scalable, high-yield manufacturing of robust nanophotonic devices, including the cavity-enhanced diamond quantum systems developed in this study.</description>

      <title>Maximizing nanoparticle light absorption: size, geometry, and a prospect for metal alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we show how to maximize absorption of plasmonic nanoparticles in terms of size, geometry and material. For that reason the interaction of nanoparticles with light was decomposed into different effects. We determined that the main effect dictating the optimal amount of optical losses is radiation damping, and how it depends on nanoparticle size and geometry. Based on this, we find that for many combinations of sizes and geometries losses in pure metals are far from optimal. To overcome the aforementioned issue, alloying is presented as straightforward and flexible way of modulating the optical losses. Furthermore, strategies for tuning the optical losses to values above, between, and even below those in pure plasmonic metals are developed in terms of selecting the right alloy composition. In some cases, alloys showed a multifold increase in absorption when compared to pure plasmonic metals. The physical reasons governing such changes are elucidated based on the electronic structure changes during alloying of different metals, which enables generalization of the results to other systems. Besides increasing absorption, electronic structure changes can also be utilized for channeling the absorbed energy to suit different purposes, such as hot carrier generation for photocatalysis or solar energy harvesting. Overall, these results establish alloying as a powerful tool for designing nanostructures for applications that utilize light absorption.</description>

      <title>Casimir force inadequacy in explaining a strong attractive force in a micrometer-sized narrow-gap re-entrant cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pate et al. \cite{pate} investigated a macroscopic opto-mechanical system with a narrow-gap re-entrant cavity coupled to a SiN membrane resonator coated with Au or Nb. They observed a significant increase in the membrane's effective spring constant $k_{\rm eff}$ for sub-2-micron gaps $x$. This increase scales roughly with $x^{-4}$, suggesting an attractive force pulling the membrane towards the re-entrant Al post, with an $x^{-3}$ dependence. Attributing this force solely to the thermal Casimir effect is challenged by our detailed calculations (presented below). These calculations reveal that the Casimir force, at the investigated gap sizes, is orders of magnitude weaker than the observed force. This significant discrepancy necessitates an alternative explanation for the observed attraction.</description>

      <title>Pulsed Vector Atomic Magnetometer Using an Alternating Fast-Rotating Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00214v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a vector atomic magnetometer that employs a fast-rotating magnetic field applied to a pulsed $^{87}$Rb scalar atomic magnetometer. This approach enables simultaneous measurements of the total magnetic field and its two polar angles relative to the rotation plane. Operating in gradiometer mode, the magnetometer achieves a total field gradient sensitivity of 35 $\mathrm{fT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ (0.7 parts per billion) and angular resolutions of 6 $\mathrm{nrad/\sqrt{Hz}}$ at a 50 $\mu$T Earth field strength. The noise spectra remain flat down to 1 Hz and 0.1 Hz, respectively. Here we show that this method overcomes several metrological challenges commonly faced by vector magnetometers and gradiometers. We propose a unique peak-altering modulation technique to mitigate systematic effects, including a newly identified dynamic heading error. Additionally, we establish the fundamental sensitivity limits of the sensor, demonstrating that its vector sensitivity approaches scalar sensitivity while preserving the inherent accuracy and calibration benefits of scalar sensors. This high-dynamic-range, ultrahigh-resolution magnetometer offers exceptional versatility for diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Deterministic photonic entanglement arising from non-Abelian quantum holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing deterministic, high-fidelity entangling interactions--of the kind that can be utilized for efficient quantum information processing--between photons remains an elusive goal. Here, we address this long-standing issue by devising a protocol for creating and manipulating highly-entangled superpositions of well-controlled states of light by using an on-chip photonic system that has recently been shown to implement three-dimensional, non-Abelian quantum holonomy. Our calculations indicate that a subset of such entangled superpositions are maximally-entangled, "volume-law" states, and that the underlying entanglement can be distilled and purified for applications in quantum science. Crucially, we generalize this approach to demonstrate the potentiality of deterministically entangling two arbitrarily high, $N$-dimensional quantum systems, by formally establishing a deep connection between the matrix representations of the unitary quantum holonomy--within energy-degenerate subspaces in which the total excitation number is conserved--and the $\left(2j+1\right)$-dimensional irreducible representations of the rotation operator, where $j = \left(N-1\right)/2$ and $N \geq 2$. Specifically, our protocol deterministically entangles spatially localized modes that are not only distinguishable but are also individually accessible and amenable to state preparation and measurement, and therefore, we envisage that this entangling mechanism could be utilized for deterministic quantum information processing with light.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Dirac cones with valley-dependent lifetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic quasiparticles emerging from band degeneracies in crystals play crucial roles in the transport and topological properties of materials and metamaterials. Quasiparticles are commonly described by Hermitian Hamiltonians, with non-Hermiticity usually considered detrimental. In this work, we show that such an assumption of Hermiticity can be lifted to bring quasiparticles into non-Hermitian regime. We propose a concrete lattice model containing two Dirac cones with valley-dependent lifetimes. The lifetime contrast enables an ultra-strong valley selection rule: only one valley can survive in the long-time limit regardless of the excitation, lattice shape and other details. This property leads to an effective parity anomaly with a single Dirac cone and offers a simple way to generate vortex states. Additionally, extending non-Hermitian features to boundaries generates valley kink states with valley-locked lifetimes, making them effectively unidirectional and more resistant against inter-valley scattering. All these phenomena are experimentally demonstrated in a non-Hermitian electric circuit lattice.</description>
