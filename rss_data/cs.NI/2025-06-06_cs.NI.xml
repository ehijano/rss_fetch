      <title>A Framework Leveraging Large Language Models for Autonomous UAV Control in Flying Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes FLUC, a modular framework that integrates open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) autopilot systems to enable autonomous control in Flying Networks (FNs). FLUC translates high-level natural language commands into executable UAV mission code, bridging the gap between operator intent and UAV behaviour.
  FLUC is evaluated using three open-source LLMs - Qwen 2.5, Gemma 2, and LLaMA 3.2 - across scenarios involving code generation and mission planning. Results show that Qwen 2.5 excels in multi-step reasoning, Gemma 2 balances accuracy and latency, and LLaMA 3.2 offers faster responses with lower logical coherence. A case study on energy-aware UAV positioning confirms FLUC's ability to interpret structured prompts and autonomously execute domain-specific logic, showing its effectiveness in real-time, mission-driven control.</description>

      <title>BEAR: BGP Event Analysis and Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy, outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering valuable operational insights for network management.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning Assisted Edge Caching Scheme Based on Lightweight Architecture DDPM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge caching is an emerging technology that empowers caching units at edge nodes, allowing users to fetch contents of interest that have been pre-cached at the edge nodes. The key to pre-caching is to maximize the cache hit percentage for cached content without compromising users' privacy. In this letter, we propose a federated learning (FL) assisted edge caching scheme based on lightweight architecture denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). Our simulation results verify that our proposed scheme achieves a higher cache hit percentage compared to existing FL-based methods and baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Channel Allocation for IEEE 802.11be Multi-Link Operation: When MAB Meets LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably, the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$ in dense networks.</description>

      <title>Grey Rhino Warning: IPv6 is Becoming Fertile Ground for Reflection Amplification Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks represent a cost-effective and potent threat to network stability. While extensively studied in IPv4 networks, DDoS implications in IPv6 remain underexplored. The vast IPv6 address space renders brute-force scanning and amplifier testing for all active addresses impractical. Innovatively, this work investigates AS-level vulnerabilities to reflection amplification attacks in IPv6.
  One prerequisite for amplification presence is that it is located in a vulnerable autonomous system (AS) without inbound source address validation (ISAV) deployment. Hence, the analysis focuses on two critical aspects: global detection of ISAV deployment and identification of amplifiers within vulnerable ASes. Specifically, we develop a methodology combining ICMP Time Exceeded mechanisms for ISAV detection, employ IPv6 address scanning for amplifier identification, and utilize dual vantage points for amplification verification.
  Experimental results reveal that 4,460 ASes (61.36% of measured networks) lack ISAV deployment. Through scanning approximately 47M active addresses, we have identified reflection amplifiers in 3,507 ASes. The analysis demonstrates that current IPv6 networks are fertile grounds for reflection amplification attacks, alarming network security.</description>

      <title>Towards Network Data Analytics in 5G Systems and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data has become a critical asset in the digital economy, yet it remains underutilized by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), unlike Over-the-Top (OTT) players that lead global market valuations. To move beyond the commoditization of connectivity and deliver greater value to customers, data analytics emerges as a strategic enabler. Using data efficiently is essential for unlocking new service opportunities, optimizing operational efficiency, and mitigating operational and business risks. Since Release 15, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) to provide powerful insights and predictions using data collected across mobile networks, supporting both user-centric and network-oriented use cases. However, academic research has largely focused on a limited set of methods and use cases, driven by the availability of datasets, restricting broader exploration. This study analyzes trends and gaps in more than 70 articles and proposes two novel use cases to promote the adoption of NWDAF and explore its potential for monetization.</description>

      <title>Indoor Sharing in the Mid-Band: A Performance Study of Neutral-Host, Cellular Macro, and Wi-Fi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor environments present a significant challenge for wireless connectivity, as immense data demand strains traditional solutions. Public Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), utilizing outdoor macro base stations (BSs), suffer from poor signal penetration. Indoor Wi-Fi networks, on the other hand, may face reliability issues due to spectrum contention. Shared spectrum models, particularly the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) utilized by private 4G/5G networks, have emerged as a promising alternative to provide reliable indoor service. Moreover, these private networks are equipped with the neutral-host (NH) model, seamlessly offloading indoor MNOs' traffic to the private CBRS network. This paper presents a comprehensive, in-situ performance evaluation of three co-located technologies utilizing mid-bands spectrum (1-6 GHz)--a CBRS-based NH network, public MNO macro networks, and a Wi-Fi 6 network--within a large, big-box retail store characterized by significant building loss. Our analysis demonstrates: (i) the NH network provides superior indoor coverage compared to MNO macro, requiring only six CBRS devices (CBSDs)--versus 65 Access Points (APs) for enterprise Wi-Fi--to achieve full coverage, with a median building loss of 26.6 dB ensuring interference-free coexistence with outdoor federal incumbents; (ii) the NH network achieves substantial indoor throughput gains, with per-channel normalized throughput improvements of 1.44x and 1.62x in downlink (DL), and 4.33x and 13x in uplink (UL), compared to 4G and 5G macro deployments, respectively; (iii) the NH deployment achieves a median indoor aggregated physical (PHY)-layer DL throughput gain of 2.08x over 5G macro deployments indoors, despite utilizing only 40 MHz of aggregated bandwidth compared to 225 MHz for 5G macro; and (iv) the NH deployment also outperforms Wi-Fi in application-layer HTTP DL performance by 5.05x.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Early-Termination for Age of Information in Tree-Based Random Access Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Age of Information (AoI) has emerged as a key metric for assessing data freshness in IoT applications, where a large number of devices report time-stamped updates to a monitor. Such systems often rely on random access protocols based on variations of ALOHA at the link layer, where collision resolution algorithms play a fundamental role to enable reliable delivery of packets. In this context, we provide the first analytical characterization of average AoI for the classical Capetanakis tree-based algorithm with gated access under exogenous traffic, capturing the protocol's dynamics, driven by sporadic packet generation and variable collision resolution times. We also explore a variant with early termination, where contention is truncated after a maximum number of slots even if not all users are resolved. The approach introduces a fundamental trade-off between reliability and timeliness, allowing stale packets to be dropped to improve freshness.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Semantic Resource Allocation with Cumulative Prospect Theoretic Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a resource allocation framework for goal-oriented semantic networks, where participating agents assess system quality through subjective (e.g., context-dependent) perceptions. To accommodate this, our model accounts for agents whose preferences deviate from traditional expected utility theory (EUT), specifically incorporating cumulative prospect theory (CPT) preferences. We develop a comprehensive analytical framework that captures human-centric aspects of decision-making and risky choices under uncertainty, such as risk perception, loss aversion, and perceptual distortions in probability metrics. By identifying essential modifications in traditional resource allocation design principles required for agents with CPT preferences, we showcase the framework's relevance through its application to the problem of power allocation in multi-channel wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Optimization for Semantic-Aware Resource Allocation under CPT-based Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of resource allocation in goal-oriented semantic communication with semantic-aware utilities and subjective risk perception is studied here. By linking information importance to risk aversion, we model agent behavior using Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), which incorporates risk-sensitive utility functions and nonlinear transformations of distributions, reflecting subjective perceptions of gains and losses. The objective is to maximize the aggregate utility across multiple CPT-modeled agents, which leads to a nonconvex, nonsmooth optimization problem. To efficiently solve this challenging problem, we propose a new algorithmic framework that combines successive convex approximation (SCA) with the projected subgradient method and Lagrangian relaxation, Our approach enables tractable optimization while preserving solution quality, offering both theoretical rigor and practical effectiveness in semantics-aware resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Spatial Network Calculus: Toward Deterministic Wireless Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02556v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the classical network calculus to spatial scenarios, focusing on wireless networks with differentiated services and varying transmit power levels. Building on a spatial network calculus, a prior extension of network calculus to spatial settings, we propose a generalized framework by introducing regulations for stationary marked point processes. The regulations correspond to two key constraints: the total transmit power of all transmitters within a spatial region and the cumulative received power at a receiver, which we refer to as ball regulation and shot-noise regulation, respectively. Then we prove the equivalence of ball regulation and shot-noise regulation for stationary marked point processes and establish a universal lower bound on the performance of all network links under these constraints. This framework is applicable to diverse network scenarios, as demonstrated by the analysis of performance guarantees for networks with multi-class users. In addition, we propose an SINR-based power control scheme adapted to user traffic, which ensures differentiated quality of service (QoS) for different user classes.</description>

      <title>A Datagram Extension to DNS over QUIC: Proven Resource Conservation in the Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Domain Name System (DNS) over QUIC (DoQ) and propose a non-disruptive extension, which can greatly reduce DoQ's resource consumption. This extension can benefit all DNS clients - especially Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This is important because even resource-constrained IoT devices can generate dozens of DNS requests every hour. DNS is a crucial service that correlates IP addresses and domain names. It is traditionally sent as plain-text, favoring low-latency results over security and privacy. The repercussion of this can be eavesdropping and information leakage about IoT devices. To address these concerns, the newest and most promising solution is DoQ. QUIC offers features similar to TCP and TLS while also supporting early data delivery and stream multiplexing. DoQ's specification requires that DNS exchanges occur over independent streams in a long-lived QUIC connection. Our hypothesis is that due to DNS's typically high transaction volume, managing QUIC streams may be overly resource intensive for IoT devices. Therefore, we have designed and implemented a data delivery mode for DoQ using QUIC datagrams, which we believe to be more preferable than stream-based delivery. To test our theory, we analyzed the memory, CPU, signaling, power, and time of each DoQ delivery mode in a setup generating real queries and network traffic. Our novel datagram-based delivery mode proved to be decisively more resource-friendly with little compromise in terms of functionality or performance. Furthermore, our paper is the first to investigate multiple queries over DoQ, to our knowledge.</description>

      <title>S\"{o}ze: One Network Telemetry Is All You Need for Per-flow Weighted Bandwidth Allocation at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weighted bandwidth allocation is a powerful abstraction that has a wide range of use cases in modern data center networks. However, realizing highly agile and precise weighted bandwidth allocation for large-scale cloud environments is fundamentally challenging. In this paper, we propose S\"{o}ze, a lightweight decentralized weighted bandwidth allocation system that leverages simple network telemetry features of commodity Ethernet switches. Given the flow weights, S\"{o}ze can effectively use the telemetry information to compute and enforce the weighted bandwidth allocations without per-flow, topology, or routing knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of S\"{o}ze through simulations and testbed experiments, improving TPC-H jobs completion time by up to $0.59\times$ and $0.79\times$ on average.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Mitigating Network Latency Effect on Teleoperated-Robot with Extended Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robot teleoperation with extended reality (XR teleoperation) enables intuitive interaction by allowing remote robots to mimic user motions with real-time 3D feedback. However, existing systems face significant motion-to-motion (M2M) latency--the delay between the user's latest motion and the corresponding robot feedback--leading to high teleoperation error and mission completion time. This issue stems from the system's exclusive reliance on network communication, making it highly vulnerable to network degradation.
  To address these challenges, we introduce TeleXR, the first end-to-end, fully open-sourced XR teleoperation framework that decouples robot control and XR visualization from network dependencies. TeleXR leverages local sensing data to reconstruct delayed or missing information of the counterpart, thereby significantly reducing network-induced issues. This approach allows both the XR and robot to run concurrently with network transmission while maintaining high robot planning accuracy. TeleXR also features contention-aware scheduling to mitigate GPU contention and bandwidth-adaptive point cloud scaling to cope with limited bandwidth.</description>
