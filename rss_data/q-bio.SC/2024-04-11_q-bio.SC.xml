      <title>Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Transport</title>

Abstract: Nucleocytoplasmic transport is essential for cellular function, presenting a canonical example of rapid molecular sorting inside cells. It consists of a coordinated interplay between import/export of molecules in/out the cell nucleus. Here, we investigate the role of spatio-temporal dynamics of the nucleocytoplasmic transport and its regulation. We develop a biophysical model that captures the main features of the nucleocytoplasmic transport, in particular, its regulation through the Ran cycle. Our model yields steady-state profiles for the molecular components of the Ran cycle, their relaxation times, as well as the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic molecule ratio. We show that these quantities are affected by their spatial dynamics and heterogeneity within the nucleus. Specifically, we find that the spatial nonuniformity of Ran Guanine Exchange Factor (RanGEF) -- particularly its proximity to the nuclear envelope -- enhances the Ran cycle's efficiency. We further show that RanGEF's accumulation near the nuclear envelope results from its intrinsic dynamics as a nuclear cargo, transported by the Ran cycle itself. Overall, our work highlights the critical role of molecular spatial dynamics in cellular processes, and proposes new avenues for theoretical and experimental inquiries into the nucleocytoplasmic transport.</description>
