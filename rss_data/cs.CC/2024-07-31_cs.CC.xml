      <title>Quantum advantage from measurement-induced entanglement in random shallow circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21203</link>

Abstract: We study random constant-depth quantum circuits in a two-dimensional architecture. While these circuits only produce entanglement between nearby qubits on the lattice, long-range entanglement can be generated by measuring a subset of the qubits of the output state. It is conjectured that this long-range measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) proliferates when the circuit depth is at least a constant critical value. For circuits composed of Haar-random two-qubit gates, it is also believed that this coincides with a quantum advantage phase transition in the classical hardness of sampling from the output distribution. Here we provide evidence for a quantum advantage phase transition in the setting of random Clifford circuits. Our work extends the scope of recent separations between the computational power of constant-depth quantum and classical circuits, demonstrating that this kind of advantage is present in canonical random circuit sampling tasks. In particular, we show that in any architecture of random shallow Clifford circuits, the presence of long-range MIE gives rise to an unconditional quantum advantage. In contrast, any depth-d 2D quantum circuit that satisfies a short-range MIE property can be classically simulated efficiently and with depth O(d). Finally, we introduce a two-dimensional, depth-2, "coarse-grained" circuit architecture, composed of random Clifford gates acting on O(log n) qubits, for which we prove the existence of long-range MIE and establish an unconditional quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Consistent Query Answering over SHACL Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16653</link>

Abstract: The Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) was standardized by the World Wide Web as a constraint language to describe and validate RDF data graphs. SHACL uses the notion of shapes graph to describe a set of shape constraints paired with targets, that specify which nodes of the RDF graph should satisfy which shapes. An important question in practice is how to handle data graphs that do not validate the shapes graph. A solution is to tolerate the non-validation and find ways to obtain meaningful and correct answers to queries despite the non-validation. This is known as consistent query answering (CQA) and there is extensive literature on CQA in both the database and the KR setting. We study CQA in the context of SHACL for a fundamental fragment of the Semantic Web query language SPARQL. The goal of our work is a detailed complexity analysis of CQA for various semantics and possible restrictions on the acceptable repairs. It turns out that all considered variants of the problem are intractable, with complexities ranging between the first and third level of the polynomial hierarchy.</description>

      <title>A learning theory for quantum photonic processors and beyond</title>

Abstract: We consider the tasks of learning quantum states, measurements and channels generated by continuous-variable (CV) quantum circuits. This family of circuits is suited to describe optical quantum technologies and in particular it includes state-of-the-art photonic processors capable of showing quantum advantage. We define classes of functions that map classical variables, encoded into the CV circuit parameters, to outcome probabilities evaluated on those circuits. We then establish efficient learnability guarantees for such classes, by computing bounds on their pseudo-dimension or covering numbers, showing that CV quantum circuits can be learned with a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the circuit's size, i.e., the number of modes. Our results show that CV circuits can be trained efficiently using a number of training samples that, unlike their finite-dimensional counterpart, does not scale with the circuit depth.</description>

      <title>The Subspace Flatness Conjecture and Faster Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14605v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a seminal paper, Kannan and Lov\'asz (1988) considered a quantity $\mu_{KL}(\Lambda,K)$ which denotes the best volume-based lower bound on the covering radius $\mu(\Lambda,K)$ of a convex body $K$ with respect to a lattice $\Lambda$. Kannan and Lov\'asz proved that $\mu(\Lambda,K) \leq n \cdot \mu_{KL}(\Lambda,K)$ and the Subspace Flatness Conjecture by Dadush (2012) claims a $O(\log(2n))$ factor suffices, which would match the lower bound from the work of Kannan and Lov\'asz.
  We settle this conjecture up to a constant in the exponent by proving that $\mu(\Lambda,K) \leq O(\log^{3}(2n)) \cdot \mu_{KL} (\Lambda,K)$. Our proof is based on the Reverse Minkowski Theorem due to Regev and Stephens-Davidowitz (2017). Following the work of Dadush (2012, 2019), we obtain a $(\log(2n))^{O(n)}$-time randomized algorithm to solve integer programs in $n$ variables. Another implication of our main result is a near-optimal flatness constant of $O(n \log^{3}(2n))$.</description>
