      <title>Natural Disaster In Canada (2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a follow-up to our earlier study, Natural Disasters in Canada (2017). We analyze the Canadian Disaster Database (CDD) to examine the frequency and severity of various natural disasters over the past 120 years and to identify emerging trends. We generate annual loss distributions for individual disaster types, as well as an aggregate annual loss distribution across all event types. Our analysis provides evidence that Canada is experiencing warmer and wetter conditions and indicates a substantial likelihood of extreme national-level losses.</description>

      <title>Trends and Performance Visualization of Clutch Time in Japan's Professional B.League</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reflecting the recent rise in Japanese basketball's competitiveness and pivotal outcomes in international tournaments, clutch-time performance has become increasingly critical. We examine clutch-time performance in Japan's B.League using play-by-play and box-score data from the 2023-24 season. Defining clutch time as the final five minutes with a score margin within five points, we compare efficiency and shot selection between clutch and non-clutch windows. We focus on effective field-goal percentage (eFG%) by spatial category, including In the Paint, Mid-Range, and 3-Point, and investigate league-wide and team-level trends. We further profile player archetypes in clutch minutes via K-means clustering on filtered box-score features. Results show that paint touches and clean three-point looks remain comparatively efficient under pressure, whereas mid-range outcomes are more context-dependent. Championship games exhibit tighter defense and scouting, moderating three-point accuracy for many teams. Our findings highlight the need for tactical flexibility, balancing efficient shot selection with adaptive counters to defensive pressure. We discuss strategic implications for late-game play-calling, spacing, and lineup choices, and outline limitations and future directions.</description>

      <title>Mapping Socio-Economic Divides with Urban Mobility Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massive digital footprints generated by bike-sharing systems in megacities like Shanghai offer a novel perspective on the urban socio-economic fabric. This study investigates whether these daily mobility patterns can quantitatively map the city's underlying social stratification. To overcome the persistent challenge of acquiring fine-grained socio-economic data, we constructed a multi-layered analytical dataset. We annotated 2,000 raw bike trips with local economic attributes, derived from a novel data enrichment methodology that employs a Large Language Model (LLM), and integrated contextual features of the built environment. A Random Forest model was then utilized as an interpretable framework to determine the key factors governing the relationship between mobility behavior and local economic status. The analysis reveals a compelling and unambiguous finding: a neighborhood's economic level, proxied by housing prices, is the single most dominant predictor of its bike-sharing patterns, substantially outweighing other geographic or temporal factors. This economic determinism manifests in three distinct ways: (1) a spatial clustering of resources, a phenomenon we term the \textit{club effect}, which concentrates mobility infrastructure and usage in affluent areas; (2) a functional dichotomy between necessity-driven, utilitarian usage in lower-income zones and flexible, recreational usage in wealthier ones; and (3) a nuanced inverted U-shaped adoption curve that identifies the urban middle class as the system's primary user base.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Land Use Impacts on Fossil Fuel-Related CO$_2$ Emissions in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions exhibit spatial variation owing to differences in development patterns, local climate, economic composition, energy sources, and other factors. Many of these factors - and therefore their contribution to GHG production - are influenceable through spatial planning and economic policy. Recent advances in environmental data reporting and climate flux measurement have produced high fidelity GHG emissions estimates at detailed spatial and temporal resolutions. Using one such dataset (Vulcan v3.0 1-km gridcell estimates of fossil-fuel CO2 for the U.S.), we explore the relationship between land use features and CO2 emissions. Analysis is conducted at multiple scales (neighbourhoods and metropolitan areas) to explore scale law effects. Using a data-driven propensity score approach, we develop doubly robust causal estimands for the effects of multiple land use features on CO2 emissions by sector. Preliminary results suggest that per capita transportation emissions are not significantly affected by local population density after controlling for metropolitan population density factors. However, results are likely influenced by the way transportation emissions are allocated in the Vulcan dataset. Results for scope 2 residential electricity and non-electricity energy are also considered in the study.</description>

      <title>How liveable are London's 15-minute neighbourhoods? Exploring liveability profiles and active travel patterns in London</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Healthy and liveable neighbourhoods have increasingly been recognised as essential components of sustainable urban development. Yet, ambiguity surrounding their definition and constituent elements presents challenges in understanding and evaluating neighbourhood profiles, highlighting the need for a more detailed and systematic assessment. This research develops a composite Liveability Index for Greater London based on metrics related to the proximity, density, and diversity of POIs, along with population density, and investigates how neighbourhood liveability relates to active travel behaviour. The Index is based on the principles of the 15-minute city paradigm (Moreno et al. 2021) and developed in line with OECD guidelines for composite indicators (European Union and Joint Research Centre 2008). The Index revealed distinct spatial patterns of neighbourhood liveability, with high liveability neighbourhoods predominantly clustered in Inner London. Decomposing the Index provided further insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each neighbourhood. Footfall modelling using ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) indicates a generally positive relationship between liveability and footfall, with spatial variation in the strength of this association. This research offers a new perspective on conceptualising and measuring liveability, demonstrating its role as an urban attractor that fosters social interaction and active engagement.</description>

      <title>PyPSA-DE: Open-source German energy system model reveals savings from integrated planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Germany has set an ambitious target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. We explore how integrated cross-sectoral planning can reduce costs compared to existing national plans. Our new linear optimization model PyPSA-DE simulates the electricity and hydrogen transmission networks, as well as supply, demand, and storage in all sectors of the energy system in Germany and its neighboring countries with high spatial and temporal resolution. While our new model shows strong electricity transmission grid development, total expansion is one third lower than in the national grid development plan, lowering costs by 92 billion EUR$_{2020}$ to 191 billion EUR$_{2020}$ and average grid tariffs by 7.5 EUR$_{2020}$ / MWh. These savings are mainly due to integrated planning and operation, a market design with regional prices, and a system-optimal usage of offshore wind. PyPSA-DE is open-source and can readily be adapted to study related issues around the energy transition.</description>

      <title>(Anti)Gravitron: A Statistical Physics Perspective on Multidimensional Metrics of Polarizing Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for measuring multidimensional inequality based on a statistical physics reinterpretation of centrifugal and centripetal forces in rotating systems. Inspired by the mechanics of the Gravitron and extended via the conceptual AntiGravitron, this study proposes a new class of inequality metrics grounded in multivariate mixtures of Beta distributions. These composite metrics capture three key structural dimensions of polarizing inequality: the number and balance of population clusters (modal entropy), the internal uniformity of each cluster (concentration), and the separation between clusters in attribute space (geometric divergence). Monte Carlo simulations of the AntiGravitron show how bifurcation, stratification, and polarization jointly influence inequality measurements due to multidimensional attraction-repulsion forces. An empirical application of the AntiGravitron to US household income data reveals polarized inequality driven by intersecting centripetal and centrifugal socio-economic forces affecting Black and African American populations in the Philadelphia County. By bridging physical systems theory and social stratification analysis, this paper offers a rigorous, flexible, and interpretable metric that enhances the understanding of polarizing inequality in high-dimensional, structurally heterogeneous contexts. The AntiGravitron framework holds promise for small-area estimation of polarization-driven inequality in socio-economics and biomedicine domains such as epidemiology, where inequality arises from multi-axial exclusion and attractor dynamics.</description>

      <title>Data as Commodity: a Game-Theoretic Principle for Information Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data is the central commodity of the digital economy. Unlike physical goods, it is non-rival, replicable at near-zero cost, and traded under heterogeneous licensing rules. These properties defy standard supply--demand theory and call for new pricing principles. We propose a game-theoretic approach in which the value of a data string emerges from strategic competition among N players betting on an underlying stochastic process, each holding partial information about past outcomes. A better-informed player faces a choice: exploit their informational advantage, or sell part of their dataset to less-informed competitors. By analytically computing the Nash equilibrium of the game, we determine the price range where the trade is beneficial to both buyer and seller. We uncover a rich landscape of market effects that diverge from textbook economics: first, prospective sellers and buyers can compete or jointly exploit the less informed competitors depending on the quality of data they hold. In a symbiotic regime, the seller can even share data for free while still improving her payoffs, showing that losing exclusivity does not necessarily reduce profit. Moreover, rivalry between well-informed players can paradoxically benefit uninformed ones, demonstrating that information abundance does not always translate to higher payoffs. We also show that the number of players influences the competition between informed parties: trades impossible in small markets become feasible in larger ones. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for the pricing of intangible goods in dynamically interacting digital markets, which are in need of robust valuation principles.</description>

      <title>Multiplexons: Limits of Multiplex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a multiplex network, a set of nodes is connected by different types of interactions, each represented as a separate layer within the network. Multiplexes have emerged as a key instrument for modeling large-scale complex systems, due to the widespread coexistence of diverse interactions in social, industrial, and biological domains. This motivates the development of a rigorous and readily applicable framework for studying properties of large multiplex networks. In this article, we provide a self-contained introduction to the limit theory of dense multiplex networks, analogous to the theory of graphons (limit theory of dense graphs). As applications, we derive limiting analogues of commonly used multiplex features, such as degree distributions and clustering coefficients. We also present a range of illustrative examples, including correlated versions of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and inhomogeneous random graph models and dynamic networks. Finally, we discuss how multiplex networks fit within the broader framework of decorated graphs, and how the convergence results can be recovered from the limit theory of decorated graphs. Several future directions are outlined for further developing the multiplex limit theory.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed High-order Graph Dynamics Identification Learning for Predicting Complex Networks Long-term Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09082v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand, existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.</description>

Abstract: We study the rate of convergence to equilibrium of the solutions to Fokker-Planck type equations with linear drift by means of Cram\'er and Energy distances, which have been recently widely used in problems related to AI, in particular for tasks related to machine learning. In all cases in which the Fokker-Planck type equations can be treated through these distances, it is shown that the rate of decay is improved with respect to known results which are based on the decay of relative entropy.</description>

      <title>Triadic percolation on multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triadic interactions are special types of higher-order interactions that occur when regulator nodes modulate the interactions between other two or more nodes. In presence of triadic interactions, a percolation process occurring on a single-layer network becomes a fully-fledged dynamical system, characterized by period-doubling and a route to chaos. Here, we generalize the model to multilayer networks and name it as the multilayer triadic percolation (MTP) model. We find a much richer dynamical behavior of the MTP model than its single-layer counterpart. MTP displays a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, leading to oscillations of arbitrarily large period or pseudo-periodic oscillations. Moreover, MTP admits period-two oscillations without negative regulatory interactions, whereas single-layer systems only display discontinuous hybrid transitions. This comprehensive model offers new insights on the importance of regulatory interactions in real-world systems such as brain networks, climate, and ecological systems.</description>

      <title>Agent Based Simulators for Epidemic Modelling: Simulating Larger Models Using Smaller Ones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agent-based simulators (ABS) are a popular epidemiological modelling tool to study the impact of various non-pharmaceutical interventions in managing an epidemic in a city (or a region). They provide the flexibility to accurately model a heterogeneous population with time and location varying, person-specific interactions as well as detailed governmental mobility restrictions. Typically, for accuracy, each person is modelled separately. This however may make computational time prohibitive when the city population and the simulated time is large. In this paper, we dig deeper into the underlying probabilistic structure of a generic, locally detailed ABS for epidemiology to arrive at modifications that allow smaller models (models with less number of agents) to give accurate statistics for larger ones, thus substantially speeding up the simulation. We observe that simply considering a smaller aggregate model and scaling up the output leads to inaccuracies. We exploit the observation that in the initial disease spread phase, the starting infections create a family tree of infected individuals more-or-less independent of the other trees and are modelled well as a multi-type super-critical branching process. Further, although this branching process grows exponentially, the relative proportions amongst the population types stabilise quickly. Once enough people have been infected, the future evolution of the epidemic is closely approximated by its mean field limit with a random starting state. We build upon these insights to develop a shifted, scaled and restart-based algorithm that accurately evaluates the ABS's performance using a much smaller model while carefully reducing the bias that may otherwise arise. We apply our algorithm for Covid-19 epidemic and theoretically support the proposed algorithm through an asymptotic analysis where the population size increases to infinity.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time treatment number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the discrete-time treatment number of a graph, in which each vertex is in exactly one of three states at any given time-step: compromised, vulnerable, or treated. Our treatment number is distinct from other graph searching parameters that use only two states, such as the firefighter problem or Bernshteyn and Lee's inspection number. Vertices represent individuals and edges exist between individuals with close connections. Each vertex starts out as compromised; it can become compromised again even after treatment. Our objective is to treat the entire population so that at the last time-step, no members are vulnerable or compromised, while minimizing the maximum number of treatments that occur at each time-step. This minimum is the treatment number, and it depends on the choice of a pre-determined length of time $r$ that a vertex can remain in a treated state and length of time $s$ that a vertex can remain in a vulnerable state without being treated again.
  We denote the pathwidth of graph $H$ by $pw(H)$ and prove that the treatment number of $H$ is bounded above by $\lceil \frac{1+pw(H)}{r+s}\rceil$. This equals the best possible lower bound for a cautious treatment plan, defined as one in which each vertex, after being treated for the first time, is treated again within every consecutive $r+s$ time-steps until its last treatment. However, many graphs admit a plan that is not cautious. When $r=s=1$, we find a useful tool for proving lower bounds, show that the treatment number of an $n\times n$ grid equals $\lceil\frac{1+n}{2}\rceil$, characterize graphs that require only one treatment per time-step, and prove that subdividing one edge can reduce the treatment number. It is known that there are trees with arbitrarily large pathwidth; surprisingly, we prove that for any tree $T$, there is a subdivision of $T$ that requires at most two treatments per time-step.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for polyadic epidemic and voter models with multiscale groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12682</link>

Abstract: Polyadic (or higher-order) interactions can significantly impact the dynamics of interacting particle systems. However, previous studies have often assumed group sizes to be relatively small. In this work, we examine the influence of multiscale polyadic group interactions, where some groups are small and others are very large. We consider two paradigmatic examples, an SIS-epidemic and the adaptive voter model. On the level of the mean field, we specifically discuss the impact of the multiscale polyadic interactions on equilibrium dynamics and phase transitions. For the SIS-epidemic model, we find a region of bistability that protects the disease-free state over a wide range beyond the classical epidemic threshold from a significant outbreak. For the adaptive voter model, we show that multiscale polyadic interactions can stabilize the network or increase the convergence rate to an unbiased equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Understanding How Network Geometry Influences Diffusion Processes in Complex Networks: A Focus on Cryptocurrency Blockchains and Critical Infrastructure Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study provides essential insights into how diffusion processes unfold in complex networks, with a focus on cryptocurrency blockchains and infrastructure networks. The structural properties of these networks, such as hub-dominated, heavy-tailed topology, network motifs, and node centrality, significantly influence diffusion speed and reach. Using epidemic diffusion models, specifically the Kertesz threshold model and the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model, we analyze key factors affecting diffusion dynamics. To assess the uncertainty in the fraction of infected nodes over time, we employ bootstrap confidence intervals, while Bayesian credible intervals are constructed to quantify parameter uncertainties in the SI models. Our findings reveal substantial variations across different network types, including Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi networks, Geometric Random Graphs, and Delaunay Triangulation networks, emphasizing the role of network architecture in failure propagation. We identify that network motifs are crucial in diffusion. We highlight that hub-dominated networks, which dominate blockchain ecosystems, provide resilience against random failures but remain vulnerable to targeted attacks, posing significant risks to network stability. Furthermore, centrality measures such as degree, betweenness, and clustering coefficient strongly influence the transmissibility of diffusion in both blockchain and critical infrastructure networks.</description>
