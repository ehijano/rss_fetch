      <title>Online Frequency Scheduling by Learning Parallel Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Resource Management is a challenging topic in future 6G networks where novel applications create strong competition among the users for the available resources. In this work we consider the frequency scheduling problem in a multi-user MIMO system. Frequency resources need to be assigned to a set of users while allowing for concurrent transmissions in the same sub-band. Traditional methods are insufficient to cope with all the involved constraints and uncertainties, whereas reinforcement learning can directly learn near-optimal solutions for such complex environments. However, the scheduling problem has an enormous action space accounting for all the combinations of users and sub-bands, so out-of-the-box algorithms cannot be used directly. In this work, we propose a scheduler based on action-branching over sub-bands, which is a deep Q-learning architecture with parallel decision capabilities. The sub-bands learn correlated but local decision policies and altogether they optimize a global reward. To improve the scaling of the architecture with the number of sub-bands, we propose variations (Unibranch, Graph Neural Network-based) that reduce the number of parameters to learn. The parallel decision making of the proposed architecture allows to meet short inference time requirements in real systems. Furthermore, the deep Q-learning approach permits online fine-tuning after deployment to bridge the sim-to-real gap. The proposed architectures are evaluated against relevant baselines from the literature showing competitive performance and possibilities of online adaptation to evolving environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Communication: From Fundamentals to Recent Trends, Challenges and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent advancements and developments in quantum technologies, the emerging field of quantum communication and networking has gained the attention of the researchers. Owing to the unique properties of quantum mechanics, viz., quantum superposition and entanglement, this new area of quantum communication has shown potential to replace modernday communication technologies. The enhanced security and high information sharing ability using principles of quantum mechanics has encouraged networking engineers and physicists to develop this technology for next generation wireless systems. However, a conceptual bridge between the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, photonics and the deployability of a quantum communication infrastructure is not well founded in the current literature. This paper aims to fill this gap by merging the theoretical concepts from quantum physics to the engineering and computing perspectives of quantum technology. This paper builds the fundamental concepts required for understanding quantum communication, reviews the key concepts and demonstrates how these concepts can be leveraged for accomplishing successful communication. The paper delves into implementation advancements for executing quantum communication protocols, explaining how hardware implementation enables the achievement of all basic quantum computing operations. Finally, the paper provides a comprehensive and critical review of the state-of-the-art advancements in the field of quantum communication and quantum internet; and points out the recent trends, challenges and open problems for the real-world realization of next generation networking systems.</description>

      <title>Statistical QoS Provisioning Architecture for 6G Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of massive ultra-reliable and low latency communications (mURLLC) as a category of time/reliability-sensitive service over 6G networks has received considerable research attention, which has presented unprecedented challenges. As one of the key enablers for 6G, satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STIN) have been developed to offer more expansive connectivity and comprehensive 3D coverage in space-aerial-terrestrial domains for supporting 6G mission-critical mURLLC applications while fulfilling diverse and rigorous quality of service (QoS) requirements. In the context of these mURLLC-driven satellite services, data freshness assumes paramount importance, as outdated data may engender unpredictable or catastrophic outcomes. To effectively measure data freshness in satellite-terrestrial integrated communications, age of information (AoI) has recently surfaced as a new dimension of QoS metric to support time-sensitive applications. It is crucial to design new analytical models that ensure stringent and diverse QoS metrics bounded by different key parameters, including AoI, delay, and reliability, over 6G satellite-terrestrial integrated networks. However, due to the complicated and dynamic nature of satellite-terrestrial integrated network environments, the research on efficiently defining new statistical QoS schemes while taking into account varying degrees of freedom has still been in their infancy. To remedy these deficiencies, in this paper we develop statistical QoS provisioning schemes over 6G satellite-terrestrial integrated networks in the finite blocklength regime. Particularly, we firstly introduce and review key technologies for supporting mURLLC. Secondly, we formulate a number of novel fundamental statistical-QoS metrics in the finite blocklength regime. Finally, we conduct a set of simulations to evaluate our developed statistical QoS schemes.</description>

      <title>Mobile Network Configuration Recommendation using Deep Generative Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are vast number of configurable parameters in a Radio Access Telecom Network. A significant amount of these parameters is configured by Radio Node or cell based on their deployment setting. Traditional methods rely on domain knowledge for individual parameter configuration, often leading to sub-optimal results. To improve this, a framework using a Deep Generative Graph Neural Network (GNN) is proposed. It encodes the network into a graph, extracts subgraphs for each RAN node, and employs a Siamese GNN (S-GNN) to learn embeddings. The framework recommends configuration parameters for a multitude of parameters and detects misconfigurations, handling both network expansion and existing cell reconfiguration. Tested on real-world data, the model surpasses baselines, demonstrating accuracy, generalizability, and robustness against concept drift.</description>

      <title>On Designing Multi-UAV aided Wireless Powered Dynamic Communication via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel design on the wireless powered communication network (WPCN) in dynamic environments under the assistance of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Unlike the existing studies, where the low-power wireless nodes (WNs) often conform to the coherent harvest-then-transmit protocol, under our newly proposed double-threshold based WN type updating rule, each WN can dynamically and repeatedly update its WN type as an E-node for non-linear energy harvesting over time slots or an I-node for transmitting data over sub-slots. To maximize the total transmission data size of all the WNs over T slots, each of the UAVs individually determines its trajectory and binary wireless energy transmission (WET) decisions over times slots and its binary wireless data collection (WDC) decisions over sub-slots, under the constraints of each UAV's limited on-board energy and each WN's node type updating rule. However, due to the UAVs' tightly-coupled trajectories with their WET and WDC decisions, as well as each WN's time-varying battery energy, this problem is difficult to solve optimally. We then propose a new multi-agent based hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (MAHDRL) framework with two tiers to solve the problem efficiently, where the soft actor critic (SAC) policy is designed in tier-1 to determine each UAV's continuous trajectory and binary WET decision over time slots, and the deep-Q learning (DQN) policy is designed in tier-2 to determine each UAV's binary WDC decisions over sub-slots under the given UAV trajectory from tier-1. Both of the SAC policy and the DQN policy are executed distributively at each UAV. Finally, extensive simulation results are provided to validate the outweighed performance of the proposed MAHDRL approach over various state-of-the-art benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Grassroots Architecture to Supplant Global Digital Platforms by a Global Digital Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13468v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an architectural alternative to global digital platforms termed grassroots, designed to serve the social, economic, civic, and political needs of local digital communities, as well as their federation. Grassroots platforms may offer local communities an alternative to global digital platforms while operating solely on the smartphones of their members, forsaking any global resources other than the network itself. Such communities may form digital economies without initial capital or external credit, exercise sovereign democratic governance, and federate, ultimately resulting in the grassroots formation of a global digital democracy.</description>

      <title>DYST (Did You See That?): An Amplified Covert Channel That Points To Previously Seen Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11850v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Covert channels are stealthy communication channels that enable manifold adversary and legitimate scenarios, ranging from malware communications to the exchange of confidential information by journalists and censorship circumvention. We introduce a new class of covert channels that we call history covert channels. We further present a new paradigm: covert channel amplification. All covert channels described until now need to craft seemingly legitimate flows or need to modify third-party flows, mimicking unsuspicious behavior. In contrast, history covert channels can communicate by pointing to unaltered legitimate traffic created by regular network nodes. Only a negligible fraction of the covert communication process requires the transfer of covert information by the covert channel's sender. This information can be sent through different protocols/channels. Our approach allows an amplification of the covert channel's message size, i.e., minimizing the fraction of actually transferred secret data by a covert channel's sender in relation to the overall secret data being exchanged. Further, we extend the current taxonomy for covert channels to show how history channels can be categorized. We describe multiple scenarios in which history covert channels can be realized, analyze the characteristics of these channels, and show how their configuration can be optimized.</description>
