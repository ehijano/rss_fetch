      <title>Role of Nonstabilizerness in Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum optimization has emerged as a promising approach for tackling complicated classical optimization problems using quantum devices. However, the extent to which such algorithms harness genuine quantum resources and the role of these resources in their success remain open questions. In this work, we investigate the resource requirements of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) through the lens of the resource theory of nonstabilizerness. We demonstrate that the nonstabilizerness in QAOA increases with circuit depth before it reaches a maximum, to fall again during the approach to the final solution state -- creating a barrier that limits the algorithm's capability for shallow circuits. We find curves corresponding to different depths to collapse under a simple rescaling, and we reveal a nontrivial relationship between the final nonstabilizerness and the success probability. Finally, we identify a similar nonstabilizerness barrier also in adiabatic quantum annealing. Our results provide deeper insights into how quantum resources influence quantum optimization.</description>

      <title>Circuit structure-preserving error mitigation for High-Fidelity Quantum Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing methods to accurately characterize and mitigate the impact of noise is crucial for enhancing the fidelity of quantum simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we present a circuit structure-preserving error mitigation framework for parameterized quantum circuits. A key advantage of our approach lies in its ability to retain the original circuit architecture while effectively characterizing and mitigating gate errors, enabling robust and high-fidelity simulations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we perform variational quantum simulations of a non-Hermitian ferromagnetic transverse-field Ising chain on IBM Quantum processors. The mitigated result shows excellent agreement with exact theoretical predictions across a range of noise levels. Our strategy offers a practical solution for addressing gate-induced errors and significantly broadens the scope of feasible quantum simulations on current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Polariton cascade phonon laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon lasers, as their photon counterparts, rely on the physics of stimulated emission. Arguably, because light does not require a material substrate to propagate, while sound does, the impact of the two technologies has however been highly contrasting, with "sasers" (for sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) mostly remaining as an academic curiosity. This might be changing due to the possibility to use coherent sound generation for on-chip processing of information at ultra-high frequencies, and in the quantum realm, in integrated photonic and optomechanical devices. Inspired by the concept of unipolar lasers based on the quantum engineering of states in semiconductor heterostructures, we propose and implement a quantum cascade phonon laser (QCPL). A condensate of exciton-photon quasiparticles (polaritons) is optically induced in a microstructured semiconductor device to jump down a ladder of engineered levels. This down-cascade is accompanied by the efficient stimulated emission of phonons of $\sim 20$, $\sim 60$, and $\sim 100$~GHz, which are designed to strongly interact with the polaritons on the same chip. The proposed concept opens the path for the design of integrated high-frequency optomechanical devices, as for example for non-reciprocal photon transport and multi-wavelength Brillouin lasers.</description>

      <title>Inverse-design topology optimization of magnonic devices using level-set method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inverse design approach in magnonics exploits the wave nature of magnons and machine learning to develop logical devices with functionalities that exceed the capabilities of analytical methods. While promising for analog, Boolean, and neuromorphic computing, current implementations face memory limitations that hinder the design of complex systems. This study presents a level-set parameterization method for topology optimization, combined with an adjoint-state approach for memory-efficient simulation of magnetization dynamics. The framework is implemented in NeuralMag, a GPU-accelerated micromagnetic solver featuring a nodal finite-difference scheme and automatic differentiation tools. To validate the method, we optimized the shape of a magnetic nanoparticle by applying constraints to the objective function, and designed a 300-nm-wide yttrium iron garnet demultiplexer achieving frequency-selective spin-wave separation. These results highlight the algorithm's efficiency in exploring local minima across various initial configurations, establishing its utility as a versatile tool for the inverse design of magnonic logic devices.</description>
