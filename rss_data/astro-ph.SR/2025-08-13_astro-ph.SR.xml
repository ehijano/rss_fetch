      <title>Universal power-law distribution functions in an electromagnetic kinetic plasma: implications for the inverted temperature profile in the solar corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory for the relaxation of electromagnetic kinetic plasmas, and demonstrate that the mean distribution functions of both electrons and ions tend to relax to a universal $v^{-5}$ tail. Large-scale electromagnetic (EM) fields efficiently accelerate the unscreened, fast particles but not the screened, slow ones. This non-thermal tail may arise in the solar corona from EM turbulence despite collisions, allowing suprathermal particles to escape the sun's gravity (velocity filtration) and inverting the temperature $(T)$ profile with $T$ rising to $10^6$ K.</description>

      <title>White dwarfs in wide binaries: the strong effects of stellar evolution and mass loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the statistics of main-sequence / main-sequence, main-sequence / white-dwarf and white-dwarf / white-dwarf wide binaries at 10^2.5-10^4 AU separations in Gaia data. For binaries containing a white dwarf, we find a complex dependence of the wide binary fraction on the white dwarf mass, including a steep decline as a function of mass at &gt;0.6Msun. Furthermore, we find that wide binaries containing white dwarfs have significantly lower eccentricities than main-sequence binaries at the same separations. To model these observations, we compute the effects of post-main-sequence mass loss on the orbital parameters of wide binaries in all regimes of timescales, from secular to impulsive, and incorporate this dynamics in a population synthesis model. We find that adiabatic expansion of the orbits in binaries with slow enough evolutionary processes is the most likely explanation for the puzzling eccentricity distribution of white dwarf wide binaries. The steeply declining white dwarf binary fraction as a function of mass requires that the timescale for mass loss must be significantly shorter for high-mass stars (10^3-10^4 years) than for the low-mass ones. We confirm previous studies that suggested that recoil in the range 0.25-4 km/s is required to explain the observed distribution of separations of white dwarf wide binaries. Finally, for low-mass white dwarfs (&lt;0.5Msun), we see interesting signatures of their formation due to close binary evolution in their wide binary statistics. Our observations and modeling provide a novel dynamical constraint on the mass-loss stages of stellar evolution that are difficult to probe with direct observations.</description>

      <title>Formation process of young stellar population in Messier 16 from a kinematic perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a kinematic study of young stars in Messier 16 (M16) using the Gaia Data Release 3 and high-resolution spectra. A total of 345 stars are selected as genuine members using the published lists of X-ray, infrared sources, and early-type stars as well as the Gaia data. There is severe differential reddening across this region and the reddening law of the intracluster medium appears abnormal. The distance to M16, derived from the parallaxes of the members, is about 1.7 kpc. The ages of members, estimated by comparing their color-magnitude diagram with theoretical isochrones, range from 1 Myr to 4 Myr. This star-forming region is composed of an open cluster (NGC 6611) and a distributed population. This cluster shows a clear pattern of expansion and rotation. Some of the distributed population are spatially associated with the gas pillars located at the ridge of H II bubble. In particular, several stars moving away from the cluster are physically associated with the northeastern pillar. In addition, their younger ages support the idea that the formation of these stars was triggered by the feedback from massive stars in NGC 6611. On the other hand, the other stars do not show systematic radial or stream motions; therefore, they likely formed through spontaneous star formation events. We discuss the formation of young stars in the context of cluster expansion, spontaneous star formation, and feedback-driven star formation, and suggest that all of these mechanisms possibly contributed to their formation.</description>

      <title>C3PO V: Comoving stellar pairs indicate rotational spin-down drives the main-sequence Li-Dip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08671v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lithium-dip observed in mid-F dwarfs remains a long-standing challenge for stellar evolution models. We present high-precision stellar parameters and A(Li) for 22 new comoving pairs, primarily located on the hotter side of the Li-Dip. Combined with pairs from the C3PO catalog, our sample includes 124 stars with Teff between 6000 and 7300 K, encompassing and extending slightly beyond the Li-Dip. Among them, 49 comoving pairs (98 stars) have both components within the temperature range of interest. Using this expanded set of comoving pairs observed with high-resolution spectroscopy, we show that rotational spin-down is the dominant process responsible for Li depletion in the Li-Dip. First, within comoving pairs, the star with v sin i &gt; 12 km/s shows higher A(Li) than its more slowly rotating companion within the Li-Dip, indicating that rotation-dependent mixing drives lithium depletion. Second, we observe a correlation between A(Li) and v sin i: fast rotators retain higher A(Li) with less scatter, while slow rotators show lower A(Li) and greater dispersion. Third, among slow rotators, A(Li) varies widely, suggesting that differences in initial rotation rates and spin-down histories influence how much Li is depleted. Some stars may have formed as fast rotators and spun down rapidly, leading to more Li depletion, while others may have started as slow rotators and retained more of their initial Li. These results demonstrate that rotational induced mixing plays an important role in shaping the Li-Dip beyond the effects of stellar age and mass.</description>

      <title>Luminaries in the Sky: The TESS Legacy Sample of Bright Stars. I. Asteroseismic detections in naked-eye main-sequence and sub-giant solar-like oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to detect and characterise solar-like oscillations in bright naked-eye (V&lt;6) main-sequence (MS) and subgiant stars observed by TESS. We seek to expand the current benchmark sample of oscillators, provide accurate global asteroseismic parameters for these bright targets, and assess their potential for future detailed investigations -- including missions such as the HWO and PLATO. Our sample of bright stars was selected from the Hipparcos/Tycho catalogues. We analysed TESS 120-s and 20-s cadence photometry using SPOC light curves and custom apertures from target pixel files. After applying a filtering of the light curves, we extracted global asteroseismic parameters ($\nu_{\rm max}$ and $\Delta\nu$) using the pySYD pipeline. Results were cross-validated with independent pipelines and compared to predictions from the ATL, while noise properties were evaluated to quantify improvements from a 20-s observing cadence. We detect solar-like oscillations in a total of 196 stars -- including 128 new detections -- with extracted $\nu_{\rm max}$ and $\Delta\nu$ values showing strong conformity to expected scaling relations. This corresponds to an increase by more than an order of magnitude in the number of MS stars with detection of solar-like oscillations from TESS. Nearly 40% of our new detections are prime HWO targets, enabling systematic asteroseismic age determinations relevant for interpreting atmospheric biosignatures. Our analysis confirms that 20-s cadence data yields lower high-frequency noise levels compared to 120-s data. Moreover, the precise stellar parameters obtained through asteroseismology establish these bright stars as benchmarks for seismic investigations and provide useful constraints for refining stellar evolution models and for complementary analyses in interferometry, spectroscopy, and exoplanet characterisation.</description>

      <title>Solar magnetic flux rope eruptions caused by inverse flux feeding processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale solar eruptions are generally accepted to have coronal magnetic flux ropes as their core structures. Recent studies found that the solar eruptions could be initiated by a sequence of flux feeding processes, during with chromospheric fibrils rise and merge with the pre-existing coronal flux rope. Further theoretical analyses have demonstrated that the normal flux feeding, i.e. the axial magnetic flux within the fibril is in the same direction as that in the flux rope, results in the accumulation of the total axial flux within the flux rope, so as to initiate the eruption. If the directions of the axial flux in the fibril and the flux rope are opposite, it is termed inverse flux feeding, whose influence on coronal flux ropes, however, is still unclear. In this paper, we use a 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model to simulate the evolution of coronal flux ropes associated with inverse flux feeding. It is found that inverse flux feeding is also efficient in causing solar eruptions: although the total signed axial magnetic flux of the rope decreases after inverse flux feeding, the total unsigned axial flux can accumulate; the eruption occurs if the unsigned axial flux of the rope reaches a critical value, which is almost the same as the threshold for normal flux feeding. The total axial currents within the rope are also similar during the onset of the eruptions caused by both normal and inverse flux feeding. Our simulation results suggest that it is the unsigned axial magnetic flux rather than the signed axial flux that regulates the onset of coronal flux rope eruptions.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Secrets of the lower Solar Atmosphere: One year of Operation of the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) on board Aditya-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) is an instrument onboard Aditya--L1, the first solar space observatory of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), India, launched on September 2, 2023. SUIT is designed to image the Sun in the 200--400 nm wavelength band in eight narrowband and three broadband filters. SUIT's science goals start with observing the solar atmosphere and large-scale continuum variations, the physics of solar flares in the NUV region, and many more. The paper elucidates the functioning of the instrument, software packages developed for easier calibration, analysis, and feedback, calibration routines, and the regular maintenance activity of SUIT during the first year of its operation. The paper also presents the various operations undergone by, numerous program sequences orchestrated to achieve the science requirements, and highlights some remarkable observations made during the first year of observations with SUIT.</description>

      <title>A new deepening of mass-radius empirical relation for main sequence stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the following paper I have compared some typical mass-radius relations for main sequence stars by studying their level of agreement with DEBCat [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1411.1219], which is a recent catalogue by J. Southworth. Models chosen for testing were originally developed using older, smaller datasets than DEBCat. Each model follows a two-piece function structure, where each branch is a monomial power-law. This approach is motivated by theoretical considerations suggesting that low-mass and high-mass main sequence stars exhibit distinct behaviors in energy production and energy transport. Best level of agreement is found for Zamorano's model [https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00653969]. Also a new empirical relation is proposed by fitting a two-piece monomial power-law to DEBCat main sequence stars.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Neutron-capture Elements in r-I and r-II Stars: A Differential-abundance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a strictly line-by-line differential analysis of a moderately $r$-process-enhanced star ($r$-I: HD~107752) with respect to a strongly $r$-process-enhanced star ($r$-II: CS~31082-0001) to investigate the possible common origin of their heavy-element nucleosynthesis with high-precision abundances. This study employs ESO data archive high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra taken with the UVES (VLT) spectrograph. Considering only the lines in common in both spectra, we estimate differential abundances of 16 light/Fe-peak elements and 15 neutron-capture elements. Abundances of O, Al, Pr, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, and detection of Tm in HD~107752 are presented for the first time. We found three distinct features in the differential-abundance pattern. Nearly equal abundances of light elements up to Zn are present for both the stars, indicating a common origin for these elements; in addition to no noticable odd-even differential pattern. In the case of neutron-capture elements, the $r$-I star exhibits mildly depleted light $r$-process elements and more depleted heavier $r$-process elements relative to $r$-II star. We also show that among $r$-I and $r$-II stars, the ratio of lighter-to-heavier $r$-process elements (e.g. [(Sr,Y,Zr)/Eu]) exhibits a decreasing trend with respect to the overall $r$-process enhancement, forming a continuous sequence from $r$-I and $r$-II stars. Finally, we discuss the necessity of multiple sites for the formation of $r$-I stars.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Magnetic Field of a Coronal Mass Ejection from Low to Middle Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in understanding the initiation and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is measuring the magnetic field of the magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) that drive CMEs. Recent developments in radio imaging spectroscopy have paved the way for diagnosing the CMEs' magnetic field using gyrosynchrotron radiation. We present magnetic field measurements of a CME associated with an X5-class flare by combining radio imaging spectroscopy data in microwaves (1--18 GHz) and meter-wave (20--88 MHz), obtained by the Owens Valley Radio Observatory's Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) and Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA), respectively. EOVSA observations reveal that the microwave source, observed in the low corona during the initiation phase of the eruption, outlines the bottom of the rising MFR-hosting CME bubble seen in extreme ultraviolet and expands as the bubble evolves. As the MFR erupts into the middle corona and appears as a white light CME, its meter-wave counterpart, observed by OVRO-LWA, displays a similar morphology. For the first time, using gyrosynchrotron spectral diagnostics, we obtain magnetic field measurements of the erupting MFR in both the low and middle corona, corresponding to coronal heights of 1.02 and 2.83 $R_{\odot}$. The magnetic field strength is found to be around 300 G at 1.02 $R_{\odot}$ during the CME initiation, and about 0.6 G near the leading edge of the CME when it propagates to 2.83 $R_{\odot}$. These results provide critical new insights into the magnetic structure of the CME and its evolution during the early stages of its eruption.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Sunspots on Spectral Line Shapes in the Visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comparative spectral analysis to explore the ability of a cooler Sun model to accurately capture the spectral line shape changes caused by Sunspots. In the search for small Earth-like planets, the effects of stellar surface activity can overwhelm the $\sim$10 cm/s planetary RV signal. This necessitates the development of new stellar modeling methods and a greater understanding of the impact of surface activity on stellar spectra. Some attempts to model out noise from Sunspot activity, in particular, have used a sum of a stellar model with a model of a cooler, but otherwise identical star. From our analysis, we find that a cooler effective temperature alone cannot capture the numerous spectral line shape variations seen in a Sunspot observation. The cooler temperature of a Sunspot not only deepens the cores of atomic lines, it also increases and strengthens molecular lines that are not fully represented in our line list. Furthermore, our LTE models and a comparison cool star also fail at capturing line strengthening, broadening, blending, and splitting induced by the magnetic field in the Sunspot.</description>

      <title>A New Method of Deriving Doppler Velocities for Solar Orbiter SPICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a follow-up to previous work on correcting PSF-induced Doppler artifacts in observations by the SPICE spectrograph on Solar Orbiter. In a previous paper, we demonstrated correction of these artifacts in the $y-\lambda$ plane with PSF Regularization, treating the forward problem with a method based on large sparse matrix inversion. It has since been found that similar apparent artifacts are also present in the $x-\lambda$ direction, i.e., across adjacent slit positions. This is difficult (although not impossible) to correct with the previous matrix inversion method due to the time variation between slit positions. We have therefore devised a new method which addresses both $x-\lambda$ and $y-\lambda$ artifacts simultaneously by applying wavelength dependent shifts at each $x-y$ plane of the spectral cube. This paper demonstrates the SPICE data issue, describes the new method, and shows a comparison with the previous one. We explore the time variation of the correction parameters for the SPICE data and show a clear orbit dependence. The results of the method are significantly higher quality derived Doppler signals, which we estimate at less than $\sim$ 5 km/s uncertainty for brighter lines in the absence of other systematics. Furthermore, we show the new SPICE polar observation results as a demonstration. The correction codes are written in Python, publicly available on GitHub, and can be directly applied to SPICE level 2 datasets.</description>

      <title>Orbits and Masses for 156 Companions from Combined Astrometry and Radial Velocities, and A Validation of Gaia Non-Single Star Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine absolute astrometry from Hipparcos and Gaia with archival radial velocities from the Keck/HIRES and ESO/HARPS spectrographs, as well as relative astrometry (when available), to derive masses and orbits for 156 companions around main-sequence stars, including 111 stellar companions, 12 brown dwarfs, and 33 planets. Although this sample is not compiled for occurrence-rate statistics due to systematic biases in non-uniform target selection and varied observing strategies, we nonetheless clearly detect the Brown Dwarf desert in the distribution of companion masses (as well as in mass ratio), out to separations of more than 10 AU. This work also enables a validation of Gaia DR3 non-single-star solutions by predicting Gaia's measured Right Ascension and Declination acceleration terms. For stars with Gaia astrometric acceleration solutions, we find qualitative agreement with Gaia DR3 results. Our predicted accelerations agree with the Gaia DR3 values overall, showing a median offset of 1.85 sigma, with a tail extending to about 10 sigma. These residuals suggest modestly underestimated uncertainties, broadly consistent with previous results for parallaxes and proper motions. Three of our systems have full Gaia orbital fits; however, their true orbital periods are long and all three Gaia solutions are spurious. Gaia DR4 will provide individual astrometric measurements and enable more detailed and extensive investigations of accelerating and orbital fits.</description>

      <title>Strict limits on potential secondary atmospheres on the temperate rocky exo-Earth TRAPPIST-1 d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nearby TRAPPIST-1 system, with its seven small rocky planets orbiting a late-type M8 star, offers an unprecedented opportunity to search for secondary atmospheres on temperate terrestrial worlds. In particular, the 0.8 Earth-radii planet TRAPPIST-1 d lies at the edge of the habitable zone (equilibrium temperature ~262 K). Here we present the first 0.6-5.2 micron NIRSpec/PRISM transmission spectrum of TRAPPIST-1 d from two transits with JWST. We find that stellar contamination from unocculted bright heterogeneities introduces 500-1,000 ppm visit-dependent slopes, consistent with constraints from the out-of-transit stellar spectrum. Once corrected, the transmission spectrum is flat within $\pm$100-150 ppm, showing no evidence for a haze-like slope or molecular absorption despite NIRSpec/PRISM's sensitivity to CH4, H2O, CO, SO2, and CO2. Our observations exclude clear, hydrogen-dominated atmospheres with high confidence (greater than 3$\sigma$). We leverage our constraints on even trace amounts of CH4, H2O, and CO2 to further reject high mean molecular weight compositions analogous to Titan, a cloud-free Venus, early Mars, and both Archean Earth and a cloud-free modern Earth scenario (greater than 95% confidence). If TRAPPIST-1 d retains an atmosphere, it is likely extremely thin or contains high-altitude aerosols, with water cloud formation at the terminator predicted by 3D global climate models. Alternatively, if TRAPPIST-1 d is airless, our evolutionary models indicate that TRAPPIST-1 b, c, and d must have formed with less than approximately 4 Earth oceans of water, though this would not preclude atmospheres on the cooler habitable-zone planets TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g.</description>

      <title>A 2821 Star Optical SETI Survey using ESO HARPS archival data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examined archived observations of 2,821 stars taken by the high-resolution ESO HARPS spectrograph to search for potential narrow-band laser emissions from extraterrestrial sources. From one observation of each star, our search algorithm identified a total of 285 spectral peaks with line widths slightly larger than the instrument's point-spread function. After eliminating false positives (including cosmic rays, instrumental artifacts, and terrestrial airglow lines, we identified 8 sources worthy of follow-up observations. We then analyzed all 1,835 additional observations of these follow-up targets, looking for recurring signals. We found 1 additional unexplained candidate in this followup search, but no candidate spikes which repeated at the same wavelength as one of the initial candidates at a later time. Further analysis identified one candidate as a likely faint airglow line. The remaining seven candidates continued to defy all false positive categories, including interference by LiDAR satellites and adaptive optics lasers from neighboring observatories. However, observations of other stars on the same night showed identical spectral spikes (in the telescope's reference frame) for four of these seven candidates -- indicating an as-yet unknown terrestrial source. This leaves 3 final candidates which currently defy the prosaic explanations examined thus far, show no indication of a terrestrial origin and therefore warrant further investigation. Two of these three candidates originate from M-Type stars and one of them originates from an oscillating red giant, so follow-up work will need to disentangle natural astrophysical stellar processes from potential SETI sources.</description>

      <title>Dynamical properties of high-[Mg/Fe] stars in the Milky Way bar region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the high-alpha component of the Galactic bulge remains debated, unlike the bar-driven origin of the low-alpha bulge. We examine the metallicity-dependent dynamical properties of high-[Mg/Fe] stars in the bar region, using samples of low- and high-[Mg/Fe] stars from APOGEE DR17, complemented by the PIGS catalogue of [Fe/H] $ &lt; -1 $ stars. The mean Galactocentric rotational velocity $ \overline V_\phi(R) $ is nearly cylindrical for both low- and high-[Mg/Fe] stars across the bulge and outer bar. $\overline V_\phi(R)$ of high-[Mg/Fe] stars with [Fe/H] $ \ge -0.6 $ is similar within errors to low-[Mg/Fe] stars in the bulge, and $ 10-20\% $ lower in the outer bar. The mean radial velocity field of these stars exhibits a quadrupole pattern similar to low-[Mg/Fe] stars. Orbit integrations in realistic barred Galactic potentials show that these model-independent properties correspond to a peanut bulge in the orbital density distributions for high-[Mg/Fe] stars with [Fe/H] $ \ge -0.6 $, transitioning toward a more spheroidal structure at lower metallicities. Additionally, $ \overline V_\phi$ ([Fe/H]) increases steeply as metallicity rises from about [Fe/H] $ \sim -1.3 $, resembling the spin-up observed at larger Galactic radii. This is accompanied by a transition in the dominant orbit families, from co- and counter-rotating cloud A and $ \rm x_4 $ orbits at low metallicities to co-rotating bar-supporting $ \rm x_1 $ family tree, box, and cloud A orbits at solar metallicity. Our results strengthen the case that the bulk of the high-[Mg/Fe] component in the bar region evolved from an alpha-enhanced disc, while metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] $ &lt; -1 $ trace a more turbulent origin.</description>

      <title>Binary clusters in the Galactic disk I: Systematic identification and classification using Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. We aim to identify and classify BCs using high-precision astrometric and kinematic data, and to investigate their physical properties, mutual gravitational interactions, and formation rates. Methods. We used a comprehensive star cluster catalog that contains 4,084 high-quality clusters. Based on spatial and kinematic proximity, we identified 400 cluster pairs involving 686 unique clusters. These pairs were classified into three types: primordial BCs, systems formed through tidal capture or resonant trapping, and hyperbolic encounter pairs. For each system, we calculated the tidal factor to quantify the strength of mutual tidal interaction. Additionally, we constructed multi-cluster systems by identifying transitive connections among cluster pairs. Results. Among the 400 identified cluster pairs, nearly 60.8% (243 pairs) are probably primordial BCs, exhibiting both similar ages and motions. This supports a scenario where they formed together in the same giant molecular cloud. We find that 82.5% of the cluster pairs have strong mutual tidal forces. In addition, 278 star clusters are identified as members of 82 multi-cluster systems, including 27 newly reported groups. Cross-matching with the literature confirms the recovery of previously reported systems and leads to the discovery of 268 new cluster pairs. In our sample, about 16.8% of star clusters are involved in some type of interaction with another cluster, and 9.94% of star clusters are likely born in primordial BCs. Conclusions. Our results provide a comprehensive, homogeneously identified sample of Galactic BCs. The high fraction of primordial BCs and their mutual tidal interaction suggest that cluster formation in pairs is a main outcome of star formation. This work offers new observational constraints on the formation and dynamical evolution of multiple star cluster systems.</description>

      <title>Structure and Dynamics of the Young Massive Star Cluster Westerlund 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a structural analysis of the young massive star cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). With multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, we measure the proper motions of $10346$ stars and determine their kinematic memberships by fitting a Gaussian mixture model to their proper motions. After correcting for extinction and completeness, we model the stellar density distribution and confirm the presence of an elongation with an eccentricity of $0.71$. The eccentricity decreases slightly with increasing mass. We fit the radial profile with the Elson, Fall, and Freeman model, observing a decrease in the core radius with increasing mass, indicative of weak but detectable mass segregation. This finding is further supported by a measured mass segregation ratio of $\Lambda_\mathrm{\rm MSR}=1.11\pm0.11$, only above $1$ by $1\sigma$, and slightly shorter minimum spanning tree length for higher mass bins. The cluster has a 1D velocity dispersion of $3.42 \pm 0.10~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, suggesting it is subvirial. The subvirial state implies either exceptionally high star formation efficiency or inefficient stellar feedback caused by local gas expulsion before stars reach the cluster. The crossing time is $0.30$ Myr and the relaxation time is $0.26$ Gyr. Given the age of Wd 1 of $10.7$ Myr, we expect evident mass segregation for stars more massive than $10~M_\odot$, which accounts for the minor mass segregation found in the mass range of $1.00\unicode{x2013}12.14~M_\odot$ in this work. This suggests the overall mass segregation in Wd 1 is not primordial.</description>

      <title>Turbulent heating in collisionless low-beta plasmas: imbalance, Landau damping, and electron-ion energy partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An understanding of how turbulent energy is partitioned between ions and electrons in weakly collisional plasmas is crucial for modelling many astrophysical systems. Using theory and simulations of a four-dimensional reduced model of low-beta gyrokinetics (the `Kinetic Reduced Electron Heating Model'), we investigate the dependence of collisionless heating processes on plasma beta and imbalance (normalised cross-helicity). These parameters are important because they control the helicity barrier, the formation of which divides the parameter space into two distinct regimes with remarkably different properties. In the first, at lower beta and/or imbalance, the absence of a helicity barrier allows the cascade of injected power to proceed to small (perpendicular) scales, but its slow cascade rate makes it susceptible to significant electron Landau damping, in some cases leading to a marked steepening of the magnetic spectra on scales above the ion Larmor radius. In the second, at higher beta and/or imbalance, the helicity barrier halts the cascade, confining electron Landau damping to scales above the steep `transition-range' spectral break, resulting in dominant ion heating. We formulate quantitative models of these processes that compare well to simulations in each regime, and combine them with results of previous studies to construct a simple formula for the electron-ion heating ratio as a function of beta and imbalance. This model predicts a `winner takes all' picture of low-beta plasma heating, where a small change in the fluctuations' properties at large scales (the imbalance) can cause a sudden switch between electron and ion heating.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): IV. Dust and Gas Disk Properties in the Upper Scorpius Star-forming Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) large program AGE-PRO explores protoplanetary disk evolution by studying gas and dust across various ages. This work focuses on ten evolved disks in Upper Scorpius, observed in dust continuum emission, CO and its isotopologues, and N$_2$H$^+$ with ALMA Bands 6 and 7. Disk radii, from the radial location enclosing 68% of the flux, are comparable to those in the younger Lupus region for both gas and dust tracers. However, solid masses are about an order of magnitude below those in Lupus and Ophiuchus, while the dust spectral index suggests some level of dust evolution. These empirical findings align with a combination of radial drift, dust trapping, and grain growth into larger bodies. A moderate correlation between CO and continuum fluxes suggests a link between gas and dust content, through the increased scatter compared to younger regions, possibly due to age variations, gas-to-dust ratio differences, or CO depletion. Additionally, the correlation between C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ fluxes observed in Lupus persists in Upper Sco, indicating a relatively stable CO gas abundance over the Class II stage of disk evolution. In conclusion, the AGE-PRO survey of Upper Scorpius disks reveals intriguing trends in disk evolution. The findings point towards potential gas evolution and the presence of dust traps in these older disks. Future high-resolution observations are needed to confirm these possibilities and further refine our understanding of disk evolution and planet formation in older environments.</description>

      <title>Analysis and simulations of binary black hole merger spins -- the question of spin-axis tossing at black hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of binary black hole (BH) mergers remains a topic of active debate, with effective spins (chi_eff) measured by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration providing crucial insights. In this study, our objective is to investigate the empirical chi_eff distribution (and constrain individual spin components) of binary BH mergers and compare them with extensive simulations, assuming that they originate purely from isolated binaries or a mixture of formation channels. We explore scenarios using BH kicks with and without the effect of spin-axis tossing during BH formation. We employ simple yet robust Monte Carlo simulations of the final core collapse forming the second-born BH, using minimal assumptions to ensure transparency and reproducibility. The synthetic chi_eff distribution is compared to the empirical data from LVK science runs O1-O3 using functional data analysis, kernel density estimations, and three different statistical tests, accounting for data uncertainties. We find strong indications for spin-axis tossing during BH formation if LVK sources are dominated by the isolated binary channel. Simulations with spin-axis tossing achieve high p-values (up to 0.882) using Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling tests, while without tossing, all p-values drop below 0.001 for isolated binaries. A statistically acceptable solution without tossing, however, emerges if ~72+/-8% of detected binary BH mergers result from dynamical interactions causing random BH spin directions. Finally, for an isolated binary origin, we find a preference for mass reversal in ~30% of the progenitor binaries. Predictions from this study can be tested with LVK O4+O5 data as well as the 3G detectors, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, enabling improved constraints on formation channel ratios and the critical question of BH spin-axis tossing.</description>
