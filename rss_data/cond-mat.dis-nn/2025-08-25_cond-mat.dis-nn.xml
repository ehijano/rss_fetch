      <title>Entanglement entropy as a probe of topological phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy (EE) provides a powerful probe of quantum phases, yet its role in identifying topological transitions in disordered systems remains underexplored. We introduce an exact EE-based framework that captures topological phase transitions even in the presence of disorder. Specifically, for a class of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model variants, we show that the difference in EE between half-filled and near-half-filled ground states, $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$, vanishes in the topological phase but remains finite in the trivial phase -- a direct consequence of edge-state localization. This behavior persists even in the presence of quasiperiodic or binary disorder. Exact phase boundaries, derived from Lyapunov exponents via transfer matrices, agree closely with numerical results from $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ and the topological invariant $\mathcal{Q}$, with instances where $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ outperforms $\mathcal{Q}$. Our results highlight EE as a robust diagnostic tool and a potential bridge between quantum information and condensed matter approaches to topological matter.</description>

      <title>Correlation thresholds in the steady states of particle systems and spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A growing body of theoretical and empirical evidence shows that the global steady-state distributions of many equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems approximately satisfy an analogue of the Boltzmann distribution, with a local dynamical property of states playing the role of energy. The correlation between the effective potential of the steady-state distribution and the logarithm of the exit rates determines the quality of this approximation. We demonstrate and explain this phenomenon in a simple one-dimensional particle system and in random dynamics of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass by providing the first explicit estimates of this correlation. We find that, as parameters of the dynamics vary, each system exhibits a threshold above and below which the correlation dramatically differs. We explain how these thresholds arise from underlying transitions in the relationship between the local and global "parts" of the effective potential.</description>

      <title>Universal Frequency Correlations and Recurrence Statistics of Complex Impedance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear electromagnetic wave scattering systems can be characterized by an impedance matrix that relates the voltages and currents at the ports of the system. When the system size becomes greater than the wavelength of the fields involved, the impedance matrix becomes a complicated function of the details of the system, in which case a statistical model, such as the Random Coupling Model (RCM) becomes useful. The statistics of the elements of the RCM impedance matrix depend on the excitation frequency, the spectral density of the modes of the enclosed system volume, the average loss factor (Q^{-1}) of the system, and the properties of the coupling ports as given by their radiation impedances. In this paper, properties of the elements of impedance matrices are explored numerically and experimentally. These include the two point frequency correlation functions for the complex impedance of elements and the expected difference in frequencies between which impedance values are approximately repeated. Universal scaling arguments are then given for these quantities, hence these results are generic for all sufficiently complicated scattering systems, including acoustic and optical systems. The experimental data presented in this paper come from microwave graphs, billiards, and three-dimensional cavities with embedded tunable perturbers such as metasurfaces. The data is found to be in generally good agreement with the predictions for the two point frequency correlations and the frequency interval for successive repetitions of impedance matrix elements values.</description>

      <title>Symmetry classification correspondence between quadratic Lindbladians and their steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry classification is crucial in understanding universal properties of quantum matter. Recently, the scope of symmetry classification has been extended to open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. However, the classification of Lindbladians and steady states remains largely separate. Because the former requires the non-Hermitian classification framework, while the latter relies on the classification scheme for Hermitian matrices. In this paper we build connections between symmetry classes of quadratic Lindbladian and its steady state, despite their different classification frameworks. We classify the full matrix representation of generic quadratic Lindbladians with particle conservation, showing they fall into 27 non-Hermitian symmetry classes. Among these, 22 classes lead to an infinite-temperature steady state. The remaining five classes have one-to-one correspondence with five steady-state Hermitian symmetry classes. Numerical simulations of random Lindbladian dynamics confirm the convergence to the correct steady-state symmetry classes at long time.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Matrix Sensing: Exact Asymptotics, Universality, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the matrix sensing problem, one wishes to reconstruct a matrix from (possibly noisy) observations of its linear projections along given directions. We consider this model in the high-dimensional limit: while previous works on this model primarily focused on the recovery of low-rank matrices, we consider in this work more general classes of structured signal matrices with potentially large rank, e.g. a product of two matrices of sizes proportional to the dimension. We provide rigorous asymptotic equations characterizing the Bayes-optimal learning performance from a number of samples which is proportional to the number of entries in the matrix. Our proof is composed of three key ingredients: $(i)$ we prove universality properties to handle structured sensing matrices, related to the ''Gaussian equivalence'' phenomenon in statistical learning, $(ii)$ we provide a sharp characterization of Bayes-optimal learning in generalized linear models with Gaussian data and structured matrix priors, generalizing previously studied settings, and $(iii)$ we leverage previous works on the problem of matrix denoising. The generality of our results allow for a variety of applications: notably, we mathematically establish predictions obtained via non-rigorous methods from statistical physics in [ETB+24] regarding Bilinear Sequence Regression, a benchmark model for learning from sequences of tokens, and in [MTM+24] on Bayes-optimal learning in neural networks with quadratic activation function, and width proportional to the dimension.</description>
