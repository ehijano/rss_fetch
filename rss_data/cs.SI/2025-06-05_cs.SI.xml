      <title>Politics and polarization on Bluesky</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online political discourse is increasingly shaped not by a few dominant platforms but by a fragmented ecosystem of social media spaces, each with its own user base, target audience, and algorithmic mediation of discussion. Such fragmentation may fundamentally change how polarization manifests online. In this study, we investigate the characteristics of political discourse and polarization on the emerging social media site Bluesky. We collect all activity on the platform between December 2024 and May 2025 to map out the platform's political topic landscape and detect distinct polarization patterns. Our comprehensive data collection allows us to employ a data-driven methodology for identifying political themes, classifying user stances, and measuring both structural and content-based polarization across key topics raised in English-language discussions. Our analysis reveals that approximately 13% of Bluesky posts engage with political content, with prominent topics including international conflicts, U.S. politics, and socio-technological debates. We find high levels of structural polarization across several salient political topics. However, the most polarized topics are also highly imbalanced in the numbers of users on opposing sides, with the smaller group consisting of only 1-2% of the users. While discussions in Bluesky echo familiar political narratives and polarization trends, the platform exhibits a more politically homogeneous user base than was typical prior to the current wave of platform fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Modeling Bulimia Nervosa in the Digital Age: The Role of Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globalization has fundamentally reshaped societal dynamics, influencing how individuals interact and perceive themselves and others. One significant consequence is the evolving landscape of eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa (BN), which are increasingly driven not just by internal psychological factors but by broader sociocultural and digital contexts. While mathematical modeling has provided valuable insights, traditional frameworks often fall short in capturing the nuanced roles of social contagion, digital media, and adaptive behavior. This review synthesizes two decades of quantitative modeling efforts, including compartmental, stochastic, and delay-based approaches. We spotlight foundational work that conceptualizes BN as a socially transmissible condition and identify critical gaps, especially regarding the intensifying impact of social media. Drawing on behavioral epidemiology and the adaptive behavior framework by Fenichel et al., we advocate for a new generation of models that incorporate feedback mechanisms, content-driven influence functions, and dynamic network effects. This work outlines a roadmap for developing more realistic, data-informed models that can guide effective public health interventions in the digital era.</description>

      <title>GA-S$^3$: Comprehensive Social Network Simulation with Group Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social network simulation is developed to provide a comprehensive understanding of social networks in the real world, which can be leveraged for a wide range of applications such as group behavior emergence, policy optimization, and business strategy development. However, billions of individuals and their evolving interactions involved in social networks pose challenges in accurately reflecting real-world complexities. In this study, we propose a comprehensive Social Network Simulation System (GA-S3) that leverages newly designed Group Agents to make intelligent decisions regarding various online events. Unlike other intelligent agents that represent an individual entity, our group agents model a collection of individuals exhibiting similar behaviors, facilitating the simulation of large-scale network phenomena with complex interactions at a manageable computational cost. Additionally, we have constructed a social network benchmark from 2024 popular online events that contains fine-grained information on Internet traffic variations. The experiment demonstrates that our approach is capable of achieving accurate and highly realistic prediction results. Code is open at https://github.com/AI4SS/GAS-3.</description>

      <title>A Retrieval-Augmented Multi-Agent Framework for Psychiatry Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of AI in psychiatric diagnosis faces significant challenges, including the subjective nature of mental health assessments, symptom overlap across disorders, and privacy constraints limiting data availability. To address these issues, we present MoodAngels, the first specialized multi-agent framework for mood disorder diagnosis. Our approach combines granular-scale analysis of clinical assessments with a structured verification process, enabling more accurate interpretation of complex psychiatric data. Complementing this framework, we introduce MoodSyn, an open-source dataset of 1,173 synthetic psychiatric cases that preserves clinical validity while ensuring patient privacy. Experimental results demonstrate that MoodAngels outperforms conventional methods, with our baseline agent achieving 12.3% higher accuracy than GPT-4o on real-world cases, and our full multi-agent system delivering further improvements. Evaluation in the MoodSyn dataset demonstrates exceptional fidelity, accurately reproducing both the core statistical patterns and complex relationships present in the original data while maintaining strong utility for machine learning applications. Together, these contributions provide both an advanced diagnostic tool and a critical research resource for computational psychiatry, bridging important gaps in AI-assisted mental health assessment.</description>

      <title>The Impact of COVID-19 on Twitter Ego Networks: Structure, Sentiment, and Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lockdown measures, implemented by governments during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce physical contact and limit viral spread, imposed significant restrictions on in-person social interactions. Consequently, individuals turned to online social platforms to maintain connections. Ego networks, which model the organization of personal relationships according to human cognitive constraints on managing meaningful interactions, provide a framework for analyzing such dynamics. The disruption of physical contact and the predominant shift of social life online potentially altered the allocation of cognitive resources dedicated to managing these digital relationships. This research aims to investigate the impact of lockdown measures on the characteristics of online ego networks, presumably resulting from this reallocation of cognitive resources. To this end, a large dataset of Twitter users was examined, covering a seven-year period of activity. Analyzing a seven-year Twitter dataset -- including five years pre-pandemic and two years post -- we observe clear, though temporary, changes. During lockdown, ego networks expanded, social circles became more structured, and relationships intensified. Simultaneously, negative interactions increased, and users engaged with a broader range of topics, indicating greater thematic diversity. Once restrictions were lifted, these structural, emotional, and thematic shifts largely reverted to pre-pandemic norms -- suggesting a temporary adaptation to an extraordinary social context.</description>

      <title>S$^3$: Social-network Simulation System with Large Language Model-Empowered Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social network simulation plays a crucial role in addressing various challenges within social science. It offers extensive applications such as state prediction, phenomena explanation, and policy-making support, among others. In this work, we harness the formidable human-like capabilities exhibited by large language models (LLMs) in sensing, reasoning, and behaving, and utilize these qualities to construct the S$^3$ system (short for $\textbf{S}$ocial network $\textbf{S}$imulation $\textbf{S}$ystem). Adhering to the widely employed agent-based simulation paradigm, we employ prompt engineering and prompt tuning techniques to ensure that the agent's behavior closely emulates that of a genuine human within the social network. Specifically, we simulate three pivotal aspects: emotion, attitude, and interaction behaviors. By endowing the agent in the system with the ability to perceive the informational environment and emulate human actions, we observe the emergence of population-level phenomena, including the propagation of information, attitudes, and emotions. We conduct an evaluation encompassing two levels of simulation, employing real-world social network data. Encouragingly, the results demonstrate promising accuracy. This work represents an initial step in the realm of social network simulation empowered by LLM-based agents. We anticipate that our endeavors will serve as a source of inspiration for the development of simulation systems within, but not limited to, social science.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Treatment Allocation in the Presence of Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Influence Maximization (IM), the objective is to -- given a budget -- select the optimal set of entities in a network to target with a treatment so as to maximize the total effect. For instance, in marketing, the objective is to target the set of customers that maximizes the total response rate, resulting from both direct treatment effects on targeted customers and indirect, spillover, effects that follow from targeting these customers. Recently, new methods to estimate treatment effects in the presence of network interference have been proposed. However, the issue of how to leverage these models to make better treatment allocation decisions has been largely overlooked. Traditionally, in Uplift Modeling (UM), entities are ranked according to estimated treatment effect, and the top entities are allocated treatment. Since, in a network context, entities influence each other, the UM ranking approach will be suboptimal. The problem of finding the optimal treatment allocation in a network setting is \textcolor{red}{NP-hard,} and generally has to be solved heuristically. To fill the gap between IM and UM, we propose OTAPI: Optimizing Treatment Allocation in the Presence of Interference to find solutions to the IM problem using treatment effect estimates. OTAPI consists of two steps. First, a causal estimator is trained to predict treatment effects in a network setting. Second, this estimator is leveraged to identify an optimal treatment allocation by integrating it into classic IM algorithms. We demonstrate that this novel method outperforms classic IM and UM approaches on both synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Experts for Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nodes in the real-world graphs exhibit diverse patterns in numerous aspects, such as degree and homophily. However, most existent node predictors fail to capture a wide range of node patterns or to make predictions based on distinct node patterns, resulting in unsatisfactory classification performance. In this paper, we reveal that different node predictors are good at handling nodes with specific patterns and only apply one node predictor uniformly could lead to suboptimal result. To mitigate this gap, we propose a mixture of experts framework, MoE-NP, for node classification. Specifically, MoE-NP combines a mixture of node predictors and strategically selects models based on node patterns. Experimental results from a range of real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements from MoE-NP.</description>

      <title>HyperDet: Source Detection in Hypergraphs via Interactive Relationship Construction and Feature-rich Attention Fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraphs offer superior modeling capabilities for social networks, particularly in capturing group phenomena that extend beyond pairwise interactions in rumor propagation. Existing approaches in rumor source detection predominantly focus on dyadic interactions, which inadequately address the complexity of more intricate relational structures. In this study, we present a novel approach for Source Detection in Hypergraphs (HyperDet) via Interactive Relationship Construction and Feature-rich Attention Fusion. Specifically, our methodology employs an Interactive Relationship Construction module to accurately model both the static topology and dynamic interactions among users, followed by the Feature-rich Attention Fusion module, which autonomously learns node features and discriminates between nodes using a self-attention mechanism, thereby effectively learning node representations under the framework of accurately modeled higher-order relationships. Extensive experimental validation confirms the efficacy of our HyperDet approach, showcasing its superiority relative to current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Source detection on graphs has demonstrated high efficacy in identifying rumor origins. Despite advances in machine learning-based methods, many fail to capture intrinsic dynamics of rumor propagation. In this work, we present SourceDetMamba: A Graph-aware State Space Model for Source Detection in Sequential Hypergraphs, which harnesses the recent success of the state space model Mamba, known for its superior global modeling capabilities and computational efficiency, to address this challenge. Specifically, we first employ hypergraphs to model high-order interactions within social networks. Subsequently, temporal network snapshots generated during the propagation process are sequentially fed in reverse order into Mamba to infer underlying propagation dynamics. Finally, to empower the sequential model to effectively capture propagation patterns while integrating structural information, we propose a novel graph-aware state update mechanism, wherein the state of each node is propagated and refined by both temporal dependencies and topological context. Extensive evaluations on eight datasets demonstrate that SourceDetMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantifying edge relevance for epidemic spreading via the semi-metric topology of complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparsification aims at extracting a reduced core of associations that best preserves both the dynamics and topology of networks while reducing the computational cost of simulations. We show that the semi-metric topology of complex networks yields a natural and algebraically-principled sparsification that outperforms existing methods on those goals. Weighted graphs whose edges represent distances between nodes are semi-metric when at least one edge breaks the triangle inequality (transitivity). We first confirm with new experiments that the metric backbone$\unicode{x2013}$a unique subgraph of all edges that obey the triangle inequality and thus preserve all shortest paths$\unicode{x2013}$recovers Susceptible-Infected dynamics over the original non-sparsified graph. This recovery is improved when we remove only those edges that break the triangle inequality significantly, i.e., edges with large semi-metric distortion. Based on these results, we propose the new semi-metric distortion sparsification method to progressively sparsify networks in decreasing order of semi-metric distortion. Our method recovers the macro- and micro-level dynamics of epidemic outbreaks better than other methods while also yielding sparser yet connected subgraphs that preserve all shortest paths. Overall, we show that semi-metric distortion overcomes the limitations of edge betweenness in ranking the dynamical relevance of edges not participating in any shortest path, as it quantifies the existence and strength of alternative transmission pathways.</description>

      <title>Ideological Fragmentation of the Social Media Ecosystem: From echo chambers to echo platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entertainment-driven nature of social media encourages users to engage with like-minded individuals and consume content aligned with their beliefs, limiting exposure to diverse perspectives. Simultaneously, users migrate between platforms, either due to moderation policies like de-platforming or in search of environments better suited to their preferences. These dynamics drive the specialization of the social media ecosystem, shifting from internal echo chambers to "echo platforms"--entire platforms functioning as ideologically homogeneous niches. To systematically analyze this phenomenon in political discussions, we propose a quantitative approach based on three key dimensions: platform centrality, news consumption, and user base composition. We analyze 117 million posts related to the 2020 US Presidential elections from nine social media platforms--Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, BitChute, Gab, Parler, Scored, and Voat. Our findings reveal significant differences among platforms in their centrality within the ecosystem, the reliability of circulated news, and the ideological diversity of their users, highlighting a clear divide between mainstream and alt-tech platforms. The latter occupy a peripheral role, feature a higher prevalence of unreliable content, and exhibit greater ideological uniformity. These results highlight the key dimensions shaping the fragmentation and polarization of the social media landscape.</description>

      <title>Multiplex Nodal Modularity: A novel network metric for the regional analysis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment during a working memory binding task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modularity is a well-established concept for assessing community structures in various single and multi-layer networks, including those in biological and social domains. Brain networks are known to exhibit community structure at local, meso, and global scale. However, modularity is limited as a metric to a global scale describing the overall strength of community structure, overlooking important variations in community structure at node level. To address this limitation, we extended modularity to individual nodes. This novel measure of nodal modularity (nQ) captures both mesoscale and local-scale changes in modularity. We hypothesized that nQ would illuminate granular changes in the brain due to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which are known to disrupt the brain's modular structure. We explored nQ in multiplex networks of a visual short-term memory binding task in fMRI and DTI data in the early stages of AD. While limited by sample size, changes in nQ for individual regions of interest (ROIs) in our fMRI networks were predominantly observed in visual, limbic, and paralimbic systems in the brain, aligning with known AD trajectories and linked to amyloid-$\beta$ and tau deposition. Furthermore, observed changes in white-matter microstructure in our DTI networks in parietal and frontal regions may compliment studies of white-matter integrity in poor memory binders. Additionally, nQ clearly differentiated MCI from MCI converters indicating that nQ may be sensitive to this key turning point of AD. Our findings demonstrate the utility of nQ as a measure of localized group structure, providing novel insights into task and disease-related variability at the node level. Given the widespread application of modularity as a global measure, nQ represents a significant advancement, providing a granular measure of network organization applicable to a wide range of disciplines.</description>

      <title>Examining Algorithmic Curation on Social Media: An Empirical Audit of Reddit's r/popular Feed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Platforms are increasingly relying on algorithms to curate the content within users' social media feeds. However, the growing prominence of proprietary, algorithmically curated feeds has concealed what factors influence the presentation of content on social media feeds and how that presentation affects user behavior. This lack of transparency can be detrimental to users, from reducing users' agency over their content consumption to the propagation of misinformation and toxic content. To uncover details about how these feeds operate and influence user behavior, we conduct an empirical audit of Reddit's algorithmically curated trending feed called r/popular. Using 10K r/popular posts collected by taking snapshots of the feed over 11 months, we find that recent comments help a post remain on r/popular longer and climb the feed. We also find that posts below rank 80 correspond to a sharp decline in activity compared to posts above. When examining the effects of having a higher proportion of undesired behavior -- i.e., moderator-removed and toxic comments -- we find no significant evidence that it helps posts stay on r/popular for longer. Although posts closer to the top receive more undesired comments, we find this increase to coincide with a broader increase in overall engagement -- rather than indicating a disproportionate effect on undesired activity. The relationships between algorithmic rank and engagement highlight the extent to which algorithms employed by social media platforms essentially determine which content is prioritized and which is not.
