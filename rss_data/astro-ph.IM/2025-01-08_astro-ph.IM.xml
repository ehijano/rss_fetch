      <title>High count rate effects in event processing for XRISM/Resolve x-ray microcalorimeter: I. Ground test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectroscopic performance of an X-ray microcalorimeter is compromised at high count rates. In this study, we utilize the Resolve X-ray microcalorimeter onboard the XRISM satellite to examine the effects observed during high count rate measurements and propose modeling approaches to mitigate them. We specifically address the following instrumental effects that impact performance: CPU limit, pile-up, and untriggered electrical cross talk. Experimental data at high count rates were acquired during ground testing using the flight model instrument and a calibration X-ray source. In the experiment, data processing not limited by the performance of the onboard CPU was run in parallel, which cannot be done in orbit. This makes it possible to access the data degradation caused by limited CPU performance. We use these data to develop models that allow for a more accurate estimation of the aforementioned effects. To illustrate the application of these models in observation planning, we present a simulated observation of GX 13+1. Understanding and addressing these issues is crucial to enhancing the reliability and precision of X-ray spectroscopy in situations characterized by elevated count rates.</description>

      <title>Modelling noise in gravitational-wave observatories with transdimensional models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling noise in gravitational-wave observatories is crucial for accurately inferring the properties of gravitational-wave sources. We introduce a transdimensional Bayesian approach to characterise the noise in ground-based gravitational-wave observatories using the Bayesian inference software $\texttt{Bilby}$. The algorithm models broadband noise with a combination of power laws; narrowband features with Lorentzians; and shapelets to capture any additional features in the data. We show that our noise model provides a significantly improved fit of the LIGO and Virgo noise amplitude spectral densities compared to currently available noise fits obtained with on-source data segments. We perform astrophysical inference on well-known events in the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog using our noise model and observe shifts of up to $7\%$ in the $90\%$ boundaries of credible intervals for some parameters. We discuss plans to deploy this framework systematically for gravitational-wave inference along with possible areas of improvement.</description>

      <title>Twinkle: A GPU-based binary-lens microlensing code with contour integration method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapidly increasing rate of microlensing planet detections, microlensing modeling software faces significant challenges in computation efficiency. Here, we develop the Twinkle code, an efficient and robust binary-lens modeling software suite optimized for heterogeneous computing devices, especially GPUs. Existing microlensing codes have the issue of catastrophic cancellation that undermines the numerical stability and precision, and Twinkle resolves them by refining the coefficients of the binary-lens equation. We also devise an improved method for robustly identifying ghost images, thereby enhancing computational reliability. We have advanced the state of the art by optimizing Twinkle specifically for heterogeneous computing devices by taking into account the unique task and cache memory dispatching patterns of GPUs, while the compatibility with the traditional computing architectures of CPUs is still maintained. Twinkle has demonstrated an acceleration of approximately 2 orders of magnitude (&gt;~100 times) on contemporary GPUs. The enhancement in computational speed of Twinkle will translate to the delivery of accurate and highly efficient data analysis for ongoing and upcoming microlensing projects. Both GPU and CPU versions of Twinkle are open-source and publicly available.</description>

      <title>Real-time RFI Excision Techniques and their Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary real-time RFI mitigation is carried out at different stages primarily using regulatory and technical approaches. Regulatory approaches include spectrum management, radio quiet zones, and ensuring protection from self-generated RFI. The technical approaches include mitigation RFI in the analog and RF frontend systems, digital signal processing systems, and offline systems.
  As is known, the signal received by a radio telescope is a combination of the contributions from the astronomical signal and a combination of system and sky background noise. RFI has an additive effect on the signal received by the radio telescope. The key distinguishing properties of RFI are that it is generally stronger than the signal and non-Gaussian.
  The capability of signal processing receiver systems has grown manifold with the advent of high-speed signal processing platforms like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This has enabled the development of different signal-processing techniques for real-time RFI mitigation algorithms. This document provides an overview of contemporary techniques while focusing on the implementation of the same in specific radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Ultra-Sensitive KIDs for Future THz Space Borne Polarimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements and simulations of the polarization purity of leaky lens-antenna coupled microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) at 1.5 THz. We find the integrated cross-polarization level to be at -21.5 dB for 1 f\#$\lambda$ spatial sampling. The measurements agree well with the theoretical description which is based on a combination of in-transmission simulation of the antenna feed, and an in-reception analysis of the antenna-KID system. Combined with the measured noise equivalent power of 5--7$\times$10$^{-20}$ W/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, these detectors are excellent candidates for large scale and high performance imaging polarimetric instruments.</description>

      <title>Computational Astrophysics, Data Science &amp; AI/ML in Astronomy: A Perspective from Indian Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contemporary astronomy and astrophysics (A&amp;A), the integration of high-performance computing (HPC), big data analytics, and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) has become essential for advancing research across a wide range of scientific domains. These tools are playing an increasingly pivotal role in accelerating discoveries, simulating complex astrophysical phenomena, and analyzing vast amounts of observational data. For India to maintain and enhance its competitive edge in the global landscape of computational astrophysics and data science, it is crucial for the Indian A&amp;A community to fully embrace these transformative technologies. Despite limited resources, the expanding Indian community has already made significant scientific contributions. However, to remain globally competitive in the coming years, it is vital to establish a robust national framework that provides researchers with reliable access to state-of-the-art computational resources. This system should involve the regular solicitation of computational proposals, which can be assessed by domain experts and HPC specialists, ensuring that high-impact research receives the necessary support. By building such a system, India can cultivate the talent, infrastructure, and collaborative environment necessary to foster world-class research in computational astrophysics and data science.</description>

      <title>Polarization aberrations in next-generation Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes (GSMTs). II. Influence of segment-to-segment coating variations on high-contrast imaging and polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct exo-Earth imaging is a key science goal for astronomy in the next decade. This ambitious task imposes a target contrast of ~10^-7 at wavelengths from I to J-band. In our prior study, we determined that polarization aberrations can limit the achievable contrast to 10^-5 to 10^-6 in the infrared. However, these results assumed a perfect coronagraph coupled to a telescope with an ideal coating on each of the mirrors. In this study we seek to understand the influence of polarization aberrations from segment-to-segment coating variations on coronagraphy and polarimetry. We use the Poke open-source polarization ray tracing package to compute the Jones pupil of each GSMT with spatially-varying coatings applied to the segments. The influence of the resultant polarization aberrations is simulated by propagating the Jones pupil through physical optics models of coronagraphs using HCIPy. After applying wavefront control from an ideal adaptive optics system, we determine that the segment-to-segment variations applied limit the performance of coronagraphy to a raw contrast of approximately 10^-8 in I-band, which is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower the target performance for high-contrast imaging systems on the ground. This is a negligible addition to the nominal polarization aberrations for ground-based systems. We further observe negligible degradation in polarimetric imaging of debris disks from segment-to-segment aberrations above and beyond the impact of nominal polarization aberration.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Parameter Estimation with Sequential Linear Simulation-based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the framework of Linear Simulation-based Inference (LSBI), an application of simulation-based inference where the likelihood is approximated by a Gaussian linear function of its parameters. We obtain analytical expressions for the posterior distributions of hyper-parameters of the linear likelihood in terms of samples drawn from a simulator, for both uniform and conjugate priors. This method is applied sequentially to several toy-models and tested on emulated datasets for the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature power spectrum. We find that convergence is achieved after four or five rounds of $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ simulations, which is competitive with state-of-the-art neural density estimation methods. Therefore, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain significant information gain and generate posteriors that agree with the underlying parameters while maintaining explainability and intellectual oversight.</description>

      <title>Polarization Profiles of Globular Cluster Pulsars from FAST I. 25 Profiles from Previously Known Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar polarization profiles are critical for understanding their magnetospheric structures and radiation mechanisms. We present polarization profile measurements for 25 pulsars in globular clusters (GCs) from the observation of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The diversity of polarization profiles shows complex magnetic structure and emission pattern of pulsars. Among these, the polarization profiles of 15 pulsars were firstly measured. M53A present a 57\% linear polarization ratio, being highest among these 25 GC pulsars. M15H present a 42\% circular polarization ratio, which is the highest among these 25 pulsars. The average ratios of circular and absolute circular polarization of these GC pulsars are -1\% and 10\% respectively, lower than normal pulsars measured with Parkes (\citealt{Oswald2023}), which are 5\% and 32\%, respectively. The Rotation Measure (RM) values of each pulsar were measured, giving the range of pulsar(s) from M3, M5, M15, M71, M53, NGC6517, NGC6539, NGC6760 being 8(1) to 16(1) rad $m^{-2}$, -1(2) to -4(6) rad $m^{-2}$, -70(2) to -76(1) rad $m^{-2}$, -480(14) rad $m^{-2}$ (M71A only), -2(1) rad $m^{-2}$ (M53A only), 187(1) to 212(2) rad $m^{-2}$, 109(1) rad $m^{-2}$ (NGC6539A only), and 102(1) to 129(4) rad $m^{-2}$. The GCs closer to the Galactic plane (GP) tend to have larger RM. This is consistent with previous study (\citealt{Hutschenreuter2022}).</description>

      <title>The S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey: Photometric Re-calibration with the BEst STar Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an independent validation and comprehensive re-calibration of S-PLUS Ultra-Short Survey (USS) DR1 12-band photometry using about 30,000--70,000 standard stars from the BEst STar (BEST) database. We identify spatial variation of zero-point offsets, up to 30--40\,mmag for blue filters ($u$, $J0378$, $J0395$) and 10\,mmag for others, predominantly due to the higher uncertainties of the technique employed in the original USS calibration. Moreover, we detect large- and medium-scale CCD position-dependent systematic errors, up to 50\,mmag, primarily caused by different aperture and flat-field corrections. We then re-calibrate the USS DR1 photometry by correcting the systematic shifts for each tile using second-order two-dimensional polynomial fitting combined with a numerical stellar flat-field correction method. The re-calibrated results from the XPSP and the SCR standards are consistent within 6\,mmag in the USS zero-points, demonstrating both the typical precision of re-calibrated USS photometry and a sixfold improvement in USS zero-point precision. Further validation using SDSS and Pan-STARRS1, as well as LAMOST DR10 and Gaia photometry, also confirms this precision for the re-calibrated USS photometry. Our results clearly demonstrate the capability and the efficiency of the BEST database in improving calibration precision to the milli-magnitude level for wide-field photometric surveys. The re-calibrated USS DR1 photometry is publicly available (\href{https://nadc.china-vo.org/res/r101504/}{doi: 10.12149/101503}).</description>

      <title>The joint detection rate of short gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the most recent short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) sample detected by the \emph{Fermi} satellite to reassess the sGRB luminosity function and formation rate. Using the empirical luminosity correlation, we first determine the pseudo redshifts of 478 sGRBs. Then, we use the maximum likelihood method to constrain the luminosity function and formation rate of sGRBs under various delay-time distribution models, finding the power-law delay model marginally preferred over the Gaussian and lognormal delay models based on the Akaike Information Criterion. The local formation rate of sGRBs is $1.73_{-0.45}^{+0.60}$ $\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$, largely independent of the adopted delay-time distribution model. Additionally, we investigate the potential for joint detection of sGRBs and their gravitational wave (GW) counterparts from binary neutron star mergers using both current and future GRB and GW facilities. For sGRB detection, we consider three existing satellites: \emph{Fermi}, the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}), and the Einstein Probe (\emph{EP}). For GW detection, we examine two International GW Networks (IGWN): a four-detector network consisting of LIGO Hanford, Livingston, Virgo, and Kagra (IGWN4) and an upcoming five-detector network that includes these four detectors plus LIGO India (IGWN5). Our results indicate that for different delay-time distribution models, the joint sGRB and GW detection rates for \emph{Fermi}, \emph{SVOM}, and \emph{EP} with IGWN4 (IGWN5) lie within 0.09--0.31 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (0.55--1.98 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$), 0.03--0.11 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (0.26--0.80 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$), and 0.01--0.04 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (0.09--0.27 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$), respectively.</description>

      <title>Using the STIX background detector as a proxy for GOES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-Rays (STIX) onboard Solar Orbiter was designed to observe solar flares in the X-ray range of 4-150 keV, providing spectral, temporal and spatial information. Besides 30 imaging detectors, STIX has two additional detectors, the coarse flare locator (CFL) and the background (BKG) detector. Flares observed from Earth are classified using their peak X-ray flux observed by the GOES satellites. Roughly half of all flares observed by STIX are located on the backside of the Sun. These flares lack a GOES-class classification.
  Aims. In this paper, we describe the calibration of the BKG detector aperture sizes. Using the calibrated measurements of the BKG detector, we explore the relationship between the peak flux for flares jointly observed by STIX and GOES. This allows us to estimate the GOES flare classes of backside flares using STIX measurements.
  Methods. We looked at the 500 largest flares observed by both STIX and GOES in the time range Feb. 21 to Apr. 23. Aperture size calibration is done by comparing 4-10 keV counts of the BKG detector with the CFL measurements. In a second step, we correlate the calibrated STIX BKG peak flux with the GOES peak flux for individual flares.
  Results. We calibrated the BKG detector aperture sizes of STIX. Further, we showed that for the larger flares a close power law fit exists between the STIX BKG and GOES peak flux with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.97. This correlation provides a GOES proxy with a one sigma uncertainty of 11%. We were able to show that the BKG detector can reliably measure a broad range of GOES flare classes from roughly B5 up to at least X85 (assuming a radial distance of 1AU), making it an interesting detector-concept for future space weather missions.

      <title>High-cadence stellar variability studies of RR Lyrae stars with DECam: New multi-band templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the most extensive set to date of high-quality RR Lyrae light curve templates in the griz bands, based on time-series observations of the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS) East field, located in the Galactic bulge at coordinates (RA, DEC)(J2000) = (18:03:34, -29:32:02), obtained with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the 4-m Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). Our templates, which cover both fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone (RRc) pulsators, can be especially useful when there is insufficient data for accurately calculating the average magnitudes and colors, hence distances, as well as to inform multi-band light curve classifiers, as will be required in the case of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). In this paper, we describe in detail the procedures that were adopted in producing these templates, including a novel approach to account for the presence of outliers in photometry. Our final sample comprises 136 RRab and 144 RRc templates, all of which are publicly available. Lastly, in this paper we study the inferred Fourier parameters and other light curve descriptors, including rise time,skewness, and kurtosis, as well as their correlations with the pulsation mode, period, and effective wavelength.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Positioning for Deep Sea Neutrino Telescopes with a System of Piezo Sensors Integrated into Glass Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Position calibration in the deep sea is typically done by means of acoustic multilateration using three or more acoustic emitters installed at known positions. Rather than using hydrophones as receivers that are exposed to the ambient pressure, the sound signals can be coupled to piezo ceramics glued to the inside of existing containers for electronics or measuring instruments of a deep sea infrastructure. The ANTARES neutrino telescope operated from 2006 until 2022 in the Mediterranean Sea at a depth exceeding 2000m. It comprised nearly 900 glass spheres with 432mm diameter and 15mm thickness, equipped with photomultiplier tubes to detect Cherenkov light from tracks of charged elementary particles. In an experimental setup within ANTARES, piezo sensors have been glued to the inside of such - otherwise empty - glass spheres. These sensors recorded signals from acoustic emitters with frequencies from 46545 to 60235Hz. Two waves propagating through the glass sphere are found as a result of the excitation by the waves in the water. These can be qualitatively associated with symmetric and asymmetric Lamb-like waves of zeroth order: a fast (early) one with $v_e \approx 5$mm/$\mu$s and a slow (late) one with $v_\ell \approx 2$mm/$\mu$s. Taking these findings into account improves the accuracy of the position calibration. The results can be transferred to the KM3NeT neutrino telescope, currently under construction at multiple sites in the Mediterranean Sea, for which the concept of piezo sensors glued to the inside of glass spheres has been adapted for monitoring the positions of the photomultiplier tubes.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Prediction of Strong Lensing Systems with Domain Adaptation and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling strong gravitational lenses is computationally expensive for the complex data from modern and next-generation cosmic surveys. Deep learning has emerged as a promising approach for finding lenses and predicting lensing parameters, such as the Einstein radius. Mean-variance Estimators (MVEs) are a common approach for obtaining aleatoric (data) uncertainties from a neural network prediction. However, neural networks have not been demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data successfully - e.g., when trained on simulated data and applied to real, observational data. In this work, we perform the first study of the efficacy of MVEs in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on strong lensing data. The source domain data is noiseless, and the target domain data has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that adding UDA to MVE increases the accuracy on the target data by a factor of about two over an MVE model without UDA. Including UDA also permits much more well-calibrated aleatoric uncertainty predictions. Advancements in this approach may enable future applications of MVE models to real observational data.</description>

      <title>Searching for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes early inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early inspiral from stellar-mass binary black holes (sBBHs) can emit milli-Hertz gravitational wave signals, making them detectable sources for space-borne gravitational wave missions like TianQin. However, the traditional matched filtering technique poses a significant challenge for analyzing this kind of signal, as it requires an impractically high number of templates ranging from $10^{31}$ to $10^{40}$. We propose a search strategy that involves two main parts: initially, we reduce the dimensionality of the simulated signals using incremental principal component analysis (IPCA). Subsequently, we train the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on the compressed TianQin data obtained from IPCA, aiming to develop both a detection model and a point parameter estimation model. The compression efficiency for the trained IPCA model achieves a cumulative variance ratio of 95.6% when applied to $10^6$ simulated signals. To evaluate the performance of CNN we generate the receiver operating characteristic curve for the detection model which is applied to the test data with varying signal-to-noise ratios. At a false alarm probability of 5%, the corresponding true alarm probability for signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 is 86.5%. Subsequently, we introduce the point estimation model to evaluate the value of the chirp mass of corresponding sBBH signals with an error. For signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50, the trained point estimation CNN model can estimate the chirp mass of most test events, with a standard deviation error of 2.49 $M_{\odot}$and a relative error precision of 0.13.</description>

      <title>Collective modes in relativistic cold asymmetric nuclear matter within the covariant Vlasov approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A covariant relativistic approach based on the Vlasov equation is applied to the study of infinite asymmetric nuclear matter. We use several Walecka-type hadronic models and obtain the dispersion relations for the longitudinal modes. The isovector and isoscalar collective modes are determined for a wide range of densities as a function of isospin asymmetry and momentum transfer within a set of eleven relativistic mean field models with different nuclear matter properties. Special attention is given to beta-equilibrium matter. It is shown that the possible propagation of isoscalar and isovector-like modes depends directly on the density dependence of the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state and of the symmetry energy, with a stiff equation of state favouring the propagation of isoscalar like collective modes at high densities, and a stiff symmetry energy defining the behavior of the isovector like modes which propagate for densities below two times saturation density. The coupling of the nuclear modes to the electron plasmon is also discussed.</description>
