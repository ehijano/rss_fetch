      <title>Suppression of Electromagnetic Pulses from Laser-Target Interactions by Strong Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-target interactions generate intense electromagnetic pulses (EMP) that can interfere with measurements and damage equipment. In this paper we show that applying a magnetic field to nanosecond pulse laser-target interactions decreases the magnitude of EMP. We demonstrate this effect in two experiments with different geometries (spherical vs. planar), laser intensities (${\sim}10^{13}$ vs. ${\sim} 10^{15}$~W/cm$^2$) and applied field strength (12~T vs. 0.1~T) that both observed suppression of EMP in the ${\sim} 1$~GHz band (by factors of $0.65\times$ and $0.32\times$ respectively). We then observe the opposite effect at high intensities with a picosecond pulse: for planar experiments with laser intensities ${\sim}10^{19}$~W/cm$^2$ and magnetic fields of 6--10~T, the magnitude of EMP is increased by a factor of $1.75\times$. These results provide a benchmark for models of EMP generation, but suggest that magnetic fields are not a viable solution for mitigating EMP on the high intensity laser facilities where it is most damaging.</description>

      <title>A tutorial on inversion-based shape control with design application to NSTX-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most common designs for magnetic control in tokamaks is to ``linearize an equilibrium'' to obtain a sensitivity mapping, then invert this mapping in order to determine the feedback control currents or voltages. For this work, we refer to this broad class of methods as inversion-based shape control (IBSC). In this work we describe the IBSC framework in a comprehensive manner and show how variations such as using dynamic voltage mappings and quadratic-program constrained control fit naturally into the framework. Despite the prevalence of IBSC, some of these extensions and the challenges associated with specific variations of IBSC are less widely known. We pay special attention to the challenge of decoupling the interaction between shape control and vertical control, which was a source of degraded vertical control performance on NSTX-U. This work is intended to provide a systematic overview of IBSC, and to that end, we have provided background material, proposed design procedures, and tutorials on the magnetic control design process within the appendices. Applying the systematic design procedure to NSTX-U, we find that the vertical control bobble on NSTX-U can be removed via decoupling, and that the vertical control phase margin can be improved by 6 degrees just by including PF1A and PF2 as vertical actuators.</description>

      <title>How Does The Magnetic Gradient Scale Length Influence Complexity of Filamentary Coils in Stellarators?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distance between the last closed flux surface (LCFS) and the nearest electromagnetic coils is a dominating factor in the cost, size, and engineering difficulty of stellarators. The smallest magnetic gradient scale length on the LCFS - denoted L_gradB - has been shown to be a good proxy for minimum coil-surface distance in optimizations of a current potential on a winding surface, such as through the REGCOIL method. However, it has not been shown the same is true for filament coils, or that the magnetic gradient scale length is an effective objective function in optimization. In this paper, we explore examples in which min(L_gradB) is correlated with the minimum coil-surface distance for filament coils. First, we analyze a subset of the single-stage-optimized equilibria from the QUASR dataset [Giuliani et al. JPP (2024)]. We find that the majority of configurations have min(L_gradB) located nearby the point of closest coil-surface distance. Second, we optimize quasihelically symmetric equilibria to have improved min(L_gradB), and optimize coils via a continuation method. We then traced alpha particles to test confinement. Finally, we compare min(L_gradB) to the minimum coil-surface distance with filament coils optimized for a set of finite beta equilibria with random boundary shapes. For all datasets, we find that min(L_gradB) is correlated with both the minimum coil-surface and coil-coil distances if sufficient coil length is allowed. Even when there is a trade-off with proxies for confinement, optimizing for improved min(L_gradB) can result in better confinement in the presence of coils, up to a point. This is because - when holding coil-coil distance constant - equilibria with lower min(L_gradB) have a larger normal field error dominated by coil ripple causing particle loss. Both can be reduced by increasing coil-surface distance for equilibria with a high min(L_gradB).</description>

      <title>Machine learning prediction of plasma behavior from discharge configurations on WEST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting plasma behavior based on discharge configurations is essential for the safe and efficient operation of tokamak experiments. While physics-based integrated modeling codes provide valuable insights, their high computational cost limits their applicability for fast scenario design and control optimization. In this study, we propose a transformer-based machine learning model to predict key global plasma parameters on the WEST tokamak, including the normalized beta ($\beta_{n}$), toroidal beta ($\beta_{t}$), poloidal beta ($\beta_{p}$), plasma stored energy ($W_{\mathrm{mhd}}$), safety factor at the magnetic axis ($q_{0}$), and safety factor at the 95% flux surface ($q_{95}$). The model uses only signals that can be defined before the discharge, such as magnetic coil currents, auxiliary heating power, plasma current reference, and line-averaged plasma density. Trained on 550 discharges from the WEST campaigns, the model demonstrates an average mean square error (MSE) loss of 0.026, an average coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ of 0.94, and achieves inference times on the order of 0.1 seconds. These results highlight the potential of data-driven surrogate models for assisting in discharge planning, scenario evaluation, and real-time control of tokamak plasmas.</description>

      <title>Neoclassical transport and profile prediction in transport barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gradient regions in tokamaks, such as the pedestal or internal transport barriers, are regions of reduced turbulence where neoclassical transport can play a dominant role. However, standard neoclassical transport theory assumes that the gradient length scales of density, temperature, and potential are of the order of the system size. In the pedestal, gradient length scales are much shorter and are measured to be of the order of the ion poloidal gyroradius. We present an extension of neoclassical theory that is applicable in transport barriers of large aspect ratio tokamaks. We show that particle and momentum transport are connected in such a way that a source of parallel momentum can drive a significant neoclassical ion particle flux. In strong gradient regions, density, electric potential, mean parallel flow, and ion temperature are shown to no longer be flux functions. Instead, they have a small but important poloidally varying piece that modifies the transport equations to lowest order. This introduces a nonlinearity in the transport problem through the coupling with quasineutrality that yields multiple co-existing solutions when solving for the plasma profiles. The different solutions could be connected to low and high transport states and jumps between solutions could be an indication of H-L back-transitions.</description>

      <title>Three Dimensional Multiphysics Modelling of Helicon Wave Heating and Antenna Plasma Coupling for Boundary Density Control in Toroidal Fusion Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active control of scrape off layer density is emerging as a critical requirement for improving ion cyclotron resonance heating and enabling high performance steady state operation in future magnetic confinement fusion devices. Helicon wave excitation offers a promising physics based approach to generating high density boundary plasmas with high ionization efficiency and low impurity release. In this work, we develop THEMIS code, a fully three dimensional (3D) multiphysics model of helicon wave propagation and power deposition in a toroidal fusion relevant configuration, employing a finite temperature thermal dielectric tensor. The code quantifies the relative contributions of Doppler shifted cyclotron damping, anomalous Doppler damping, collisional damping, and Landau damping, and demonstrates that slow wave propagation and electron Landau damping dominate the accessible heating regime in Helimak device. A comparative study of four planar antenna geometries under the present protruding window configuration shows that geometric cutoffs and SOL density gradients severely limit power penetration into the core accessible region. To address this constraint, we introduce a recessed window launch scheme that positions the dielectric window inside the vacuum vessel and perform systematic parameter scans of window position, antenna geometry, and installation orientation. From these analyses, we identify the key physics driven principles governing efficient helicon wave coupling: the importance of open circuit termination, maximized strap length and width, controlled inter turn spacing, and sufficient clearance from metallic walls to avoid near field suppression. Guided by these principles, we designed an optimized racetrack spiral antenna that increases coupling efficiency by more than an order of magnitude compared with conventional short circuited rectangular spiral antenna.</description>

      <title>Friction-induced scale-selection in the extended Cahn-Hilliard model for zonal staircase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we describe a possible mechanism to set the radial scale of zonal flows, which may be applicable to the $E \times B$ staircase found in the global full-f simulations such as [G. Dif-Pradalier et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 085004 (2015)]. 1D numerical simulation results of the Cahn-Hilliard model - extended to include zonal flow friction - can be understood from a heuristic nonlinear analysis. The staircase step-size $\Delta$ is found to decrease as the dimensionless zonal flow friction $\mu$ increases. It scales like $\Delta \sim \log \mu^\alpha$, with $\alpha \simeq -0.41$, up to a constant offset.</description>

      <title>Gyrokinetic simulation of the effect of transient fueling on plasma turbulence in ADITYA-U tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gradient-driven microturbulence in ADITYA-U tokamak plasmas has been suppressed by injecting short gas puffs. The suppression of microturbulence increases the core temperature and subsequently the energy confinement time following the gas puff. The gas injection modifies the radial density profile, making it relatively flatter near the mid-radius. Global electrostatic gyrokinetic simulations show that this modification to the radial density profile due to gas injection suppresses the existing trapped electron mode (TEM). Simulation results show that the TEM-dominated turbulence suppression reduces the turbulence-driven heat transport, leading to an increase in core temperature. Applying multiple periodic gas-puffs leads to multiple periodic events of TEM suppression, improving the overall energy confinement time, and is used as an active control mechanism to influence microturbulence in ADITYA-U tokamak.</description>

      <title>The Free-Electron Laser Model of Magnetospheric Chorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chorus waves are electromagnetic waves named for their resemblance to birds chirping at dawn when their radio frequencies are played as audio. The amplification of chorus in Earth's magnetosphere has been the subject of intense scientific inquiry since the discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts in 1958. Resonant interactions between chorus and radiation belt electrons can lead to the exponential growth of small seed waves by a factor of fifty within milliseconds. These powerful modes can cause rapid acceleration of electrons and endanger space-based technologies. Recent efforts to understand chorus amplification have drawn upon parallels to free-electron lasers, laboratory devices that generate intense coherent light with tunable frequencies. This approach, known as the free-electron laser model of magnetospheric chorus, is the subject of this dissertation. In this work, we build on previous research on the free-electron laser model, ultimately presenting a novel nonlinear model of whistler-mode chorus in the magnetosphere. In the first chapter, we provide a brief introduction to whistlers, magnetospheric chorus, and free-electron lasers. We also derive the 2N+2 equations foundational to the interaction of chorus with N resonant electrons. In the second chapter, we derive a reduced set of just three nonlinear equations using the method of collective variables. We then derive a Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE) for the behavior of a chorus wave packet with a spectrum of frequencies with spatially varying amplitudes and discuss the prediction of solitary chorus waves. In the third chapter, we focus on the behavior of the single-mode solutions predicted by the GLE, including their linear stability and the phenomenon of mode condensation, where a single mode can emerge from a noisy spectrum. In the final chapter, we summarize the results and discuss open questions and future directions.</description>

      <title>Fast reconnection in a coronal torn plasma sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tearing instability, also known as plasmoid instability, is an effective mechanism to speed up magnetic reconnection process, working in a wide range of magnetized plasma systems with different spatial scales, ionization degrees, and collisionality. However, due to observational limitations, observations of {plasma sheet} tearing and the resulting plasmoids are rather scarce. This scarcity significantly hinders our understanding of the role of plasmoids in the reconnection process from an observational perspective. Using high-spatiotemporal multiwavelength observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we traced the entire evolution of a coronal {plasma sheet}. Its formation was driven by the emergence of photospheric magnetic flux, followed by tearing, and eventual decay. The evolution of the {plasma sheet} exhibited two distinct stages. Initially, it rose rapidly, lengthened, and underwent tearing at a low frequency. Subsequently, its ascent slowed, it began to shorten, and the tearing occurred more frequently. Detailed analysis of the reconnecting {plasma sheet} focuses on heating, plasmoid dynamics (formation and ejection), and the resulting reconnection rate change. Two key heating processes are identified: {plasma sheet} tearing and coalescence involving plasmoids and magnetic cusps. More importantly, combining observations with analytical studies suggests that plasmoids are key carriers of magnetic flux fast transferring in the observed torn {plasma sheet}, and their formation and ejection significantly enhance the reconnection rate and facilitate the onset of fast reconnection.</description>

      <title>Nanometer-scale pre-bunched electron beams generated from all-optical plasma-based acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality and prebunched electron beams can produce coherent x-rays with high intensity and narrow bandwidth, which is essential for modern light sources. An all-optical scheme based on plasma-based acceleration to produce bright electron beams that are pre-bunched on nanometer-scales is proposed. By using a density modulation created by two low intensity counter-propagating lasers, the phase velocity of the plasma wake excited by an intense driver laser in a uniform plasma can be modulated at a frequency twice that of the colliding lasers and thus turn the injection on and off. The injected electrons are micro-bunched at the Doppler shifted wavelength of the modulated wavelength using the corresponding phase velocity of the gradual expansion of the wakefield. It is demonstrated that by controlling the properties of the drive and colliding lasers, that beams with exotic pre-bunched structures can be produced, which may have critical applications in ultrafast high power x-rays. This extremely compact, all-optical scheme to produce ultra-bright pre-bunched electron beams may therefore enable novel applications for ultrafast x-ray users and arouse general interest in various fields.</description>

      <title>The Role of Inhomogeneities in the Turbulent Accretion of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of supermassive black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope reveal significant inhomogeneities, most likely related to density and magnetic field perturbations. To model these features, we conduct high-resolution 2D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations of a Fishbone-Moncrief torus around a Kerr black hole using the Black Hole Accretion Code $\texttt{BHAC}$. We compare unperturbed accretion with a case featuring plasma density bubbles with pressure balanced magnetic islands of different amplitudes. Power spectrum analysis of accretion time series, performed via the Blackman-Tukey method, shows that the perturbed case exhibits (1) steeper spectral indices compared to the unperturbed case, deviating from the characteristic $1/\omega$ noise spectrum, and (2) increased correlation times, providing evidence for absorption of macro-structures at the event horizon. Spatial auto-correlation analysis of near-horizon turbulence confirms larger energy-containing coherent structures in the perturbed case altering the accretion rate. These results provide new insights for interpreting observations of supermassive black hole environments, where near-horizon turbulence may play a key role in the accretion process.</description>

      <title>The Numerics of VMEC++</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: VMEC++ is a Python-friendly, from-scratch reimplementation in C++ of the Variational Moments Equilibrium Code (VMEC), a fixed- and free-boundary ideal-MHD equilibrium solver for stellarators and tokamaks. The first VMEC implementation was written by Steven P. Hirshman and colleagues in the 1980s and 1990s and its latest Fortran incarnation (PARVMEC, https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/PARVMEC) is widely used in stellarator optimization systems. Our work improves on previous implementations with regard to various critical aspects: special care has been put in providing an idiomatic Python experience, from installation to actual usage; VMEC++ has a zero-crash policy; it supports inputs in the classic INDATA format as well as friendlier JSON files. VMEC++ execution times are typically less than or equal to previous implementations, and time to convergence can be decreased dramatically by leveraging its hot-restart feature: by providing the output of a VMEC++ run as initial state for a subsequent one, VMEC++ is initialized using the previously converged equilibrium. This can dramatically decrease runtimes when running on many similar magnetic configurations as it typically happens in stellarator optimization pipelines. On the flip side, some features of the original Fortran VMEC implementation are not yet available in VMEC++, such as support for non-stellarator-symmetric configurations. This contribution presents the internal numerics of the open-source VMEC++ package publicly for the first time.</description>

      <title>A Particle-in-Cell Simulation Framework for Thomson Scattering Analysis in Inertial Confinement Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04298</link>

Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion (ICF), Thomson scattering (TS) is a widely used diagnostic technique for probing plasma conditions. We present a first-principles numerical approach to obtaining scattered light signals of ion acoustic features with high resolution in angle and frequency space using particle-in-cell simulations under typical ICF conditions. Our method demonstrates good agreement with existing theories for thermal collective TS. In the super-thermal collective regime, the results align with theory when the driven plasma modes are well-matched in wave vectors to the probe and collecting beams. Moreover, we also find that TS signals can remain significant even under imperfect wave-vector matching-a result that contradicts the conventional expectation that the TS spectrum strictly follows the plasma density spectrum. We attribute this discrepancy to a beating wave mechanism arising from the interaction between the probe beam and driven plasma density modulations. Our work thus provides a practical framework for interpreting TS signals from driven ion modes, a common yet complex feature in ICF plasmas.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Motion of Ions In Finite-amplitude Low-frequency Alfv\'en Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite-amplitude low-frequency Alfv\'en waves (AWs) are ubiquitous in space plasmas, where they play a key role in the transport and dissipation of energy, particularly in the heating of ions in the solar corona and solar wind. In this study, we investigate the nonlinear interaction between ions and obliquely propagating AWs. When the wave amplitude and propagation angle lie within specific ranges, ion motion becomes chaotic. We quantify this behavior using the maximum Lyapunov exponent ($\lambda_{\mathrm{m}}$) and define a new parameter, the Chaos Ratio (CR), to describe the fraction of chaotic particles across different initial states. The global chaos threshold is determined as the contour CR = 0.01. Analysis of magnetic moment variations reveals that the physical origin of chaos is pitch-angle scattering induced by \textit{wave-driven field-line curvature} (WFLC), which disrupts adiabatic invariance and leads to stochastic ion energization. The onset condition for chaos can be expressed by an effective relative curvature radius, $P_{eff.} &lt; 25$. This analytical criterion delineates the boundary of the chaotic region in the ($k_x$, $k_z$, $B_w$) parameter space and agrees well with numerical results. The identified WFLC mechanism provides a new physical pathway for converting macroscale Alfv\'enic disturbances into microscopic ion heating. \textbf{This analysis offers a simplified model that illustrates a plausible ion energization mechanism in Alfv\'enic turbulent plasmas}, including those associated with solar wind switchbacks and coronal fluctuations. These results highlight a universal chaotic process that may underlie stochastic heating in heliospheric and astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Spectral Deconvolution without the Deconvolution: Extracting Temperature from X-ray Thomson Scattering Spectra without the Source-and-Instrument Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) probes the dynamic structure factor of the system, but the measured spectrum is broadened by the combined source-and-instrument function (SIF) of the setup. In order to extract properties such as temperature from an XRTS spectrum, the broadening by the SIF needs to be removed. Recent work [Dornheim et al. Nature Commun. 13, 7911 (2022)] has suggested that the SIF may be deconvolved using the two-sided Laplace transform. However, the extracted information can depend strongly on the shape of the input SIF, and the SIF is in practice challenging to measure accurately. Here, we propose an alternative approach: we demonstrate that considering ratios of Laplace-transformed XRTS spectra collected at different scattering angles is equivalent to performing the deconvolution, but without the need for explicit knowledge of the SIF. From these ratios, it is possible to directly extract the temperature from the scattering spectra, when the system is in thermal equilibrium. We find the method to be generally robust to spectral noise and physical differences between the spectrometers, and we explore situations in which the method breaks down. Furthermore, the fact that consistent temperatures can be extracted for systems in thermal equilibrium indicates that non-equilibrium effects could be identified by inconsistent temperatures of a few eV between the ratios of three or more scattering angles.</description>

      <title>Ionization and temperature measurements in warm dense copper using x-ray absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We detail experimental results inferring ionization and temperature for warm dense copper plasmas at several times solid density (15 to 25 g/cm$^3$) and temperatures of 10 to 21 eV. Experiments performed at the OMEGA Laser Facility generate uniform warm dense matter conditions via symmetric shock compression of a buried copper layer. The plasma is probed with a laser-generated x-ray source to collect the K-shell x-ray absorption spectrum. Fitting bound-bound absorption contributions from constituent charge states of copper provides an estimated $\overline{Z}$ of approximately 4 to 7 for these warm dense copper plasmas. We find that these partially ionized plasmas have K-edge shifts of 12 to 30 eV and bound-bound resonance 1s$\rightarrow$3p absorption shifts of 4 to 26 eV with respect to the cold K-edge. This study provides necessary experimental data to improve ionization and opacity models in the warm dense matter regime.</description>

      <title>Magnetic plasmoid explosions in the context of magnetar giant flares and fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetar flares are highly energetic and rare events in which intense X and {\gamma}-ray emission is released from strongly magnetised neutron stars. The events are also accompanied by mass ejection from the neutron star. Fast radio bursts are short and intense pulses of coherent radio emission. Their large dispersion measures support an extragalactic origin. While their exact origin still remains elusive, a substantial number of models associates them with strong magnetic field and high-energy relativistic plasma found in the vicinity of magnetars. There is growing evidence that some fast radio bursts are associated with flare-type events from magnetars. We provide a set of configurations describing a relativistic, spherical, magnetic plasmoid explosion. We proceed by solving the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics for a system that expands while maintaining its internal equilibrium. We find the interdependent relation between pressure, mass density, Lorentz factor, and magnetic field that determines the detailed properties of the solutions. A dichotomy of solutions exists that correspond to higher and lower density and thermal pressure compared to the external one. For stronger toroidal magnetic fields, the maximum permitted expansion velocity becomes lower than the weaker toroidal fields. These solution classes can be applied to magnetar giant flares and fast radio bursts. Those that corresponding to over densities and higher pressure can be associated with magnetar flares, and those corresponding to underdensities can be relevant to fast radio bursts that correspond to magnetically dominated events with low mass loading.

      <title>On flying near the base of a pseudo-streamer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03620v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near the 10 solar radius perihelion of Parker Solar Probe encounter 24, a confined region containing an enhanced plasma density (25,000 per cubic centimeter) and broadband electrostatic waves was encountered. The solar wind velocity (200 kilometers per second) and ion temperature (25 electron Volts) were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed near the base of a pseudo-streamer. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. This field is not associated with an ExB drift because it is observed in the plasma rest frame. Instead, it is balanced by the Generalized Ohm's Law terms whose current dependent term associated with this electric field was less than 1 milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. The region also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the Generalized Ohm's Law could be significant. In addition, both the density and electric field had non-zero slopes as functions of time, suggesting that the pressure gradient term in the Generalized Ohm's Law also mattered. This large electric field in the plasma rest frame may be the first and largest such field ever reported.</description>
