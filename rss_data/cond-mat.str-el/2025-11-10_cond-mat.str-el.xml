      <title>Short-range Spin Freezing State in the Double Trillium Lattice Spin-Liquid Candidate KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ Revealed via $^{31}$P NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study, combined with thermodynamic measurements and first-principle band-structure calculations, has been conducted to explore the ground state of the $S = 5/2$ double trillium lattice antiferromagnet KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$. Our experimental results indicate that the magnetic ground state is neither a conventional three-dimensional (3D) long-range order (LRO) nor a pure gapless spin-liquid state, as conjectured previously [Boya et al., APL Mater. 10, 101103 (2022)]. Specifically, the observation of a nearly field-independent NMR linewidth below $T^{*}$ = (3.5 $\pm$ 0.4) K, and a significant enhancement of spin-spin relaxation rate $1/T_2$ below $2T^{*}$ (where $T^{*}$ is the characteristic temperature identified from the magnetic susceptibility), indicate a complex magnetic ground state where spin freezing coexists with persistent dynamics. Furthermore, we argue that the lack of magnetic LRO and the persistence of strong magnetic fluctuations in KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ are unlikely to originate from intersite K/Sr disorder, rather arise due to intrinsic magnetic frustration. Our findings position KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ into a broader family of geometrically frustrated magnets characterized by coexisting spin freezing and pronounced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, marking it as a promising platform for investigating exotic phenomena in 3D frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of linear magnetoresistance in Kagome metal ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kagome lattice has attracted extensive attention due to the diverse magnetic properties and non-trivial electronic states generated by its unique atomic arrangement, which provides an excellent system for exploring macroscopic quantum behavior. Here, we report the anomalous transport properties in 166-type Kagome metal ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$ single crystals. The quadratic and linear magnetoresistance (LMR) can be observed depending on the directions of the field and the current. Integrating Hall resistivity and quantum oscillation measurements, we found that the LMR could match well with the Abrikosov model. However, this model encounters difficulties in explaining the anisotropy of the magnetoresistance. To solve the issue, we extrapolate the Abrikosov model to the case of two-dimensional linear dispersion. It was found that when the field is parallel to the linear dependence momentum, the quantized energy is $\epsilon_n^{\pm}$ = $\pm v\sqrt{p^2+2eHn/c}$, resulting in LMR. By contrast, when it is parallel to the non-linear dependence momentum, the energy is $\epsilon_n^{\pm}$ = $\pm v\sqrt{2eHn/c}$, without yielding LMR. Through the combination of experiment and theory, the modified Abrikosov model could interpret the macroscopic quantum transport in ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$ crystal. The present research provides a new perspective for understanding the LMR behavior.</description>

      <title>Coupled dimerized alternating-bond quantum spin chains in the distorted honeycomb-lattice magnet Cu$_5$SbO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze powder-averaged inelastic neutron scattering and magnetization data for the distorted honeycomb compound Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ using a first-order dimer expansion calculation and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We show that, in contrast to the previously proposed honeycomb lattice model, Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ accommodates interacting dimerized spin chains with alternating ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic couplings along the chain. Moreover, unlike the typical couplings observed in other Cu$^{2+}$-based distorted honeycomb magnets, the spin chains in Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ primarily couple through an antiferromagnetic coupling $J_4$ that arises between the honeycomb layers, rather than the expected interchain $J_3$ coupling in the layers. This finding reveals a different magnetic coupling scheme, $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_4$, for Cu$_5$SbO$_6$. In addition, utilizing x-ray spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, we also refine the crystal structure and stacking-fault model of the compound.</description>

      <title>Compact localized fermions and Ising anyons in a chiral spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiparticle hybridization remains a major challenge to realizing and controlling exotic states of matter in existing quantum simulation platforms. We report the absence of hybridization for compact localized states (CLS) emerging in the chiral spin liquid described by the Yao-Kivelson model. The CLS form due to destructive quantum interference at fine-tuned coupling constants and populate perfectly flat quasiparticle bands on an effective kagome lattice. Using a formalism for general Majorana-hopping Hamiltonians, we derive exact expressions for CLS for various flux configurations and both for the topological and trivial phases of the model. In addition to finite-energy matter fermions with characteristic spin-spin correlations, we construct compact localized Majorana zero modes attached to $\pi$-flux excitations, which enable non-Abelian braiding of Ising anyons with minimal separation. Our results inform the quantum simulation of topologically ordered states of matter and open avenues for exploring flat-band physics in quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>An explicit formula for perturbation theory at any order with infinitely many perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a systematic formula, in terms of integer partitions, that generates perturbation theory explicitly at an arbitrary order. Our approach naturally includes an infinite number of perturbations and uses a single matrix equation that contains the information for both the eigenvalue and eigenvector corrections. The formula reduces to the standard case of one perturbation in the appropriate limit. This formulation streamlines the derivations that are traditionally tedious in perturbation theory, facilitating high-order calculations.</description>

      <title>Exact analysis of the interplay of charge order and unconventional pairings in the 2D Hatsugai-Kohmoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide here a study of some competing ordering tendencies exhibited by the exactly solvable 2D Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model on a square lattice. To this end, we investigate the interplay between superconductivity, charge-density wave (CDW) and pair-density wave (PDW) orders as a function of interaction, doping parameter, magnetic field, and uniaxial strain. As a result, we confirm the intertwined nature of CDW and PDW fluctuating orders for intermediate-to-strong couplings. We also verify that, while an applied magnetic field favors the formation of a CDW and allows the subsequent emergence of a PDW as a secondary order, strain effects favor unidirectional PDW as a primary order over the subdominant appearance of a stripe-like CDW. These results underscore the value of the HK model as an interesting platform in order to investigate (via an exactly solvable framework) the emergence of charge order and unconventional superconductivity in fermionic systems with strong interactions. Finally, we briefly discuss an orbital generalization of the HK model, which has been recently argued to be relevant to describe the properties of realistic strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>The action of the nearest neighbor Coulomb repulsion on the homogeneity in the high concentration domain for itinerant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact results are presented for itinerant systems
  demonstrating that the nearest neighbor Coulomb
  repulsion (V) destroys the homogeneity in the high concentration regime, this
  property being not present in the low concentration domain. Since the effects
  of V often seems contradictory, and the number of phases in which it could
  appear is extremely large, this result underlines that the action of the
  nearest neighbor repulsion is not necessarily routed in the characteristics
  of phases on which it acts, but could be intimately related to V itself.
  The $V &gt; 0$ case usually means non-integrability, hence the deduced exact
  ground states are related to non-integrable systems, the technique being
  based on positive semidefinite operator properties.</description>

      <title>On-Shell Methods for Quantum Matter: Strongly correlated Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for applying on-shell scattering amplitude methods to emergent relativistic phases of quantum matter. Many strongly correlated systems, from Dirac and Weyl semimetals to topological-insulator surfaces, exhibit low-energy excitations that are effectively massless relativistic spinors. We show that physical observables such as nonlinear optical and Hall responses can be obtained from compact on-shell amplitudes, bypassing the complexity of Feynman diagrams. As a concrete demonstration, we derive the nonlinear Hall conductivity of a Dirac semimetal from a single parity-odd three-photon amplitude, highlighting the analytic and conceptual power of amplitude-based approaches for strongly correlated condensed-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Structural modulation, physical properties, and electronic band structure of the kagome metal UCr$_6$Ge$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical flexibility of the $RM_6X_6$ stoichiometry, where an $f$-block element is intercalated in the CoSn structure type, allows for the tuning of flatbands associated with kagome lattices to the Fermi level and for emergent phenomena due to interactions between the $f$- and $d$-electron lattices. Yet, 5$f$ members of the "166" compounds are underrepresented compared with 4$f$ members. Here, we report single-crystal growth of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$, which crystallizes in a monoclinically distorted Y$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$-type structure. The real-space character of the modulation, which is unique within the $RM_6X_6$ family, is approximated by a 3$\times$1$\times$2 supercell of the average monoclinic cell. The compound has kagome-lattice flatbands near the Fermi level and a moderately enhanced electronic heat capacity, as evidenced by its low-temperature Sommerfeld coefficient ($\gamma=86.5$ mJ mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$) paired with band structure calculations. The small, isotropic magnetization and featureless resistivity of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$ suggest itinerant uranium 5$f$ electrons and Pauli paramagnetism. The isotropic magnetic behavior of the uranium 5$f$ electrons starkly contrasts with localized behavior in other uranium 166 compounds, highlighting the high tunability of the magnetic ground state across the material family.</description>

      <title>From single-particle to many-body chaos in Yukawa--SYK: theory and a cavity-QED proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how quantum systems transition from integrable to fully chaotic behavior remains a central open problem in physics. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model provides a paradigmatic framework for studying many-body chaos and holography, yet it captures only the strongly correlated limit, leaving intermediate regimes unexplored. Here, we investigate the Yukawa--SYK (YSYK) model, where bosonic fields mediate random fermionic interactions, and demonstrate that it naturally bridges single-particle and many-body chaos. Using spectral and dynamical chaos markers, we perform a comprehensive finite-size characterization of the YSYK model. We show that the interaction strength acts as a tunable control parameter interpolating between the SYK$_2$ and SYK$_4$ limits, and introduce a framework enabling direct and quantitative comparison with these benchmark models. In the intermediate regimes, we uncover distinct dynamical regimes marked by partial ergodicity breaking, prethermalization plateaus, and incomplete scrambling. Finally, we propose a feasible optical-cavity implementation of the YSYK model using ultra-cold atoms. Our results establish the YSYK model as a unifying platform connecting single-particle and many-body chaos, paving the way for experimental observation of these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Representational power of selected neural network quantum states in second quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network quantum states emerge as a promising tool for solving quantum many-body problems. However, its successes and limitations are still not well-understood in particular for Fermions with complex sign structures. Based on our recent work [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 21, 10252-10262 (2025)], we generalizes the restricted Boltzmann machine to a more general class of states for Fermions, formed by product of `neurons' and hence will be referred to as neuron product states (NPS). NPS builds correlation in a very different way, compared with the closely related correlator product states (CPS) [H. J. Changlani, et al. Phys. Rev. B, 80, 245116 (2009)], which use full-rank local correlators. In constrast, each correlator in NPS contains long-range correlations across all the sites, with its representational power constrained by the simple function form. We prove that products of such simple nonlocal correlators can approximate any wavefunction arbitrarily well under certain mild conditions on the form of activation functions. In addition, we also provide elementary proofs for the universal approximation capabilities of feedforward neural network (FNN) and neural network backflow (NNBF) in second quantization. Together, these results provide a deeper insight into the neural network representation of many-body wavefunctions in second quantization.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial stress tuning of the anomalous Hall effect in Mn3Ge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tunable electronic properties in magnetic materials lead to novel physical phenomena that have the potential to be exploited in the design of new spintronic devices. Here, we report the effect of uniaxial stress on the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the hexagonal frustrated antiferromagnetic Heusler compound Mn3Ge. Our x-ray diffraction results show that the c/a ratio varies linearly with strain when stress is applied along the a axis, as well as a significantly higher Young's modulus along the c direction. The linear behavior of the c/a ratio under uniaxial stress mirrors that seen under hydrostatic pressure up to 1.8 GPa, but results in a characteristically different behavior of the AHE. Stress applied along the a axis induces a distortion in the ab plane, smoothing the abrupt jump in the AHE signal at zero magnetic field. In contrast, stress applied along the c axis has little effect, presumably due to the higher Young's modulus. We argue that this is due to pronounced changes in magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Nodal Gap in a Doped Spin-1/2 Antiferromagnetic Mott Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many emergent phenomena appear in doped Mott insulators near the insulator-to-metal transition. In high-temperature cuprate superconductors, superconductivity arises when antiferromagnetic (AFM) order is gradually suppressed by carrier doping, and a $\textit{d}$-wave superconducting gap forms when an enigmatic nodal gap evolves into a point node. Here, we examine electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$, the 5$\textit{d}$-electron counterpart of cuprates, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. At low doping levels, we observe the formation of electronic states near the Fermi level, accompanied by a gap at the AFM zone boundary, mimicking the AFM gap in electron-doped cuprates. With increasing doping, a distinct gap emerges along the (0,0)-($\pi$,$\pi$) nodal direction, paralleling that observed in hole-doped cuprates. This anomalous nodal gap persists after the collapse of the AFM gap and gradually decreases with further doping. It eventually vanishes into a point node of the reported $\textit{d}$-wave gap. These observations replicate the characteristic features in both electron- and hole-doped cuprates, indicating a unified route toward nodal metallicity in doped spin-1/2 AFM Mott insulators.</description>

Abstract: The Mott insulator a-RuCl3, featuring the intertwined interplay of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Kitaev spin correlations, provides an unparalleled platform for probing quantum many-body physics. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we compare temperature-dependent dI/dV spectra between in-situ grown monolayers and exfoliated bulk samples. Both systems exhibit pronounced Mott gap softening near 110 K, manifested by spectral weight transfer from Hubbard bands toward the Fermi level, resulting in low-energy correlated charge delocalization. Although this gap softening coincides with Kitaev paramagnetic and structural phase transitions in bulk crystals, monolayer studies provide compelling insights. By eliminating structural phase transition in monolayer sample, we suggest that spin correlations, rather than Coulomb interactions alone, may govern charge dynamics within the Mott-Hubbard framework, challenging conventional Mott-Hubbard paradigms. These results resolve a long-standing controversy regarding the Mott gap magnitude in a-RuCl3 and experimentally confirm the critical role of spin correlations in Mott physics.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning of many-body electronic correlation entropy from local measurements</title>

Abstract: The characterization of quantum correlations in many-body systems is instrumental to understanding the nature of emergent phenomena in quantum materials. The correlation entropy serves as a key metric for assessing the complexity of a quantum many-body state in interacting electronic systems. However, its determination requires the measurement of all single-particle correlators across a macroscopic sample, which can be impractical. Machine learning methods have been shown to allow learning the correlation entropy from a reduced set of measurements, yet these methods assume that the targeted system is contained in the set of training Hamiltonians. Here we show that a transfer learning strategy enables correlation entropy learning from a reduced set of measurements in families of Hamiltonians never considered in the training set. We demonstrate this transfer learning methodology in a wide variety of interacting models including local and non-local attractive and repulsive many-body interactions, long-range hopping, doping, magnetic field, and spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, we show how this transfer learning methodology allows detecting quantum many-body phases never observed during their training set without prior knowledge about them. Our results demonstrate that correlation entropy learning can be potentially performed experimentally without requiring training in the experimentally realized Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Long-range Entanglement and Role of Realistic Interaction in Braiding of Non-Abelian Quasiholes in Fractional Quantum Hall Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parity conservation dictates that when fusing pairs of Moore-Read (MR) quasiholes, such that each pair of charge-$e/4$ anyon forms a charge-$e/2$ anyon, the parity of the numbers of $1$-anyon and $\psi$-anyon must be conserved within a given system. This idea is illustrated here using the Jack polynomial formalism, which also provides a basis to numerically study the dynamics of MR anyons. In particular, we examine the effect of two-body electron-electron interaction on the degeneracy of two anyon fusion channels, which affects their mutual statistics of the MR anyons. We find that parity conservation gives rise to a long-range ``entanglement" which affect the experimental measurement of exchange statistics under realistic electron interaction. It is therefore important to account for all quasiholes in an experimental systems in order to accurately predict the outcome of a certain measurement. We also show how understanding the quasihole dynamics can help to fine-tune two-body interactions in order to stabilize any given fusion channel in experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is dedicated to the 60-th anniversary of the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics and presents a review of normal and superconducting properties of toroidal, altermagnetic, and noncentrosymmetric metals. Metals with toroidal order are compounds not possessing symmetry in respect of space and time inversion but are symmetric in respect of the product of these operations. An electric current propagating through samples of such a material causes its magnetisation. Superconducting states in toroidal metals are a mixture of singlet and triplet states. Superconductivity is gapless even in ideal crystals without impurities. Altermagnets are antiferromagnetic metals that have a specific spin splitting of electron bands determined by time inversion in combinations with rotations and reflections of a crystal lattice. Similar splitting takes place in metals whose symmetry does not have a spatial inversion operation. Both of these types of materials have an anomalous Hall effect. A current propagating through a noncentrosymmetric metal causes magnetization, but this is not the case in altermagnets. On the other hand, in altermagnets, there is a specific piezomagnetic Hall effect. Superconducting pairing in non-centrosymmetric metals occurs between electrons occupying states in one zone, whereas, in altermagnets, we are dealing with interband pairing, which is unfavorable for the formation of a superconducting state.</description>

Abstract: We study the Kitaev model on regular hyperbolic trivalent tilings. Depending on the length $p$ of the elementary polygons, we examine two distinct tri-colorings of the tiling. Using a recent conjecture on the ground-state flux sector, we compute the phase diagram via exact diagonalizations and derive analytical expressions for the effective Hamiltonians in the isolated-dimer limit which are valid for all values of $p$. Our results interpolate between the Euclidean honeycomb lattice and the trivalent Bethe lattice ($p=\infty$) for which we derive the exact solution of the phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>The nexus between negative charge-transfer and reduced on-site Coulomb energy in correlated topological metals</title>

Abstract: The layered $3d$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) CoTe$_2$ and NiTe$_2$ are topological Dirac Type-II metals. Their $d$-bands do not exhibit the expected correlation-induced band narrowing seen in CoO and NiO. We address this conundrum by quantifying the on-site Coulomb energy $U_{dd}$ via single-particle partial density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite using valence band resonant photoemission spectroscopy (PES), and obtain $U_{dd}$ = 3.0 eV/3.7 eV for CoTe$_2$/NiTe$_2$. Charge-transfer (CT) cluster model simulations of the measured core-level PES and x-ray absorption spectra of CoTe$_2$ and CoO validate their contrasting electronic parameters:$U_{dd}$ and CT energy $\Delta$ are (3.0 eV, -2.0 eV) for CoTe$_2$, and (5.0 eV, 4.0 eV) for CoO, respectively. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for CoTe$_2$$&lt;$CoO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in CoTe$_2$ is not due to $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$-count$\sim$1 by CT from ligand to Co site in CoTe$_2$ is due to a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$. Yet, only because $U_{dd}$$&gt;$$\big|\Delta\big|$, CoTe$_{2}$ becomes a topological metal with $p$$\rightarrow$${p}$ type lowest energy excitations. Similarly, we obtain a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ in NiTe$_2$ compared to NiO. The study reveals the nexus between negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ required for setting up the electronic structure framework for achieving topological behavior via band inversion in correlated metals.</description>

      <title>Topological Modes in Monitored Quantum Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Dynamical quantum systems both driven by unitary evolutions and monitored through measurements have proved to be fertile ground for exploring new dynamical quantum matters. While the entanglement structure and symmetry properties of monitored systems have been intensively studied, the role of topology in monitored dynamics is much less explored. In this work, we investigate novel topological phenomena in the monitored dynamics through the lens of free-fermion systems. Free-fermion monitored dynamics were previously shown to be unified with the Anderson localization problem under the Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classification. Guided by this unification, we identify the topological area-law-entangled phases in the former setting through the topological classification of disordered insulators and superconductors in the latter. As examples, we focus on 1+1D free-fermion monitored dynamics in two symmetry classes, DIII and A. We construct quantum circuit models to study different topological area-law phases and their domain walls in the respective symmetry classes. We find that the domain wall between topologically distinct area-law phases hosts dynamical topological modes whose entanglement is protected from being quenched by the measurements in the monitored dynamics. We demonstrate how to manipulate these topological modes by programming the domain-wall dynamics. In particular, for topological modes in class DIII, which behave as unmeasured Majorana modes, we devise a protocol to braid them and study the entanglement generated in the braiding process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13360v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called $R$-parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In most noninteracting quantum systems, the scaling theory of localization predicts one-parameter scaling flow in both ergodic and localized regimes. On the other hand, it is expected that the one-parameter scaling hypothesis breaks down for interacting systems that exhibit the many-body ergodicity breaking transition. Here we introduce a scaling theory of fading ergodicity, which is a precursor regime of many-body ergodicity breaking. We argue that the two-parameter scaling governs the entire ergodic regime; however, (i) it evolves into the one-parameter scaling at the ergodicity breaking critical point with the critical exponent $\nu=1$, and (ii) it gives rise to the resilient one-parameter scaling close to the ETH point. Our theoretical framework may serve as a building block for two-parameter scaling theories of many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one of the simplest integrable two-dimensional quantum field theories with a boundary: $N$ free non-compact scalars in the bulk, constrained non-linearly on the boundary to lie on an $(N-1)$-sphere of radius $1/\sqrt{g}$. The $N=1$ case reduces to the single-channel Kondo problem, for $N=2$ the model describes dissipative Coulomb charging in quantum dots, and larger $N$ is analogous to higher-spin impurity or multi-channel scenarios. Adding a boundary magnetic field -- a linear boundary coupling to the scalars -- enriches the model's structure while preserving integrability. Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov (2004) conjectured an expansion for the boundary free energy on the infinite half-cylinder in powers of the magnetic field. Using large-$N$ saddle-point techniques, we confirm their conjecture to next-to-leading order in $1/N$. Renormalization of the subleading solution turns out to be highly instructive, and we connect it to the RG running of $g$ studied by Giombi and Khanchandani (2020).</description>

      <title>Secret communication games and a hierarchy of quasiparticle statistics in 3 + 1D topological phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a family of secret communication challenge games naturally define a hierarchy of emergent quasiparticle statistics in three-dimensional (3D) topological phases. The winning strategies exploit a special class of the recently proposed $R$-paraparticles to allow nonlocal secret communication between the two participating players. We first give a high-level, axiomatic description of emergent $R$-paraparticles, and show that any physical system hosting such particles admits a winning strategy. We then analyze the games using the categorical description of topological phases (where point-like excitations in 3D are described by symmetric fusion categories), and show that only $R$-paraparticles can win the 3D challenge in a noise-robust way, and the winning strategy is essentially unique. This analysis associates emergent $R$-paraparticles to deconfined gauge theories based on an exotic class of finite groups. Thus, even though this special class of $R$-paraparticles are fermions or bosons under the categorical classification, their exchange statistics can still have nontrivial physical consequences in the presence of appropriate defects, and the $R$-paraparticle language offers a more convenient description of the winning strategies. Finally, while a subclass of non-Abelian anyons can win the game in 2D, we introduce twisted variants that exclude anyons, thereby singling out $R$-paraparticles in 2D as well. Our results establish the secret communication challenge as a versatile diagnostic for both identifying and classifying exotic exchange statistics in topological quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider interacting paraparticle chains with a constant $R$-matrix where the Hamiltonian sums over the internal degrees (flavors) of the paraparticles. For such flavor-blind Hamiltonians we show a general factorization of the Hilbert space into occupation and flavor parts with the Hamiltonian acting non-trivially only on the former. For open boundaries, the spectrum therefore coincides with that of the occupation Hamiltonian $H_{\rm occ}$ with the flavor part merely adding degeneracies. For periodic boundaries, a cyclic reordering of the flavors leads to a separation of $H_{\rm occ}$ into flux sectors at fixed particle number, thus making the parastatistics directly observable in the energy spectrum. For important exemplary cases, $H_{\rm occ}$ reduces to the XXZ chain with flux allowing for an exact solution. In the gapless regime, this solution shows flux-shifted $c=1$ conformal towers in the low-energy spectrum and a temperature-dependent chemical potential in the bulk thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infinite-layer nickelates are among the most promising cuprate-akin superconductors, although relevant differences from copper oxides have been reported. Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics, except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy, shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites, which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that infinite layer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce an ansatz for continuous matrix product operators for quantum field theory. We show that (i) they admit a closed-form expression in terms of finite number of matrix-valued functions without reference to any lattice parameter; (ii) they are obtained as a suitable continuum limit of matrix product operators; (iii) they preserve the entanglement area law directly in the continuum, and in particular they map continuous matrix product states (cMPS) to another cMPS. As an application, we use this ansatz to construct several families of continuous matrix product unitaries beyond quantum cellular automata.</description>
