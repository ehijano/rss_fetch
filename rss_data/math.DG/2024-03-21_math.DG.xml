      <title>The Riemannian Penrose Inequality with Matter Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Riemannian Penrose Inequalities are precise geometric statements that imply that the total mass of a zero second fundamental form slice of a spacetime is at least the mass contributed by the black holes, assuming that the spacetime has nonnegative matter density everywhere. In this paper, we remove this last assumption, and prove stronger statements that the total mass is at least the mass contributed by the black holes, plus a contribution coming from the matter density along the slice.
  We use the first author's conformal flow to achieve this, combined with Stern's harmonic level set techniques in the first case, and spinors in the second case. We then compare these new results to results previously known from Huisken-Ilmanen's inverse mean curvature flow techniques.</description>

      <title>Lie groupoid Riemann-Roch-Hirzebruch theorem and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Lie algebroid is a generalization of Lie algebra that provides a general framework to describe the symmetries of a manifold. In this paper, we introduce Lie algebroid index theory and study the Lie algebroid Dolbeault operator. We also introduce Connes' index theory on regular foliated manifolds to obtain a generalized Riemann-Roch theorem on manifolds with regular foliation. We show that the topological side of Connes' index theory can be identified with the topological side of Lie algebroid index theory. Finally, we introduce Lie algebroid Kodaira vanishing theorem, and provide some applications and examples. The Lie algebroid Kodaira vanishing theorem can be used on the analytic side of Connes' theorem to attest to the criterion of a positive line bundle from its topological information.</description>

      <title>Isothermic nets with spherical parameter lines from discrete holomorphic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that all discrete isothermic nets with a family of planar or spherical lines of curvature can be obtained from special discrete holomorphic maps via lifted-folding. This novel approach is a generalization and discretization of a classical method to create planar curvature lines on smooth surfaces. In particular, this technique provides an efficient way to construct discrete isothermic topological tori composed of fundamental pieces from discrete periodic holomorphic maps.</description>

      <title>Solution of the Bj\"orling problem by discrete approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bj\"orling problem amounts to the construction of a minimal surface from a real-analytic curve with a given real-analytic normal vector field. We approximate that solution locally by discrete minimal surfaces as special discrete isothermic surfaces (as defined by Bobenko and Pinkall in 1996). The main step in our construction is the approximation of the sought surface's Weierstrass data by discrete conformal maps. We prove that the approximation error is of the order of the square of the mesh size.</description>

      <title>Upper bound for Steklov eigenvalues of warped products with fiber of dimension 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the Steklov spectrum of the warped product $[0,L]\times_h \Sigma$ equipped with the metric $dt^2+h(t)^2g_\Sigma$, where $\Sigma$ is a compact surface. We find sharp upper bounds for the Steklov eigenvalues in terms of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on $\Sigma$. We apply our method to the case of metric of revolution on the 3-dimensional ball and we obtain a sharp estimate on the spectral gap between two consecutive Steklov eigenvalues.</description>

Abstract: We study the geometry of hyperconvex representations of hyperbolic groups in ${\rm PSL}(d,\mathbb{C})$ and establish two structural results: a group admitting a hyperconvex representation is virtually isomorphic to a Kleinian group, and its hyperconvex limit set in the appropriate flag manifold has Hausdorff dimension strictly smaller than $2$.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection on noncommutative differential forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine Hilbert module and algebraic techniques to give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an Hermitian torsion-free connection on the bimodule of differential one-forms of a first order differential calculus. In the presence of the extra structure of a bimodule connection, we give sufficient conditions for uniqueness. We prove that any $\theta$-deformation of a compact Riemannian manifold admits a unique Hermitian torsion-free bimodule connection and provide an explicit construction of it. Specialising to classical Riemannian manifolds yields a novel construction of the Levi-Civita connection on the cotangent bundle.</description>

      <title>Higher Complex Structures and Flat Connections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2005.14445v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2018, Vladimir Fock and the author introduced a geometric structure on surfaces, called higher complex structure, whose moduli space shares several properties with Hitchin's component. In this paper, we establish various links between flat connections and higher complex structures.
  In particular, we study a certain class of connections on a bundle equipped with a line subbundle $L$, which we call $L$-parabolic. These connections are almost flat, and allow a local standard form. A certain family of $L$-parabolic connections is parametrized by the data of a higher complex structure and a cotangent variation. The family of connections being flat implies the compatibility condition of the cotangent variation. Higher diffeomorphisms are realized by the gauge transformation induced by changing $L$. Constructing flat families of connections of this kind is linked to Toda integrable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01025v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute a lower bound for the scalar curvature of a gradient Einstein soliton under a certain assumption on its potential function. We establish an asymptotic behavior of the potential function on a noncompact gradient shrinking Einstein soliton. As a result, we obtain the finiteness of its fundamental group and its weighted volume. We also prove some geometric and analytic results for constructing gradient Einstein solitons that are realized as warped metrics, and we give a few explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Weighted $\infty$-Willmore Spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the two-sphere $\Sigma$, we consider the problem of minimising among suitable immersions $f \,\colon \Sigma \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3$ the weighted $L^\infty$ norm of the mean curvature $H$, with weighting given by a prescribed ambient function $\xi$, subject to a fixed surface area constraint. We show that, under a low-energy assumption which prevents topological issues from arising, solutions of this problem and also a more general set of ``pseudo-minimiser'' surfaces must satisfy a second-order PDE system obtained as the limit as $p \rightarrow \infty$ of the Euler-Lagrange equations for the approximating $L^p$ problems. This system gives some information about the geometric behaviour of the surfaces, and in particular implies that their mean curvature takes on at most three values: $H \in \{ \pm \vert \vert \xi H \vert \vert_{L^\infty} \}$ away from the nodal set of the PDE system, and $H = 0$ on the nodal set (if it is non-empty).</description>

      <title>Geodesic Equations on asymptotically locally Euclidean K\"ahler manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the geodesic equation in the space of K\"ahler metrics under the setting of asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) K\"ahler manifolds and we prove global $\mathcal{C}^{1,1}$ regularity of the solution. Then, we relate the solution of the geodesic equation to the uniqueness of scalar-flat ALE metrics. To this end, we study the asymptotic behavior of $\varepsilon$-geodesics at spatial infinity. Under the assumption that the Ricci curvature of a reference ALE K\"ahler metric is non-positive, convexity of the Mabuchi $K$-energy along $\varepsilon$-geodesics. However, we will also prove that on the line bundle $\mathcal{O}(-k)$ over $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ with $n \geq 2$ and $k \neq n$, no ALE K\"ahler metric can have non-positive (or non-negative) Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>T-Dualities and Courant Algebroid Relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to T-duality based on Courant algebroid relations which subsumes the usual T-duality as well as its various generalisations. Starting from a relational description for the reduction of exact Courant algebroids over foliated manifolds, we introduce a weakened notion of generalised isometries that captures the generalised geometry counterpart of Riemannian submersions when applied to transverse generalised metrics. This is used to construct T-dual backgrounds as generalised metrics on reduced Courant algebroids which are related by a generalised isometry. We prove an existence and uniqueness result for generalised isometric exact Courant algebroids coming from reductions. We demonstrate that our construction reproduces standard T-duality relations based on correspondence spaces. We also describe how it applies to generalised T-duality transformations of almost para-Hermitian manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a closed connected oriented (possibly non-spin) smooth four-dimensional manifold with scalar curvature bounded below by $n(n-1)$. In this paper, we prove that if $f$ is a smooth map of non-zero degree from $(M, g)$ to the unit four-sphere, then $f$ is an isometry. Following ideas of Gromov, we use $\mu$-bubbles and a version with coefficients of the rigidity of the three-sphere to rule out the case of strict inequality. Our proof of rigidity is based on the harmonic map heat flow coupled with the Ricci flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.02679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a correspondence between the group of symplectic diffeomorphisms of a 4-dimensional real torus and the vanishing locus of a certain hyperK\"ahler moment map. This observation gives rise to a new flow, called the modified moment map flow. The construction can be adapted to the polyhedral setting, for which we prove a Duistermaat type theorem. This paper lays out the ground work for some effective polyhedral symplectic geometry and for a potential Morse-Bott theory, with applications to the topology of the space of symplectic maps of the 4-torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elastic energy of a bending-resistant interface depends both on its geometry and its material composition. We consider such a heterogeneous interface in the plane, modeled by a curve equipped with an additional density function. The resulting energy captures the complex interplay between curvature and density effects, resembling the Canham-Helfrich functional. We describe the curve by its inclination angle, so that the equilibrium equations reduce to an elliptic system of second order. After a brief variational discussion, we investigate the associated nonlocal $L^2$-gradient flow evolution, a coupled quasilinear parabolic problem. We analyze the (non)preservation of quantities such as convexity, positivity, and symmetry, as well as the asymptotic behavior of the system. The results are illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>K-stability and large complex structure limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss how, under suitable assumptions, a K\"ahler test configuration admits a mirror Landau-Ginzburg model, giving a corresponding expression for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant as a residue pairing. We study the general behaviour of such mirror formulae under large scaling of the K\"ahler form. We exploit the observation that this scaling trivially preserves $K$-stability, but takes the mirror Landau-Ginzburg model to a large complex structure limit. In certain cases the mirror formulae for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant simplify in this limit. We focus on a special type of limiting behaviour, when the Donaldson-Futaki invariant concentrates at a single critical point of the Landau-Ginzburg potential, and show that this leads to new formulae for the Donaldson-Futaki invariant in terms of theta functions on the mirror. We provide a main application, which shows that such limiting behaviour actually occurs for test configurations in several nontrivial examples, both toric and non-toric, in the case of slope (in)stability for polarised surfaces.</description>
