      <title>A Global Systems Perspective on Food Demand, Deforestation and Agricultural Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feeding a larger and wealthier global population without transgressing ecological limits is increasingly challenging, as rising food demand (especially for animal products) intensifies pressure on ecosystems, accelerates deforestation, and erodes biodiversity and soil health. We develop a stylized, spatially explicit global model that links exogenous food-demand trajectories to crop and livestock production, land conversion, and feedbacks from ecosystem integrity that, in turn, shape future yields and land needs. Calibrated to post-1960 trends in population, income, yields, input use, and land use, the model reproduces the joint rise of crop and meat demand and the associated expansion and intensification of agriculture. We use it to compare business-as-usual, supply-side, demand-side, and mixed-policy scenarios. Three results stand out. First, productivity-oriented supply-side measures (e.g. reduced chemical inputs, organic conversion, lower livestock density) often trigger compensatory land expansion that undermines ecological gains-so that supply-side action alone cannot halt deforestation or widespread degradation. Second, demand-side change, particularly reduced meat consumption, consistently relieves both intensification and expansion pressures; in our simulations, only substantial demand reductions (on the order of 40% of projected excess demand by 2100) deliver simultaneous increases in forest area and declines in degraded land. Third, integrated policy portfolios that jointly constrain land conversion, temper input intensification, and curb demand outperform any single lever. Together, these findings clarify the system-level trade-offs that frustrate piecemeal interventions and identify the policy combinations most likely to keep global food provision within ecological limits.</description>

      <title>Strategic Behavior in Crowdfunding: Insights from a Large-Scale Online Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines strategic behavior in crowdfunding using a large-scale online experiment. Building on the model of Arieli et. al 2023, we test predictions about risk aversion (i.e., opting out despite seeing a positive private signal) and mutual insurance (i.e., opting in despite seeing a negative private signal) in a static, single-shot crowdfunding game, focusing on informational incentives rather than dynamic effects. Our results validate key theoretical predictions: crowdfunding mechanisms induce distinct strategic behaviors compared to voting, where participants are more likely to follow private signals (odds ratio: 0.139, $p &lt; 0.001$). Additionally, the study demonstrates that higher signal accuracy (85\% vs. 55\%) decreases risk aversion (odds ratio: 0.414, $p = 0.024$) but increases reliance on mutual insurance (odds ratio: 2.532, $p = 0.026$). However, contrary to theory, increasing the required participation threshold (50\% to 80\%) amplifies risk aversion (odds ratio: 3.251, $p = 0.005$), which, pending further investigation, may indicate cognitive constraints.
  Furthermore, we show that while mutual insurance supports participation, it may hinder information aggregation, particularly as signal accuracy increases. These findings advance crowdfunding theory by confirming the impact of informational incentives and identifying behavioral deviations that challenge standard models, offering insights for platform design and mechanism refinement.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Medicaid Coverage on Mental Health, Why Insurance Makes People Happier in OHIE: by Spending Less or by Spending More?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (OHIE) offers a unique opportunity to examine the causal relationship between Medicaid coverage and happiness among low-income adults, using an experimental design. This study leverages data from comprehensive surveys conducted at 0 and 12 months post-treatment. Previous studies based on OHIE have shown that individuals receiving Medicaid exhibited a significant improvement in mental health compared to those who did not receive coverage. The primary objective is to explore how Medicaid coverage impacts happiness, specifically analyzing in which direction variations in healthcare spending significantly improve mental health: higher spending or lower spending after Medicaid. Utilizing instrumental variable (IV) regression, I conducted six separate regressions across subgroups categorized by expenditure levels and happiness ratings, and the results reveal distinct patterns. Enrolling in OHP has significantly decreased the probability of experiencing unhappiness, regardless of whether individuals had high or low medical spending. Additionally, it decreased the probability of being pretty happy and having high medical expenses, while increasing the probability among those with lower expenses. Concerning the probability of being very happy, the OHP only had a positive effect on being very happy and spending less, and its effect on those with high expenses was insignificant. These findings align with the benefit of Medicaid: alleviating financial burden, contributing to the well-being of distinct subgroups.</description>

      <title>Ranking Policies Under Loss Aversion and Inequality Aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong empirical evidence from laboratory experiments, and more recently from population surveys, shows that individuals, when evaluating their situations, pay attention to whether they experience gains or losses, with losses weighing more heavily than gains. The electorate's loss aversion, in turn, influences politicians' choices. We propose a new framework for welfare analysis of policy outcomes that, in addition to the traditional focus on post-policy incomes, also accounts for individuals' gains and losses resulting from policies. We develop several bivariate stochastic dominance criteria for ranking policy outcomes that are sensitive to features of the joint distribution of individuals' income changes and absolute incomes. The main social objective assumes that individuals are loss averse with respect to income gains and losses, inequality averse with respect to absolute incomes, and hold varying preferences regarding the association between incomes and income changes. We translate these and other preferences into functional inequalities that can be tested using sample data. The concepts and methods are illustrated using data from an income support experiment conducted in Connecticut.</description>

      <title>From tug-of-war to Brownian Boost: explicit ODE solutions for player-funded stochastic-differential games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brownian Boost is a one-parameter family of stochastic differential games played on the real line in which players spend at rates of their choosing in an ongoing effort to influence the drift of a randomly diffusing point particle~$X$. One or other player is rewarded, at time infinity, according to whether~$X$ tends to plus or minus infinity. Each player's net receipt is the final reward (only for the victor) minus the player's total spend. We characterise and explicitly compute the time-homogeneous Markov-perfect Nash equilibria of Brownian Boost, finding the derivatives of the players' expected payoffs to solve a pair of coupled first-order non-linear ODE. Brownian Boost is a high-noise limit of a two-dimensional family of player-funded tug-of-war games, one of which was studied in~\cite{LostPennies}. We analyse the discrete games, finding them, and Brownian Boost, to exemplify key features studied in the economics literature of tug-of-war initiated by~\cite{HarrisVickers87}: a battlefield region where players spend heavily;
  stakes that decay rapidly but asymmetrically in distance to the battlefield; and an effect of discouragement that makes equilibria fragile under asymmetric perturbation of incentive.
  Tug-of-war has a parallel mathematical literature derived from~\cite{PSSW09}, which solved the scaled fair-coin game in a Euclidean domain via the infinity Laplacian PDE. By offering an analytic solution to Brownian Boost, a game that models strategic interaction and resource allocation, we seek to build a bridge between the two tug-of-war literatures.</description>
