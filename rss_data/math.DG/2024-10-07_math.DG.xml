      <title>Rigidity of singular de-Sitter tori with respect to their lightlike bi-foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a natural notion of constant curvature Lorentzian surfaces with conical singularities, and provide a large class of examples of such structures. We moreover initiate the study of their global rigidity, by proving that de-Sitter tori with a single singularity of a fixed angle are determined by the topological equivalence class of their lightlike bi-foliation. While this result is reminiscent of Troyanov's work on Riemannian surfaces with conical singularities, the rigidity will come from topological dynamics in the Lorentzian case.</description>

      <title>Individuation of 3D perceptual units from neurogeometry of binocular cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the functional architecture of the early stages of three-dimensional vision by extending the neurogeometric sub-Riemannian model for stereo-vision introduced in \cite{BCSZ23}. A new framework for correspondence is introduced that integrates a neural-based algorithm to achieve stereo correspondence locally while, simultaneously, organizing the corresponding points into global perceptual units. The result is an effective scene segmentation. We achieve this using harmonic analysis on the sub-Riemannian structure and show, in a comparison against Riemannian distance, that the sub-Riemannian metric is central to the solution.</description>

      <title>Classification of Horikawa surfaces with T-singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify all projective surfaces with only T-singularities, $K^2=2p_g-4$, and ample canonical class. In this way, we identify all surfaces, smoothable or not, with only T-singularities in the Koll\'ar--Shepherd-Barron--Alexeev (KSBA) moduli space of Horikawa surfaces. We also prove that they are not smoothable when $p_g \geq 10$, except for the Lee-Park (Fintushel-Stern) examples, which we show to have only one deformation type unless $p_g=6$ (in which case they have two). This demonstrates that the challenging Horikawa problem cannot be addressed through complex T-degenerations, and we propose new questions regarding diffeomorphism types based on our classification. Furthermore, the techniques developed in this paper enable us to classify all KSBA surfaces with only T-singularities and $K^2=2p_g-3$, e.g. quintic surfaces and I-surfaces.</description>

      <title>Quasilinear wave equations on Kerr black holes in the full subextremal range $|a|&lt;M$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove global existence, boundedness and decay for small data solutions $\psi$ to a general class of quasilinear wave equations on Kerr black hole backgrounds in the full sub-extremal range $|a|&lt;M$. The method extends our previous [DHRT22], which considered such equations on a wide class of background spacetimes, including Kerr, but restricted in that case to the very slowly rotating regime $|a|\ll M$ (which may be treated simply as a perturbation of Schwarzschild $a=0$). To handle the general $|a|&lt;M$ case, our present proof is based on two ingredients: (i) the linear inhomogeneous estimates on Kerr backgrounds proven in [DRSR16], further refined however in order to gain a derivative in elliptic frequency regimes, and (ii) the existence of appropriate physical space currents satisfying degenerate coercivity properties, but which now must be tailored to a finite number of wave packets defined by suitable frequency projection. The above ingredients can be thought of as adaptations of the two basic ingredients of [DHRT22], exploiting however the peculiarities of the Kerr geometry. The novel frequency decomposition in (ii), inspired by the boundedness arguments of [DR11, DRSR16], is defined using only azimuthal and stationary frequencies, and serves both to separate the superradiant and non-superradiant parts of the solution and to localise trapping to small regions of spacetime. The strengthened (i), on the other hand, allows us to relax the required coercivity properties of our wave-packet dependent currents, so as in particular to accept top order errors provided that they are localised to the elliptic frequency regime. These error terms are analysed with the help of the full Carter separation.</description>

      <title>Rigidity results for initial data sets satisfying the dominant energy condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our work proves rigidity theorems for initial data sets associated with compact smooth spin manifolds with boundary and with compact convex polytopes, subject to the dominant energy condition. For manifolds with smooth boundary, this is based on the solution of a boundary value problem for Dirac operators. For convex polytopes we use approximations by manifolds with smooth boundary.</description>

      <title>A geometric approach to apriori estimates for optimal transport maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key inequality which underpins the regularity theory of optimal transport for costs satisfying the Ma--Trudinger--Wang condition is the Pogorelov second derivative bound. This translates to an apriori interior $C^1$ estimate for smooth optimal maps. Here we give a new derivation of this estimate which relies in part on Kim, McCann and Warren's observation that the graph of an optimal map becomes a volume maximizing spacelike submanifold when the product of the source and target domains is endowed with a suitable pseudo-Riemannian geometry that combines both the marginal densities and the cost.</description>

      <title>An analytic invariant of G_2 manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:1505.02734v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the moduli space of holonomy G_2-metrics on a closed 7-manifold is in general disconnected by presenting a number of explicit examples.
  We detect different connected components of the G_2-moduli space by defining an integer-valued analytic refinement of the nu-invariant, a Z/48-valued defect invariant of G_2-structures on a closed 7-manifold introduced by the first and third authors. The refined invariant is defined using eta invariants and Mathai-Quillen currents on the 7-manifold and we compute it for twisted connected sums \`a la Kovalev, Corti-Haskins-Nordstr\"om-Pacini and extra-twisted connected sums as constructed by the second and third authors. In particular, we find examples of G_2-holonomy metrics in different components of the moduli space where the associated G_2-structures are homotopic and other examples where they are not.</description>

      <title>Quasilinear wave equations on asymptotically flat spacetimes with applications to Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove global existence and decay for small-data solutions to a class of quasilinear wave equations on a wide variety of asymptotically flat spacetime backgrounds, allowing in particular for the presence of horizons, ergoregions and trapped null geodesics, and including as a special case the Schwarzschild and very slowly rotating $\vert a \vert \ll M$ Kerr family of black holes in general relativity. There are two distinguishing aspects of our approach. The first aspect is its dyadically localised nature: The nontrivial part of the analysis is reduced entirely to time-translation invariant $r^p$-weighted estimates, in the spirit of [DR09], to be applied on dyadic time-slabs which for large $r$ are outgoing. Global existence and decay then both immediately follow by elementary iteration on consecutive such time-slabs, without further global bootstrap. The second, and more fundamental, aspect is our direct use of a "blackbox" linear inhomogeneous energy estimate on exactly stationary metrics, together with a novel but elementary physical space top order identity that need not capture the structure of trapping and is robust to perturbation. In the specific example of Kerr black holes, the required linear inhomogeneous estimate can then be quoted directly from the literature [DRSR16], while the additional top order physical space identity can be shown easily in many cases (we include in the Appendix a proof for the Kerr case $\vert a \vert \ll M$, which can in fact be understood in this context simply as a perturbation of Schwarzschild). In particular, the approach circumvents the need either for producing a purely physical space identity capturing trapping or for a careful analysis of the commutation properties of frequency projections with the wave operator of time-dependent metrics.</description>
