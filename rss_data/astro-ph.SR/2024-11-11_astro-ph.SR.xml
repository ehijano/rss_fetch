      <title>Sites of Planet Formation in Binary Systems. II. Double the Disks in DF Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the latest results of our ALMA program to study circumstellar disk characteristics as a function of orbital and stellar properties in a sample of young binary star systems known to host at least one disk. Optical and infrared observations of the eccentric, ~48-year period binary DF Tau indicated the presence of only one disk around the brighter component. However, our 1.3 mm ALMA thermal continuum maps show two nearly-equal brightness components in this system. We present these observations within the context of updated stellar and orbital properties which indicate that the inner disk of the secondary is absent. Because the two stars likely formed together, with the same composition, in the same environment, and at the same time, we expect their disks to be co-eval. However the absence of an inner disk around the secondary suggests uneven dissipation. We consider several processes which have the potential to accelerate inner disk evolution. Rapid inner disk dissipation has important implications for planet formation, particularly in the terrestrial-planet-forming region.</description>

      <title>A simple model for spectroscopic analyses of active stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic analyses of young late-type stars suffer from systematic inaccuracies, typically under-estimating metallicities but over-estimating abundances of certain elements including oxygen and barium. Effects are stronger in younger and cooler stars, and recent evidence specifically indicates a connection to the level of chromospheric activity. We present here a two-component spectroscopic model representing a non-magnetic baseline plus a magnetic spot, and analyse the resulting synthetic spectra of young solar analogues using a standard spectroscopic technique. For a moderately active star with solar parameters and chromospheric activity index log R'_HK = -4.3 (~100 Myr), we predict that [Fe/H] is underestimated by 0.06 dex while v_mic is overestimated by 0.2 km/s; for higher activity levels we predict effects as large as 0.2 dex and 0.7 km/s. Predictions are in agreement with literature data on solar twins, and indicate that the model is a plausible explanation to the observed effects. The model is simple enough that it can be included in spectroscopic packages with only changes to the underlying spectrum synthesis modules, if a log R'_HK value is provided.</description>

      <title>HD 34736: An intensely magnetised double-lined spectroscopic binary with rapidly-rotating chemically peculiar B-type components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of a comprehensive study of the spectroscopic binary (SB2) system HD 34736 hosting two chemically peculiar (CP) late B-type stars. Using new and archival observational data, we characterise the system and its components, including their rotation and magnetic fields. Fitting of the radial velocities yields $P_\mathrm{orb}=83.\!^\mathrm{d}219(3)$ and $e=0.8103(3)$. The primary component is a CP He-wk star with $T_{\mathrm{eff}A}=13000\pm500$ K and $\upsilon_\mathrm{e}\sin i\;=75\pm3$ km/s, while the secondary exhibits variability of Mg and Si lines, and has $T_{\mathrm{eff}B}=11500\pm1000$ K and $\upsilon_\mathrm{e}\sin i=110$-180 km/s. TESS and KELT photometry reveal clear variability of the primary component with a rotational period $P_{\mathrm{rot}A}=1.\!^\mathrm{d}279\,988\,5(11)$, which is lengthening at a rate of $1.26(6)$ s/yr. For the secondary, $P_{\mathrm{rot}B}=0.\!^\mathrm{d}522\,693\,8(5)$, reducing at a rate of $-0.14(3)$ s/yr. The longitudinal component $\langle B_\mathrm{z}\rangle$ of the primary's strongly asymmetric global magnetic field varies from $-6$ to +5 kG. Weak spectropolarimetric evidence of a magnetic field is found for the secondary star. The observed X-ray and radio emission of HD 34736 may equally be linked to a suspected T Tau-like companion or magnetospheric emission from the principal components. Given the presence of a possible third magnetically active body, one can propose that the magnetic characteristics of the protostellar environment may be connected to the formation of such systems.</description>

      <title>A photometric and spectroscopic study of eight semi-detached eclipsing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By cross-matching the eclipsing binary catalog from TESS with that from LAMOST MRS, semi-detached eclipsing binaries with radial velocities coverage spanning more than 0.3 phases were authenticated. The absolute parameters for these systems were determined by simultaneous modeling of light curves and radial velocities using the Wilson-Devinney program. Additionally, the secular orbital variations were further analyzed using O-C curves. Eight semi-detached eclipsing binaries have been identified. Among them, seven feature primary stars situated within the main-sequence band, while their secondaries are all in evolved stages. This suggests that these systems likely originated as detached binaries and have undergone a reversal of the mass ratio. However, TIC 428257299 is an exception where the primary is Roche lobe-filling, and its secondary has experienced mass loss events. Additionally, TIC 8677671 and TIC 318217844 demonstrate secular cyclical changes of orbital periods. Specifically, for TIC 8677671, the cyclical change could result from magnetic activity or a third body which is likely to be compact, with a mass of at least 2.97 M$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Solving the mystery of extreme light variability in the massive eccentric system MACHO 80.7443.1718</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of massive stars is heavily influenced by their binarity, and the massive eccentric binary system MACHO 80.7443.1718 (ExtEV) serves as a prime example. This study explores whether the light variability of ExtEV, observed near the periastron during its 32.8-day orbit, can be explained by a wind-wind collision (WWC) model and reviews other potential explanations. Using broadband photometry, TESS data, ground-based $UBV$ time-series photometry, and high-resolution spectroscopy, we analysed the system's parameters. We ruled out the presence of a Keplerian disk and periodic Roche-lobe overflow. Our analysis suggests the primary component has a radius of about $30\,{\rm R}_\odot$, luminosity of $\sim6.6\times10^5\,{\rm L}_\odot$, and mass between $25$ and $45\,{\rm M}_\odot$, with a high wind mass-loss rate of $4.5\times10^{-5}\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, likely enhanced by tidal interactions, rotation, and tidally excited oscillations. We successfully modelled ExtEV's light curve, identifying atmospheric eclipse and light scattering in the WWC cone as key contributors. The system's mass-loss rate exceeds theoretical predictions, indicating that ExtEV is in a rare evolutionary phase, offering insights into enhanced mass loss in massive binary systems.</description>

      <title>Examining the rotation of the planet-hosting M dwarf GJ 3942</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on radial velocities, EXORAP photometry, and activity indicators, the HADES team reported a 16.3-day rotation period for the M dwarf GJ 3992. However, an RV--H$\alpha$ magnitude-squared coherence estimate has significant peaks at frequencies 1/16 cycles/day and 1/32 cycles/day. We re-analyze HADES data plus Hipparcos, SuperWASP, and TESS photometry to see whether the rotation period could be 32 days with 16-day harmonic. SuperWASP shows no significant periodicities, while the Hipparcos observing cadence is suboptimal for detecting 16- and 32-day periodicities. Although the average TESS periodogram has peaks at harmonics of 1/16 cycles/day, the harmonic sequence is not fully resolved according to the Rayleigh criterion. The TESS observations suggest a 1/16 cycles/day rotation frequency and a 1/32 cycles/day subharmonic, though resolution makes the TESS rotation detection ambiguous.</description>

      <title>The robustness of inferred envelope and core rotation rates of red-giant stars from asteroseismology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotation is an important, yet poorly-modelled phenomenon of stellar structure and evolution. Accurate estimates of internal rotation rates are therefore valuable for constraining stellar evolution models. We aim to assess the accuracy of asteroseismic estimates of internal rotation rates and how these depend on the fundamental stellar parameters. We apply the recently-developed method called extended-MOLA inversions to infer localised estimates of internal rotation rates of synthetic observations of red giants. We search for suitable reference stellar models following a grid-based approach, and assess the robustness of the resulting inferences to the choice of reference model. We find that matching the mixed mode pattern between the observation and the reference model is an important criterion to select suitable reference models. We propose to i) select a set of reference models based on the correlation between the observed rotational splittings and the mode-trapping parameter ii) compute rotation rates for all these models iii) use the mean value obtained across the whole set as the estimate of the internal rotation rates. We find that the effect of a near surface perturbation in the synthetic observations on the rotation rates estimated based on the correlation between the observed rotational splittings and the mode-trapping parameter is negligible. We conclude that when using an ensemble of reference models, constructed based on matching the mixed mode pattern, the input rotation rates can be recovered across a range of fundamental stellar parameters like mass, mixing-length parameter and composition. Further, red-giant rotation rates determined in this way are also independent of a near surface perturbation of stellar structure.</description>

      <title>On the magnetic and thermodynamic properties of dark fibrils in the chromosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fibrillar structures are ubiquitous in the solar chromosphere and their potential for mediating the mass and energy transport in the solar atmosphere is undeniable. An accurate determination of their properties requires the use of advanced high-resolution observations which are now becoming broadly available from different observatories. We exploit the capabilities of multi-atom, multi-line spectropolarimetric inversions using the Stockholm Inversion Code (STiC). Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium inversions of a fibril-rich area are performed using spectropolarimetric observations in the Ca II 854.2 nm line obtained with the CRISP imaging spectropolarimeter and spectroscopic observations in the Ca II H line obtained with the CHROMospheric Imaging Spectrometer (CHROMIS) at the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope (SST). Additionally, coobservations in the Mg II h &amp; k lines obtained with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) are used in the inversions to better constrain the thermodynamic properties of the fibrils. The incorporation of multiple atomic species and spectral lines proves to better constrain the properties of the plasma constituting the fibrils. In particular, the tracing of a large number of fibrils allowed for the study of the variation of the temperature and magnetic field along their projected length over the field of view. The results provide a view of fibrils possessing hot footpoints of about 5 900 K. The temperature drop away from the footpoints is on average 250 K, with a larger drop of around 500 K for the longer fibrils. The magnetic field is also reported to be larger at the footpoints, being almost twice as large as the minimum value reported at the middle point of the fibrils.</description>

      <title>The rush to the poles and the role of magnetic buoyancy in the solar dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The butterfly diagram of the solar cycle exhibits a poleward migration of the diffuse magnetic field resulting from the decay of trailing sunspots. It is one component of what is sometimes referred to as the "rush to the poles". We investigate under which conditions the rush to the poles can be reproduced in flux-transport Babcock-Leighton dynamo models. We identify three main ways to reproduce it: a flux emergence probability that decreases rapidly with latitude; a threshold in subsurface toroidal field strength between slow and fast emergence; and an emergence rate based on magnetic buoyancy. We find that all three mechanisms lead to solar-like butterfly diagrams, but which present notable differences between them. The shape of the butterfly diagram is very sensitive to model parameters for the threshold prescription, while most models incorporating magnetic buoyancy converge to very similar butterfly diagrams, with butterfly wings widths of $\lesssim\pm 30^\circ$, in very good agreement with observations. With turbulent diffusivities above $35~\text{km}^2/\text{s}$ but below about $40~\text{km}^2/\text{s}$, buoyancy models are strikingly solar-like. The threshold and magnetic buoyancy prescriptions make the models non-linear and as such can saturate the dynamo through latitudinal quenching. The period of the models involving buoyancy is independent of the source term amplitude, but emergence loss increases it by $\simeq 60\%$. For the rush to the poles to be visible, a mechanism suppressing (enhancing) emergences at high (low) latitudes must operate. It is not sufficient that the toroidal field be stored at low latitudes for emergences to be limited to low latitudes. From these models we infer that the Sun is not in the advection-dominated regime, but also not in the diffusion-dominated regime. The cycle period is set through a balance between advection, diffusion and flux emergence.</description>

      <title>Search for Axions from Magnetic White Dwarfs with Chandra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low mass axion-like particles could be produced in abundance within the cores of hot, compact magnetic white dwarf (MWD) stars from electron bremsstrahlung and converted to detectable X-rays in the strong magnetic fields surrounding these systems. In this work, we constrain the existence of such axions from two dedicated Chandra X-ray observations of $\sim$40 ks each in the energy range $\sim$1 - 10 keV towards the magnetic white dwarfs (MWDs) WD 1859+148 and PG 0945+246. We find no evidence for axions, which constrains the axion-electron times axion-photon coupling to $|g_{a\gamma \gamma} g_{aee}| \lesssim 1.54 \times 10^{-25}$ ($3.54 \times 10^{-25}$) GeV$^{-1}$ for PG 0945+246 (WD 1859+148) at 95% confidence for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-6}$ eV. We find an excess of low-energy X-rays between 1 - 3 keV for WD 1859+148 but determine that the spectral morphology is too soft to arise from axions; instead, the soft X-rays may arise from non-thermal emission in the MWD magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>KMT-2024-BLG-1044L: A sub-Uranus microlensing planet around a host at the star-brown dwarf mass boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analysed microlensing data to uncover the nature of the anomaly that appeared near the peak of the short-timescale microlensing event KMT-2024-BLG-1044. Despite the anomaly's brief duration of less than a day, it was densely observed through high-cadence monitoring conducted by the KMTNet survey. Detailed modelling of the light curve confirmed the planetary origin of the anomaly and revealed two possible solutions, due to an inner--outer degeneracy. The two solutions provide different measured planet parameters: $(s, q)_{\rm inner} = [1.0883 \pm 0.0027, (3.125 \pm 0.248)\times 10^{-4}]$ for the inner solutions and $(s, q)_{\rm outer} = [1.0327 \pm 0.0054, (3.350 \pm 0.316)\times 10^{-4}]$ for the outer solutions. Using Bayesian analysis with constraints provided by the short event timescale ($t_{\rm E} \sim 9.1$~day) and the small angular Einstein radius ($\theta_{\rm E}\sim 0.16$~mas for the inner solution and $\sim 0.10$~mas for the outer solutio), we determined that the lens is a planetary system consisting of a host near the boundary between a star and a brown dwarf and a planet with a mass lower than that of Uranus. The discovery of the planetary system highlights the crucial role of the microlensing technique in detecting planets that orbit substellar brown dwarfs or very low-mass stars.</description>

Abstract: The observational detection of some metastable isomers in the interstellar medium with abundances comparable to those of the most stable isomer, or even when the stable isomer is not detected, highlights the importance of non-equilibrium chemistry. This challenges our understanding of the interstellar chemistry. We present a chemical study of isomers through the sulphur isomer pair HNCS and HSCN, since HSCN has been observed in regions where its stable isomer has not been detected, and the observed HNCS/HSCN ratio seems to significantly vary from cold to warm regions. We have used the Nautilus chemical code to model the formation and destruction paths of HNCS and HSCN in different astrochemical scenarios, and the time evolution of the HNCS/HSCN ratio. We have also analysed the influence of the environmental conditions on their chemical abundances. We present an observational detection of the metastable isomer HSCN in the Class I object B1-a, but not of the stable isomer HNCS, despite HNCS lying 3200 K lower in energy than HSCN. Our results show an HNCS/HSCN ratio sensitive to the gas temperature and the evolutionary time, with the highest values obtained at early stages (t&lt;10^4 yr) and low (Tg&lt;20 K) temperatures. The results suggest a different efficiency of the isomerisation processes depending on the source temperature. The progressive decrease of HNCS/HSCN with gas temperature at early evolutionary times indicates that this ratio may be used as a tracer of cold young objects. This work also demonstrates the key role of grain surface chemistry in the formation of the isomer pair HNCS and HSCN in cold regions, and the importance of the ions H2NCS+ and HNCSH+ in warm/hot regions. Since most of the interstellar regions where HSCN is detected are cold regions, a larger sample including sources characterised by high temperatures are needed to corroborate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Emergence of high-mass stars in complex fiber networks (EMERGE) V. From filaments to spheroids: the origin of the hub-filament systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identified as parsec-size, gas clumps at the junction of multiple filaments, hub-filament systems (HFS) play a crucial role during the formation of young clusters and high-mass stars. These HFS appear nevertheless to be detached from most galactic filaments when compared in the mass-length (M-L) phase-space. We aim to characterize the early evolution of HFS as part of the filamentary description of the interstellar medium. Combining previous scaling relations with new analytic calculations, we created a toy model to explore the different physical regimes described by the M-L diagram. Despite its simplicity, our model accurately reproduces several observational properties reported for filaments and HFS such as their expected typical aspect ratio ($A$), mean surface density ($\Sigma$), and gas accretion rate ($\dot{m}$). Moreover, this model naturally explains the different mass and length regimes populated by filaments and HFS, respectively. Our model predicts a dichotomy between filamentary ($A\geq 3$) and spheroidal ($A&lt;3$) structures connected to the relative importance of their fragmentation, accretion, and collapse timescales. Individual filaments with low accretion rates are dominated by an efficient internal fragmentation. In contrast, the formation of compact HFS at the intersection of filaments triggers a geometric phase-transition leading to the gravitational collapse of these structures at parsec-scales in $\sim$1Myr also inducing higher accretion rates.</description>

      <title>Collisional charging of dust particles by suprathermal plasmas. II -- Regularized Kappa distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of the velocity distribution functions of the plasma particles on the equilibrium charge of dust grains, acquired through inelastic collisions of the particles with the grains. This paper is the second in a series of two papers on the subject. Here, we consider the charging process when the plasma particles are statistically described by the recently proposed regularized Kappa distribution functions, which allow for extreme suprathermal states, characterized by extremely low values of the kappa index, previously forbidden to the standard Kappa distributions, whose effects on dust charging were studied in Paper I of this series. We analyse the effects that extreme suprathermal states of the plasma particles have on dust charging and verify conditions for the uncommon result of positive equilibrium charge, employing two different models for the regularized Kappa distributions.</description>

      <title>Plasma Seismology: Fully Exploiting the Information Contained in Velocity Space of Kinetic Plasmas using the Morrison G Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weakly collisional plasmas contain a wealth of information about the dynamics of the plasma in the particle velocity distribution functions, yet our ability to exploit fully that information remains relatively primitive. Here we aim to present the fundamentals of a new technique denoted Plasma Seismology that aims to invert the information from measurements of the particle velocity distribution functions at a single point in space over time to enable the determination of the electric field variation over an extended spatial region. The fundamental mathematical tool at the heart of this technique is the Morrison $G$ Transform. Using kinetic numerical simulations of Langmuir waves in a Vlasov-Poisson plasma, we demonstrate the application of the standard Morrison $G$ Transform, which uses measurements of the particle velocity distribution function over all space at one time to predict the evolution of the electric field in time. Next, we introduce a modified Morrison $G$ Transform which uses measurements of the particle velocity distribution function at one point in space over time to determine the spatial variation of the electric field over an extended spatial region. We discuss the limitations of this approach, particularly for the numerically challenging case of Langmuir waves. The application of this technique to Alfven waves in a magnetized plasma holds the promise to apply the technique to existing spacecraft particle measurement instrumentation to determine the electric fields over an extended spatial region away from the spacecraft.</description>

      <title>The first catalog of candidate white dwarf-main sequence binaries in open star clusters: A new window into common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Close binary systems are the progenitors to both Type Ia supernovae and the compact object mergers that can be detected via gravitational waves. To achieve a binary with a small radial separation, it is believed that the system likely undergoes common envelope (CE) evolution. Despite its importance, CE evolution may be one of the largest uncertainties in binary evolution due to a combination of computational challenges and a lack of observed benchmarks where both the post-CE and pre-CE conditions are known. Identifying post-CE systems in star clusters can partially circumvent this second issue by providing an independent age constraint on the system. For the first time, we conduct a systematic search for white dwarf (WD) and main-sequence (MS) binary systems in 299 Milky Way open star clusters. Coupling Gaia DR3 photometry and kinematics with multi-band photometry from Pan-STARRS1 and 2MASS, we apply a machine learning based approach and find 52 high-probability candidates in 38 open clusters. For a subset of our systems, we present follow-up spectroscopy from the Gemini and Lick Observatories and archival light curves from TESS, Kepler/K2 and the Zwicky Transient Facility. Examples of M-dwarfs with hot companions are spectroscopically observed, along with regular system variability. While the kinematics of our candidates are consistent with their host clusters, some systems have spatial positions offset relative to their hosts, potentially indicative of natal kicks. Ultimately, this catalogue is a first step to obtaining a set of observational benchmarks to better link post-CE systems to their pre-CE progenitors.</description>

      <title>First Resolution of Microlensed Images of a Binary-Lens Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resolve the multiple images of the binary-lens microlensing event ASASSN-22av using the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The light curves show weak binary perturbations, complicating the analysis, but the joint modeling with the VLTI data breaks several degeneracies, arriving at a strongly favored solution. Thanks to precise measurements of angular Einstein radius \theta_E = 0.724 +/- 0.002 mas and microlens parallax, we determine that the lens system consists of two M dwarfs with masses of M_1 = 0.258 +/- 0.008 M_sun and M_2 = 0.130 +/- 0.007 M_sun, a projected separation of r_\perp = 6.83 +/- 0.31 AU and a distance of D_L = 2.29 +/- 0.08 kpc. The successful VLTI observations of ASASSN-22av open up a new path for studying intermediate-separation (i.e., a few AUs) stellar-mass binaries, including those containing dark compact objects such as neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>New Cold Subdwarf Discoveries from Backyard Worlds and a Metallicity Classification System for T Subdwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the results of a spectroscopic survey of candidate T subdwarfs identified by the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 program. Near-infrared spectra of 31 sources with red $J-W2$ colors and large $J$-band reduced proper motions show varying signatures of subsolar metallicity, including strong collision-induced H$_2$ absorption, obscured methane and water features, and weak K I absorption. These metallicity signatures are supported by spectral model fits and 3D velocities, indicating thick disk and halo population membership for several sources. We identify three new metal-poor T subdwarfs ([M/H] $\lesssim$ $-$0.5), CWISE J062316.19+071505.6, WISEA J152443.14$-$262001.8, and CWISE J211250.11-052925.2; and 19 new "mild" subdwarfs with modest metal deficiency ([M/H] $\lesssim$ $-$0.25). We also identify three metal-rich brown dwarfs with thick disk kinematics. We provide kinematic evidence that the extreme L subdwarf 2MASS J053253.46+824646.5 and the mild T subdwarf CWISE J113010.07+313944.7 may be part of the Thamnos population, while the T subdwarf CWISE J155349.96+693355.2 may be part of the Helmi stream. We define a metallicity classification system for T dwarfs that adds mild subdwarfs (d/sdT), subdwarfs (sdT), and extreme subdwarfs (esdT) to the existing dwarf sequence. We also define a metallicity spectral index that correlates with metallicities inferred from spectral model fits and iron abundances from stellar primaries of benchmark T dwarf companions. This expansion of the T dwarf classification system supports investigations of ancient, metal-poor brown dwarfs now being uncovered in deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>A high resolution simulation of protoplanetary disk turbulence driven by the vertical shear instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A high resolution fourth-order Pad\'e scheme is used to simulate locally isothermal 3D disk turbulence driven by the vertical shear instability (VSI) using 268.4 M points. In the early non-linear period of axisymmetric VSI, angular momentum transport by vertical jets creates correlated N-shaped radial profiles of perturbation vertical and azimuthal velocity. This implies dominance of positive perturbation vertical vorticity layers and a recently discovered angular momentum staircase with respect to radius ($r$). These features are present in 3D in a weaker form. The 3D flow consists of vertically and azimuthally coherent turbulent shear layers containing small vortices with all three vorticity components active. Previously observed large persistent vortices in the interior of the domain driven by the Rossby wave instability are absent. We speculate that this is due to a weaker angular momentum staircase in 3D in the present simulations compared to a previous simulation. The turbulent viscosity parameter $\alpha(r)$ increases linearly with $r$. At intermediate resolution, the value of $\alpha(r)$ at midradius is close to that of a previous simulation. The specific kinetic energy spectrum with respect to radial wavenumber has a power law region with exponent $-1.84$, close to the value $-2$ expected for shear layers. The spectrum with respect to azimuthal wavenumber has a $-5/3$ region and lacks a $-5$ region reported in an earlier study. Finally, it is found that axisymmetric VSI has artifacts at late times, including a very strong angular momentum staircase, which in 3D is present weakly in the disk's upper layers.</description>

      <title>Microlensing Events in Five Years of Photometry from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microlensing has a unique advantage for detecting dark objects in the Milky Way, such as free-floating planets, neutron stars, and stellar-mass black holes. Most microlensing surveys focus on the Galactic bulge, where higher stellar density leads to a higher event rate. However, microlensing events in the Galactic plane have closer lenses and longer timescales, which leads to a greater chance of measuring microlens parallax, providing an additional constraint on the mass of the lens. This work searches for microlensing events in Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 17 from 2018--2023 in the Galactic plane region. We find 124 high-confidence microlensing events and 54 possible events, all available online\footref{online_resources}. Thus, with two years of additional ZTF data in DR17, we have more than doubled the number of microlensing events (60) found in the previous three-year DR5 search. In the event selection, we use the efficient \texttt{EventFinder} algorithm to detect microlensing signals, which could be used for large datasets such as future ZTF data releases or data from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Using detection efficiencies of ZTF fields obtained from catalog-level simulations, we calculate the mean Einstein timescale to be $\langle t_\mathrm{E}\rangle=51.7\pm3.3$ days, smaller than previous results of the Galactic plane but within 1.5$\sigma$. We also calculate optical depths and event rates, although some caution is needed due to the use of visual inspection when creating our final sample. Spectroscopy of three possible candidates confirms their microlensing nature.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning the Forecast of Galactic Cosmic-Rays Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning framework based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict galactic cosmic-ray spectra on a one-day-ahead basis by leveraging historical solar activity data, overcoming limitations inherent in traditional transport models. By flexibly incorporating multiple solar parameters such as the heliospheric magnetic field, solar wind speed, and sunspot numbers, our model achieves accurate short-term and long-term predictions of cosmic-ray flux. The addition of historical cosmic-ray flux data significantly enhances prediction accuracy, allowing the model to capture complex dependencies between past and future flux variations. Additionally, the model reliably predicts full cosmic-ray spectra for different particle species, enhancing its utility for comprehensive space weather forecasting. Our approach offers a scalable, data-driven alternative to traditional physics-based methods, ensuring robust daily and long-term forecasts. This work opens avenues for advanced models that can integrate broader observational data, with significant implications for space weather monitoring and mission planning.</description>
