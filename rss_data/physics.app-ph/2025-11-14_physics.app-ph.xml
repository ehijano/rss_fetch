      <title>Reduced Variability in Threshold Switches Using Heterostructures of SiO${_x}$ and Vertically Aligned MoS${_2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials provide unique structural features, such as physical gaps between their layers that are only connected through van der Waals (vdW) forces. These vdW gaps can guide the migration of intercalated ions and thus regulate filament growth in resistive switching (RS) devices. Vertically aligned 2D materials and their heterostructures provide vdW gap-mediated ion transport in memristor crossbars, providing great potential for high-density integration and reliable RS performance. Nevertheless, the fundamental switching mechanisms and their contributions to the RS remain inadequately understood. In this work, we investigate silver (Ag) filament-based threshold switching (TS) in heterostructures comprising vertically aligned 2D molybdenum disulfide (VAMoS${_2}$) grown via sulfurization and silicon oxide (SiO${_x}$). Compared to SiO${_x}$-only devices, the SiO${_x}$/VAMoS${_2}$ devices exhibit TS with higher on-threshold and hold voltages, each approximately 0.4 V, faster switching times down to 356 ns under a 4 V pulse, and a lower cycle-to-cycle on-current variability of 3.0%. A physics-based, variability-aware model reveals that confined Ag ion migration within the vdW gaps in VAMoS${_2}$ forms ultrathin seed filaments, which guide filament growth in the SiO${_x}$ layer. These findings establish SiO${_x}$/VAMoS${_2}$ heterostructures as a promising concept for reliable TS in vertical device architectures for emerging memories and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Diamond-based sensing of stray fields from the bulk of thin-film magnets via nano-indentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement of the magnetization in the bulk of thin-film or two-dimensional materials is important for understanding their intrinsic properties without the complications from edges or domain walls. However, the stray fields from the bulk vanish or are very weak, which limits the application of direct measurement methods. Here, we develop a non-destructive approach to directly measuring the stray fields from the bulk of thin-film magnets at arbitrarily designatable locations, with nanoscale spatial resolution. We employ nano-indentation to induce the leakage of stray fields from the materials and use nano-diamond magnetometers to measure them. We apply the method to iron thin films and determine the intrinsic magnetization in the bulk of the materials. This work provides direct access to the intrinsic magnetic properties of thin-film and low-dimensional materials, as well as a method to study the mechanical effects on magnetization in nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Bandwidth of Linear Classically Damped Systems with Application to Experimental Model Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bandwidth is a widely known concept and tool used in structural dynamics to measure an oscillator's capacity to dissipate energy over time, for example when used in half-power damping estimation of structural modes. Root Mean Square (RMS) Bandwidth is a generalization of bandwidth that overcomes some of the limitations encountered with conventional bandwidth, including the prerequisite of linearity, single-mode response, and light damping. However, its mathematical form does not reveal much about the physics behind it. In this paper, we extend RMS Bandwidth to multiple degree-of-freedom, linear, time-invariant, classically damped systems by deriving an Analytical Root Mean Square (ARMS) Bandwidth in terms of a system's modal parameters and initial modal energy distribution. We demonstrate that ARMS Bandwidth reliably and accurately computes a single measure for a practical structure's dissipative capacity. Also, a purely data-driven methodology for assessing the modal energy distribution is developed. We apply ARMS Bandwidth to single and multiple degree-of-freedom systems and an experimental model aircraft to demonstrate its broad applicability. Future work will address the effects of non-classical damping distribution, time-varying parameters, and nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Impact of Contact Gating on Scaling of Monolayer 2D Transistors Using a Symmetric Dual-Gate Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance and scalability of two-dimensional (2D) field-effect transistors (FETs) are strongly influenced by geometry-defined electrostatics. In most 2D FET studies, the gate overlaps with the source and drain electrodes, allowing the gate potential to modulate the 2D semiconductor underneath the electrodes and ultimately effect carrier transport at the metal-semiconductor interface - a phenomenon known as contact gating. Here, a symmetric dual-gate structure with independently addressable back and top gates is employed to elucidate the impact of contact gating on a monolayer MoS2 channel. Unlike previous studies of contact gating, this symmetric structure enables quantification of the phenomena through a contact gating factor, revealing a 2x enhancement in on-state performance in long-channel devices. At scaled dimensions (50 nm channel and 30 nm contact length), the influence of contact gating becomes amplified, yielding a 5x increase in on-state performance and a 70% reduction in transfer length when contact gating is present. Since many reported record-performance 2D FETs employ back-gate geometries that inherently include contact gating, these results establish contact gating as a critical and previously underappreciated determinant of device performance in the 2D FET landscape.</description>

      <title>Multibit Ferroelectric Memcapacitor for Non-volatile Analogue Memory and Reconfigurable Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tuneable capacitors are vital for adaptive and reconfigurable electronics, yet existing approaches require continuous bias or mechanical actuation. Here we demonstrate a voltage-programmable ferroelectric memcapacitor based on HfZrO that achieves more than eight stable, reprogrammable capacitance states (3-bit encoding) within a non-volatile window of 24~pF. The device switches at low voltages (3~V), with each state exhibiting long retention (10^5~s) and high endurance (10^6 cycles), ensuring reliable multi-level operation. At the nanoscale, multistate charge retention was directly visualised using atomic force microscopy, confirming the robustness of individual states beyond macroscopic measurements. As a proof of concept, the capacitor was integrated into a high-pass filter, where the programmed capacitive states shift the cutoff frequency over 5~kHz, establishing circuit-level viability. This work demonstrates the feasibility of CMOS-compatible, non-volatile, analogue memory based on ferroelectric HfZrO, paving the way for adaptive RF filters, reconfigurable analogue front-ends, and neuromorphic electronics.</description>

      <title>Beyond empirical models: Discovering new constitutive laws in solids with graph-based equation discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constitutive models are fundamental to solid mechanics and materials science, underpinning the quantitative description and prediction of material responses under diverse loading conditions. Traditional phenomenological models, which are derived through empirical fitting, often lack generalizability and rely heavily on expert intuition and predefined functional forms. In this work, we propose a graph-based equation discovery framework for the automated discovery of constitutive laws directly from multisource experimental data. This framework expresses equations as directed graphs, where nodes represent operators and variables, edges denote computational relations, and edge features encode parametric dependencies. This enables the generation and optimization of free-form symbolic expressions with undetermined material-specific parameters. Through the proposed framework, we have discovered new constitutive models for strain-rate effects in alloy steel materials and the deformation behavior of lithium metal. Compared with conventional empirical models, these new models exhibit compact analytical structures and achieve higher accuracy. The proposed graph-based equation discovery framework provides a generalizable and interpretable approach for data-driven scientific modelling, particularly in contexts where traditional empirical formulations are inadequate for representing complex physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>The $N$-achromat and beyond: a unified variational framework for optimal chromatic aberration correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present novel and effective methods for reducing chromatic aberrations in
  cemented lens systems. We derive an analytical solution coined the pentachromat, which
  corrects five distinct colors. This method can naturally be extended to accommodate
  an arbitrary number of lenses and to correct for a customized selection of spectral lines.
  Since correcting for specific rays rather than the entire residual spectrum
  can overconstrain the system, we introduce a variational formulation. This approach
  tames the residual spectrum by several orders of magnitude compared to conventional
  designs like the superachromat, while giving theoretical guarantees to reach the
  optimal solutions.
  Furthermore, this innovative methodology opens up previously uncharted design
  possibilities, such as multiple-focal-length achromatic systems. This allows for the
  selection of specific optical powers paired with desired bandwidths, enabling the
  design of highly specialized and tailored optical systems.
  Finally, we couple our variational framework with a combinatorial search, allowing to
  find the type of glasses and their geometry such that it reaches the best residual spectrum
  over an available catalogue.</description>

      <title>Systematic dispersion engineering of crystalline microresonators for broadband and coherent frequency comb generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultraprecision machining offers a powerful route to dispersion control in crystalline microresonators, allowing the design of waveguide geometries for tailoring the spectrum of microresonator frequency combs. By precisely designing the geometry, both group-velocity and higher-order dispersions can be engineered across a broad wavelength range. However, despite their promising features, such advantages have remained largely unexplored due to fabrication challenges. Here, we demonstrate that resonators shaped by ultrapecision machining exhibit high precision and strongly suppressed spatial mode interactions, facilitating the generation of smooth dissipative Kerr soliton combs and broadband frequency combs beyond the telecommunication C-band. These results underscore the effectiveness of precision geometry control for realizing coherent and broadband microcombs on crystalline photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>k-Selective Electrical-to-Magnon Transduction with Realistic Field-distributed Nanoantennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excitation and detection of propagating spin waves with lithographed nanoantennas underpin both classical magnonic circuits and emerging quantum technologies. Here, we establish a framework for all-electrical propagating spin-wave spectroscopy (AEPSWS) that links realistic electromagnetic drive fields to micromagnetic dynamics. Using finite-element (FE) simulations, we compute the full vector near-field of electrical impedance-matched, tapered coplanar and stripline antennas and import this distribution into finite-difference (FD) micromagnetic solvers. This approach captures the antenna-limited wave-vector spectrum and the component-selective driving fields (perpendicular to the static magnetisation) that simplified uniform-field models cannot. From this coupling, we derive how realistic current return paths and tapering shapes, k-weighting functions, for Damon-Eshbach surface spin waves in yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) films are, for millimetre-scale matched CPWs and linear tapers down to nanometre-scale antennas. Validation against experimental AEPSWS on a $48\,nm$ YIG film shows quantitative agreement in dispersion ridges, group velocities, and spectral peak positions, establishing that the antenna acts as a tunable k-space filter. These results provide actionable design rules for on-chip magnonic transducers, with immediate relevance for low-power operation regimes and prospective applications in quantum magnonics.</description>

      <title>Phase field modelling of cracking and capacity fade in core-shell cathode particles for lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-shell electrode particles are a promising morphology control strategy for high-performance lithium-ion batteries. However, experimental observations reveal that these structures remain prone to mechanical failure, with shell fractures and core-shell debonding occurring after a single charge. In this work, we present a novel, comprehensive computational framework to predict and gain insight into the failure of core-shell morphologies and the associated degradation in battery performance. The fully coupled chemo-mechano-damage model presented captures the interplay between mechanical damage and electrochemical behaviours, enabling the quantification of particle cracking and capacity fade. Both bulk material fracture and interface debonding are captured by utilising the phase field method. We quantify the severity of particle cracking and capacity loss through case studies on a representative core-shell system (NMC811@NMC532). The results bring valuable insights into cracking patterns, underlying mechanisms, and their impact on capacity loss. Surface cracks are found to initiate when a significantly higher lithium concentration accumulates in the core compared to the shell. Interfacial debonding is shown to arise from localised hoop stresses near the core-shell interface, due to greater shell expansion. This debonding develops rapidly, impedes lithium-ion transport, and can lead to more than 10\% capacity loss after a single discharge. Furthermore, larger particles may experience crack branching driven by extensive tensile zones, potentially fragmenting the entire particle. The framework developed can not only bring new insight into the degradation mechanisms of core-shell particles but also be used to design electrode materials with improved performance and extended lifetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curved and conformal optics offer significant advantages by unlocking additional geometric degrees of freedom for optical design. These capabilities enable enhanced optical performance and are essential for meeting non-optical constraints, such as those imposed by ergonomics, aerodynamics, or wearability. However, existing fabrication techniques such as direct electron or laser beam writing on curved substrates, and soft-stamp-based transfer or nanoimprint lithography suffer from limitations in scalability, yield, geometry control, and alignment accuracy. Here, we present a scalable fabrication strategy for curved and conformal metasurface optics leveraging thermoforming, an industry-standard, high-throughput manufacturing process widely used for shaping thermoplastics. Our approach uniquely enables wafer-scale production of highly curved metasurface optics, achieving sub-millimeter radii of curvature and micron-level alignment precision. To guide the design and fabrication process, we developed a thermorheological model that accurately predicts and compensates for the large strains induced during thermoforming. This allows for precise control of metasurface geometry and preservation of optical function, yielding devices with diffraction-limited performance. As a demonstration, we implemented an artificial compound eye comprising freeform micro-metalens arrays. Compared to traditional micro-optical counterparts, the device exhibits an expanded field of view, reduced aberrations, and improved uniformity, highlighting the potential of thermoformed metasurfaces for next-generation optical systems.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Spacetime Crystals Induced by Anomalous Velocity Modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-modulated media offer powerful opportunities for controlling light, yet extending such concepts to optical frequencies has remained challenging. Here we propose a different route to photonic spacetime crystals based on modulation of the anomalous velocity in low-symmetry conductors, particularly Weyl semimetals. We show that when driven by a strong optical pump, the anomalous velocity of Bloch electrons induces an ultrafast spacetime modulation that propagates with a superluminal phase velocity relative to the dielectric background. This self-induced modulation enables unidirectional light transport below the optical gap and, near the epsilon-near-zero point, gives rise to collective parametric resonance and stimulated emission of volume plasmons. These findings identify Weyl semimetals as a promising platform for realizing optical spacetime crystals and open a pathway toward active and nonreciprocal photonic systems governed by quantum geometric effects.</description>

Abstract: Photonic space time crystals (PSTCs) are emerging materials characterized by periodic variations in electromagnetic parameters with respect to both space and time. To date, research on PSTCs remains theoretical, with no practical realization reported. This article presents the practical realization of PSTCs through the design and simulation of a 2D metasurface-based photonic space-time crystal. It illustrates the characteristics of energy bandgaps, momentum bandgaps, and mixed energy momentum bandgap eigenmodes within the dispersion relation of these crystals. Additionally, the article details the properties of second order exceptional points that occur when two bandgaps overlap under specific conditions. The application of the metasurface based PSTC in 6G wireless communications is also demonstrated. This work aims to advance the understanding of PSTCs and their potential applications.</description>

Abstract: Biosensing based on optically trapped fluorescent nanodiamonds is an intriguing research direction potentially allowing to resolve biochemical processes inside living cells. Towards this goal, we investigate infrared near (NIR) laser irradiation at 1064 nm on fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. By conducting comprehensive experiments, we aim to understand how NIR exposure influences the fluorescence and sensing properties of FNDs and to determine the potential implications for the use of FNDs in various sensing applications. The experimental setup involved exposing FNDs to varying intensities of NIR laser light and analyzing the resultant changes in their optical and physical properties. Key measurements included T1 relaxation times, optical spectroscopy, and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra. The findings reveal how increased NIR laser power correlates with alterations in ODMR central frequency but also that charge state dynamics under NIR irradiation of NV centers plays a role. We suggest protocols with NIR and green light that mitigate the effect of NIR, and demonstrate that FND biosensing works well with such a protocol.</description>

      <title>Impact of helium ion irradiation on the thermal properties of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors</title>

Abstract: SNSPDs are indispensable for applications ranging from quantum information processing to deep-space optical communications, owing to their high detection efficiency, low dark counts, and excellent timing resolution. However, further improving the intrinsic detection efficiency (IDE) remains crucial for optimizing SNSPD performance. Ion irradiation has recently emerged as a powerful post-fabrication method to enhance SNSPD characteristics. Here, we studied the effects of He-ion irradiation on the thermal properties of NbN SNSPDs. We systematically examine the evolution of thermal boundary conductance as a function of ion fluence (0-1.1E17 ions/cm2), observing a 57% decrease from 127 to 54 W/m^2K^4 with increasing fluence, followed by saturation at approximately 9E16 ions/cm2. At this fluence, the minimum hotspot relaxation time measurements indicate a 41% increase, rising from 17 to 24 ps,while the electron-phonon interaction time decreases, with the magnitude of change depending on temperature and sample batch.TEM reveals defect formation at the NbN/SiO2 interface (6-8 nm) and He-bubble formation within the SiO2 layer (30-260 nm), contributing to the extended thermal relaxation time. These irradiation-induced modifications play a key role in enhancing the IDE of the treated devices. We further demonstrate a post-irradiation SNSPD showing a saturated IDE plateau at 2000 nm from 2.7 K to 28 mK, enabled by thermal modifications and a weakly wavelength-dependent avalanche-assisted mechanism. Our findings highlight ion irradiation as a valuable tool for thermal tailoring in SNSPDs and advance the understanding of detection physics and defect engineering in superconducting optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Disordered Continuity: Programming Resolution-Independent Stochastic Metamaterials with Differentiable Anisotropic Property Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nature-inspired stochastic metamaterials with disordered and multiscale architectures have shown great promise towards extraordinary functionalities, including high mechanical resilience, stress modulation and biased stiffness reinforcement. As a special type of functionally graded metamaterial, programming multiscale stochastic metamaterial to achieve required functional property is computationally demanding due to the iterative simulation process, and thereby often intuitively implemented by filling a predefined subset of functional units into rasterized design space of fixed resolution, which restricts the flexibility and effectiveness of the designed functionality. To mitigate the computational complexity introduced by the multiscale architecture, we proposed a two-stage approach to programming stochastic metamaterials towards customized mechanical response. Instead of directly optimizing stochastic microstructures, the proposed approach first optimizes a differentiable physical property distribution, e.g. stiffness that targets desired functionality, and then generates spinodal architected microstructures to realize such property distribution under resolution-independent rasterization. The key enabler is the incorporation of spherical harmonics to represent, modulate and interpolate anisotropic stiffness distribution, which then serves as a non-uniform distribution function for the generation of anisotropic spinodal infills with high continuity. The test results demonstrated effective design of stochastic metamaterials with programmed functionalities to enable stress modulation, texture encoding and mechanical cloaking.</description>

      <title>Novel design strategies for modulating conductive stretchable system response based on periodic assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.12600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft electronics have recently gathered considerable interest thanks to their bio-mechanical compatibility. An important feature of such deformable conductors is their electrical response to strain. While development of stretchable materials with high gauge factors has attracted considerable attention, there is a growing need for stretchable conductors whose response to deformation can be accurately engineered to provide arbitrary resistance-strain relationships. The rare studies addressing this issue have focused on deterministic geometries of single rigid materials, limiting the scope of such strategies. Herein, we introduce the novel concept of periodic stretchable patterns combining multiple conductive materials to produce tailored responses. Using shortest-path algorithms, we establish a computationally efficient selection method to obtain required resistance-strain relationship. Using this algorithm, we identify and experimentally demonstrate constant resistance-strain responses up to 50% elongation using a single micro-textured material. Finally, we demonstrate counter-intuitive sinusoidal responses by integrating three materials, with interesting applications in sensing and soft robotics.</description>

      <title>A Linear Quantum Coupler for Clean Bosonic Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing with superconducting circuits relies on high-fidelity driven nonlinear processes. An ideal quantum nonlinearity would selectively activate desired coherent processes at high strength, without activating parasitic mixing products or introducing additional decoherence. The wide bandwidth of the Josephson nonlinearity makes this difficult, with undesired drive-induced transitions and decoherence limiting qubit readout, gates, couplers, and amplifiers. Significant strides have been recently made into building better `quantum mixers', with promise being shown by Kerr-free three-wave mixers that suppress driven frequency shifts, and balanced quantum mixers that explicitly forbid a significant fraction of parasitic processes. We propose a novel mixer that combines both these strengths, with engineered selection rules that make it essentially linear (not just Kerr-free) when idle, and activate clean parametric processes even when driven at high strength. Further, its ideal Hamiltonian is simple to analyze analytically, and we show that this ideal behavior is first-order insensitive to dominant experimental imperfections. We expect this mixer to allow significant advances in high-Q control, readout, and amplification.</description>

      <title>Broadband Optical Modulation and Control at Millikelvin Temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A universal experimental challenge when studying radiation effects on cryogenic devices is to precisely and accurately characterize the position-dependent device response very near the energy detection threshold. We have developed a compact cryogenic optical beam steering system that can be used to generate O({\mu}s) pulses of small numbers of photons over the energy range of 1.2 - 4.5eV at room temperature, and deliver those photons via fiber optic to any specified location on the surface of a detector operating at cryogenic temperatures. This new system will allow for robust calibration of any photon-sensitive detector, including supercondcting devices. The system can be used efficiently to explore the physics of target materials, quantify the position sensitivity of different sensor designs, measure phonon transport, and study the effects of quasiparticle poisoning on detector operation. We describe the design of this pulsed calibration method and present first results obtained with a second-generation system operated at room temperature and sub-Kelvin temperatures.</description>
