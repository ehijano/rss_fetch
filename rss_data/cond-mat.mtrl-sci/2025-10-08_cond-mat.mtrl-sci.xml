      <title>Tunable electronic energy level alignment and exciton diversity in organic-inorganic van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: van der Waals stacking of two-dimensional (2D) materials offers a powerful platform for engineering material interfaces with tailored electronic and optical properties. While most van der Waals multilayers have featured inorganic monolayers, incorporating molecular monolayers introduces new degrees of tunability and functionality. Here, we investigate hybrid bilayers composed of atomically thin perylene-based molecular crystals interfaced with monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), specifically MoS2 and WS2. Using ab initio many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation approach, we predict emergent properties beyond those of the isolated constituent systems. Notably, we find substantial renormalization of monolayer molecular crystal band gap due to TMD-induced polarization. Furthermore, by varying the TMD monolayer, we demonstrate tuning of the energy level alignment of the bilayer and subsequent control over a diversity of lowest-energy excitons, which include strongly bound hybrid excitons and long-lived charge-transfer excitons. These findings establish organic-inorganic van der Waals heterostructures as a promising class of materials for tunable optoelectronic devices and quantum excitonic phenomena, expanding the design space for low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface and Berry phase analysis for Dirac nodal line semimetals: cautionary tale to SrGa$_2$ and BaGa$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Berry phase of odd multiples of $\pi$ inferred from quantum oscillations (QOs) has often been treated as evidence for nontrivial reciprocal space topology. However, disentangling the Berry phase values from the Zeeman effect and the orbital magnetic moment is often challenging. In centrosymmetric compounds, the case is simpler as the orbital magnetic moment contribution is negligible. Although the Zeeman effect can be significant, it is usually overlooked in most studies of QOs in centrosymmetric compounds. Here, we present a detailed study on the non-magnetic centrosymmetric $\mathrm{SrGa_2}$ and $\mathrm{BaGa_2}$, which are predicted to be Dirac nodal line semimetals (DNLSs) based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Evidence of the nontrivial topology is found in magnetotransport measurements. The Fermi surface topology and band structure are carefully studied through a combination of angle-dependent QOs, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and DFT calculations, where the nodal line is observed in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Strong de Haas-van Alphen fundamental oscillations associated with higher harmonics are observed in both compounds, which are well-fitted by the Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) formula. However, even with the inclusion of higher harmonics in the fitting, we found that the Berry phases cannot be unambiguously determined when the Zeeman effect is included. We revisit the LK formula and analyze the phenomena and outcomes that were associated with the Zeeman effect in previous studies. Our experimental results confirm that $\mathrm{SrGa_2}$ and $\mathrm{BaGa_2}$ are Dirac nodal line semimetals. Additionally, we highlight the often overlooked role of spin-damping terms in Berry phase analysis.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of proton insertion across the perovskite-brownmillerite transition in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-{\delta}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: La$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$CoO3-$\delta$ is a promising off-stoichiometric metal oxide that undergoes a topotactic perovskite ($\delta$ = 0) to brownmillerite ($\delta$ = 0.5) transition under electrochemical and thermochemical stimuli, with concomitant variations in its electrical, magnetic, thermal, and optical properties. Recent studies on thin-film cycling in electrochemical devices show incomplete reversibility of this transition, with significant acid-etching serving as a degradation mechanism. While earlier investigations examined the protonation of brownmillerite SrCoO2.5, the thermodynamics of protonation across the perovskite-to-brownmillerite transition remain poorly understood. In this work, we combine density functional theory calculations with predictions from universal machine-learning interatomic potentials to elucidate the energetics and implications of protonation across the transition for La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\delta$. These calculations reveal negative hydrogen insertion energies and strong competition with oxygen vacancy formation across the transition for a wide range of conditions. The extent of protonation is primarily limited by the availability of Co 3d states to accommodate reduction by inserted hydrogen. Although hydrogen insertion is often thermodynamically favorable within a defect picture, a convex hull analysis of the resulting HyLa0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\delta$ phases reveals them to be unstable against decomposition into hydroxides among other products. This instability increases with hydrogen content and provides a thermodynamic basis for the acid-etching observed during electrochemical cycling. This work advances the fundamental understanding of protonation in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\delta$ and contextualizes experimental observations of related materials in the presence of moisture or H2.</description>

      <title>Cation vacancies mediate thermochemical water splitting with iron aluminates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar thermochemical water splitting enables hydrogen production by cycling metal oxides between reduced and oxidized states, typically through an oxygen vacancy mechanism. However, recent experimental work suggests that cation vacancies have a greater influence on the redox behavior of iron aluminate spinels used in water splitting. This remains debated, as calculations predict that such cation vacancies are thermodynamically unfavorable. In the current work, we show that Fe vacancies in (Fe$\zeta$Al1-$\zeta$)3O4 become accessible only when facilitated by inversion between Fe and Al. This antisite disorder lowers the formation energy of octahedral Fe vacancies in Al-rich spinels ($\zeta$ = 1/3) from over 3 eV to just 0.62 eV when one third of the cation sites are inverted, allowing high Fe vacancy concentrations under oxidizing conditions. This mechanism supports high H2 yields up to 361 $\mu$mol/g, consistent with experimental observations. Our findings support the notion that solar thermochemical water splitting can occur through a cation vacancy mechanism. They also clarify how site inversion, vacancy energetics, and defect interactions each contribute to redox performance, offering general design principles for identifying and optimizing materials that operate through cation vacancy cycling.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials Enable Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Doped MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first computational framework for molecular dynamics simulation of MoS2 doped with 25 elements spanning metals, non-metals, and transition metals using Meta's Universal Model for Atoms machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP). Benchmarking against density functional theory calculations demonstrates the accuracy of the MLIP for simulating doped-MoS2 systems and highlights opportunities for improvement. Using the MLIP, we perform heating-cooling simulations of doped-MoS2 supercells. The simulations capture complex phenomena including dopant clustering, MoS2 layer fracturing, interlayer diffusion, and chemical compound formation at orders-of-magnitude reduced computational cost compared to density functional theory. This work provides an open-source computational workflow for application-oriented design of doped-MoS2, enabling high-throughput screening of dopant candidates and optimization of compositions for targeted tribological, electronic, and optoelectronic performance. The MLIP bridges the accuracy-efficiency gap between first-principles methods and empirical potentials, and the framework offers unprecedented opportunities for large-scale materials discovery in two-dimensional doped material systems.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy of quantum wire-like dislocation states in ZnS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent \textit{ab initio} calculations predict 1D dispersive electronic bands confined to the atomic scale cores of dislocations in the wide bandgap (3.84 eV) semiconductor ZnS. We test these predictions by correlating sub-bandgap optical transitions with the density of dislocations formed during strain relaxation in epitaxial ZnS grown on GaP. The densities for four predicted partial dislocations are quantified using scanning electron microscopy-based electron channeling contrast imaging. Room-temperature ellipsometry reveals absorption peaks that scale with dislocation density and align with theoretical predictions. Low-temperature photoluminescence spectra show deep emission peaks matching dislocation 1D band-to-band transitions. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy reveals six distinct emission lines with contrasting excitation dependence. Four peaks (2.78, 2.41, 2.20, 1.88 eV), assigned to dislocations, exhibit only modest suppression ($\leq$5$\times$) when excited below the ZnS bandgap, while two other peaks (3.11, 1.53~eV) are strongly quenched ($&gt;$10$\times$). These findings support the existence of efficient, 1D band-to-band radiative transitions within quantum wire-like dislocation core states in ZnS, distinct from typical non-radiative deep-level defects in wide-gap semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Imaging Nanoscale Carrier, Thermal, and Structural Dynamics with Time-Resolved and Ultrafast Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved and ultrafast electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) is an emerging technique for measuring photoexcited carriers, lattice dynamics, and near-fields across femtosecond to microsecond timescales. When performed in either a specialized scanning transmission electron microscope or ultrafast electron microscope (UEM), time-resolved and ultrafast EELS can directly image charge carriers, lattice vibrations, and heat dissipation following photoexcitation or applied bias. Yet recent advances in theoretical calculations and electron optics are often required to realize the full potential of ultrafast EEL spectrum imaging. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the recent progress in the theory and instrumentation of time-resolved and ultrafast EELS. We begin with an introduction to the technique, followed by a physical description of the loss function. We outline approaches for calculating and interpreting ground-state and transient EEL spectra spanning low-loss plasmons to core-level excitations analogous to X-ray absorption. We then survey the current state of time-resolved and ultrafast EELS techniques beyond photon-induced near-field electron microscopy, highlighting abilities to image carrier and thermal dynamics. Finally, we examine future directions enabled by emerging technologies, including electron beam monochromation, in situ and operando cells, laser-free UEM, and high-speed direct electron detectors. These advances position time-resolved and ultrafast EELS as a critical tool for uncovering nanoscale dynamic processes in quantum materials and solar energy conversion devices.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the physical attributes of CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 compounds: A first-principles study for next-generation photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic and optical properties of CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 were studied using first-principles DFT calculations. Band gaps were calculated using the GGA-PBESol functional. Both materials show promise for photovoltaic applications because of their large, near-unity absorption efficiencies (10^4 cm^-1) in the visible region. They exhibit low exciton binding energies (18.85-26.81 meV), large Bohr radii (23-34.3 Angstrom), and moderate exciton temperatures (218-311 K), which are favorable for photovoltaic applications. Their performance as solar cells was simulated using the SCAPS-1D tool for thin-film devices with Pt/CdS/CdGa2Te4/Cu2O/Ti and Pt/CdS/ZnGa2Te4/Cu2O/Ti structures. We investigated the effects of layer thickness, donor and acceptor concentrations (shallow donors/acceptors), and defect density on device performance. The ideal absorber thickness for XGa2Te4 (X = Cd, Zn) was found to be 1000-1800 nm, and the CdS buffer layer around 150 nm. To obtain an efficiency above 20%, the defect density in the CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 absorber layers should be kept below 1.772 x 10^13 cm^-3. The best simulations show efficiencies of 18.46% and 17.35% for CdGa2Te4- and ZnGa2Te4-based solar cells, respectively.</description>

      <title>Co-evaporated Formamidinium tin triiodide with suppressed p-type self-doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-evaporation of formamidinium tin triiodide (FASnI3) precursors, without any additives or reducing agents, leads to the growth of a highly crystalline thin film which shows a bandgap around 1.31 eV, closely matching the theoretical value predicted from the ideal single crystal structure of FASnI3. The polycrystalline thin film presents a lower tendency of Sn2+ to Sn4+ oxidation and highly reduced tendency to self-doping, demonstrating, overall, an improved resistance to defects formation. These findings suggest solvent-free co-evaporation processes as a promising route for high quality Sn-based perovskite polycrystalline thin films.</description>

      <title>From High-Entropy Ceramics (HECs) to Compositionally Complex Ceramics (CCCs) and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, the field of high-entropy ceramics (HECs) has rapidly expanded to encompass a wide range of oxides, borides, silicides, and other ceramic solid solutions. In 2020, we proposed extending the concept of HECs to compositionally complex ceramics (CCCs), in which non-equimolar compositions and the presence of long- or short-range order reduce entropy while offering new opportunities to tailor and enhance properties, often beyond those of higher-entropy counterparts. Here, fundamental questions arise: Is the entropy in HECs truly high? Should maximizing entropy always be our goal? This perspective article revisits key concepts and terminologies and highlights emerging directions, including dual-phase CCCs, ultrahigh-entropy phases, and novel processing routes such as ultrafast reactive sintering. We propose that exploring compositional complexity across vast non-equimolar spaces, together with correlated disorder (coupled short-range chemical and structural orders), offers a more effective strategy for designing ceramics with superior performance than simply maximizing entropy.</description>

      <title>Confinement-Controlled Morphology and Stability of One-Dimensional CrI3 Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating monolayers derived from 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials into next-generation technological applications remains a significant challenge due to their structural and magnetic instability issues. Template-assisted encapsulation is a potential route for the growth of stable 2D monolayers aimed at designing novel 1D heterostructures, opening new avenues for studying low-dimensional quantum effects and spin-related phenomena. In this study, we explored the diameter-dependent encapsulation of 2D CrI3 crystals using multi-walled carbon nanotubes as nanoscale host templates. Advanced microscopic analysis revealed distinct structural transitions, ranging from internal nanorod encapsulation to external shell formation, directly influenced by the host nanotube diameter. Furthermore, statistical analysis of structural morphologies indicates that CrI3 nanorods preferentially form within MWCNTs with inner diameters up to 5 nm, while single-walled CrI3 nanotubes are stabilized in CNTs with diameters up to 8 nm. For host CNTs exceeding 10 nm in diameter, CrI3 predominantly forms surface coatings rather than confined one-dimensional structures. In situ electron beam irradiation demonstrates the superior structural stability of single-walled CrI3 confined within MWCNTs, while externally coated CrI3 undergoes decomposition into metallic Cr clusters. Prolonged irradiation induces a morphological transformation of CrI3 nanotubes into nanorods. These insights lay the groundwork for engineering robust, tunable 1D magnetic heterostructures of CrI3 for spintronic and data storage applications.</description>

      <title>High- and medium-entropy nitride coatings from the Cr-Hf-Mo-Ta-W-N system: properties and high-temperature stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High- and medium-entropy nitride coatings from the Cr-Hf-Mo-Ta-W-N system were studied using ab initio calculations and experiments to clarify the role of entropy and individual elements in phase stability, microstructure, and high-temperature behaviour. Formation energy calculations indicated that nitrogen vacancies stabilise the cubic (fcc) phase, with hafnium and tantalum acting as strong stabilisers, while tungsten destabilises the lattice. Coatings were deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering at approx. 50C (AT) and approx. 580C (HT). All exhibited columnar fcc structures; high-temperature deposition produced denser coatings, lower nitrogen content, and larger crystallites, resulting in higher hardness and elastic modulus. Thermal stability was tested up to 1200C on Si and oxidation at 1400C on sapphire. AT coatings failed early, while most HT coatings endured. Nitrogen loss less than 10 at.% at 1000C was critical for survival. TEM revealed tungsten segregation and HfO2 formation, while fcc nitride remained dominant. Ta enrichment proved essential for superior thermal and oxidation stability.</description>

      <title>Retardance of lab grown diamond substrates as a function of thickness: momentum-drift random walk model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the correlation between mean retardance and thickness of diamond substrates grown homoepitaxially via microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD). We measure the retardance of a diamond substrate in two orientations: perpendicular and parallel to the growth direction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the correlation between mean retardance and thickness differs for these orientations. When measured perpendicular to the growth direction, the mean retardance is approximately proportional to the square root of the substrate thickness. In contrast, when measured parallel to the growth direction, we observe a generally higher mean retardance and an approximately linear correlation with thickness. This anisotropy arises not from differences in stress magnitude but from differences in the interlayer correlation of the principal stress axes, as evidenced by correlation coefficients between the azimuth angles of consecutive layers in the diamond crystal. To simulate the integrated retardance of diamond wafers, we propose a two-dimensional random walk model with momentum drift, which captures the diamond crystal tendency to preserve the azimuth angle across the samples. By optimizing the momentum factor, we show that the model can closely match experimental data. The momentum factor is found higher along the growth direction, which is consistent with the calculated correlation coefficients. Furthermore, both the model and experiments indicate that retardance-to-thickness ratios of thin samples converge toward similar base retardances in both orientations. These findings establish a quantitative framework for interpreting birefringence in diamond substrates, with implications for material selection and development in thermal management, quantum sensing, high-power electronics, and optical applications.</description>

      <title>Autonomous interpretation of atomistic scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with bespoke properties have long been identified by computational searches, and their experimental realisation is now coming within reach through autonomous laboratories. Scattering experiments are central to verifying the atomic structures of autonomously synthesised materials. Yet, interpreting these measurements typically requires user expertise and manual processing, or machine learning (ML) models trained on predefined datasets, limiting fully autonomous materials discovery. Here, we introduce a differentiable optimisation framework that treats scattering calculations, energetics, and chemical constraints as a unified refinement problem. Capability demonstrations across molecules, crystal structures, nanoparticles, and amorphous matter show that this data-driven approach resolves structural degeneracies with multi-modal inputs - suggesting its usefulness for informing, and ultimately guiding, the operation of autonomous laboratories.</description>

      <title>Effect of crystallographic texture on dealloying kinetics and composition of nanoporous gold surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoporous metals allow for tailoring composition and surface-to-volume ratio, both aspects critical for applications in catalysis. Here, Ag70Au30 (2 at. %) films with a face-centered cubic structure were deposited at 400{\deg}C, either {111}-textured or randomly oriented. Upon chemical dealloying, atom probe tomography of the nanoporous structure reveals that the textured film retains a up to 2.7 times higher Ag concentration within the ligaments compared to the randomly oriented film that exhibits ligament coarsening, indicating faster dealloying kinetics. Our study highlights the potential of microstructure engineering in tailoring the properties of nanoporous metals for possible future catalytic and electrochemical applications.</description>

      <title>Magnon-Magnon Interaction Induced by Dynamic Coupling in a Hybrid Magnonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a combined experimental and numerical investigation of spin-wave dynamics in a hybrid magnonic crystal consisting of a CoFeB artificial spin ice (ASI) of stadium-shaped nanoelements patterned atop a continuous NiFe film, separated by a 5 nm Al2O3 spacer. Using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy, we probe the frequency dependence of thermal spin waves as functions of applied magnetic field and wavevector, revealing the decisive role of interlayer dipolar coupling in the magnetization dynamics. Micromagnetic simulations complement the experiments, showing a strong interplay between ASI edge modes and backward volume modes in the NiFe film. The contrast in saturation magnetization between CoFeB and NiFe enhances this coupling, leading to a pronounced hybridization manifested as a triplet of peaks in the spectra - predicted by simulations and observed experimentally. This magnon-magnon coupling persists over a wide magnetic field range, shaping both the spin-wave dispersion and frequency-field response throughout the hysteresis loop. Our findings establish how ASI geometry can selectively enhance specific spin-wave wavelengths in the underlying film, identifying them as preferential channels for magnonic signal transport and manipulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials have been attracting increasing attention in recent years due to their unique behavior and possible applications in new devices. One material of great interest is the 2D van der Waals (vdW) crystal CrSBr, that exhibits antiferromagnetic (AF) order at low temperatures due to an interlayer AF exchange interaction. Here we present a full quantum spin-wave theory for CrSBr considering three intralayer and one interlayer exchange interactions, and triaxial magnetic anisotropy. The fits of the theoretical results to antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) measurements and inelastic neutron scattering data yield reliable values for the seven interaction parameters that can be used to calculate other properties of this interesting material.</description>

      <title>Colorimetry and Tribology of Ultrapure Copper Surface Micromodification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling optical and tribological properties of metal surfaces, like color and wear rate, without altering their chemical composition is a highly desirable process across numerous fields of science and industry. It represents a cost-effective alternative to traditional chemical methods, particularly for copper, one of the most important metals widely used where high electrical and thermal conductivity, alongside resistance to corrosion, are required. We investigated the control of copper surface texture through a controlled micromodification process, utilizing constant force and velocity with abrasive silicon carbide sandpaper on ultrapure copper pellets exhibiting elongated crystallographic grains, and its impact on optical properties. Systematically varying grit size and rubbing direction, both along and across the grains, resulted in tunable microgroove morphology, demonstrating a marked difference in wear rate between single-grain and multi-grain abrasion. Furthermore, modification along copper grain boundaries yielded a change in the wear rate by a factor of two, related to single-grain and multi-grain abrasion regime changes, enabling precise control over material performance via tuned abrasion conditions. Colorimetric analysis via C-Microscopy revealed a strong, statistically significant relationship between abrasive parameters, microgroove geometry (inclination angle, depth, and size), and optical spectral signatures, which were then parametrized to achieve targeted control. This research demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to color and reflectance modification via microgroove engineering, offering a pathway to customized material properties by uniquely coupling contact mechanics, surface morphology, and colorimetry at the microscale level.</description>

      <title>Origin of trapped intralayer Wannier and charge-transfer excitons in moir\'e materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials offer a versatile platform for engineering excitons with unprecedented control, promising next-generation optoelectronic applications. While continuum models are widely used to study moir\'e excitons due to their computational efficiency, they often disagree with ab initio many-body approaches, as seen for intralayer excitons in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers. Here, we resolve these discrepancies using an atomistic, quantum-mechanical framework based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation with localized Wannier functions as the basis for the electronic structure. We show that inclusion of dielectric screening due to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation is essential to reproduce the full set of experimentally observed features of moir\'e intralayer excitons. Our analysis reveals a competition between Wannier and charge transfer characters, driven by variations between direct and indirect band gaps at high symmetry stacking regions due to atomic relaxations and environmentally tunable electron-hole interactions. Building on this insight, we demonstrate that the lowest-energy bright excitons are Wannier-like in WS2/WSe2 heterobilayers but charge-transfer-like in twisted WSe2 homobilayers, despite having comparable moir\'e lengths when encapsulated in hBN. In the absence of hBN encapsulation, the lowest-energy bright exciton in twisted WSe$_2$ becomes Wannier-like. These results establish atomistic modeling as a powerful and efficient approach for designing and controlling excitonic phenomena in moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Synthesizability Gap in Perovskites by Combining Computations, Literature Data, and PU Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among emerging energy materials, halide and chalcogenide perovskites have garnered significant attention over the last decade owing to the abundance of their constituent species, low manufacturing costs, and their highly tunable composition-structure-property space. Navigating the vast perovskite compositional landscape is possible using density functional theory (DFT) computations, but they are not easily extended to predictions of the synthesizability of new materials and their properties. As a result, only a limited number of compositions identified to have desirable optoelectronic properties from these calculations have been realized experimentally. One way to bridge this gap is by learning from the experimental literature about how the perovskite composition-structure space relates to their likelihood of laboratory synthesis. Here, we present our efforts in combining high-throughput DFT data with experimental labels collected from the literature to train classifier models employing various materials descriptors to forecast the synthesizability of any given perovskite compound. Our framework utilizes the positive and unlabeled (PU) learning strategy and makes probabilistic estimates of the synthesis likelihood based on DFT- computed energies and the prior existence of similar synthesized compounds. Our data and models can be readily accessed via a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible (FAIR) nanoHUB tool.</description>

      <title>Reliable End-to-End Material Information Extraction from the Literature with Source-Tracked Multi-Stage Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven materials discovery requires large-scale experimental datasets, yet most of the information remains trapped in unstructured literature. Existing extraction efforts often focus on a limited set of features and have not addressed the integrated composition-processing-microstructure-property relationships essential for understanding materials behavior, thereby posing challenges for building comprehensive databases. To address this gap, we propose a multi-stage information extraction pipeline powered by large language models, which captures 47 features spanning composition, processing, microstructure, and properties exclusively from experimentally reported materials. The pipeline integrates iterative extraction with source tracking to enhance both accuracy and reliability. Evaluations at the feature level (independent attributes) and tuple level (interdependent features) yielded F1 scores around 0.96. Compared with single-pass extraction without source tracking, our approach improved F1 scores of microstructure category by 10.0% (feature level) and 13.7% (tuple level), and reduced missed materials from 49 to 13 out of 396 materials in 100 articles on precipitate-containing multi-principal element alloys (miss rate reduced from 12.4% to 3.3%). The pipeline enables scalable and efficient literature mining, producing databases with high precision, minimal omissions, and zero false positives. These datasets provide trustworthy inputs for machine learning and materials informatics, while the modular design generalizes to diverse material classes, enabling comprehensive materials information extraction.</description>

      <title>Variational and field-theoretical approach to exciton-exciton interactions and biexcitons in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons are the subject of intense research due to their potential for optoelectronic devices and applications, especially in the realm of two-dimensional materials. While the properties of free excitons in these systems are well understood, a general description of their interactions is complicated due to their composite nature, which leads to exchange between the identical fermions of different excitons. In this work we employ a variational approach to study interactions between Wannier excitons and obtain an effective interaction potential between two ground-state excitons in a system of spin-degenerate electrons and holes. This potential is in general nonlocal and depends on the coupled spins of the particles. When particularized to hydrogen-like excitons with a heavy hole, it becomes local and exactly reproduces the Heitler-London result for two interacting hydrogen atoms. Thus, our result can be interpreted as a generalization of the Heitler-London potential to arbitrary masses. Including corrections due to excited states results in a van der Waals potential at large distances, which is expected due to the induced dipole-dipole nature of the interactions. Additionally, we use a path-integral formalism to develop a many-body theory for a gas of excitons, resulting in an excitonic action that formally includes many-body interactions between excitons. While in the field representing the excitons is exactly bosonic, we clarify how the internal exchange processes arise in the field-theoretical treatment, and show that the diagrams corresponding to the interactions between excitons align with our variational calculation when evaluated on shell. Our methods and results lay the groundwork for a generalized theory of exciton-exciton interactions and their application to the study of biexciton spectra and correlated excitonic matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent interest in quantum materials has focused on systems exhibiting both superconductivity and non-trivial band topology as material candidates to realize topological or unconventional superconducting states. So far, superconductivity in most topological materials has been identified as type II. In this work, we present magnetotransport studies on the quasi-two-dimensional type I superconductor $\mathrm{YbSb_2}$. Combined ab initio DFT calculations and quantum oscillation measurements confirm that $\mathrm{YbSb_2}$ is a Dirac nodal line semimetal in the normal state. The complex Fermi surface morphology is evidenced by the non-monotonic angular dependence of both the quantum oscillation amplitude and the magnetoresistance. Our results establish $\mathrm{YbSb_2}$ as a candidate material platform for exploring the interplay between band topology and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>The roles of elasticity and dimension in liquid-gel phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare six elastic models for polymer networks in the context of phase separation within a gel, including a new model that combines the finite extensible Arruda-Boyce model and the slip tube model for entangled chains. We study incompressible uniaxial stretch and compression, and three volume-changing constrained-dimension deformations, in which the material can only deform in the designated dimensions(s) while the constrained direction(s) remain(s) the same. Each model responds differently to large deformations, and our proposed model successfully describes both strain softening and strain hardening, which are both present in well-entangled elastomers. When considering phase separation, we show that the commonly-used neo-Hookean model fails to admit a common tangent construction for phase coexistence for 3D deformations. This can be resolved by using a model with finite extension, such as the Arruda-Boyce model. In constrained-dimension deformations, where the gel's volume is allowed to change, for elastic models in which phase coexistence is possible, the critical temperatures increases and the critical concentration decreases with increasing deformation dimensions. This strong dependence of the phase diagram on spatial dimension and geometry distinguishes phase separation elastic media from conventional phase separation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate by atomistic simulations the memory behavior a model glass subjected to random driving protocols. The training consists of a random walk of forward and/or backward shearing sequences bounded by a maximal shear strain of absolute value {\gamma}T . We show that such a stochastic training protocol is able to record the training amplitude. Different read-out protocols are also tested and are shown to be able to retrieve the training amplitude. We then emphasize the ten- sorial character of the memory encoded in the glass sample and then characterize the anisotropic mechanical behavior of the trained samples.</description>

      <title>Probing orbital currents through inverse orbital Hall and Rashba effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive experimental investigation of orbital-to-charge conversion in metallic and semiconductor materials, emphasizing the fundamental roles of the inverse orbital Hall effect (IOHE) and the inverse orbital Rashba effect. Using spin pumping driven by ferromagnetic resonance (SP-FMR) and the spin Seebeck effect (SSE), we demonstrate efficient orbital current generation and detection in YIG/Pt/NM structures, where NM is either a metal or a semiconductor. A central finding is the dominance of orbital contributions over spin-related effects, even in systems with weak spin-orbit coupling. In particular, a large enhancement of the SP-FMR and SSE signals is observed in the presence of naturally oxidized Cu in different heterostructures. Furthermore, we identify positive and negative IOHE signals in Ti and Ge, respectively, and extract orbital diffusion lengths in both systems using a diffusive model. Our results confirm the presence of orbital transport and offer valuable insights that may guide the further development of orbitronics.</description>

      <title>Field Free Spin-Orbit Torque Controlled Synapse and Stochastic Neuron Devices for Spintronic Boltzmann Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spintronics offers a promising approach to energy efficient neuromorphic computing by integrating the functionalities of synapses and neurons within a single platform. A major challenge, however, is achieving field-free spin orbit torque SOT control over both synaptic and neuronal devices using an industry-adopted spintronic materials stack. In this study, we present field-free SOT spintronic synapses utilizing a CoFeB ferromagnetic thin film system, where asymmetrical device design and specifically added lateral notches in the CoFeB thin film facilitate effective domain wall DW nucleation, movement, and pinning and depinning. This method yields multiple analog, nonvolatile resistance states with enhanced linearity and symmetry, resulting in programmable and stable synaptic weights. We provide a systematic measurement approach to improve the linearity and symmetry of the synapses. Additionally, we demonstrate nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions MTJs that function as SOT-driven stochastic neurons, exhibiting current-tunable, Boltzmann-like probabilistic switching behavior, which provides an intrinsic in-hardware Gibbs sampling capability. By integrating these synapses and neurons into a Boltzmann machine complemented by a classifier layer, we achieve recognition accuracies greater than 98 percent on the MNIST dataset and 86 percent on Fashion MNIST. This work establishes a framework for field free synaptic and neuronal devices, setting the stage for practical, materials-compatible, and all spintronic neuromorphic computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Engineering Magnetic States and Magnetoresistance in Bisegmented Co-Ni Jellyfish Nanowires via Interplay of Shape and Magnetocrystalline Anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expanding the spectrum of 3D magnetic nanostructures requires mastering the interplay between different anisotropy contributions. Here, we fabricate bisegmented jellyfish nanowires with tailored arrangements of Co (strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy) and Ni (dominant shape anisotropy) segments. We uncover a unique magnetic duality: Co segments can be tuned to exhibit either a flux-closing multidomain state or a shape-anisotropy-dominated vortex configuration, directly governed by their geometry. This local domain structure, imaged by MFM and simulated micromagnetically, dictates the global magnetic response-suppressing magnetostatic interactions in arrays and enabling the programming of the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in single nanowires. Our work provides a blueprint for designing functional magnetic nanomaterials where magnetoresistive properties are engineered through strategic anisotropy control.</description>

      <title>Giant and robust Josephson diode effect in multiband topological nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically predict the giant and robust Josephson diode effect in quasi-one-dimensional topological Majorana nanowires in the regime with multiple subbands, which is expected to be relevant for the real experiment. In the multiband regime, the Majorana bound states and conventional Andreev bound states can naturally coexist, and respectively contribute to the fractional and conventional parts in the Josephson effect, with the former/latter having 4$\pi$/2$\pi$-periodicity. We show that the interplay between the two types of bound modes can produce a robust and giant diode effect in the deep topological phase regime. Notably, we unveil a novel spin parity exchange mechanism, occurring only in the multiband regime, which leads to a robust high efficiency plateau of the giant diode effect. This effect is a nontrivial consequence of the balanced Fermi moment shifts of the multiple subbands in tuning the external magnetic field. Our finding highlights the subband engineering as a powerful tool to optimize the Josephson diode effect realistically and provides a new feasible signature to identify topological phase regime in superconducting nanowires.</description>

      <title>Hidden phonon-assisted charge density wave transition in BaFe2Al9 revealed by ultrafast optical spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom is fundamental to charge density wave (CDW) formation, yet the microscopic origin often remains elusive. Here, we investigate the transient optical response of the intermetallic compound BaFe2Al9 using polarization-resolved ultrafast optical spectroscopy. We identify a discontinuous sign reversal in the transient reflectivity at Tc ~ 110 K, providing unambiguous evidence for the first-order transition. The anisotropic quasiparticle relaxation establishes the three-dimensional nature of the ordered state. Below Tc, a single coherent 1.6 THz oscillation appears abruptly and remains confined to the CDW phase. This mode exhibits weak temperature dependence with negligible softening and is absent in Raman spectra. First-principles calculations imply that it is a precursor phonon at the CDW wave vector with strong electron-phonon coupling. Our results indicate that the CDW in BaFe2Al9 arises from intertwined electronic and lattice instabilities, assisted by a displacive mechanism mediated by a hidden strongly coupled phonon, distinct from conventional amplitude-mode softening scenarios.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Pruning for Increased Robustness and Reduced Computational Overhead in Gaussian Process Accelerated Saddle Point Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a strategy for accelerating saddle point searches on high-dimensional energy surfaces by reducing the number of times the energy and its derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates need to be evaluated. The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization can, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also occur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well enough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using geometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using a summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point sampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations to avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made. Stability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable trust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the growth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes prove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational time on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published data set of chemical reactions. With these improvements, the GP approach is established as, a robust and scalable algorithm for accelerating saddle point searches when the evaluation of the energy and atomic forces requires significant computational effort.</description>

      <title>Frieze charge-stripes in a correlated kagome superconductor CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome metals have developed into a vibrant playground for materials physics, where geometric frustration, electronic correlations and band topology come together to create a variety of exotic phenomena. Recently synthesized CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ has provided a rare opportunity to explore unconventional superconductivity in a strongly correlated kagome system with hints of frustrated magnetism and quantum criticality. Using spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we reveal a cascade of density wave transitions with different symmetries in bulk single crystals of CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$. In particular, we discover a new electronic state $-$ a unidirectional density wave that breaks all mirror symmetries akin to a chiral density wave, but in contrast retains a mirror-glide symmetry. We term this state a frieze charge-stripe order phase, because its symmetry properties agree with one of the fundamental frieze symmetry groups. A combination of high-resolution imaging, Fourier analysis and theoretical simulations uncovers the crucial role of sublattice degrees of freedom in forming this phase, with internal chiral textures of opposite handedness. Our experiments reveal that superconductivity in CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ develops from a new type of a unidirectional density wave, and set the foundation for exploring electronic states with frieze symmetry groups in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Electricity at the macroscale and its microscopic origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I define the fields that describe electrical macrostructure, and their rates of change, in terms of the microscopic charge density, electric field, electric potential, and their rates of change. To deduce these definitions, I lay some new foundations of a theory of how observable macroscopic fields are related to spatial averages of their microscopic counterparts.
  I find that the relationships between macroscopic fields are identical in form to the relationships between their microscopic counterparts, meaning that the $\vec{P}$ and ${\vec{D}}$ fields do not appear in them. Without invoking quantum mechanics, I derive the expressions for polarization current established by the Modern Theory of Polarization. I prove that the bulk-average electric potential, or mean inner potential, vanishes in a macroscopically-uniform charge-neutral material, and I show that when a crystal lattice lacks inversion symmetry, it does not imply the existence of macroscopic $\vec{E}$ or $\vec{P}$ fields in the crystal's bulk.
  I point out that symmetry is scale-dependent. Therefore, if anisotropy of the microstructure does not manifest as anisotropy of the macrostructure, it cannot be the origin of a macroscopic vector field. The macroscopic charge density vanishes in a material's bulk. Therefore, regardless of the microstructure, a macroscopic $\vec{E}$ field cannot emanate from the bulk. I find that all relationships between observable macroscopic fields can be expressed mathematically without introducing the polarization ($\vec{P}$) and electric displacement ($\vec{D}$) fields, neither of which is observable. I also show that most `quantum mechanical' aspects of the existing microscopic theory of electricity in materials are compatible with, or required features of, a statistical theory of classical particles whose charges and masses are comparable to those of electrons and nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal structure generation is fundamental to materials science, enabling the discovery of novel materials with desired properties. While existing approaches leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) through extensive fine-tuning on materials databases, we show that pre-trained LLMs can inherently generate novel and stable crystal structures without additional fine-tuning. Our framework employs LLMs as intelligent proposal agents within an evolutionary pipeline that guides them to perform implicit crossover and mutation operations while maintaining chemical validity. We demonstrate that MatLLMSearch achieves a 78.38% metastable rate validated by machine learning interatomic potentials and 31.7% DFT-verified stability, outperforming specialized models such as CrystalTextLLM. Beyond crystal structure generation, we further demonstrate that our framework adapts to diverse materials design tasks, including crystal structure prediction and multi-objective optimization of properties such as deformation energy and bulk modulus, all without fine-tuning. These results establish our framework as a versatile and effective framework for consistent high-quality materials discovery, offering training-free generation of novel stable structures with reduced overhead and broader accessibility.</description>

      <title>Understanding phonon selection and interference in momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09792v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As momentum-resolved Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (q-EELS) becomes more widely used for phonon measurements, better understanding of the intricacies of the acquired signal is necessary. Selection rules limit the allowed scattering, which may prohibit the appearance of specific phonon branches for certain measurements. Simultaneous sampling of the lattice across all basis indices also warrants a coherent treatment of phonons, which yields a larger repeating unit in reciprocal space. We thus introduce the concept of the ``interferometric Brillouin zone'', which is closely related to the Dynamic Structure Factor. Both effects determine where phonon modes may be observed. Through a rigorous understanding of both, we introduce a new efficient method for simulating scattering experiments via Spectral Energy Density (SED) and/or Lattice Dynamics (LD) calculations and results are compared to established q-EELS simulation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the use of scattering selection rules on well-studied systems and explore the acquisition of a polarization-selective vibrational density of states.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear spin and orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects induced by a femtosecond laser pulse: Simulations for Au(001)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling gives rise to distinctive surface and interface phenomena, such as spin-momentum locking and spin splitting. In nonequilibrium settings, one of the key manifestations is the (Rashba-)Edelstein effect, where an electric current generates a net spin or orbital polarization perpendicular to the current direction. While the steady-state behavior of these effects is well studied, their dynamics on ultrafast timescales remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of the ultrafast spin and orbital Edelstein effects on an Au(001) surface, triggered by excitation with a femtosecond laser pulse. These effects are intrinsic and inherently nonlinear. Using a real-space tight-binding model combined with time evolution governed by the von Neumann equation, we simulate the electron dynamics in response to the pulse. Our results reveal pronounced differences between the spin and orbital responses, offering detailed insights into their distinct temporal profiles and magnitudes. We further explore the associated charge, spin, and orbital currents, including the emergence of laser-induced spin and orbital Hall effects. Finally, we quantify the angular momentum transfer mediated by the light-matter interaction. These findings shed light on the intricate ultrafast dynamics driven by spin-orbit coupling and offer guidance for the design of next-generation spintronic and orbitronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron transfer (ET) reactions underpin energy conversion and chemical transformations in both biological and abiological systems. The efficiency of any ET process relies on achieving a desired ET rate within an optimal driving force range. Marcus theory provides a microscopic framework for understanding the activation free energy, and thus the rate, of ET in terms of a key parameter: the reorganization energy. For electrified solid-liquid interfaces, it has long been conventionally understood that only factors in the electrolyte phase are responsible for determining the reorganization energy and the electronic density of states (DOS) of the electrode serves only to dictate the number of thermally accessible channels for ET. Here we show instead that the electrode DOS plays a central role in governing the reorganization energy, far outweighing its conventionally assumed role. Using atomically layered heterostructures, we tune the DOS of graphene and measure outer-sphere ET kinetics. We find the ensuing variation in ET rate arises from strong modulation in a reorganization energy associated with image potential localization in the electrode. This work redefines the traditional paradigm of heterogeneous ET kinetics, revealing a deeper role of the electrode electronic structure in interfacial reactivity.</description>

      <title>Role of nanoparticle shape on the critical size for quasi-uniform ordering: from spheres to cubes through superballs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equilibrium states of single-domain magnetite nanoparticles (NPs) result from a subtle interplay between size, geometry, and magnetocrystalline anisotropy. In this work, we present a micromagnetic study of shape-controlled magnetite NPs using the superball geometry, which provides a continuous interpolation between spheres and cubes. By isolating the influence of shape, we analyze the transition from quasi-uniform (single-domain) to vortex-like states as particle size increases, revealing critical sizes that depend on the superball exponent p. Our simulations show that faceted geometries promote the stabilization of vortex states at larger sizes, with marked distortions in the vortex core structure. The inclusion of cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy, representative of magnetite, further lowers the critical size and introduces preferential alignment along the [111] easy axes. For isotropic shapes, the critical size for this transition increases with p, ranging from ~49 nm for spheres to ~56 nm for cubes, in agreement with experimental trends. In contrast, the presence of slight particle elongation increases the critical size and induces another preferential alignment direction. These results demonstrate that even small deviations from sphericity or aspect ratio significantly alter the magnetic ordering and stability of equilibrium magnetic states.</description>

Abstract: Ultrathin nanowires could play a central role in next-generation downscaled electronics. Here, we explore some of the most promising candidates identified from previous high-throughput screening: CuC$_2$, TaSe$_3$, and AuSe$_2$, to gain insight into the thermodynamic and anharmonic behaviors of nanowires that could be exfoliated from weakly-bonded three-dimensional materials. We analyze thermal stability, linear thermal expansion, and anharmonic heat capacity using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. Notably, our work unveils exotic features common among all the 1D wires: a colossal record negative thermal expansion and very large deviations from the Dulong-Petit law due to strong anharmonicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heating a long-range ordered adsorbate phase beyond its stability temperature does not necessarily result in a disordered phase, it can also break up into heavily fluctuating ordered domains. Temporal and/or spatial averaging over these fluctuations may give the impression of both a wrong periodicity and a false local symmetry. This can happen even below liquid-nitrogen temperature, so that the true nature of the phase might remain undetected. We demonstrate this scenario at the catalytically active Rh(100) surface covered by 1/2 monolayer of oxygen, using quantitative low energy electron diffraction (LEED), variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT). Using the example of CO adsorption, we show that local symmetry can have a decisive influence on the binding energy and thus the chemical reactivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological polarization textures in ferroelectrics offer pathways to dense memory, neuromorphic computing, and controlled probes of topology in solids. In rhombohedral barium titanate, theory has identified stable antiskyrmions of topological charge -2 that fractionalize into six -1/3 hotspots, termed topological quarks. Here we extend this landscape to Zr-substituted barium titanate (BZT) using a first-principles parameterized effective Hamiltonian framework. In an ordered 12.5% composition, the chemically doubled periodicity enforces an alternation along [111]: one half hosts the -2 antiskyrmion (six -1/3 quarks), the other a +4 skyrmion (six +2/3 quarks). The two share the same six-vortex skeleton but differ by an integer +1 per vortex in the plane-integrated topological (slice) charge. In random BZT, nanodomains remain inducible and cryogenically stable, yet quenched disorder pins and distorts the vortices, producing a heterogeneous, skyrmion-glass-like state with fluctuations of the topological charge along the nanodomain axis. Thermal stability maps show that pure barium titanate retains -2 textures up to ~100 K, whereas in BZT the critical temperature is nonmonotonic, with a minimum near 6-8% Zr, reflecting competition between ferroelectric softening and disorder pinning. Importantly, the 12.5% ordered arrangement remains rhombohedral above 300 K, enabling field-stabilized nanodomains at 293 K. Under a local [111] bias, the ordered system carries +4 slice charge, while the random composition fragments under the same conditions. These results establish BZT as a platform for chemically programmed, fractionalized ferroelectric topology from cryogenic to room temperature and suggest routes to multistate, reconfigurable devices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Efficiency of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Calculations of Dynamic Response Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) constitutes an essential technique for diagnosing material properties under extreme conditions, such as high pressures and intense laser heating. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most accurate available ab initio methods for modeling XRTS spectra, as well as a host of other dynamic material properties. However, strong thermal excitations, along with the need to account for variations in temperature and density as well as the finite size of the detector significantly increase the computational cost of TDDFT simulations compared to ambient conditions. In this work, we present a broadly applicable method for optimizing and enhancing the efficiency of TDDFT calculations. Our approach is based on a one-to-one mapping between the dynamic structure factor and the imaginary time density--density correlation function, which naturally emerges in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum many-body theory. Specifically, we combine rigorous convergence tests in the imaginary time domain with a constraints-based noise attenuation technique to improve the efficiency of TDDFT modeling without the introduction of any significant bias. As a result, we can report a speed-up by up to an order of magnitude, thus potentially saving millions of CPU hours for modeling a single XRTS measurement of matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>AtomWorld: A Benchmark for Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models on Crystalline Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to develop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these abilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific workflows.</description>

      <title>Nodal-line semimetals and their variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) are a new family of topological materials characterized by electronic band crossings that form lines in the Brillouin zone. These NLSMs host exotic nodal-line structures and exhibit distinct features such as drumhead surface states and unique electromagnetic responses. This review classifies various NLSM types based on their nodal structures and protecting symmetries, highlighting that these nodal-line structures can form links, knots, and chains. We discuss their characteristic electromagnetic responses, including Landau level spectroscopy, optical conductivity, and permittivity. Furthermore, the strong correlation effects in these NLSMs modify their semimetallic phases and lead to novel quantum phases where magnetism and superconductivity intertwine.</description>

      <title>FreeBird.jl: An Extensible Toolbox for Simulating Interfacial Phase Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present FreeBird, an extensible Julia-based platform for computational studies of phase equilibria at generic interfaces. The package supports a range of system configurations, from atomistic solid surfaces to coarse-grained lattice$-$gas models, with energies evaluated using classical interatomic potentials or lattice Hamiltonians. Both atomistic and lattice systems accommodate single- or multi-component mixtures with flexibly definable surface and lattice geometries. Implemented sampling algorithms include nested sampling, Wang$-$Landau sampling, Metropolis Monte Carlo, and, for tractable lattice systems, exact enumeration. Leveraging Julia's type hierarchies and multiple dispatch, FreeBird provides a modular interface that allows seamless integration of system definitions, energy evaluators, and sampling schemes. Designed for flexibility, extensibility, and performance, FreeBird offers a versatile framework for exploring the thermodynamics of interfacial phenomena.</description>
