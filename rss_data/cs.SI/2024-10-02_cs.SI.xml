      <title>Optimizing Treatment Allocation in the Presence of Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Influence Maximization (IM), the objective is to -- given a budget -- select the optimal set of entities in a network to target with a treatment so as to maximize the total effect. For instance, in marketing, the objective is to target the set of customers that maximizes the total response rate, resulting from both direct treatment effects on targeted customers and indirect, spillover, effects that follow from targeting these customers. Recently, new methods to estimate treatment effects in the presence of network interference have been proposed. However, the issue of how to leverage these models to make better treatment allocation decisions has been largely overlooked. Traditionally, in Uplift Modeling (UM), entities are ranked according to estimated treatment effect, and the top entities are allocated treatment. Since, in a network context, entities influence each other, the UM ranking approach will be suboptimal. The problem of finding the optimal treatment allocation in a network setting is combinatorial and generally has to be solved heuristically. To fill the gap between IM and UM, we propose OTAPI: Optimizing Treatment Allocation in the Presence of Interference to find solutions to the IM problem using treatment effect estimates. OTAPI consists of two steps. First, a causal estimator is trained to predict treatment effects in a network setting. Second, this estimator is leveraged to identify an optimal treatment allocation by integrating it into classic IM algorithms. We demonstrate that this novel method outperforms classic IM and UM approaches on both synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>Graph Residual Noise Learner Network for Brain Connectivity Graph Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A morphological brain graph depicting a connectional fingerprint is of paramount importance for charting brain dysconnectivity patterns. Such data often has missing observations due to various reasons such as time-consuming and incomplete neuroimage processing pipelines. Thus, predicting a target brain graph from a source graph is crucial for better diagnosing neurological disorders with minimal data acquisition resources. Many brain graph generative models were proposed for promising results, yet they are mostly based on generative adversarial networks (GAN), which could suffer from mode collapse and require large training datasets. Recent developments in diffusion models address these problems by offering essential properties such as a stable training objective and easy scalability. However, applying a diffusion process to graph edges fails to maintain the topological symmetry of the brain connectivity matrices. To meet these challenges, we propose the Graph Residual Noise Learner Network (Grenol-Net), the first graph diffusion model for predicting a target graph from a source graph.</description>

      <title>Resonance Reduction Against Adversarial Attacks in Dynamic Networks via Eigenspectrum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonance is a well-known phenomenon that happens in systems with second order dynamics. In this paper we address the fundamental question of making a network robust to signal being periodically pumped into it at or near a resonant frequency by an adversarial agent with the aim of saturating the network with the signal. Towards this goal, we develop the notion of network vulnerability, which is measured by the expected resonance amplitude on the network under a stochastically modeled adversarial attack. Assuming a second order dynamics model based on the network graph Laplacian matrix and a known stochastic model for the adversarial attack, we propose two methods for minimizing the network vulnerability that leverage the principle of eigenspectrum optimization. We provide extensive numerical results analyzing the effects of both methods.</description>

Abstract: Social network analysis can answer research questions such as why or how individuals interact or form relationships and how those relationships impact other outcomes. Despite the breadth of methods available to address psychological research questions, social network analysis is not yet a standard practice in psychological research. To promote the use of social network analysis in psychological research, we present an overview of network methods, situating each method within the context of research studies and questions in psychology.</description>

      <title>Unifying a Public Software Ecosystem: How Omaolo Responded to the COVID-19 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public actors are often seen as slow, especially in renewing information systems, due to complex tendering and competition regulations, which delay decisions. This challenge is even greater in multi-company ecosystems. However, when faced with a common threat, the ecosystem needs to unite to face the challenge. This study explores how the Omaolo ecosystem in Finland evolved from traditional public-private cooperation to an alliance model during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2022. It highlights how the crisis accelerated changes in operations and collaboration between public and private participants, identifying key shifts, benefits, and challenges. Key findings include the removal of traditional barriers and the creation of an alliance approach that sped up the development of Omaolo's symptom assessment tool. This improved collaboration, service scalability, and responsiveness to healthcare needs despite the initial regulatory and stakeholder alignment challenges. The study concludes that crises can drive agile responses in public ecosystems. The new collaboration model helped Omaolo to adapt quickly to changing service demands, managing healthcare patient loads more effectively. These findings highlight the value of flexible, collaborative strategies for responding to emergencies in public software ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Discriminative community detection for multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplex networks have emerged as a promising approach for modeling complex systems, where each layer represents a different mode of interaction among entities of the same type. A core task in analyzing these networks is to identify the community structure for a better understanding of the overall functioning of the network. While different methods have been proposed to detect the community structure of multiplex networks, the majority deal with extracting the consensus community structure across layers. In this paper, we address the community detection problem across two closely related multiplex networks. For example in neuroimaging studies, it is common to have multiple multiplex brain networks where each layer corresponds to an individual and each group to different experimental conditions. In this setting, one may be interested in both learning the community structure representing each experimental condition and the discriminative community structure between two groups. In this paper, we introduce two discriminative community detection algorithms based on spectral clustering. The first approach aims to identify the discriminative subgraph structure between the groups, while the second one learns the discriminative and the consensus community structures, simultaneously. The proposed approaches are evaluated on both simulated and real world multiplex networks.</description>

      <title>Early Career Citations Capture Judicial Idiosyncrasies and Predict Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Judicial impartiality is a cornerstone of well-functioning legal systems. We assemble a dataset of 112,312 civil lawsuits in U.S. District Courts to study the effect of extraneous factors on judicial decision making. We show that cases are randomly assigned to judges and that biographical judge features are predictive of judicial decisions. We use low-dimensional representations of judges' early-career citation records as generic representations of judicial idiosyncrasies. These predict future judgments with accuracies exceeding 65% for high-confidence predictions on balanced out-of-sample test cases. For 6-8% of judges, these representations are significant predictors across all judgments. These findings indicate that a small but significant group of judges routinely relies on extraneous factors and careful vetting of judges prior to appointment may partially address this issue. Our use of low-dimensional representations of citation records may also be generalized to other jurisdictions or to study other aspects of judicial decision making.</description>

      <title>Epidemiology-Aware Neural ODE with Continuous Disease Transmission Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective epidemic forecasting is critical for public health strategies and efficient medical resource allocation, especially in the face of rapidly spreading infectious diseases. However, existing deep-learning methods often overlook the dynamic nature of epidemics and fail to account for the specific mechanisms of disease transmission. In response to these challenges, we introduce an innovative end-to-end framework called Epidemiology-Aware Neural ODE with Continuous Disease Transmission Graph (EARTH) in this paper. To learn continuous and regional disease transmission patterns, we first propose EANO, which seamlessly integrates the neural ODE approach with the epidemic mechanism, considering the complex spatial spread process during epidemic evolution. Additionally, we introduce GLTG to model global infection trends and leverage these signals to guide local transmission dynamically. To accommodate both the global coherence of epidemic trends and the local nuances of epidemic transmission patterns, we build a cross-attention approach to fuse the most meaningful information for forecasting. Through the smooth synergy of both components, EARTH offers a more robust and flexible approach to understanding and predicting the spread of infectious diseases. Extensive experiments show EARTH superior performance in forecasting real-world epidemics compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at https://github.com/Emory-Melody/EpiLearn.</description>

      <title>Delving Deep into Engagement Prediction of Short Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling the popularity of User Generated Content (UGC) short videos on social media platforms presents a critical challenge with broad implications for content creators and recommendation systems. This study delves deep into the intricacies of predicting engagement for newly published videos with limited user interactions. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that Mean Opinion Scores from previous video quality assessment datasets do not strongly correlate with video engagement levels. To address this, we introduce a substantial dataset comprising 90,000 real-world UGC short videos from Snapchat. Rather than relying on view count, average watch time, or rate of likes, we propose two metrics: normalized average watch percentage (NAWP) and engagement continuation rate (ECR) to describe the engagement levels of short videos. Comprehensive multi-modal features, including visual content, background music, and text data, are investigated to enhance engagement prediction. With the proposed dataset and two key metrics, our method demonstrates its ability to predict engagements of short videos purely from video content.</description>

      <title>$k$-local Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2017 Day et al. introduced the notion of locality as a structural complexity-measure for patterns in the field of pattern matching established by Angluin in 1980. In 2019 Casel et al. showed that determining the locality of an arbitrary pattern is NP-complete. Inspired by hierarchical clustering, we extend the notion to coloured graphs, i.e., given a coloured graph determine an enumeration of the colours such that colouring the graph stepwise according to the enumeration leads to as few clusters as possible. Next to first theoretical results on graph classes, we propose a priority search algorithm to compute the $k$-locality of a graph. The algorithm is optimal in the number of marking prefix expansions, and is faster by orders of magnitude than an exhaustive search. Finally, we perform a case study on a DBLP subgraph to demonstrate the potential of $k$-locality for knowledge discovery.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Web Spam Detection through a Blockchain-Enabled Crowdsourcing Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of spam on the Web has necessitated the development of machine learning models to automate their detection. However, the dynamic nature of spam and the sophisticated evasion techniques employed by spammers often lead to low accuracy in these models. Traditional machine-learning approaches struggle to keep pace with spammers' constantly evolving tactics, resulting in a persistent challenge to maintain high detection rates. To address this, we propose blockchain-enabled incentivized crowdsourcing as a novel solution to enhance spam detection systems. We create an incentive mechanism for data collection and labeling by leveraging blockchain's decentralized and transparent framework. Contributors are rewarded for accurate labels and penalized for inaccuracies, ensuring high-quality data. A smart contract governs the submission and evaluation process, with participants staking cryptocurrency as collateral to guarantee integrity. Simulations show that incentivized crowdsourcing improves data quality, leading to more effective machine-learning models for spam detection. This approach offers a scalable and adaptable solution to the challenges of traditional methods.</description>

      <title>"I don't trust them": Exploring Perceptions of Fact-checking Entities for Flagging Online Misinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spread of misinformation through online social media platforms has had substantial societal consequences. As a result, platforms have introduced measures to alert users of news content that may be misleading or contain inaccuracies as a means to discourage them from sharing it. These interventions sometimes cite external sources, such as fact-checking organizations and news outlets, for providing assessments related to the accuracy of the content. However, it is unclear whether users trust the assessments provided by these entities and whether perceptions vary across different topics of news. We conducted an online study with 655 US participants to explore user perceptions of eight categories of fact-checking entities across two misinformation topics, as well as factors that may impact users' perceptions. We found that participants' opinions regarding the trustworthiness and bias of the entities varied greatly, aligning largely with their political preference. However, just the presence of a fact-checking label appeared to discourage participants from sharing the headlines studied. Our results hint at the need for further exploring fact-checking entities that may be perceived as neutral, as well as the potential for incorporating multiple assessments in such labels.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Online Toxicity During the 2022 Mpox Outbreak: A Computational Analysis of Topical and Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Online toxicity, encompassing behaviors such as harassment, bullying, hate speech, and the dissemination of misinformation, has become a pressing social concern in the digital age. The 2022 Mpox outbreak, initially termed "Monkeypox" but subsequently renamed to mitigate associated stigmas and societal concerns, serves as a poignant backdrop to this issue. Objective: In this research, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of the toxic online discourse surrounding the 2022 Mpox outbreak. Our objective is to dissect its origins, characterize its nature and content, trace its dissemination patterns, and assess its broader societal implications, with the goal of providing insights that can inform strategies to mitigate such toxicity in future crises. Methods: We collected more than 1.6 million unique tweets and analyzed them from five dimensions, including context, extent, content, speaker, and intent. Utilizing BERT-based topic modeling and social network community clustering, we delineated the toxic dynamics on Twitter. Results: We identified five high-level topic categories in the toxic online discourse on Twitter, including disease (46.6%), health policy and healthcare (19.3%), homophobia (23.9%), politics (6.0%), and racism (4.1%). Through the toxicity diffusion networks of mentions, retweets, and the top users, we found that retweets of toxic content were widespread, while influential users rarely engaged with or countered this toxicity through retweets. Conclusions: By tracking topical dynamics, we can track the changing popularity of toxic content online, providing a better understanding of societal challenges. Network dynamics spotlight key social media influencers and their intents, indicating that addressing these central figures in toxic discourse can enhance crisis communication and inform policy-making.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks for Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new scattering networks for signals measured on simplicial complexes, which we call \emph{Multiscale Hodge Scattering Networks} (MHSNs). Our construction is based on multiscale basis dictionaries on simplicial complexes, i.e., the $\kappa$-GHWT and $\kappa$-HGLET, which we recently developed for simplices of dimension $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$ in a given simplicial complex by generalizing the node-based Generalized Haar-Walsh Transform (GHWT) and Hierarchical Graph Laplacian Eigen Transform (HGLET). The $\kappa$-GHWT and the $\kappa$-HGLET both form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs use a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to cascade the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation that is akin to local pooling in CNNs, and which may be performed either locally or per-scale. These pooling operations are harder to define in both traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets, and geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, we are able to extract a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be used along with very simple machine learning methods (i.e., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification systems with far fewer parameters to train than most modern graph neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our MHSNs in three distinct types of problems: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction.</description>

Abstract: Scientific datasets play a crucial role in contemporary data-driven research, as they allow for the progress of science by facilitating the discovery of new patterns and phenomena. This mounting demand for empirical research raises important questions on how strategic data utilization in research projects can stimulate scientific advancement. In this study, we examine the hypothesis inspired by the recombination theory, which suggests that innovative combinations of existing knowledge, including the use of unusual combinations of datasets, can lead to high-impact discoveries. Focusing on social science, we investigate the scientific outcomes of such atypical data combinations in more than 30,000 publications that leverage over 5,000 datasets curated within one of the largest social science databases, ICPSR. This study offers four important insights. First, combining datasets, particularly those infrequently paired, significantly contributes to both scientific and broader impacts (e.g., dissemination to the general public). Second, infrequently paired datasets maintain a strong association with citation even after controlling for the atypicality of dataset topics. In contrast, the atypicality of dataset topics has a much smaller positive impact on citation counts. Third, smaller and less experienced research teams tend to use atypical combinations of datasets in research more frequently than their larger and more experienced counterparts. Lastly, despite the benefits of data combination, papers that amalgamate data remain infrequent. This finding suggests that the unconventional combination of datasets is an under-utilized but powerful strategy correlated with the scientific impact and broader dissemination of scientific discoveries</description>
