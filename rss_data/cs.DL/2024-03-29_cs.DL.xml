      <title>Unleashing the Power of AI. A Systematic Review of Cutting-Edge Techniques in AI-Enhanced Scientometrics, Webometrics, and Bibliometrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The study aims to analyze the synergy of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with scientometrics, webometrics, and bibliometrics to unlock and to emphasize the potential of the applications and benefits of AI algorithms in these fields.
  Design/methodology/approach: By conducting a systematic literature review, our aim is to explore the potential of AI in revolutionizing the methods used to measure and analyze scholarly communication, identify emerging research trends, and evaluate the impact of scientific publications. To achieve this, we implemented a comprehensive search strategy across reputable databases such as ProQuest, IEEE Explore, EBSCO, Web of Science, and Scopus. Our search encompassed articles published from January 1, 2000, to September 2022, resulting in a thorough review of 61 relevant articles.
  Findings: (i) Regarding scientometrics, the application of AI yields various distinct advantages, such as conducting analyses of publications, citations, research impact prediction, collaboration, research trend analysis, and knowledge mapping, in a more objective and reliable framework. (ii) In terms of webometrics, AI algorithms are able to enhance web crawling and data collection, web link analysis, web content analysis, social media analysis, web impact analysis, and recommender systems. (iii) Moreover, automation of data collection, analysis of citations, disambiguation of authors, analysis of co-authorship networks, assessment of research impact, text mining, and recommender systems are considered as the potential of AI integration in the field of bibliometrics.
  Originality/value: This study covers the particularly new benefits and potential of AI-enhanced scientometrics, webometrics, and bibliometrics to highlight the significant prospects of the synergy of this integration through AI.</description>

      <title>On The Peer Review Reports: Does Size Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amidst the ever-expanding realm of scientific production and the proliferation of predatory journals, the focus on peer review remains paramount for scientometricians and sociologists of science. Despite this attention, there is a notable scarcity of empirical investigations into the tangible impact of peer review on publication quality. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis of how peer review contributes to the quality of scholarly publications, as measured by the citations they receive.Utilizing an adjusted dataset comprising 57,482 publications from Publons to Web of Science and employing the Raking Ratio method, our study reveals intriguing insights. Specifically, our findings shed light on a nuanced relationship between the length of reviewer reports and the subsequent citations received by publications. Through a robust regression analysis, we establish that, beginning from 947 words, the length of reviewer reports is significantly associated with an increase in citations.These results not only confirm the initial hypothesis that longer reports indicate requested improvements, thereby enhancing the quality and visibility of articles, but also underscore the importance of timely and comprehensive reviewer reports. Furthermore, insights from Publons' data suggest that open access to reports can influence reviewer behavior, encouraging more detailed reports.Beyond the scholarly landscape, our findings prompt a reevaluation of the role of reviewers, emphasizing the need to recognize and value this resource-intensive yet underappreciated activity in institutional evaluations. Additionally, the study sounds a cautionary note regarding the challenges faced by peer review in the context of an increasing volume of submissions, potentially compromising the vigilance of peers in swiftly assessing numerous articles.</description>

      <title>Understanding Archives: Towards New Research Interfaces Relying on the Semantic Annotation of Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digitisation campaigns carried out by libraries and archives in recent years have facilitated access to documents in their collections. However, exploring and exploiting these documents remain difficult tasks due to the sheer quantity of documents available for consultation. In this article, we show how the semantic annotation of the textual content of study corpora of archival documents allow to facilitate their exploitation and valorisation. First, we present a methodological framework for the construction of new interfaces based on textual semantics, then address the current technological obstacles and their potential solutions. We conclude by presenting a practical case of the application of this framework.</description>

      <title>University Students Motives and Challenges in Utilising Institutional Repository Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the core functions of an academic institution is to generate knowledge, disseminate it to the intended audiences, and preserve it for future use. Academic institutions are now establishing Institutional Repositories (IRs) to collect produced resources to facilitate accessibility, dissemination, utilization, and management of intellectual materials produced within an institution. This study aimed to assess postgraduate students motives for utilizing IR resources and the challenges they encounter when utilizing IR resources at the University of Dar es Salaam. This study was conducted using a descriptive study design whereby it used both qualitative and quantitative research approaches. The population of this study comprised postgraduate students, librarians, and ICT personnel from the University of Dar es Salaam. A sample of 102 respondents was drawn conveniently and purposively for this study. Data were collected through questionnaires, interviews, as well as a review of documentary sources. Quantitative data were analyzed through a Version 16 Statistics Package for Social Science and qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis. The findings indicate that access to fulltext documents, the relevance of IR resources, and easy searching of the materials in the repository system motivate the utilization of IR resources. However, several challenges impede the utilization of these resources including unreliable internet access, inaccessibility of full-text and lack of guiding policy have been revealed as the major challenges toward utilization of IR resources. The study recommends training postgraduate students on the general use of IRs. Also, the University management should develop an IR policy that will guide the utilization of IR resources</description>
