      <title>On the impossibility of detecting a late change-point in the preferential attachment random graph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of late change-point detection under the preferential attachment random graph model with time dependent attachment function. This can be formulated as a hypothesis testing problem where the null hypothesis corresponds to a preferential attachment model with a constant affine attachment parameter $\delta_0$ and the alternative corresponds to a preferential attachment model where the affine attachment parameter changes from $\delta_0$ to $\delta_1$ at a time $\tau_n = n - \Delta_n$ where $0\leq \Delta_n \leq n$ and $n$ is the size of the graph. It was conjectured in Bet et al. that when observing only the unlabeled graph, detection of the change is not possible for $\Delta_n = o(n^{1/2})$. In this work, we make a step towards proving the conjecture by proving the impossibility of detecting the change when $\Delta_n = o(n^{1/3})$. We also study change-point detection in the case where the labelled graph is observed and show that change-point detection is possible if and only if $\Delta_n \to \infty$, thereby exhibiting a strong difference between the two settings.</description>

      <title>Usual stochastic orderings of the second-order statistics with dependent heterogeneous semi-parametric distribution random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript investigates the stochastic comparisons of the second-order statistics from dependent and heterogeneous general semi-parametric family of distributions observations. Some sufficient conditions on the usual stochastic order of the second-order statistics from dependent and heterogeneous observations are established under the p-larger order and the reciprocally majorization order. Some numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical findings. In addition, the results of the Theorem are applied to two important models. Finally, we use a group of real data for empirical analysis to carry out reliability analysis.</description>

      <title>Bernoulli amputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An approach to amputation, the process of introducing missing values to a complete dataset, is presented. It allows to construct missingness indicators in a flexible and principled way via copulas and Bernoulli margins and to incorporate dependence in missingness patterns. Besides more classical missingness models such as missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random, the approach is able to model structured missingness such as block missingness and, via mixtures, monotone missingness, which are patterns of missing data frequently found in real-life datasets. Properties such as joint missingness probabilities or missingness correlation are derived mathematically. The approach is demonstrated with mathematical examples and empirical illustrations in terms of a well-known dataset.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation of Polychoric Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polychoric correlation is often an important building block in the analysis of rating data, particularly for structural equation models. However, the commonly employed maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is highly susceptible to misspecification of the polychoric correlation model, for instance through violations of latent normality assumptions. We propose a novel estimator that is designed to be robust to partial misspecification of the polychoric model, that is, the model is only misspecified for an unknown fraction of observations, for instance (but not limited to) careless respondents. In contrast to existing literature, our estimator makes no assumption on the type or degree of model misspecification. It furthermore generalizes ML estimation and is consistent as well as asymptotically normally distributed. We demonstrate the robustness and practical usefulness of our estimator in simulation studies and an empirical application on a Big Five administration. In the latter, the polychoric correlation estimates of our estimator and ML differ substantially, which, after further inspection, is likely due to the presence of careless respondents that the estimator helps identify.</description>

      <title>Multi-Channel Factor Analysis: Identifiability and Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work by Ram\'irez et al. [2] has introduced Multi-Channel Factor Analysis (MFA) as an extension of factor analysis to multi-channel data that allows for latent factors common to all channels as well as factors specific to each channel. This paper validates the MFA covariance model and analyzes the statistical properties of the MFA estimators. In particular, a thorough investigation of model identifiability under varying latent factor structures is conducted, and sufficient conditions for generic global identifiability of MFA are obtained. The development of these identifiability conditions enables asymptotic analysis of estimators obtained by maximizing a Gaussian likelihood, which are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal even under misspecification of the latent factor distribution.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Normality of the Conditional Value-at-Risk based Pickands Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pickands estimator for the extreme value index is beneficial due to its universal consistency, location, and scale invariance, which sets it apart from other types of estimators. However, similar to many extreme value index estimators, it is marked by poor asymptotic efficiency. Chen (2021) introduces a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)-based Pickands estimator, establishes its consistency, and demonstrates through simulations that this estimator significantly reduces mean squared error while preserving its location and scale invariance. The initial focus of this paper is on demonstrating the weak convergence of the empirical CVaR in functional space. Subsequently, based on the established weak convergence, the paper presents the asymptotic normality of the CVaR-based Pickands estimator. It further supports these theoretical findings with empirical evidence obtained through simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Online Differentially Private Synthetic Data Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a polynomial-time algorithm for online differentially private synthetic data generation. For a data stream within the hypercube $[0,1]^d$ and an infinite time horizon, we develop an online algorithm that generates a differentially private synthetic dataset at each time $t$. This algorithm achieves a near-optimal accuracy bound of $O(\log(t)t^{-1/d})$ for $d\geq 2$ and $O(\log^{4.5}(t)t^{-1})$ for $d=1$ in the 1-Wasserstein distance. This result extends the previous work on the continual release model for counting queries to Lipschitz queries. Compared to the offline case, where the entire dataset is available at once, our approach requires only an extra polylog factor in the accuracy bound.</description>
