      <title>Diversity in Network-Friendly Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the Internet has been dominated by content-rich platforms, employing recommendation systems to provide users with more appealing content (e.g., videos in YouTube, movies in Netflix). While traditional content recommendations are oblivious to network conditions, the paradigm of Network-Friendly Recommendations (NFR) has recently emerged, favoring content that improves network performance (e.g. cached near the user), while still being appealing to the user. However, NFR algorithms sometimes achieve their goal by shrinking the pool of content recommended to users. The undesirable side-effect is reduced content diversity, a phenomenon known as ``content/filter bubble''. This reduced diversity is problematic for both users, who are prevented from exploring a broader range of content, and content creators (e.g. YouTubers) whose content may be recommended less frequently, leading to perceived unfairness. In this paper, we first investigate - using real data and state-of-the-art NFR schemes - the extent of this phenomenon. We then formulate a ``Diverse-NFR'' optimization problem (i.e., network-friendly recommendations with - sufficient - content diversity), and through a series of transformation steps, we manage to reduce it to a linear program that can be solved fast and optimally. Our findings show that Diverse-NFR can achieve high network gains (comparable to non-diverse NFR) while maintaining diversity constraints. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that incorporates diversity issues into network-friendly recommendation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Inducing Semi-Structured Sparsity by Masking for Efficient Model Inference in Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crucial role of convolutional models, both as standalone vision models and backbones in foundation models, necessitates effective acceleration techniques. This paper proposes a novel method to learn semi-structured sparsity patterns for convolution kernels in the form of maskings enabling the utilization of readily available hardware accelerations. The approach accelerates convolutional models more than two-fold during inference without decreasing model performance. At the same time, the original model weights and structure remain unchanged keeping the model thus easily updatable. Beyond the immediate practical use, the effect of maskings on prediction is easily quantifiable. Therefore, guarantees on model predictions under maskings are derived showing stability bounds for learned maskings even after updating the original underlying model.</description>
