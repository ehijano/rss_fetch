      <title>On induced subgraphs of $H(n,3)$ with maximum degree $1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider induced subgraphs of the Hamming graph $H(n,3)$. We show that if $U \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_3^n$ and $U$ induces a subgraph of $H(n,3)$ with maximum degree at most $1$ then
  1. If $U$ is disjoint from a maximum size independent set of $H(n,3)$ then $|U| \leq 3^{n-1}+1$. Moreover, all such $U$ with size $3^{n-1}+1$ are isomorphic to each other.
  2. For $n \geq 6$, there exists such a $U$ with size $|U| = 3^{n-1}+18$ and this is optimal for $n = 6$.
  3. If $U \cap \{x, x+e_1, x+2e_1\} \ne \phi$ for all $x \in \mathbb{Z}_3^n$ then $|U| \leq 3^{n-1} + 729$.</description>

      <title>On the minimum spectral radius of connected graphs of given order and size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a question of Hong from 1993 related to the minimum spectral radii of the adjacency matrices of connected graphs of given order and size. Hong asked if it is true that among all connected graphs of given number of vertices $n$ and number of edges $e$, the graphs having minimum spectral radius (the minimizer graphs) must be almost regular, meaning that the difference between their maximum degree and their minimum degree is at most one. In this paper, we answer Hong's question positively for various values of $n$ and $e$ and in several cases, we determined the graphs with minimum spectral radius.</description>

      <title>Remoteness of graphs with given size and connectivity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite, simple connected graph. The average distance of a vertex $v$ of $G$ is the arithmetic mean of the distances from $v$ to all other vertices of $G$. The remoteness $\rho(G)$ of $G$ is the maximum of the average distances of the vertices of $G$.
  In this paper, we give sharp upper bounds on the remoteness of a graph of given order, connectivity and size. We also obtain corresponding bound s for $2$-edge-connected and $3$-edge-connected graphs, and bounds in terms of order and size for triangle-free graphs.</description>

      <title>The generalized 4-connectivity of godan graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized $k$-connectivity of a graph $G$, denoted by $\kappa_k(G)$, is the minimum number of internally edge disjoint $S$-trees for any $S\subseteq V(G)$ and $|S|=k$. The generalized $k$-connectivity is a natural extension of the classical connectivity and plays a key role in applications related to the modern interconnection networks. The godan graph $EA_n$ is a kind of Cayley graphs which posses many desirable properties. In this paper, we shall study the generalized 4-connectivity of $EA_n$ and show that $\kappa_4(EA_n)=n-1$ for $n\ge 3$.</description>

      <title>Flexipaths in matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the unavoidable minors of large 3-connected matroids were found nearly thirty years ago, there has been little progress on solving the corresponding problem for large 4-connected matroids. This paper aims to take a step towards solving that problem. The objects of study here are 4-paths, that is, sequences $(L, P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n, R)$ of sets that partition the ground set of a matroid so that the union of any proper initial segment of parts is 4-separating. Viewing the ends L and R as fixed, we call such a partition a 4-flexipath if $(L, Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_n, R)$ is a 4-path for all permutations $(Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_n)$ of $(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n)$. A straightforward simplification enables us to focus on $(4,c)$-flexipaths for some $c$ in $\{1,2,3\}$, that is, those 4-flexipaths for which $\lambda(Q_i) = c$ and $\lambda(Q_i \cup Q_j) &gt; c$ for all distinct $i$ and $j$. Our main result is that the only non-trivial case that arises here is when $c = 2$. In that case, there are essentially only two possible dual pairs of $(4,c)$-flexipaths when $n \geq 5$. A key technique in the proof of this result is of independent interest. We construct the clonal core of a partitioned matroid. From the relatively simple structure of this clonal core, we can deduce many properties of the original partitioned matroid from the local connectivities between unions of parts of the partition.</description>

      <title>Tropical hyperplane arrangements and combinatorial mutations of the matching field polytopes of Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sequence of combinatorial mutations of matching field polytopes preserves the property of giving rise to a toric degeneration of Grassmannians. In this paper, we find a way to check that two matching field polytopes are combinatorial mutation equivalence using tropical hyperplane arrangements, ``literally at a glance". Our way can prove that block diagonal matching fields are combinatorial mutations equivalent to diagonal matching fields. This is one of main results in \cite{clarke2021combinatorial}. Our result can be regarded as a generalization of that result.</description>

      <title>Connectoids II: existence of normal trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this series we introduce and investigate the concept of connectoids, which captures the connectivity structure of various discrete objects like undirected graphs, directed graphs, bidirected graphs, hypergraphs or finitary matroids.
  In the first paper of this series we developed a universal end space theory based on connectoids that unifies the existing end spaces of undirected and directed graphs. Further, we introduced a notion of normal trees of connectoids which represents the ends of connectoids as normal trees do in undirected graphs.
  In this paper we show that our notion of normal trees generalises normal trees of undirected graphs to connectoids by characterising their existence: We extend Jung's famous characterisation via dispersed sets to connectoids, and show that normal spanning trees exist if they exist in some neighbourhood of each end. Furthermore, we show that a connectoid has a normal spanning tree if and only if its groundset can be well-ordered in a certain way, called countable separation number.
  In this way we establish a unified notion of normal trees for undirected, directed and bidirected graphs, as well as for hypergraphs and finitary matroids.</description>

      <title>Sharing tea on a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the analysis of consensus formation in the Deffuant model for social interaction, we consider the following procedure on a graph $G$. Initially, there is one unit of tea at a fixed vertex $r \in V(G)$, and all other vertices have no tea. At any time in the procedure, we can choose a connected subset of vertices $T$ and equalize the amount of tea among vertices in $T$. We prove that if $x \in V(G)$ is at distance $d$ from $r$, then $x$ will have at most $\frac{1}{d+1}$ units of tea during any step of the procedure. This bound is best possible and answers a question of Gantert.
  We also consider arbitrary initial weight distributions. For every finite graph $G$ and $w \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{V(G)}$, we prove that the set of weight distributions reachable from $w$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{V(G)}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$ and a constant $\alpha&gt;0$, we denote by $C_{\alpha}(G)$ the minimum order of a subgraph $H\subseteq G$ with $d(H)\ge \alpha d(G)$. Liu and Montgomery conjectured that every graph $G$ contains $K_{\Omega(t)}$ as a subdivision for $t=\min \{d(G), \sqrt{\tfrac{C_{\alpha}(G)}{\log C_{\alpha}(G)}}\}$. In the paper, we prove this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Planar Cycle-Extendable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For most problems pertaining to perfect matchings, one may restrict attention to matching covered graphs -- that is, connected nontrivial graphs with the property that each edge belongs to some perfect matching. There is extensive literature on these graphs that are also known as $1$-extendable graphs (since each edge extends to a perfect matching) including an ear decomposition theorem due to Lovasz and Plummer.
  A cycle $C$ of a graph $G$ is conformal if $G-V(C)$ has a perfect matching; such cycles play an important role in the study of perfect matchings, especially when investigating the Pfaffian orientation problem. A matching covered graph $G$ is cycle-extendable if -- for each even cycle $C$ -- the cycle $C$ is conformal, or equivalently, each perfect matching of $C$ extends to a perfect matching of $G$, or equivalently, $C$ is the symmetric difference of two perfect matchings of $G$, or equivalently, $C$ extends to an ear decomposition of $G$. In the literature, these are also known as cycle-nice or as $1$-cycle resonant graphs.
  Zhang, Wang, Yuan, Ng and Cheng [Discrete Mathematics, 345:7 (2022), 112876] provided a characterization of claw-free cycle-extendable graphs. Guo and Zhang [Discrete Mathematics, 275:1-3 (2004), 151-164] and independently Zhang and Li [Discrete Applied Mathematics, 160:13-14 (2012), 2069-2074], provided characterizations of bipartite planar cycle-extendable graphs. In this paper, we establish a characterization of all planar cycle-extendable graphs -- in terms of $K_2$ and four infinite families.</description>

      <title>A tame vs. feral dichotomy for graph classes excluding an induced minor or induced topological minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A minimal separator in a graph is an inclusion-minimal set of vertices that separates some fixed pair of nonadjacent vertices. A graph class is said to be tame if there exists a polynomial upper bound for the number of minimal separators of every graph in the class, and feral if it contains arbitrarily large graphs with exponentially many minimal separators. Building on recent works of Gartland and Lokshtanov [SODA 2023] and Gajarsk\'y, Jaffke, Lima, Novotn\'a, Pilipczuk, Rz\k{a}\.zewski, and Souza [arXiv, 2022], we show that every graph class defined by a single forbidden induced minor or induced topological minor is either tame or feral, and classify the two cases. This leads to new graph classes in which Maximum Weight Independent Set and many other problems are solvable in polynomial time. We complement the classification results with polynomial-time recognition algorithms for the maximal tame graph classes appearing in the obtained classifications.</description>

      <title>On Energy of Graphs with Self-Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G be a simple graph on n vertices with vertex set V(G). The energy of G, denoted by, $\mathcal{E}(G)$ is the sum of all absolute values of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix $A(G)$. It is the first eigenvalue-based topological molecular index and is related to the molecular orbital energy levels of ${\pi}$-electrons in conjugated hydrocarbons. Recently, the concept of energy of a graph is extended to a self-loop graph. Let $S$ be a subset of $V(G)$. The graph $G_S$ is obtained from the graph $G$ by attaching a self-loop at each of the vertices of $G$ which are in the set $S$. The energy of the self-loop graph $G_S$, denoted by $\mathcal{E}(G_S)$, is the sum of all absolute eigenvalues of the matrix $A(G_S)$. Two non-isomorphic self-loop graphs are equienergetic if their energies are equal. Akbari et al. (2023)conjectured that there exist a subset $S$ of $V(G)$ such that $\mathcal(G_S) &gt; \mathcal{E}(G)$. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture. Also, we construct pairs of equienergetic self-loop graphs of order 24n for all n \ge 1.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a discretisation of the de Rham-Hodge theory in the two-dimensional case based on a discrete exterior calculus framework. We present discrete analogues of the Hodge-Dirac and Laplace operators in which key geometric aspects of the continuum counterpart are captured. We provide and prove a discrete version of the Hodge decomposition theorem. Special attention has been paid to discrete models on a combinatorial torus. In this particular case, we also define and calculate the cohomology groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{P}_{2n+2}$ be the regular polygon with $2n+2$ vertices, and let $\theta$ be the rotation of 180$^\circ$. Fomin and Zelevinsky showed that $\theta$-invariant triangulations of $\mathbf{P}_{2n+2}$ are in bijection with the clusters of cluster algebras of type $B_n$ or $C_n$. Moreover, cluster variables correspond to the orbits of the action of $\theta$ on the diagonals of $\mathbf{P}_{2n+2}$. In this paper, we associate a labeled modified snake graph $\mathcal{G}_{ab}$ to each $\theta$-orbit $[a,b]$, and we get the cluster variables of type $B_n$ and $C_n$ which correspond to $[a,b]$ as perfect matching Laurent polynomials of $\mathcal{G}_{ab}$. This extends the work of Musiker for cluster algebras of type B and C to every seed.</description>

      <title>A classification model based on a population of hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel hypergraph classification algorithm. The use of hypergraphs in this framework has been widely studied. In previous work, hypergraph models are typically constructed using distance or attribute based methods. That is, hyperedges are generated by connecting a set of samples which are within a certain distance or have a common attribute. These methods however, do not often focus on multi-way interactions directly. The algorithm provided in this paper looks to address this problem by constructing hypergraphs which explore multi-way interactions of any order. We also increase the performance and robustness of the algorithm by using a population of hypergraphs. The algorithm is evaluated on two datasets, demonstrating promising performance compared to a generic random forest classification algorithm.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a construction method for interlocking assemblies based on planar crystallographic symmetries. Planar crystallographic groups, also known as wallpaper groups, correspond to tessellations of the plane with a tile, called a fundamental domain, such that the action of the group can be used to tessellate the plane with the given tile. The main idea of this method is to extend the action of a wallpaper group so that it acts on three-dimensional space and places two fundamental domains into parallel planes. Next, we interpolate between these domains to obtain a block that serves as a candidate for interlocking assemblies. We show that the resulting blocks can be triangulated, and we can also approximate blocks with smooth surfaces using this approach. Finally, we show that there exists a family of blocks derived from this construction that can be tiled in multiple ways, characterised by generalised Truchet tiles. The assemblies of one block in this family, which we call RhomBlock, correspond to tessellations with lozenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an explicit isomorphism between an open subset in the open positroid variety $\Pi_{k,n}^{\circ}$ in the Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(k,n)$ and the product of two open positroid varieties $\Pi_{k,n-a+1}^{\circ}\times \Pi_{k,a+k-1}^{\circ}$. In the respective cluster structures, this isomorphism is given by freezing a certain subset of cluster variables and applying a cluster quasi-equivalence.</description>

      <title>A skew Specht perspective of RoCK blocks and cuspidal systems for KLR algebras in affine type A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cuspidal systems parameterize KLR algebra representations via root partitions $\pi$, where simple modules $L(\pi)$ arise as heads of proper standard modules. Working in affine type A with an arbitrary convex preorder, we construct explicit skew diagrams $\zeta(\pi)$ such that the skew Specht module $S^{\zeta(\pi)}$ has simple head $L(\pi)$ and a filtration by proper standard modules. This result arises from an in-depth study of the combinatorial interplay between cuspidal systems and RoCK cyclotomic KLR algebras.</description>

      <title>A Note on Fractional DP-Coloring of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.03416v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DP-coloring (also called correspondence coloring) is a generalization of list coloring introduced by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle in 2015. In 2019, Bernshteyn, Kostochka, and Zhu introduced a fractional version of DP-coloring. They showed that unlike the fractional list chromatic number, the fractional DP-chromatic number of a graph $G$, denoted $\chi_{_{DP}}^*(G)$, can be arbitrarily larger than $\chi^*(G)$, the graph's fractional chromatic number. We generalize a result of Alon, Tuza, and Voigt (1997) on the fractional list chromatic number of odd cycles, and, in the process, show that for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$, $\chi_{_{DP}}^*(C_{2k+1}) = \chi^*(C_{2k+1})$. We also show that for any $n \geq 2$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}$, if $p^*$ is the solution in $(0,1)$ to $p=(1-p)^n$ then $\chi_{_{DP}}^*(K_{n,m})\leq1/p^*$, and we prove a generalization of this result for multipartite graphs. Finally, we determine a lower bound on $\chi_{_{DP}}^*(K_{2,m})$ for any $m \geq 3$.</description>

Abstract: Warning Propagation is a combinatorial message passing algorithm that unifies and generalises a wide variety of recursive combinatorial procedures. Special cases include the Unit Clause Propagation and Pure Literal algorithms for satisfiability as well as the peeling process for identifying the $k$-core of a random graph. Here we analyse Warning Propagation in full generality on a very general class of multi-type random graphs. We prove that under mild assumptions on the random graph model and the stability of the the message limit, Warning Propagation converges rapidly. In effect, the analysis of the fixed point of the message passing process on a random graph reduces to analysing the process on a multi-type Galton-Watson tree. This result corroborates and generalises a heuristic first put forward by Pittel, Spencer and Wormald in their seminal $k$-core paper (JCTB 1996).</description>

Abstract: Which conditions ensure that a digraph contains all oriented paths of some given length, or even a all oriented trees of some given size, as a subgraph? One possible condition could be that the host digraph is a tournament of a certain order. In arbitrary digraphs and oriented graphs, conditions on the chromatic number, on the edge density, on the minimum outdegree and on the minimum semidegree have been proposed. In this survey, we review the known results, and highlight some open questions in the area.</description>

      <title>Rainbow and Gallai-Rado numbers involving binary function equations</title>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{E}$, $\mathcal{E}_1$, and $\mathcal{E}_2$ be equations, $n$ and $k$ be positive integers. The rainbow number $\operatorname{rb}([n],\mathcal{E})$ is difined as the minimum number of colors such that for every exact $(\operatorname{rb}([n],\mathcal{E}))$-coloring of $[n]$, there exists a rainbow solution of $\mathcal{E}$. The Gallai-Rado number $\operatorname{GR}_k(\mathcal{E}_1:\mathcal{E}_2)$ is defined as the minimum positive integer $N$, if it exists, such that for all $n\ge N$, every $k$-colored $[n]$ contains either a rainbow solution of $\mathcal{E}_1$ or a monochromatic solution of $\mathcal{E}_2$. In this paper, we get some exact values of rainbow and Gallai-Rado numbers involving binary function equations. We also provide an algorithm to calculate the rainbow numbers of nonlinear binary function equations.</description>

      <title>Interval and $\ell$-interval Rational Parking Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interval parking functions are a generalization of parking functions in which cars have an interval preference for their parking. We generalize this definition to parking functions with $n$ cars and $m\geq n$ parking spots, which we call interval rational parking functions and provide a formula for their enumeration. By specifying an integer parameter $\ell\geq 0$, we then consider the subset of interval rational parking functions in which each car parks at most $\ell$ spots away from their initial preference. We call these $\ell$-interval rational parking functions and provide recursive formulas to enumerate this set for all positive integers $m\geq n$ and $\ell$. We also establish formulas for the number of nondecreasing $\ell$-interval rational parking functions via the outcome map on rational parking functions. We also consider the intersection between $\ell$-interval parking functions and Fubini rankings and show the enumeration of these sets is given by generalized Fibonacci numbers. We conclude by specializing $\ell=1$, and establish that the set of $1$-interval rational parking functions with $n$ cars and $m$ spots are in bijection with the set of barred preferential arrangements of $[n]$ with $m-n$ bars. This readily implies enumerative formulas. Further, in the case where $\ell=1$, we recover the results of Hadaway and Harris that unit interval parking functions are in bijection with the set of Fubini rankings, which are enumerated by the Fubini numbers.</description>

      <title>A note on edge irregularity strength of Dandelion graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G$, a vertex labeling $\phi:V(G) \rightarrow \{1, 2,\ldots,k\}$ is called $k$-labeling. The weight of an edge $xy$ in $G$, written $w_{\phi}(xy)$, is the sum of the labels of end vertices $x$ and $y$, i.e., $w_{\phi}(xy)=\phi(x)+\phi(y)$. A vertex $k$-labeling is defined to be an edge irregular $k$-labeling of the graph $G$ if for every two different edges $e$ and $f$, $w_{\phi}(e) \neq w_{\phi}(f)$. The minimum $k$ for which the graph $G$ has an edge irregular $k$-labeling is called the edge irregularity strength of $G$, written $es(G)$. In this note, we find the exact value of edge irregularity strength of Dandelion graph when $\Delta(G) \geq \lceil \frac{|E(G)|+1}{2} \rceil$; and determine the bounds when $\Delta(G) &lt; \lceil \frac{|E(G)|+1}{2} \rceil $.</description>

      <title>The chromatic number of very dense random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chromatic number of a very dense random graph $G(n,p)$, with $p \ge 1 - n^{-c}$ for some constant $c &gt; 0$, was first studied by Surya and Warnke, who conjectured that the typical deviation of $\chi(G(n,p))$ from its mean is of order $\sqrt{\mu_r}$, where $\mu_r$ is the expected number of independent sets of size $r$, and $r$ is maximal such that $\mu_r &gt; 1$, except when $\mu_r = O(\log n)$. They moreover proved their conjecture in the case $n^{-2} \ll 1 - p = O(n^{-1})$.
  In this paper, we study $\chi(G(n,p))$ in the range $n^{-1}\log n \ll 1 - p \ll n^{-2/3}$, that is, when the largest independent set of $G(n,p)$ is typically of size 3. We prove in this case that $\chi(G(n,p))$ is concentrated on some interval of length $O(\sqrt{\mu_3})$, and for sufficiently `smooth' functions $p = p(n)$, that there are infinitely many values of $n$ such that $\chi(G(n,p))$ is not concentrated on any interval of size $o(\sqrt{\mu_3})$. We also show that $\chi(G(n,p))$ satisfies a central limit theorem in the range $n^{-1} \log n \ll 1 - p \ll n^{-7/9}$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and study quantum Capelli operators inside newly constructed quantum Weyl algebras associated to three families of symmetric pairs. Both the center of a particular quantized enveloping algebra and the Capelli operators act semisimply on the polynomial part of these quantum Weyl algebras. We show how to transfer well-known properties of the center arising from the theory of quantum symmetric pairs to the Capelli operators. Using this information, we provide a natural realization of Knop-Sahi interpolation polynomials as functions that produce eigenvalues for quantum Capelli operators.</description>

      <title>The refined solution to the Capelli eigenvalue problem for $\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)\oplus\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$ and $\mathfrak{gl}(m|2n)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak g$ be either the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{gl}(V)\oplus\mathfrak{gl}(V)$ where $V:=\mathbb C^{m|n}$ or the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{gl}(V)$ where $V:=\mathbb C^{m|2n}$. Furthermore, let $W$ be the $\mathfrak g$-module defined by $W:=V\otimes V^*$ in the former case and $W:=\mathcal S^2(V)$ in the latter case. Associated to $(\mathfrak g,W)$ there exists a distinguished basis of Capelli operators $\left\{D^\lambda\right\}_{\lambda\in\Omega}$, naturally indexed by a set of hook partitions $\Omega$, for the subalgebra of $\mathfrak g$-invariants in the superalgebra $\mathcal{PD}(W)$ of superdifferential operators on $W$.
  Let $\mathfrak b$ be a Borel subalgebra of $\mathfrak g$. We compute eigenvalues of the $D^\lambda$ on the irreducible $\mathfrak g$-submodules of $\mathcal{P}(W)$ and obtain them explicitly as the evaluation of the interpolation super Jack polynomials of Sergeev--Veselov at suitable affine functions of the $\mathfrak b$-highest weight. While the former case is straightforward, the latter is significantly more complex. This generalizes a result by Sahi, Salmasian and Serganova for these cases, where such formulas were given for a fixed choice of Borel subalgebra.</description>

      <title>Construction of orientable sequences in $O(1)$-amortized time per bit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An orientable sequence of order $n$ is a cyclic binary sequence such that each length-$n$ substring appears at most once \emph{in either direction}. Maximal length orientable sequences are known only for $n\leq 7$, and a trivial upper bound on their length is $2^{n-1} - 2^{\lfloor(n-1)/2\rfloor}$. This paper presents the first efficient algorithm to construct orientable sequences with asymptotically optimal length; more specifically, our algorithm constructs orientable sequences via cycle-joining and a successor-rule approach requiring $O(n)$ time per bit and $O(n)$ space. This answers a longstanding open question from Dai, Martin, Robshaw, Wild [Cryptography and Coding III (1993)]. Applying a recent concatenation-tree framework, the same sequences can be generated in $O(1)$-amortized time per bit using $O(n^2)$ space. Our sequences are applied to find new longest-known (aperiodic) orientable sequences for $n\leq 20$.</description>

      <title>Toward TransfORmers: Revolutionizing the Solution of Mixed Integer Programs with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce an innovative deep learning framework that employs a transformer model to address the challenges of mixed-integer programs, specifically focusing on the Capacitated Lot Sizing Problem (CLSP). Our approach, to our knowledge, is the first to utilize transformers to predict the binary variables of a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem. Specifically, our approach harnesses the encoder decoder transformer's ability to process sequential data, making it well-suited for predicting binary variables indicating production setup decisions in each period of the CLSP. This problem is inherently dynamic, and we need to handle sequential decision making under constraints. We present an efficient algorithm in which CLSP solutions are learned through a transformer neural network. The proposed post-processed transformer algorithm surpasses the state-of-the-art solver, CPLEX and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in solution time, optimal gap, and percent infeasibility over 240K benchmark CLSP instances tested. After the ML model is trained, conducting inference on the model, reduces the MIP into a linear program (LP). This transforms the ML-based algorithm, combined with an LP solver, into a polynomial-time approximation algorithm to solve a well-known NP-Hard problem, with almost perfect solution quality.</description>
