      <title>Relativistic fluid dynamics in a 'hydro' frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate how field redefinition influences the spectrum of linearized perturbations in relativistic fluid dynamics. We show that the hydrodynamic modes do not get affected under local field redefinition, whereas the non-hydrodynamic modes do. These non-hydrodynamic modes can be removed through a suitable all-order field redefinition. This process leads to a new frame containing only hydrodynamic modes, which we refer to as the hydro frame. Additionally, we demonstrate that the resulting stress-energy tensor may constitute an infinite series in momentum space, with the radius of convergence associated with the removed non-hydrodynamic mode, highlighting its role in the hydrodynamic expansion's validity.</description>

      <title>Towards next-generation optical potentials for nuclear reactions and structure calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical-model potentials (OMPs) are critical ingredients for basic and applied nuclear physics. Present-day computational capabilities allow us to generate data-driven nucleon-nucleus OMPs that are non-local and exactly dispersive (as theoretically required to be), include statistically-sound uncertainty quantification, and are trained on both scattering and bound-state data from a wide area of the nuclear chart. Combined together, these features allow for significant improvement in fidelity and extrapolative power of the model. Here, we present preliminary work toward the development and training of such an OMP. The capability of the model to describe data at this first stage is encouraging.</description>

      <title>Nuclear structure properties and weak interaction rates of even-even Fe isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear structure properties and weak interaction rates of neutron rich even even iron (Fe) isotopes (A = 50 70) are investigated using the Interacting Boson Model1 (IBM1) and the proton neutron Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (pnQRPA) model. The IBM1 is used for the calculation of energy levels and the B(E2) values of neutron rich Fe isotopes. Later their geometry was predicted within the potential energy formalism of the IBM1 model. Weak interaction rates on neutron rich nuclei are needed for the modeling and simulation of presupernova evolution of massive stars. In the current study, we investigate the possible effect of nuclear deformation on stellar rates of even even Fe isotopes. The pnQRPA model is applied to calculate the weak interaction rates of selected Fe isotopes using three different values of deformation parameter. It is noted that, in general, bigger deformation values led to smaller total strength and larger centroid values of the resulting Gamow Teller distributions. This later translated to smaller computed weak interaction rates. The current finding warrants further investigation before it may be generalized.The reported stellar rates are up to 4 orders of magnitude smaller than previous calculations and may bear astrophysical significance.</description>

      <title>Limiting Rotation Rate of Neutron Stars from Crust Breaking and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars are not observed to spin faster than about half their breakup rate. This limiting rotational frequency may be related to the strength of their crusts. As a star spins up from accretion, centrifugal forces stress the crust. We perform finite-element simulations of rotating neutron stars and find that the crust fails at rotation rates about half the breakup rate. We argue that this crust failure is asymmetric and produces a significant ellipticity (fractional difference in moments of inertia). A rotating star, with this ellipticity, radiates gravitational waves that limit further spin up. These stars may be promising sources for LIGO / VIRGO and next generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Comparing effective temperatures in standard, Tsallis, and q-dual statistics from transverse momentum spectra of identified light charged hadrons produced in gold--gold collisions at RHIC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified light charged hadrons produced in gold--gold (Au+Au) collisions across various centrality classes at center-of-mass energies per nucleon pair, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, ranging from 7.7 to 200 GeV, as measured by the STAR Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The analysis employs standard (Bose-Einstein/Fermi-Dirac), Tsallis, and q-dual statistics to fit the same $p_T$ spectra and derive distinct effective temperatures: $T_{\text{Standard}}$, $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$, and $T_{\text{q-dual}}$. In most instances, there exists an approximately linear relationship or positive correlation between $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ and $T_{\text{Standard}}$, as well as between $T_{\text{q-dual}}$ and $T_{\text{Standard}}$, when considering $T_{\text{Standard}}$ as a baseline. However, while both $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ and $T_{\text{q-dual}}$ increase from semi-central to central Au+Au collisions at 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV, where QGP is expected, changes in $T_{\text{Standard}}$ occur more gradually. This work suggests that $T_{\text{Standard}}$ is better suited for characterizing phase transitions between hadronic matter and QGP compared to $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ or $T_{\text{q-dual}}$, primarily due to the considerations related to entropy index in the Tsallis and q-dual statistics.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang-zero ratios for locating a critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to numerically determine the location of a critical point in general systems using the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros. This method makes use of the fact that the ratios of Lee-Yang zeros on various spatial volumes intersect at the critical point. While the method is similar to the Binder-cumulant analysis, it is advantageous in suppressing the finite-volume effects arising from the mixing of variables in general systems. We show that the method works successfully for numerically locating the CP in the three-dimensional three-state Potts model with a nonzero external field.</description>

      <title>First Experimental Test of the Ratio Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ratio is a new reaction observable suggested to extract accurately structure information on halo nuclei. It corresponds to the ratio of differential cross sections for scattering and breakup, which is predicted to remove the uncertainty related to the reaction dynamics. We present here the first experimental test of the method for the 11Be + 12C collision at ELab = 20A MeV performed at Texas A&amp;M University. Differential cross sections for scattering and inclusive one-neutron breakup have been measured with the new detector array BlueSTEAl. The ratio of cross sections is very smooth and independent of the projectile-target interaction, which demonstrates the validity of the ratio method. We extend our analysis to existing 11Be + 208Pb data, confirming that the method works well on any target.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the mechanism of $J/\psi$-nucleon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy $J/\psi N$ scattering is important for various reasons: it is related to the hidden-charm $P_c$ pentaquark states, provides insights into the role of gluons in nucleon structures, and is relevant to the $J/\psi$ properties in nuclear medium. The scattering can happen through two distinct mechanisms: the coupled-channel mechanism via open-charm meson-baryon intermediate states, and the soft-gluon exchange mechanism. We investigate the $J/\psi N$ $S$-wave scattering length through both mechanisms, and find that the soft-gluon exchange mechanism leads to a scattering length at least one order of magnitude larger than that from the coupled-channel mechanism and thus is the predominant one. The findings can be verified by lattice calculations and will enhance our understanding of the scattering processes breaking the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule.</description>

      <title>$P$-wave charmonium contribution to hidden-charm states from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze, considering the contribution of $P$-wave charmonia, lattice data for the $D \overline{D}$-$D_s \overline{D}_s$ coupled-channel and $D \overline{D}{}^\ast$ systems and search for hidden-charm states with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{++}$, and $2^{++}$ quantum numbers. For $0^{++}$, the analysis reveals three poles in the $D\overline{D}$-$D_s \overline{D}_s$ coupled-channel amplitude, corresponding to three states. Two of these poles, located near the $D\overline{D}$ and $D_s \overline{D}_s$ thresholds, can be interpreted as mostly molecular states. A third pole above the $D_s \overline{D}_s$ threshold is originated from the $P$-wave $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ charmonium state. In the $1^{++}$ sector, we find two poles in the complex energy plane. The first one is related to the molecular $X(3872)$ state, with a compositeness exceeding $90\%$, while the second one, stemming from the $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ charmonium, appears above the $D\overline{D}{}^\ast$ threshold and it likely corresponds to the recently discovered $\chi_{c1}(4010)$ state. In the $2^{++}$ sector, we also report two poles and find that the dressed $\chi_{c2}(2P)$ is lighter than the $D^\ast\overline{D}{}^\ast$ molecular state, with the dynamics of the latter closely related to that of the heavy-quark spin-symmetry partner of the $X(3872)$.</description>

      <title>Formation, dissociation and regeneration of charmonia within microscopic Langevin simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a microscopic and dynamical model to study the formation, as well as dissociation and recombination processes of charmonium states in a heat bath at constant temperature and volume. Within this classical approach, the heavy quarks are described as Brownian particles in a background medium of light constituents and can therefore be described in terms of a Fokker-Planck equation with constant transport coefficients, which is then materialized through with relativistic Langevin simulations. The heavy quarks interact classically over a Coulomb-like screened potential to form a bound state if the relative energy of the pair becomes negative. Dissociation of bound states are possible as a result of screening effects of the potential as well as through scatterings with plasma particles. We demonstrate the full equilibration of the system and show that, for tuning the coupling constant, the obtained equilibrium charmonium yields are in accordance with the Statistical Hadronization Model.</description>

      <title>Approaching Stable Quark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The determination of whether the ground state of baryon matter in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the ordinary nucleus or a quark matter state remains a long-standing question in physics. A critical parameter in this investigation is the bag parameter $B$, which quantifies the QCD vacuum energy and can be computed using nonperturbative methods such as Lattice QCD (LQCD). By combining the equation of state derived from perturbative QCD (pQCD) with the bag parameter to fit the LQCD-simulated data for isospin-dense matter, we address the stability of quark matter within the LQCD+pQCD framework. Our findings suggest that the current data imposes an upper bound on $B^{1/4} \lesssim 160$ MeV, approaching a conclusive statement on quark matter stability. Additionally, we derive more general thermodynamic bounds on the quark matter energy-per-baryon and $B$, which, while weaker, provide complementary insights.</description>

Abstract: We evaluate the two-photon exchange correction to the unpolarized cross section in the elastic muon-proton scattering within dispersion relations. One of the six independent invariant amplitudes requires a subtraction. We fix the subtraction function to the model estimate of the full two-photon exchange at one of three MUSE beam energies and make a prediction for the two other energies. Additionally, we present single and double polarization observables accounting for the lepton mass.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless double beta decay rates in the presence of light sterile neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) in minimal extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics where gauge-singlet right-handed neutrinos give rise to Dirac and Majorana neutrino mass terms. We argue that the standard treatment of these scenarios, based on mass-dependent nuclear matrix elements, is missing important contributions to the $0\nu\beta\beta$ amplitude. First, new effects arise from the exchange of neutrinos with very small (ultrasoft) momenta, for which we compute the associated nuclear matrix elements for the decays of ${}^{76}$Ge and ${}^{136}$Xe. These contributions can dominate the $0\nu\beta\beta$ rate in cases with light sterile neutrinos. The ultrasoft terms are also relevant in the more standard scenario of just three light Majorana neutrinos where they lead to a $10\%$ reduction of the total $0\nu\beta\beta$ amplitude. Secondly, we highlight the importance of short-range terms associated with medium-heavy sterile neutrinos and provide explicit formulae that can be used in phenomenological analyses. As examples we discuss impact of these new effects in several explicit scenarios, including a realistic $3+2$ model with two right-handed gauge-singlet neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized Dirac spectral density in $N_f = 2+1$ QCD at physical quark masses, temperature $T = 230$ MeV and system size $L_s = 3.4$ fm. To that end, we perform a point-wise continuum limit of the staggered density in lattice QCD with staggered quarks. We find, for the first time, that a clear infrared structure (IR peak) emerges in the density of Dirac operator describing dynamical quarks. We also provide numerical evidence that a component of this peak, which becomes dominant in the thermodynamic limit, is due to a non-trivial accumulation of near-zero modes. Features of this structure are consistent with those previously attributed to the recently-proposed IR phase of thermal QCD. Our results (i) provide the only complete first-principles evidence that these IR features exist and are physical; (ii) improve the upper bound for IR-phase transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{IR}}$ so that the new window is $200 &lt; T_{\mathrm{IR}} &lt; 230\,$MeV; (iii) are consistent with non-restoration of anomalous U$_{\mathrm A}$(1) symmetry (chiral limit) below $T = 230$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Attractor in Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractor is a concept that describes universal equilibration behavior in which systems lose microscopic details before hydrodynamics becomes applicable. We propose a setup to observe hydrodynamic attractors in ultracold atomic gases, taking advantage of the fact that driving the two-body $s$-wave scattering length causes phenomena equivalent to isotropic fluid expansions. We specifically consider two-component fermions with contact interactions in three dimensions and discuss their dynamics under a power-law drive of the scattering length in a uniform system. By explicit computation, we derive a hydrodynamic relaxation model. We analytically solve their dynamics and find the hydrodynamic attractor solution. Our proposed method using the scattering length drive is applicable to a wide range of ultracold atomic systems, and our results establish these as a new platform for exploring hydrodynamic attractors.</description>

      <title>The Radius of the High-mass Pulsar PSR J0740+6620 with 3.6 yr of NICER Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report an updated analysis of the radius, mass, and heated surface regions of the massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620 using Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) data from 2018 September 21 to 2022 April 21, a substantial increase in data set size compared to previous analyses. Using a tight mass prior from radio timing measurements and jointly modeling the new NICER data with XMM-Newton data, the inferred equatorial radius and gravitational mass are $12.49_{-0.88}^{+1.28}$ km and $2.073_{-0.069}^{+0.069}$ $M_\odot$ respectively, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the $16\,\%$ and $84\,\%$ quantiles, with an estimated systematic error $\lesssim 0.1$ km. This result was obtained using the best computationally feasible sampler settings providing a strong radius lower limit but a slightly more uncertain radius upper limit. The inferred radius interval is also close to the $R=12.76_{-1.02}^{+1.49}$ km obtained by Dittmann et al., when they require the radius to be less than $16$ km as we do. The results continue to disfavor very soft equations of state for dense matter, with $R&lt;11.15$ km for this high-mass pulsar excluded at the $95\,\%$ probability. The results do not depend significantly on the assumed cross-calibration uncertainty between NICER and XMM-Newton. Using simulated data that resemble the actual observations, we also show that our pipeline is capable of recovering parameters for the inferred models reported in this paper.</description>

      <title>Precise Mass Measurement of the $^{108, 110, 112, 114, 116}$Rh ground state and isomeric state(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise mass measurements of the $^{108, 110, 112, 114, 116}$Rh ground and isomeric states were performed using the Canadian Penning Trap at Argonne National Laboratory, showing a good agreement with recent JYFLTRAP measurements. A new possible isomeric state of $^{114}$Rh was also observed. These isotopes are part of the longest odd-odd chain of identical spin-parity assignment, of 1$^+$, spanning $^{104-118}$Rh, despite being in a region of deformation. Theoretical calculations were performed to explain this phenomenon. In addition, multiquasiparticle blocking calculations were conducted to study the configuration of low-lying states in the odd-odd Rh nuclei and elucidate the observed anomalous isomeric yield ratio of $^{114}$Rh.</description>

      <title>Vortex Avalanches and Collective Motion in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the dynamics of about 600 quantum vortices in a spinning-down cylindrical container using a Gross--Pitaevskii model. For the first time, we find convincing spatial-temporal evidence of avalanching behaviour resulting from vortex depinning and collective motion. During a typical avalanche, about 10 to 20 vortices exit the container in a short period, producing a glitch in the superfluid angular momentum and a localised void in the vorticity. After the glitch, vortices continue to depin and circulate around the vorticity void in a similar manner to that seen in previous point-vortex simulations. We present evidence of collective vortex motion throughout this avalanche process. We also show that the effective Magnus force can be used to predict when and where avalanches will occur. Lastly, we comment on the challenge of extrapolating these results to conditions in real neutron stars, which contain many orders of magnitude more vortices.</description>
