      <title>How to make a Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the general conditions under which evolution in the laws of physics and matter creation or destruction are closely intertwined. They make use of global time variables canonically dual to the constants of Nature. Such times flow at a rate determined by what can be interpret as the chemical potential of the fundamental constants (in analogy with phenomenological clocks based on isentropic fluids). The general condition for violations of energy conservation is then that a matter parameter evolves as a function of a gravity clock or vice-versa. This framework can be envisaged as the environment within which a natural selection scenario operates, powered by random mutations in the values of the constants of nature (or indeed any other variability in the laws in terms of the times defined above). The prize function is the creation of matter, followed by its preservation. This can be accomplished in an environment where diffeomorphism invariance is among the possible theories, with mutations modelled, for example, on the absorbing Markov chain. In such a set-up the diffeormorphism invariant state with fixed constants (or any nearby state) should be the absorbing state. John Wheeler's ``higgledy-piggledy'' chaotic cosmic start therefore finds a realization in this model, where its own demise and the establishment of order and seemingly immutable laws is also a predection of the model.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing FHDE with Scalar and Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Fractional Holographic Dark Energy (FHDE) model to reconstruct it by means of dynamic candidates such as ($i$) Quintessence, ($ii$) K-essence, ($iii$) Dilaton, ($iv$) Yang-Mills condensate, ($v$) DBI-essence, and ($vi$) Tachyonic fields in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe. In particular, the dark-energy possibilities ($i$)-($vi$) are formulated through suitable field descriptions. Being concrete, we establish a comprehensive correspondence between FHDE and suitable scalar and gauge field frameworks that co-substantiate our investigation and subsequent discussion. In more detail, we methodically compute the corresponding Equation of State (EoS) parameters and field (kinetic and potential) features for the fractional parameter ($\alpha$) range, viz. $1&lt;\alpha\leq2$. Conclusively, our results show that the modifications brought by the fractional features satisfactorily enable late-time cosmic acceleration, together with avoiding quantum instabilities by preventing the EoS from entering the phantom divide i.e., $\omega(z)\rightarrow-\infty$, which is a common issue in standard scalar field models without fractional dynamics (e.g., K-essence field). Our findings further indicate that fractional calculus attributes can be significant in addressing the challenges of dark-energy models by offering a robust framework to prospect late-time acceleration and properly fitting observational constraints. Notably, we find that as the fractional features start to dominate, the EoS parameter of all the effective field configurations asymptotically approaches a $\Lambda$CDM behaviour in the far-future limit $z\rightarrow-1$. In summary, the recent perspective introduced by FHDE \citep{Trivedi:2024inb} can indeed be cast as a promising aspirant through the use of prominent field frameworks.</description>

      <title>Spherically symmetric and static black bounces with multiple horizons, throats, and anti-throats in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black bounce spacetimes usually arise from the Simpson-Visser regularization method. This type of metric presents a wormhole throat inside an event horizon. In this paper, we presented new classes of black bounce spacetime solutions, which have multiple horizons, throats, and anti-throats. These solutions are variants of black holes and wormholes, based on modifications of the Schwarzschild and Simpson-Visser metrics. The metric function allows for multiple horizons and throats, and the asymptotic behavior recovers the Schwarzschild solution. The article considers a scalar field coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics, generating solutions with a partially phantom scalar field and a magnetic monopole. The energy conditions can be satisfied or violated depending on the region of spacetime, analyzed through an anisotropic fluid. The regularity of the spacetime is ensured by the analysis of the Kretschmann scalar.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensorial, spinorial and helicity formalisms of the curvature and conformal curvature dynamics are developed. Equations of linearized gravity within that formalisms are given. Gravitational radiation in linearized gravity in terms of curvature dynamics is investigated. Equivalence of the Bia\l{}ynicki-Birula formula for the gravitational energy in linearized gravity and the Landau-Lifschitz formula is proved.

      <title>Formation of regular black hole from baryonic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate regular black hole formation through the gravitational collapse of baryonic matter characterized by a time- and radius-dependent coefficient of equation of state. Our analysis yields exact solutions to Einstein's field equations that describe singularity-free spacetimes. These solutions are matched to the Husain metric, providing a complete description of dynamical black holes with a barotropic equation of state. The solutions reveal interesting physical behavior but face important challenges: the pressure increases with radius and violates the dominant energy condition beyond a critical value, requiring external matching for a complete spacetime description. Our analysis of black hole shadows shows that both the shadow and photon sphere radii increase monotonically with the equation of state parameter $\alpha$. The matching between interior and exterior solutions suggests a phase transition occurs during collapse, potentially delaying apparent horizon formation. This prediction, combined with distinct shadow characteristics, offers promising avenues for observational tests of regular black hole models.</description>

      <title>Violations of the null convergence condition in kinematical transitions between singular and regular black holes, horizonless compact objects, and bounces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do regular black holes evade the Hawking-Penrose singularity theorems? Various models of stationary regular black holes globally satisfy the null convergence condition (NCC). At first glance this might seem puzzling, as the NCC must generically be violated to avoid the focusing point implied by the singularity theorems. In fact, the extant singularity theorems depend on subtle global assumptions and do not provide information about where and when the singularity actually forms. In particular inner horizons are typically reached at finite affine parameter, before null geodesic focusing occurs, and the region inside the inner horizon is not itself a trapped region. Specifically, the Bardeen, Dymnikova and Hayward models of stationary regular black holes feature an inner Cauchy horizon which violates global hyperbolicity, hence violating one of the key assumptions of Penrose's singularity theorem, and furthermore challenging their viability as long-living end-points of gravitational collapse. In contrast, during non-stationary processes describing kinematic transitions between standard singular black holes and regular black holes or horizonless compact objects, the inner horizon - when present - need not act as a Cauchy horizon. This raises the intriguing possibility that the NCC might instead be violated during intermediate stages of such transitions. Our detailed analysis confirms that NCC violations occur frequently during such kinematic transitions, even when the stationary end-point spacetimes respect the NCC. We also investigate analogous transitions toward black-bounce spacetimes and their horizonless compact counterparts, wormholes, where the NCC is always violated. These findings offer new insights into how regular black holes and related objects evade the constraints imposed by the standard singularity theorems.</description>

      <title>Novel charged black hole solutions in conformal Killing gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate static spherically symmetric solutions in the context of Conformal Killing Gravity, a recently proposed modified theory of gravity that offers a new approach to the cosmological constant problem. Coupling this new theory with nonlinear electrodynamics, we derive the corresponding field equations and study their behavior under different parameter choices. We analyze three different models, each focusing on different key parameters. Our results reveal a rich causal structure with multiple horizons and transitions between extreme and non-extreme solutions depending on the parameter values. Moreover, we compute the nonlinear Lagrangian density for each model and find that it agrees with Maxwell theory in the limit $F \rightarrow 0$. We also confirm the existence of a central curvature singularity via the Kretschmann scalar. To connect our theoretical results with observational prospects, we study the black hole shadows associated with each model. The analysis shows that the calculated shadow size and shape of the three proposed models are consistent with the data for the supermassive object at the center of our galaxy and are therefore possible candidates for modeling this structure.</description>

      <title>One-loop corrections to the E-type $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation and primordial black hole production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-loop corrections (1LC) to the power spectrum of scalar perturbations, arising from cubic interactions in the single-field E-type $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation and primordial black hole (PBH) production, are numerically calculated. The results demonstrate the 1LC contributes merely a few percent to the tree-level power spectrum. The model parameters are chosen to predict the PBH masses in the asteroid-mass range, while maintaining consistency with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations within 1$\sigma$ confidence levels, and obeying the upper limits on $\mu$-distortions. The PBH formed on scales smaller than the inflation scale can constitute a significant fraction of the present dark matter (DM). The PBH-induced gravitational waves (GW) may be detectable by the future space-based gravitational interferometers. We also consider a reconstruction of the scalar potential from possible GW observations and present a numerical approach tested in the parameter space of the model.</description>

      <title>A $\chi^2$ statistic for the identification of strongly lensed gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) emanated by stellar mass compact binary coalescences (CBCs), and lensed by galaxy- or cluster-scale lenses, will produce two or more copies of the GW signal. These will have identical phase evolution but differing amplitudes. Such lensing signatures are expected to be detected by the end of the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra's (LVK's) fifth observing run (O5). In this work, we propose a novel $\chi_{\mathrm{lens}}^2$ statistic to segregate pairs of detected GW events as either lensed or unlensed, using templates typically used in GW searches. The statistic is an application of the generalized $\chi^2$ discriminator described in \citet{dhurandhar2017}, tailored to probe the similarity (or lack thereof) between the phase evolutions of two CBC signals. We assess the performance of $\chi_{\mathrm{lens}}^2$ on a realistic astrophysical dataset of lensed and unlensed CBCs detectable in O4, assuming a single LIGO-like detector at design sensitivity. We find that we can correctly identify lensed events with efficiencies comparable to existing Bayesian and machine learning methods. Evaluating $\chi_{\mathrm{lens}}^2$ is orders of magnitude faster than Bayesian methods. Moreover, the statistics of $\chi_{\mathrm{lens}}^2$, in stationary Gaussian noise, are fully understood, in contrast to machine learning methods. $\chi_{\mathrm{lens}}^2$ can, therefore, be used to rapidly and accurately weed out the vast majority of unlensed candidate pairs and identify lensed pairs.</description>

      <title>Generalized Eddington--Finkelstein Coordinates and Exact Vaidya-Type Solutions in Weyl Conformal Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Vaidya-type solutions in Weyl conformal gravity (WCG) using Eddington--Finkelstein-like coordinates. Our considerations focus on spherical as well as hyperbolic and planar symmetries. In particular, we find all vacuum dynamical solutions for the aforementioned symmetries. These are, in contrast to general relativity, structurally quite non-trivial. We provide a thorough analysis of their basic properties, such as, relation to other known WCG solutions, algebraic types, singularities, horizons, and symmetries. In the same vein, we also derive, classify, and discuss non-vacuum solutions with the Coulombic electric field and null dust. Other salient issues, such as the gauge equivalence of WCG solutions to Einstein spaces and the role of the Birkhoff--Riegert theorem, are also addressed.</description>

      <title>A practical Bayesian method for gravitational-wave ringdown analysis with multiple modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) ringdown signals from black holes (BHs) encode crucial information about the gravitational dynamics in the strong-field regime, which offers unique insights into BH properties. In the future, the improving sensitivity of GW detectors is to enable the extraction of multiple quasi-normal modes (QNMs) from ringdown signals. However, incorporating multiple modes drastically enlarges the parameter space, posing computational challenges to data analysis. Inspired by the $F$-statistic method in the continuous GW searches, we develope an algorithm, dubbed as FIREFLY, for accelerating the ringdown signal analysis. FIREFLY analytically marginalizes the amplitude and phase parameters of QNMs to reduce the computational cost and speed up the full-parameter inference from hours to minutes, while achieving consistent posterior and evidence. The acceleration becomes more significant when more QNMs are considered. Rigorously based on the principle of Bayesian inference and importance sampling, our method is statistically interpretable, flexible in prior choice, and compatible with various advanced sampling techniques, providing a new perspective for accelerating future GW data analysis.</description>

      <title>Fermion-antifermion pairs in magnetized spacetime generated by a point source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we study fermion-antifermion pairs in a magnetized spacetime induced by a point-like source and characterized by an angular deficit parameter, \(\alpha\). In the rest frame, the relative motion (\(\propto r\)) of these pairs is analyzed using exact solutions of a two-body Dirac equation with a position-dependent mass expressed as \(m(r) = m_0 + \mathcal{S}(r)\). We select the Lorentz scalar potential \(\mathcal{S}(r) = -\alpha_c/r\), which modifies the rest mass in a manner analogous to an attractive Coulomb potential, and derive analytical solutions to the resulting radial wave equation. Our findings are applicable to pairs in flat spacetime when \(\alpha = 1\) without loss of generality. We elucidate how the spectra of such pairs are influenced by the spacetime background. Additionally, we observe that even the well-known non-relativistic energy (\(\propto \alpha_c^2\)) reflects the influence of the parameter \(\alpha\) in positronium-like fermion-antifermion systems. We propose that our results can also be extended to study charge carriers in magnetized monolayer materials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the metric for a 2+1-dimensional spinning point source background can be transformed into the metric describing the near-horizon region of a rotating BTZ black hole, a result not previously reported in the literature. This metric holds potential for providing meaningful insights into topics such as holographic superconductivity and quantum critical phenomena in future research</description>

      <title>On Geometrization of Classical Fields (Model of Embedded Spaces)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of geometrization of the gravitational and electro magnetic fields in 4D Finsler space (the Model of Embedded Spaces -- MES) is investigated. The model postulates a proper metric set of an element of distributed matter and asserts that space-time is a mutual physical embedding of such sets. The simplest MES geometry is constructed (its relativistic Finsler version) with a connection that depends of the properties of matter and its fields (torsion and nonmetricity are absent). The field hypothesis and the Least Action Principle of the matter-field system lead to Einstein-type and Maxwell-type equations, and their nonlinearity -- to the anisotropic field contribution to the seed mass of matter. It is shown that the seed matter plays the role of a physical vacuum of the Embedding determines the cosmological constant. In the special case of a conformal metric, the Maxwell-type equations reduce to the Maxwell equations themselves and a negative electromagnetic contribution. A possible experimental verification of this result is evaluated. The "redshift" effect in an electric field is also mentioned as a method for studying the vacuum and relic electric charge. A study of the gauge structure of the presented theory is postponed to the future.</description>

Abstract: We apply the Noether symmetry analysis in $f\left( Q\right)$-Cosmology to determine invariant functions and conservation laws for the cosmological field equations. For the FLRW background and the four families of connections, it is found that only power-law $f\left( Q\right)$ functions admit point Noether symmetries. Finally, exact and analytic solutions are derived using the invariant functions.</description>

      <title>Covariant non-perturbative pointer variables for quantum fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the dynamics of a detector modeled by a harmonic oscillator coupled with an otherwise free quantum field in a curved spacetime in terms of covariant equations of motion leading to local observables. To achieve this, we derive and renormalize the integro-differential equation that governs the detector pointer-variable dynamics, introducing phenomenological parameters such as a dispersion coefficient and a Lamb-shift parameter. Our formal solution, expressed in terms of Green's functions, allows for the covariant, and causal analysis of induced observables on the field. This formalism can be used for instance to detect non-Gaussianities present in the field's state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximating the derivative-of-the-Gaussian profile proposed by Gibbons and Hawking by the scarf potential, the scattering of particles by a gravitational wave generated by flyby is described analytically by following the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Pure displacement arises when the wave zone contains an integer number of half-waves. The results confirm the prediction of Zel'dovich and Polnarev.</description>

      <title>LearningMatch: Siamese Neural Network Learns the Match Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The match, which is defined as the the similarity between two waveform templates, is a fundamental calculation in computationally expensive gravitational-wave data-analysis pipelines, such as template bank generation. In this paper we introduce LearningMatch, a Siamese neural network that has learned the mapping between the parameters, specifically $\lambda_{0}$ (which is proportional to the chirp mass), $\eta$ (symmetric mass ratio), and equal aligned spin ($\chi_{1}$ = $\chi_{2}$), of two gravitational-wave templates and the match. The trained Siamese neural network, called LearningMatch, can predict the match to within $3.3\%$ of the actual match value. For match values greater than 0.95, a trained LearningMatch model can predict the match to within $1\%$ of the actual match value. LearningMatch can predict the match in 20 $\mu$s (mean maximum value) with Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). LearningMatch is 3 orders of magnitudes faster at determining the match than current standard mathematical calculations that involve the template being generated.</description>

      <title>A definition of the mass aspect function for weakly regular asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to the well-known and unambiguous notion of ADM mass for asymptotically Euclidean manifolds, the notion of mass for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds admits several interpretations. Historically, there are two approaches to defining the mass in the asymptotically hyperbolic setting: the mass aspect function of Wang defined on the conformal boundary at infinity, and the mass functional of Chru\'sciel and Herzlich which may be thought of as the closest asymptotically hyperbolic analogue of the ADM mass. In this paper we unify these two approaches by introducing an ADM-style definition of the mass aspect function that applies to a broad range of asymptotics and in very low regularity. Additionally, we show that the mass aspect function can be computed using the Ricci tensor. Finally, we demonstrate that this function exhibits favorable covariance properties under changes of charts at infinity, which includes a proof of the asymptotic rigidity of hyperbolic space in the context of weakly regular metrics.</description>

      <title>Semilinear wave equations on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit global existence and decay for small-data solutions of semilinear wave equations on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole backgrounds satisfying the classical null condition, a problem which was previously addressed by the first author in joint work with Aretakis and Gajic (Ann. of PDE, 2020). In this paper, we develop a new approach based on propagating a significantly weaker set of estimates, which allows for a simpler and more streamlined proof. Our proof does not require tracking sharp estimates for the solution in the near-horizon region, which means that it is compatible with, but does not imply, the non-decay and growth hierarchy of derivatives of the solution along the event horizon expected from the Aretakis instability. In particular, this approach is in principle compatible with other settings where stronger horizon instabilities are expected, such as nonlinear charged scalar fields on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om, or nonlinear waves on extremal Kerr. We also sketch how our proof applies to semilinear problems on spacetimes settling down to extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om, such as those constructed in our joint work with Kehle (arXiv:2410.16234, 2024).</description>

      <title>GWSkyNet-Multi II: an updated deep learning model for rapid classification of gravitational-wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-messenger observations of gravitational waves and electromagnetic emission from compact object mergers offer unique insights into the structure of neutron stars, the formation of heavy elements, and the expansion rate of the Universe. With the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave detectors currently in their fourth observing run (O4), it is an exciting time for detecting these mergers. However, assessing whether to follow up a candidate gravitational-wave event given limited telescope time and resources is challenging; the candidate can be a false alert due to detector glitches, or may not have any detectable electromagnetic counterpart even if it is real. GWSkyNet-Multi is a deep learning model developed to facilitate follow-up decisions by providing real-time classification of candidate events, using localization information released in LVK rapid public alerts. Here we introduce GWSkyNet-Multi II, an updated model targeted towards providing more robust and informative predictions during O4 and beyond. Specifically, the model now provides normalized probability scores and associated uncertainties for each of the four corresponding source categories released by the LVK: glitch, binary black hole, neutron star-black hole, and binary neutron star. Informed by explainability studies of the original model, the updated model architecture is also significantly simplified, including replacing input images with intuitive summary values, making it more interpretable. For significant O4 event alerts issued between May 2023 and December 2024, GWSkyNet-Multi II produces a prediction that is consistent with the updated LVK classification for 93% of events. The updated model can be used by the community to help make time-critical follow-up decisions.</description>

      <title>Reheating chiral dynamos with spin-0 and massive spin-1 torsions via chiral asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Syderenko et al. (JCAP, 10: 018, 2016) investigated magnetogenesis and chiral asymmetry in the early hot universe. This study explores the impact of minimally coupling a constant torsion in their cosmological model, suggesting new chiral physics. Physically, this means that if torsion is right chiral, the difference between the number of right and left chiralities does not change. Moreover, the decay of chiral asymmetry depends on torsion chirality. We solve the chiral torsionful dynamo equation for magnetic field seeds. Magnetic helical fields are considered important for chiral fermion asymmetry. Even in $(3+1)$ dimensional spacetime, torsion is highly suppressed beyond inflation (Eur Phys J C 82: 291, 2022). However, torsion of $1\,\mathrm{MeV}$ appears in the early universe. Equations for correlated magnetic field coefficients are solved in terms of torsion. Weak magnetic fields of the order of $10^{-42}$ Gauss are boosted by powerful torsionful dynamo amplification, generating a much stronger magnetic field of the order of $10^{-9}$ Gauss in the present universe. A galactic magnetic field of $10^{-6}$ Gauss in the present universe, with torsion of $10^{-15}$ Gauss, leads us to a galactic dynamo seed of $10^{-9}$ Gauss. We also discuss reheating dynamo regeneration of decaying cosmic magnetic fields during the hadronization era. The relation between the reheating contribution to e-folds and the connection between CMF and temperature squared allows us to obtain dynamo amplification in terms of N-folds of inflation. The main innovation of this work is the exploration of constant torsion in a cosmological model, revealing new chiral physics. This study offers a new perspective on the origin and evolution of magnetic fields in the early universe.</description>

Abstract: We examine the quantum field description of massive Carrollian field theories, with a particular focus on resolving the issue of gauge dependence concerning mass in scalar Carrollian Electrodynamics. We also present the quantum field description for complex Carrollian scalar fields, Carrollian fermions, and Carrollian Electrodynamics. We highlight the challenges in scalar Carrollian electrodynamics (sCED), where the renormalized mass appears gauge-dependent, and clarify this discrepancy by carefully constructing completely gauge fixed propagators, affirming the gauge independence of mass in the Carrollian framework. Utilizing techniques from BRST quantization, we construct the BRST action for sCED and construct Nielsen identities to ascertain the independence of mass on the gauge fixing parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work employs the quantum extremal surface framework to compute the Page curve for black holes corrected by non-extensive entropy. The entropy of Hawking radiation increases linearly with time, leading to the persistence of the information paradox for non-extensive entropy-corrected black holes. At late time, we extremize the generalized entropy functional; incorporating contributions from both matter and the quantum extremal island, we establish that the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation saturates to the non-extensive extension of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Finally, we study the dependence of non-extensive parameters on the Page time.</description>

      <title>Can Q-balls describe cosmological and galactic dark matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cold Dark Matter (CDM) hypothesis accurately predicts large-scale structure formation and fits the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature fluctuations (CMB). However, observations of the inner regions of dark matter halos and dwarf galaxy satellites have consistently posed challenges to CDM. On the other hand, the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) hypothesis can explain galactic phenomena but fails to account for the complex shape of the CMB and matter power spectra. CDM and MOND are effective in nearly mutually exclusive regimes, prompting the question: Is there a physical mechanism where CDM and MOND share a common origin? Q-balls, which are localized, non-topological solitons, can be a bridge between the two hypotheses. Q-balls formed in the early Universe can mimic CDM at cosmological scales. Interestingly, Q-balls can exhibit MOND-like behavior in the late Universe at galactic scales, providing a unified framework. Specifically, we demonstrate that millicharged composite Q-balls formed from complex scalar fields, decoupled from the background radiation, can naturally arise during the radiation-dominated epoch. From the matter-radiation equality, we also obtain the mass of Q-balls to be $1~{eV}$, which are much smaller than the electron mass. Using the constraints from the invisible decay mode of ortho-positronium, we obtain $Q &lt; 3.4 \times 10^{-5}$. We also establish an upper bound on the number density of Q-balls, which depends on the charge of the Q-ball and the small initial charge asymmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the MOND naturally emerges at the galactic scale within the framework of our Q-ball model.</description>

      <title>Ultradense Dark Matter Halos with Poisson Noise from Stellar-Mass Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of Poisson noise, originating from the discrete distribution of stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs), on the abundance of ultradense dark matter halos (UDMHs). We incorporate the contribution of PBH shot noise into the power spectrum and modify the primordial power spectrum to calculate the differential mass function of UDMHs across various models, while accounting for crucial physical and geometrical factors. We further compare our results with observational constraints on the abundance of compact dark matter and the mass distribution of PBHs derived from the thermal history of the early Universe. Our findings demonstrate that the mass of PBHs contributing to Poisson noise plays a pivotal role in determining the abundance of UDMHs. Moreover, we show that Poisson noise from lighter PBHs strengthens the single-component dark matter scenario, whereas the corresponding effect from heavier PBHs supports the multi-component dark matter scenario.</description>

Abstract: We apply a voltage pulse to electrically excite the incompressible region of a two-dimensional electron liquid in the $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall state and investigate the collective excitations in both the edge and bulk via photoluminescence spectral energy shifts. Introducing an offset in the voltage pulse significantly enhances the excitation signal. Real-space and time-resolved measurements reveal the dynamics of the bulk excitations, with an estimated group velocity of approximately $3 \times 10^4$ m/s. These bulk excitations align well with the magneto-plasmon model. Our results highlight the topological link between edge and bulk states, providing a novel approach to exploring solid-state analogs of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Topological Casimir effect for fermionic condensate in AdS spacetime with compact dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate combined effects of gravitational field and spatial topology on the fermionic condensate (FC) for a massive Dirac field in locally anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime with a part of spatial dimensions compactified to a torus. For general phases in the periodicity conditions along compact dimensions the topological Casimir contribution is explicitly extracted and the renormalization is reduced to the one for purely AdS spacetime. The FC is an even periodic function of the magnetic flux enclosed by compact dimension with the period of flux quantum. The topological contribution vanishes on the AdS boundary and dominates in the total FC in the region near the AdS horizon. For proper lengths of compact dimensions smaller than the AdS curvature radius the influence of the gravitational field is weak and the leading term in the corresponding expansion coincides with the FC for a locally Minkowski spacetime with compact dimensions. For large proper lengths the decay of the topological FC follows a power law for both massless and massive field, in contrast to an exponential decay in Minkowski bulk for massive fields. Applications are discussed for 2D Dirac materials.</description>

      <title>Adjustable picometer-stable interferometers for testing space-based gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave detectors, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), use picometer-precision laser interferometry to detect gravitational waves at frequencies from 1 Hz down to below 0.1 mHz. Laser interferometers used for on-ground prototyping and testing of such instruments are typically constructed by permanently bonding or gluing optics onto an ultra-stable bench made of low-expansion glass ceramic. This design minimizes temperature coupling to length and tilt, which dominates the noise at low frequencies due to finite temperature stability achievable in laboratories and vacuum environments. Here, we present the study of an alternative opto-mechanical concept where optical components are placed with adjustable and freely positionable mounts on an ultra-stable bench, while maintaining picometer length stability. With this concept, a given interferometer configuration can be realised very quickly due to a simplified and speed-up assembly process, reducing the realisation time from weeks or months to a matter of hours. We built a corresponding test facility and verified the length stability of our concept by measuring the length change in an optical cavity that was probed with two different locking schemes, heterodyne laser frequency stabilisation and Pound-Drever-Hall locking. We studied the limitations of both locking schemes and verified that the cavity length noise is below 1 pm/sqrt(Hz) for frequencies down to 3 mHz. We thereby demonstrate that our concept can simplify the testing of interferometer configurations and opto-mechanical components and is suitable to realise flexible optical ground support equipment for space missions that use laser interferometry, such as future space-based gravitational wave detectors and satellite geodesy missions.</description>

      <title>Non-Keplerian Charged Accretion Disk Orbiting a Black Hole~Pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have focused on how spinning black holes (BHs) within a binary system containing a strongly magnetized neutron star, then immersed in external magnetic fields, can acquire charge through mechanisms like the Wald process and how this charge could power pulsar-like electromagnetic radiation. Those objects called ``Black hole pulsar'' mimic the behaviour of a traditional pulsar, and they can generate electromagnetic fields, such as magnetic dipoles. Charged particles within an accretion disk around the black hole would then be influenced not only by the gravitational forces but also by electromagnetic forces, leading to different geometries and dynamics. In this context, we focus here on the interplay of the magnetic dipole and the accretion disk. We construct the equilibrium structures of non-conducting charged perfect fluids orbiting Kerr black holes under the influence of a dipole magnetic field aligned with the rotation axis of the BH. The dynamics of the accretion disk in such a system are shaped by a complex interplay between the non-uniform, non-Keplerian angular momentum distribution, the black hole's induced magnetic dipole, and the fluid's charge. We show how these factors jointly influence key properties of the disk, such as its geometry, aspect ratio, size, and rest mass density.</description>

      <title>Note on 't Hooft's Shock Wave Commutators From Near Horizon Conformal Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a finite model of 't Hooft's shock wave commutation relations from the ansatz\cite{Carlip}\cite{Solodukhin}\cite{BZ} that the quantum degrees of freedom in a causal diamond in a solution of Einstein's Equations are those of a (cut-off\cite{BZ}\cite{hilbertbundles} ) 1 + 1 dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge related to the area of the diamond's holographic screen by equating Cardy's formula with the generalized Bekenstein-Hawking formula\cite{ted95}\cite{fsb}. The particular CFT is an exactly marginal perturbation of free massless fermions, as motivated by the Holographic Space-Time\cite{hilbertbundles} (HST) program. The momentum cutoff in $1 + 1$ dimensions and the Dirac eigenvalue cutoff on the transverse geometry, modify the 't Hooft relations when the area of the diamond is finite and remove all coincident point divergences in predictions derived from these commutation relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently found that connection coefficients of the Heun equation can be derived in closed form using crossing symmetry in two-dimensional Liouville theory via the Nekrasov-Shatashvili functions. In this work, we systematize this approach to second-order linear ODEs of Fuchsian type, which arise in the description of N = 2, four-dimensional quiver gauge theories. After presenting the general procedure, we focus on the specific case of Fuchsian equations with five regular singularities and present some applications to black hole perturbation theory. First, we consider a massive scalar perturbation of the Schwarzschild black hole in AdS7. Next, we analyze vector type perturbations of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS5 black hole. We also discuss the implications of our results in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence and present explicit results in the large spin limit, where we make connection with the light-cone bootstrap. Furthermore, using the spectral network technology, we identify the region of the moduli space in Seiberg-Witten theory that is relevant for the study of black hole quasinormal modes. Our results suggest that, in some cases, this region corresponds to the strong-coupling regime, highlighting the potential applicability of the conformal GMN TBA framework to address scenarios where the gravitational dictionary implies that the instanton counting parameters are not parametrically small.</description>

      <title>The Superconformal Index and Black Hole Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconformal index of ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(N)$ has provided powerful insights into the entropy of supersymmetric black holes in AdS$_5\times S^5$, including some sub-leading logarithmic and non-perturbative corrections. Recently, the phase space of supersymmetric solutions has been argued to contain configurations other than the asymptotically AdS$_5$ black hole. Such configurations include the so-called grey galaxies where the black hole at the center is surrounded by a gas of gravitons. By numerically evaluating the superconformal index of ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills at small values of $N$, we detect systematic deviations from the entropy of black holes with two distinct angular momenta. We find that the giant graviton expansion of the index is a numerically efficient way of evaluating the index that complements the direct character evaluation and allows for explicit access to $N\le 15$ with up to two giant gravitons in the expansion. We find it remarkable that a supersymmetric quantity in field theory, usually thought of as a rigid counting observable, indeed contains information about different phases in the space of supersymmetric solutions on the gravity side.</description>

      <title>The Irrelevance of Primordial Black Hole Clustering in the LVK mass range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in realistic models where primordial black holes are formed due to the collapse of sizeable inflationary perturbations, their initial spatial clustering beyond Poisson distribution does not play any role in the binary mergers, including sub-solar primordial black holes, responsible for the gravitational waves detectable by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. This is a consequence of the existing FIRAS CMB distortion constraints on the relevant scales. This conclusion might not hold for lighter masses potentially accessible by future gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of nonthermal fixed points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes play a prominent role in relaxation of diverse physical systems to equilibria, ranging from astrophysical black holes to tiny droplets of quark-gluon plasma at RHIC and LHC accelerators. We propose that a novel kind of quasinormal modes govern the direct approach to self-similar time evolution of nonthermal fixed points, whose relevance ranges from high energy physics to cold atom gases. We utilize black hole perturbation theory techniques to compute the spectrum of these far from equilibrium quasinormal modes for a kinetic theory with a Focker-Planck collision kernel in isotropic and homogeneous states. Our conclusion is that quasinormal modes of nonthermal fixed points give rise to a tower of progressively more decaying power-law contributions. A byproduct of our analysis is a precise determination and improved understanding of the distribution function characterizing nonthermal fixed points.</description>

      <title>High Energy Particle Collisions in the vicinity of Naked Singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate particle acceleration and high-energy collisions in the Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan (JMN-1) naked singularity, which, in the absence of an event horizon, allows infalling particles to turn back under specific angular momentum conditions. These outgoing particles can then collide with infalling ones, enabling the JMN-1 singularity to act as a natural high-energy particle accelerator. We derive the necessary expressions to compute the center-of-mass energy of two colliding particles and find that this energy can reach extremely high values, potentially even approaching Planck energy scales. We also explore the implications of these results, including the possible formation of microscopic black holes that could decay via Hawking radiation, releasing energy on the order of $10^{26} eV$ due to the extreme gravitational fields near the naked singularity. This scenario offers significant advantages. If horizonless compact objects exist in nature, these high-energy collisions could substantially influence the surrounding physical processes and might give rise to distinct observational signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for solutions describing slowly moving non-rotating black holes in the khrono-metric model, a modified gravity theory with preferred time (khronon) which arises at low energies from the non-projectable Horava gravity. We work in the decoupling limit when the back-reaction of the khronon on the metric is small and can be treated perturbatively. For a given black hole velocity, we find a family of solutions parameterized by the khronon propagation speed and regular everywhere outside the universal horizon. On the universal horizon they have a weak singularity manifesting itself in a non-analyticity of the khronon field. Using the behavior of khronon at infinity we extract the leading black hole sensitivity for which we obtain a simple analytic expression valid throughout the phenomenologically allowed parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes (QNMs) uniquely describe the dominant piece of the gravitational-wave ringdown of postmerger black holes. While the linear QNM regime has been extensively studied, recent work has highlighted the importance of second-perturbative-order, quadratic QNMs (QQNMs) arising from the nonlinear coupling of linear QNMs. Previous attempts to quantify the magnitude of these QQNMs have shown discrepant results. Using a new hyperboloidal framework, we resolve the discrepancy by showing that the QQNM/QNM ratio is a function not only of the black hole parameters but also of the ratio between even- and odd-parity linear QNMs: the ratio QQNM/QNM depends on what created the ringing black hole, but only through this ratio of even- to odd-parity linear perturbations.</description>

      <title>Dealing with data gaps for TianQin with massive black hole binary signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space-borne gravitational wave detectors like TianQin might encounter data gaps due to factors like micrometeoroid collisions or hardware failures. Such events will cause discontinuity in the data, presenting challenges to the data analysis for TianQin, especially for massive black hole binary mergers. Since the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) accumulates in a non-linear way, a gap near the merger could lead to a significant loss of SNR. It could introduce bias in the estimate of noise properties, and the results of the parameter estimation. In this work, using simulated TianQin data with injected a massive black hole binary merger, we study the window function method, and for the first time, the inpainting method to cope with the data gap, and an iterative estimate scheme is designed to properly estimate the noise spectrum. We find that both methods can properly estimate noise and signal parameters. The easy-to-implement window function method can already perform well, except that it will sacrifice some SNR due to the adoption of the window. The inpainting method is slower, but it can minimize the impact of the data gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reissner-Nordstrom anti de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole, characterized by electric charge and negative cosmological constant,exhibits a rich thermodynamics structure. In this paper, we consider the influence of quintessence, a hypothetical dark energy component with negative pressure. we have computed the extended generalized uncertainty principle (EGUP) corrections to the thermodynamics of RN-AdS black hole, including Hawking temperature, heat capacity, entropy function and pressure. Furthermore, as a special case of EGUP, we have computed and compared the result obtained from the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) with those from the extended uncertainty principle (EUP). This work contributes to the understanding of the interplay between fundamental physics and the macroscopic properties of black holes, offering a novel perspective on the thermodynamics of RN-AdS black holes in the context of quintessence and quantum gravity corrections. More importantly, we found that, unlike in the case of the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole, the qualitative behavior for the RN-AdS black hole with quintessence remain largely unchanged, except for minor differences, at the equation of state parameters w=-1/3 and w=-2/3. In addition , unlike RN black holes, the phase transition point of RN-AdS black holes shift to almost zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the late-time relaxation of a perturbed Schwarzschild black hole, driven by a source term representing an infalling particle in generic orbits. We consider quasi-circular and eccentric binaries, dynamical captures and radial infalls, with orbital dynamics driven by an highly accurate analytical radiation reaction. After reviewing the description of the late-time behaviour as an integral over the whole inspiral history, we derive an analytical expression exactly reproducing the slow relaxation observed in our numerical evolutions, obtained with a hyperboloidal compactified grid, for a given particle trajectory. We find this signal to be a superposition of an infinite number of power-laws, the slowest decaying term being Price's law. Next, we use our model to explain the several orders-of-magnitude enhancement of tail terms for binaries in non-circular orbits, shedding light on recent unexpected results obtained in numerical evolutions. In particular, we show the dominant terms controlling the enhancement to be activated when the particle is far from the BH, with small tangential and radial velocities soon before the plunge. As we corroborate with semi-analytical calculations, this implies that for large eccentricities the tail amplitude can be correctly extracted even when starting to evolve only from the last apastron before merger. We discuss the implications of these findings on the extraction of late-time tail terms in non-linear evolutions, and possible observational consequences. We also briefly comment on the scattering scenario, and on the connection with the soft graviton theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational path-integral of Gauss-Bonnet gravity is investigated and the transition from one spacelike boundary configuration to another is analyzed. Of particular interest is the case of Neumann and Robin boundary conditions which is known to lead to a stable Universe in Einstein-Hilbert gravity in four spacetime dimensions. After setting up the variational problem and computing the necessary boundary terms, the transition amplitude is computed \emph{exactly} in the mini-superspace approximation. The $\hbar\to0$ limit brings out the dominant pieces in the path-integral which is traced to an initial configuration corresponding to Hartle-Hawking no-boundary Universe. A deeper study involving Picard-Lefschetz methods not only allow us to find the integration contour along which the path integral becomes convergent but also aids in understanding the crossover from Euclidean to Lorentzian signature. Saddle analysis further highlights the boundary configurations giving dominant contribution to the path-integral which is seen to be those corresponding to Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal and agrees with the exact computation. To ensure completeness, a comparison with the results from Wheeler-DeWitt equation is done.</description>

      <title>Quantum Effects in 3+1 Schwarzschild-de Sitter Spacetime: Properties of the Hadamard Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a four-dimensional Schwarzschild-de Sitter background, the spherically symmetric $(\ell=0)$ contribution to the Hadamard two-point correlation function is computed for a massless minimally-coupled scalar field in the Unruh state. Consideration is given to spacetime points located between the black hole and cosmological horizons. Previously it was found in two dimensions at late times for spatially separated points that the Hadamard function exhibits unbounded linear growth in time, with a rate of growth proportional to the sum of the black hole and cosmological surface gravities. Here it is shown numerically that this instability persists in four dimensions, but with a modification of the two-dimensional result due to scattering effects associated with the scalar field modes. An analytic approximation is derived for the growth rate in four dimensions and, in the limit that the black hole vanishes, is found to be equivalent to the rate of growth for the Hadamard function found previously for de Sitter space in cosmological coordinates.</description>

Abstract: The ultralocal limit along timelike geodesics, in which any geometry reduces to Bianchi I, does not extend to non-geodesic timelike observers. Exceptions are discussed, including particles with variable mass, test particles in Einstein frame scalar-tensor gravity, and self-interacting dark matter.</description>

      <title>A mechanism to generate varying speed of light via Higgs-dilaton coupling: Theory and cosmological applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to $\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$, the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and $\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation $\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods, resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.</description>

      <title>The Stability of Anisotropic Compact Stars Influenced by Dark Matter under Teleparallel Gravity: An Extended Gravitational Deformation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our investigation, we pioneer the development of geometrically deformed strange stars within the framework of teleparallel gravity theory through gravitational decoupling via the complete geometric deformation (CGD) technique. The significant finding is the precise solution for deformed strange star (SS) models achieved through the vanishing complexity factor scenario. Further, we introduce the concept of space-time deformation caused by dark matter (DM) content in DM haloes, leading to perturbations in the metric potentials $g_{tt}$ and $g_{rr}$ components. Mathematically, this DM-induced deformation is achieved through the CGD method, where the decoupling parameter $\alpha$ governs the extent of DM influence. To validate our findings, we compare our model predictions with observational constraints, including GW190814 (with a mass range of $2.5-2.67 M_{\odot}$) and neutron stars (NSTRs) such as EXO 1785-248 [mass=$1.3_{-0.2}^{+0.2}~M_{\odot}$], 4U 1608-52 [mass=$1.74_{-0.14}^{+0.14}~M_{\odot}$], and PSR J0952-0607 [mass=$2.35_{-0.17}^{+0.17}~M_{\odot}$].
  Our investigation delves into the stability of the model by considering causality conditions, Herrera's Cracking Method, the adiabatic index, and the Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov criterion. We demonstrate that the developed model mimics a wide range of recently observed pulsars. To emphasize its compatibility, we highlight the predicted mass and radius in tabular form by varying both the parameters $\alpha$ and $\zeta_1$. Notably, our findings are consistent with the observation of gravitational waves from the first binary merger event. Furthermore, we compare our results with those obtained for a slow-rotating configuration. In addition to this, we discuss the moment of inertia using the Bejger-Haensel approach in this formulation.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence in the generalized uncertainty principle framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of a Schwarzschild black hole, surrounded by the quintessence energy-matter in the linear and quadratic generalized uncertainty principle framework. Considering the variance in the position to be of the order of the event horizon radius and equating the variance in the momentum to the Hawking temperature of the black hole, we substitute these variances in the deformed algebra. From there we obtained the generalized uncertainty principle-modified black hole temperature and eventually the specific heat of the black hole. Then we calculate the critical as well as the remnant mass and obtain the entropy relation. We observe that the entropy relation includes the usual leading order ``\textit{area divided by four}" term, sub-leading logarithmic term, and higher order inverse of the area corrections. Finally, calculating the energy output as a function of time, we obtain the evaporation time of the black hole. The results show the dependence of the quintessence parameter on the thermodynamic quantities in the framework of linear and quadratic generalized uncertainty principle.</description>

      <title>Space-based optical lattice clocks as gravitational wave detectors in search for new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04340v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity and performance of space-based Optical Lattice Clocks (OLCs) in detecting gravitational waves, in particular the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) at low frequencies $(10^{-4}, 1) \rm Hz$, which are inaccessible to ground-based detectors. We first analyze the response characteristics of a single OLC detector for SGWB detection and compare its sensitivity with that of Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Due to longer arm lengths, space-based OLC detectors can exhibit unique frequency responses and enhance the capability to detect SGWB in the low-frequency range, but the sensitivity of a single OLC detector remains insufficient overall compared to LISA. Then, as a preliminary plan, we adopt a method of cross-correlation on two OLC detectors to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This method leverages the uncorrelated origins but statistically similar properties of noise in two detectors while the SGWB signal is correlated between them, thus achieving effective noise suppression and sensitivity enhancement. Future advancements in OLC stability are expected to further enhance their detection performance. This work highlights the potential of OLC detectors as a promising platform for SGWB detection, offering complementary capabilities to LISA, and opening an observational window into more astrophysical sources and the early universe.</description>

Abstract: Black hole complementarity has been well understood in spherically symmetric black holes. To study its validity for an accelerating Schwarzschild black hole, which has a preferred direction, we perform the thought experiment proposed by Susskind and Thorlacius and further investigate the criteria set by Hayden and Preskill. First, we derive thermodynamic quantities that satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. Using these quantities, we conduct thought experiments based on the Page time and the scrambling time, which show that black hole complementarity remains valid, although the energy required for the duplication of information depends on the angle due to the axisymmetric metric.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Vanishing Nonlinear Love Numbers of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tidal Love numbers parametrize the conservative induced tidal response of self-gravitating objects. It is well established that asymptotically-flat black holes in four-dimensional general relativity have vanishing Love numbers. In linear perturbation theory, this result was shown to be a consequence of ladder symmetries acting on black hole perturbations. In this work, we show that a black hole's tidal response induced by a static, parity-even tidal field vanishes for all multipoles to all orders in perturbation theory. Our strategy is to focus on static and axisymmetric spacetimes for which the dimensional reduction to the fully nonlinear Weyl solution is well-known. We define the nonlinear Love numbers using the point-particle effective field theory, matching with the Weyl solution to show that an infinite subset of the static, parity-even Love number couplings vanish, to all orders in perturbation theory. This conclusion holds even if the tidal field deviates from axisymmetry. Lastly, we discuss the symmetries underlying the vanishing of the nonlinear Love numbers. An $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)$ algebra acting on a covariantly-defined potential furnishes ladder symmetries analogous to those in linear theory. This is because the dynamics of the potential are isomorphic to those of a static, massless scalar on a Schwarzschild background. We comment on the connection between the ladder symmetries and the Geroch group that is well-known to arise from dimensional reduction.</description>

Abstract: Black holes are extreme outcomes of General Relativity, and can form through a variety of ways, including gravitational collapse of massive stars, or quantum fluctuations in the early universe. Here, we ask the question of whether they can form via focusing of radiation by compact binaries or intense lasers, or via trapping at the light ring of black holes. We provide evidence that gravitational lensing of radiation from a small, finite number of sources is not a viable mechanism to form black holes.</description>

Abstract: Recently it was demonstrated that by adding to the Einstein-Hilbert action a series in powers of the curvature invariants with specially chosen coefficients one can obtain a theory of gravity which has spherically symmetric solutions describing regular black holes. Its reduced action depends on a function of one of the basic curvature invariants of the corresponding metric. In this paper we study a generalization of this model to the case when this function depends on all the basic curvature invariants. We show that the metrics which are solutions of such a model possess a universal scaling property. We demonstrate that there exists a special class of such models for which the ``master" equation for a basic curvature invariant is a linear second order ordinary differential equation. We specify a domain in the space of parameters of the model for which the corresponding solutions describe regular static spherically symmetric black holes and study their properties.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter, one of the fundamental components of the universe, has remained mysterious in modern cosmology and particle physics, and hence, this field is of utmost importance at present moment. One of the foundational questions in this direction is the origin of dark matter which directly links with its creation. In the present article we study the gravitational production of dark matter in two distinct contexts: firstly, when reheating occurs through the gravitational particle production, and secondly, when it is driven by the inflaton's decay. We establish a connection between the reheating temperature and the mass of dark matter, and from the reheating bounds, we determine the range of viable dark matter mass values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First, we explain some ambiguities of spacetime and metric field as fundamental concepts. Then, from the Unruh effect point of view and using the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, we construct an operator as a quanta of acceleration that we call quantum acceleration operator (QAO). Thereupon, we investigate the relation between the vacuum of two different frames in the Minkowski space. Also, we show that the vacuum of each accelerated frame in the Minkowski space can be obtained by applying such a QAO to the Minkowski vacuum. Furthermore, utilizing these QAOs, we augment the Hilbert space and then extract the metric field of a general frame of the Minkowski spacetime. In this approach, these concepts emerge from the Hilbert space through the constructed QAOs. Accordingly, such an augmented Hilbert space includes quantum field theory in a general frame and can be considered as a fundamental concept instead of the classical metric field and the standard Hilbert space.</description>

Abstract: General Relativity suffers for two main problems which have not yet been overcome: it predicts spacetime singularities and cannot be formulated as a perturbative renormalizable theory. In particular, many attempts have been made for avoiding singularities, such as considering higher order or infinite derivative theories. The price to pay in both cases is to give up locality and therefore they are known altogether as non-local theories of gravity. In this paper, we investigate how to recognize the presence of non-local effects by exploiting the power emitted by gravitational waves in a binary system in presence of non-local corrections as $R\Box^{-1}R$ to the Hilbert-Einstein action. After solving the field equations in terms of the source stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ and obtaining the gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor, $\tau_{\mu\nu}$, we find that the General Relativity quadrupole formula is modified in a non-trivial way, making it feasible to find a possible signature of non-locality. Our final results on the gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor could also be applied to several astrophysical scenarios involving energy or momentum loss, potentially providing multiple tests for non-local deviations from General Relativity. We finally discuss the detectability of the massless transverse scalar mode, discovering that, although this radiation is extremely weak, in a small range around the model divergence, its amplitude could fall within the low-frequency Einstein Telescope sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: The radiative properties of the accretion disks around rotating short-hairy black holes are studied. The geodesic motion of massive particles in the equatorial planes of short-hairy black holes and impact of the rotation parameter $a$, short-hair parameter $Q$ and power parameter $k$ on the geodesic motion is obtained. Then, we consider thin accretion disks around the short-hairy black holes. The radiative flux densities, effective temperatures, differential and spectral luminosity of the disks are investigated for various specific parameters. The impact of parameters $a,Q,k$ on these properties is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Exact plane gravitational radiation fields are presented within the framework of general relativity and their properties are described. The physics of nonlinear elliptically polarized plane gravitational waves is developed in close analogy with electromagnetic waves. The motion of free test particles in the dynamic gravitational fields of elliptically polarized plane waves is investigated. In particular, we demonstrate the cosmic jet property of these spacetimes, namely, most timelike geodesics tend to line up in the direction of wave propagation and produce a cosmic jet whose speed asymptotically approaches the speed of light.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we propose a new paradigm for cosmology: a time dependent scalar condensate background originated from the quadratic $(R + \alpha R^2)$ Starobinski model, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $\alpha$ the coupling constant. In weak gravity limit the system decouples into a conventional graviton and a higher derivative scalar. It was shown earlier through works from our group, \cite{ssg,sg,us}, that the latter can sustain an oscillatory lowest energy configuration or a {\it{Geometric Condensate}} as it consists entirely of metric degrees of freedom. In the present work, we study Gravitational Wave propagation in this condensate background. We show that the explicit time dependent nature of the condensate can generate curvature and radiation-like contributions in the scale factor evolution in FLRW cosmology. Subsequently the condensate leaves its signature on the Gravitational Wave profile as it propagates in the condensate modified FLRW spacetime. The wave profile is calculated analytically in terms of Whittaker functions. The main novelty of the Geometric Condensate scheme is that no external (condensate) matter from outside has been considered.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Quasinormal Modes of Black Holes in $f(\mathbb{T})$ and $f(\mathbb{Q})$ Gravity</title>

Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes of static and spherically symmetric black holes in vacuum within the framework of $f(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathbb{Q} + \alpha \mathbb{Q}^2$ gravity, and compare them with those in $f(\mathbb{T}) = \mathbb{T} + \alpha \mathbb{T}^2$ gravity. Based on the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, we notice that the gravitational effects arise from non-metricity (the covariant derivative of metrics) in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity rather than curvature in $f(R)$ or torsion in $f(\mathbb{T})$. Using the finite difference method and the sixth-order WKB method, we compute the quasinormal modes of massless scalar field and electromagnetic field perturbations. Tables of quasinormal frequencies for various parameter configurations are provided based on the sixth-order WKB method. Our findings reveal the differences in the quasinormal modes of black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity compared to those in $f(R)$ and $f(\mathbb{T})$ gravity. This variation demonstrates the impact of different parameter values, offering insights into the characteristics of $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity. These results provide the theoretical groundwork for assessing alternative gravities' viability through gravitational wave data, and aid probably in picking out the alternative gravity theory that best aligns with the empirical reality.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Ringing and Shadows of Black Holes and Wormholes in Dark Matter-Inspired Weyl Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl gravity naturally generates effective dark matter and cosmological constant terms as integration constants, eliminating the need to explicitly introduce them into the theory. Additionally, the framework permits three intriguing solutions for compact objects: an asymptotically de Sitter Schwarzschild-like black hole described by the Mannheim-Kazanas solution, a non-Schwarzschild black hole, and a traversable wormhole that exists without exotic matter. In this work, we investigate the quasinormal spectra of all three solutions.
  We demonstrate that when the mass of the black hole corresponding to the Mannheim-Kazanas solution approaches zero, the perturbation equations yield an exact solution expressible through hypergeometric functions. The quasinormal modes of black holes in Weyl gravity can be classified into three distinct branches: Schwarzschild-like modes modified by effective dark matter and cosmological terms, and modes associated with empty spacetime (de Sitter and dark matter branches), which are further influenced by the black hole mass. Previous studies have shown that the dark matter term induces a secondary stage of quasinormal ringing following the initial Schwarzschild phase. Here, we compute the frequencies using convergent methods and elucidate how this unique time-domain behavior translates into the frequency domain.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate that the non-Schwarzschild black hole can be distinguished from both the Schwarzschild-like solution and the wormhole through their distinct quasinormal spectra. We also compute shadow radii for black holes and wormholes within Weyl gravity, revealing that wormholes with large throat radii can produce significantly smaller shadows compared to black holes of equivalent mass.</description>

      <title>Making Sense of Gravitational Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of statistical methods to model gravitational systems is crucial to physics practice, but the extent to which thermodynamics and statistical mechanics genuinely apply to these systems is a contentious issue. This paper provides new conceptual foundations for gravitational thermodynamics by reconsidering the nature of key concepts like equilibrium and advancing a novel way of understanding thermodynamics. The challenges arise from the peculiar characteristics of the gravitational potential, leading to non-extensive energy and entropy, negative heat capacity, and a lack of standard equilibrium. Hence it has been claimed that only non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is warranted in this domain, whereas thermodynamics is inapplicable. We argue instead that equilibrium statistical mechanics applies to self-gravitating systems at the relevant scale, as they display equilibrium in the form of metastable quasi-equilibrium states. We then develop a minimal framework for thermodynamics that can be applied to these systems and beyond. Thermodynamics applies in the sense that we can devise macroscopic descriptions and explanations of the behaviour of these systems in terms of coarse-grained quantities like energy and temperature within equilibrium statistical mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the WQFT partition function, specifically the eikonal phase in a black hole scattering event in the dynamical Chern-Simons theory, using the techniques of spinning worldline quantum field theory. We consider the scattering of spinning black holes and highlight the necessary details for the calculation of the partition function. We present the $\epsilon$-expansion of the essential two-loop integrals using Integration-by-Parts (IBP) reduction and differential equation techniques, which we then utilize to compute the linear-in-order spin eikonal phase up to 3PM. Additionally, we discuss the dependence of the phase on the spin orientations of the black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a gravitational dual to a constriction Josephson junction constructed from the AdS/BCFT correspondence. On the gravity side, we consider a planar AdS-Schwarzschild black hole. Our junction is connected by the boundary $\partial\Omega$ with tension $\Sigma$ on the boundary CFT. This approach lead us to analytical solutions rather than usual numerical methods. Our computations on the gravity side reproduce the standard relation between the current across the junction and the phase difference of the condensate controlled by the tension $\Sigma$. We also study the maximum current's dependence on the junction's tension and size and reproduce familiar results.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical search method for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes in noisy space-based detector data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future space-based laser interferometric detectors, such as LISA, will be able to detect gravitational waves (GWs) generated during the inspiral phase of stellar-mass binary black holes (SmBBHs). The detection and characterization of GWs from SmBBHs poses a formidable data analysis challenge, arising from the large number of wave cycles that make the search extremely sensitive to mismatches in signal and template parameters in a likelihood-based approach. This makes the search for the maximum of the likelihood function over the signal parameter space an extremely difficult task. We present a data analysis method that addresses this problem using both algorithmic innovations and hardware acceleration driven by GPUs. The method follows a hierarchical approach in which a semi-coherent $\mathcal{F}$-statistic is computed with different numbers of frequency domain partitions at different stages, with multiple particle swarm optimization (PSO) runs used in each stage for global optimization. An important step in the method is the judicious partitioning of the parameter space at each stage to improve the convergence probability of PSO and avoid premature convergence to noise-induced secondary maxima. The hierarchy of stages confines the semi-coherent searches to progressively smaller parameter ranges, with the final stage performing a search for the global maximum of the fully-coherent $\mathcal{F}$-statistic. We test our method on 2.5 years of a single LISA TDI combination and find that for an injected SmBBH signal with a SNR between $\approx 11$ and $\approx 14$, the method can estimate (i) the chirp mass with a relative error of $\lesssim 0.01\%$, (ii) the time of coalescence within $\approx 100$ sec, (iii) the sky location within $\approx 0.2$ ${\rm deg}^2$, and (iv) orbital eccentricity at a fiducial signal frequency of 10 mHz with a relative error of $\lesssim 1\%$.

      <title>Plane wave limits of Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the covariant formulation of Penrose's plane wave limit by Blau et al., we construct for any Riemannian metric $g$ a family of "plane wave limits" of one higher dimension. These limits are taken along geodesics of $g$, yield simpler metrics of Lorentzian signature, and are isometric invariants. They can also be seen to arise locally from a suitable expansion of $g$ in Fermi coordinates, and they directly encode much of $g$'s geometry. For example, normal Jacobi fields of $g$ are encoded as geodesics of its plane wave limits. Furthermore, $g$ will have constant sectional curvature if and only if each of its plane wave limits is locally conformally flat. In fact $g$ will be flat, or Ricci-flat, or geodesically complete, if and only if all of its plane wave limits are, respectively, the same. Many other curvature properties are preserved in the limit, including certain inequalities, such as signed Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>Absence of one-loop effects on large scales from small scales in non-slow-roll dynamics II: Quartic interactions and consistency relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove explicitly the absence of one-loop corrections to large scales from small scales in transient non-slow-roll dynamics. Specifically, we address loop corrections to the primordial power spectrum, relative to tree-level, that are independent of the ratio between the two scales. We review all the necessary components, adapted to our context, to express one-loop diagrams as three-point functions, emphasizing the crucial role played by quartic interactions. Notably, we include the quartic Hamiltonian induced by the cubic Lagrangian and quartic interactions that are ensured by diffeomorphism invariance. We then explicitly prove consistency relations for an arbitrary transient non-slow-roll phase involving operators with (time) derivatives. Finally, we calculate one-loop corrections by including contributions from the relevant cubic and quartic interactions, and express the final result as a total derivative term over comoving momenta, utilizing the consistency relations we established. This leads us to conclude that one-loop corrections to long-wavelength modes are unaffected by the physics of short and enhanced modes in non-slow-roll dynamics.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependence in $\Lambda$CDM parameters inferred from the CMB: a possible sign of Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early dark energy (EDE) model is one of the promising solutions to the Hubble tension. One of the successes of the EDE model is that it can provide a similar fit to the $\Lambda$CDM model for the CMB power spectrum. In this work, I analyze the phenomenology of the EDE and $\Lambda$CDM parameters on the CMB temperature power spectrum and notice that this cannot hold on all scales. Thus, if the real cosmology is as described by the EDE model, the $\Lambda$CDM parameters will be scale-dependent when fitting the CMB power spectrum with the $\Lambda$CDM model, which can be hints for the EDE model. I examine CMB-S4-like observations through mock data analysis and find that parameter shifts are notable. As observations include smaller scales, I find lower $H_0$, $n_s$, $\omega_b$ and higher $\omega_m$, $A_s e^{-2\tau}$, which will also constitute new tensions with other observations. They can serve as a possible signal for the EDE model.</description>

      <title>A recent confirmation of the wide binary gravitational anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concerning recent published studies exploring the presence or otherwise of a gravitational anomaly at low accelerations in wide binary stars
  as observed by the {\it Gaia} satellite, the paper published by Cookson on the subject last year presents an interesting case. In that study,
  RMS values of binned relative internal velocities in 1D for wide binaries are compared to Newtonian predictions for that quantity, with the
  author concluding that the data presented show no indication of any inconsistency with Newtonian expectations. However, the comparison presented
  is critically flawed, as the Newtonian predictions used refer to wide binaries with mean total masses of 2.0 $M_{\odot}$. This is larger than
  the 1.56 $M_{\odot}$ value which applies to the data used in said paper. In this short note we correct the error mentioned above and show that
  the data and error bars as given by Cookson are in fact inconsistent with Newtonian expectations. Contrary to the assertion in that study,
  the data presented there actually show a clear anomaly in the low acceleration gravitational regime, { with the overall slope of the
  velocity-separation scaling being inconsistent with Newtonian expectations at a 3.3$\sigma$ level.} Based on the data presented in the paper
  by Cookson, wide binary systems show a clear Milgromian deviation from Newtonian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Observable CMB B-modes from Cosmological Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A B-mode polarization signal in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is widely regarded as smoking gun evidence for gravitational waves produced during inflation. Here we demonstrate that tensor perturbations from a cosmological phase transition can produce a B-mode signal whose strength rivals that of testable inflationary predictions across a range of observable scales. Although phase transitions arise from causal sub-horizon physics, they nevertheless exhibit a white noise power spectrum on super-horizon scales. Power is suppressed on the large scales relevant for CMB B-mode polarization, but it is not necessarily negligible. For appropriately chosen phase transition parameters, the maximal B-mode amplitude can compete with inflationary predictions that can be tested with current and future experiments. These scenarios can be differentiated by performing measurements on multiple angular scales, since the phase transition signal predicts peak power on smaller scales.</description>

      <title>Post-processing subtraction of tilt-to-length noise in LISA in the presence of gravitational wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be the first space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory. It will measure gravitational wave signals in the frequency regime from 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz. The success of these measurements will depend on the suppression of the various instrument noises. One important noise source in LISA will be tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling. Here, it is understood as the coupling of angular jitter, predominantly from the spacecraft, into the interferometric length readout. The current plan is to subtract this noise in-flight in post-processing as part of a noise minimization strategy. It is crucial to distinguish TTL coupling well from the GW signals in the same readout to ensure that the noise will be properly modeled. Furthermore, it is important that the subtraction of TTL noise will not degrade the GW signals. In the present manuscript, we show on simulated LISA data and for four different GW signal types that the GW responses have little effect on the quality of the TTL coupling fit and subtraction. Also, the GW signal characteristics were not altered by the TTL coupling subtraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the effect of wave function renormalization (WFR) in asymptotically safe gravity. We show that there are two WFR-invariant quantities, and the renormalization (RG) equations may be written entirely in terms of these quantities. The same set of RG equations can be obtained whether we fix the vacuum energy or Newton coupling along the RG trajectory. The flow of the Newton constant and the vacuum energy is also discussed in detail. In particular we discuss how the vacuum energy behaves near the singular barrier in the low energy.</description>

      <title>Brickwall One-Loop Determinant: Spectral Statistics &amp; Krylov Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon -- a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon -- within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</description>
