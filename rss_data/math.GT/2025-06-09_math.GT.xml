      <title>Minimal generating sets of groups of Kim-Manturov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a series of groups defined by Kim and Manturov. These groups have their background in triangulations of a surface and configurations of points, lines or circles on the surface. They are expected to have relationships to many geometric objects. In this paper, we give a minimal generating set of the group and determine the abelianization. We also introduce some related groups which might be helpful to understand the structure of the original groups.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of fine curve graphs of planar surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fine curve graph of a surface is the graph whose vertices are simple closed essential curves in the surface and whose edges connect disjoint curves. In this paper, we prove that the automorphism group of the fine curve graph of a surface is naturally isomorphic to the homeomorphism group of the surface for boundaryless planar surfaces with at least 7 punctures.</description>

      <title>Proper actions on finite products of hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A group $G$ is said to have property (PH') if there exist finitely many hyperbolic spaces $X_1,\cdots,X_n$ on which $G$ acts coboundedly such that the diagonal action of $G$ on the product $\prod_{i=1}^nX_i$ equipped with $\ell^1$-metric is proper. A group $G$ has property (PH) if it virtually has property (PH'). This notion is a generalization of property (QT) introduced by Bestvina-Bromberg-Fujiwara \cite{BBF21}. In this paper, we initiate the study of property (PH) of groups and give a complete characterization of groups with property (PH') or (PH) from lineal actions.
  In addition, by considering a central extension of groups $1\to Z\to E\to G\to 1$, we prove that $E$ has property (PH) (resp. (QT)) if and only if $G$ has property (PH) (resp. (QT)) and the Euler class of the extension is bounded. We also derive similar results for amalgamated direct products and graph products. As corollaries, we characterize when 3-manifold groups have property (PH) and obtain more interesting examples with property (QT) including the central extension of residually finite hyperbolic groups, the mapping class group of any finite-type surface and the outer automorphism group of torsion-free one-ended hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <title>Torus knots in adjoint representation and Vogel's universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vogel's universality gives a unified description of the adjoint sector of representation theory for simple Lie algebras in terms of three parameters $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$, which are homogeneous coordinates of Vogel's plane. It is associated with representation theory within the framework of Chern-Simons theory only, and gives rise to universal knot invariants. We extend the list of these latter further, and explain how to deal with the adjoint invariants for the torus knots $T[m,n]$ considering the case of $T[4,n]$ with odd $n$ in detail.</description>

      <title>Thick isotopy property and the mapping class groups of Heegaard splittings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.11548v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the fundamental group of the space of Heegaard splittings of an irreducible $3$-manifold to be finitely generated. The condition is exactly the conclusion of the thick isotopy lemma proved by Colding, Gabai and Ketover, which says that any isotopy of a Heegaard surface is achieved by a $1$-parameter family of surfaces with area bounded above by a universal constant and with some ``thickness property''. We also prove that a Heegaard splitting of a hyperbolic or spherical $3$-manifold satisfies the condition if it is topologically minimal (in the sense of Bachman) and its disk complex has finitely generated homotopy group. In conclusion, such a Heegaard splitting has finitely generated mapping class group.</description>

      <title>A surgery approach to abelian quotients of the level 2 congruence group and the Torelli group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide algorithms for computing the Rochlin invariants of mod 2 homology spheres and mapping tori. This provides a unified framework for studying two families of maps: the Birman-Craggs maps of the Torelli group, and Sato's maps of the level 2 congruence subgroup of the mapping class group. Our framework gives new, elementary proofs that both families of maps are homomorphisms, gives an explicit method for evaluating these maps on Dehn twists, and relates the two families when restricted to the Torelli group. It also gives a relation between an extension of the Birman-Craggs maps to the level 2 congruence subgroup, and Meyer's signature cocycle.</description>

      <title>Quantized geodesic lengths for Teichm\"uller spaces: algebraic aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1980's H Verlinde suggested to construct and use a quantization of Teichm\"uller spaces to construct spaces of conformal blocks for the Liouville conformal field theory. This suggestion led to a mathematical formulation by Fock in 1990's and later by Fock, Goncharov and Shen, called the modular functor conjecture, based on the Chekhov-Fock quantum Teichm\"uller theory. In 2000's Teschner combined the Chekhov-Fock version and the Kashaev version of quantum Teichm\"uller theory to construct a solution to a modified form of the conjecture. We embark on a direct approach to the conjecture based on the Chekhov-Fock(-Goncharov) theory. We construct quantized trace-of-monodromy along simple loops via Bonahon and Wong's quantum trace maps developed in 2010's, and investigate algebraic structures of them, which will eventually lead to construction and properties of quantized geodesic length operators. We show that a special recursion relation used by Teschner is satisfied by the quantized trace-of-monodromy, and that the quantized trace-of-monodromy for disjoint loops commute in a certain strong sense.</description>

      <title>On the symmetric braid index of ribbon knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the symmetric braid index $b_s(K)$ of a ribbon knot $K$ to be the smallest index of a braid whose closure yields a symmetric union diagram of $K$, and derive a Khovanov-homological characterisation of knots with $b_s(K)$ at most three. As applications, we show that there exist knots whose symmetric braid index is strictly greater than the braid index, and deduce that every chiral slice knot with determinant one has braid index at least four. We also calculate bounds for $b_s(K)$ for prime ribbon knots with at most 11 crossings.</description>

      <title>Ideal Triangulations and Once-Punctured Surface Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known result of Walsh states that if $\mathcal T^*$ is an ideal triangulation of an atoroidal, acylindrical, irreducible, compact 3-manifold with torus boundary components, then every properly embedded, two-sided, incompressible surface $S$ is isotopic to a spun-normal surface unless $S$ is isotopic to a fiber or virtual fiber. Previously it was unknown if for such a 3-manifold an ideal triangulation in which a fiber spun-normalizes exists. We give a proof of existence and give an algorithm to construct the ideal triangulation provided the 3-manifold has a single boundary component.</description>

      <title>Sparse spectrally rigid sets for negatively curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose that $(M,\mathfrak{g})$ is a compact Riemannian manifold with strictly negative sectional curvatures. A subset of conjugacy classes $E \subset \text{conj}(\pi_1(M))$ is called spectrally rigid if when two negatively curved Riemannian metrics $\mathfrak{g}_1, \mathfrak{g}_2$ on $M$ have the same marked length spectrum on $E$, then their marked length spectra coincide everywhere. In this work we show that there are arbitrarily sparse spectrally rigid sets and that they exist, in some sense, in every direction in $\pi_1(M)$.</description>
