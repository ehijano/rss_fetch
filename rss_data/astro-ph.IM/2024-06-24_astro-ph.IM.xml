      <title>Gnuastro: Generating polar plots in Astronomical images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a structure displays dependence on distance and azimuthal angle from a center (for example the spiral arms of galaxies or the diffraction spikes of stars), projecting the pixels to polar coordinates greatly simplifies their study. This projection from one pixel grid to another is known as a "polar plot". For this purpose, a new option has been added to the GNU Astronomy Utilities (Gnuastro) in version 0.23 to "astscript-radial-profile" script, which we describe in this research note. The figures of this research note are reproducible with Maneage, on the Git commit 5d34243.</description>

      <title>Single-photon gig in Betelgeuse's occultation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from the occultation of Betelgeuse by asteroid (319) Leona on December 12, 2023, observed using a 64x64 pixel Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) array mounted on a 10-inch telescope at the AstroCamp Observatory in Nerpio, Southeast of Spain, just a few kilometers from the center of the occultation shadow path. This study highlights remarkable advancements in applying SPAD technology in astronomy. The SPAD array's asynchronous readout capacity and photon-counting timestamp mode enabled a temporal resolution of 1 microsecond in our light curve observations of Betelgeuse. Our data analysis addressed challenges inherent to SPAD arrays, such as optical cross-talk and afterpulses, which typically cause the photon statistics to deviate from a Poisson distribution. By adopting a generalized negative binomial distribution for photon statistics, we accurately describe the observational data. This method yielded an optical cross-talk estimation of 1.07% in our SPAD array and confirmed a negligible impact of spurious detected events due to afterpulses. The meticulous statistical examination of photon data underscores our SPAD-array's exceptional performance in conducting precise astronomical observations. The observations revealed a major decrease in Betelgeuse's intensity by 77.78% at the occultation's peak, allowing us to measure Betelgeuse's angular diameter at 57.26 mas in the SDSS g-band. This measurement, employing a simplified occultation model and considering the known properties of Leona, demonstrates the potential of SPAD technology for astronomy and sets a new standard for observing ultra-rapid transient celestial events, providing a valuable public dataset for the astronomical community.</description>

      <title>CCAT: Detector Noise Limited Performance of the RFSoC-based Readout Electronics for mm/sub-mm/far-IR KIDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST), on Cerro Chajnantor in the Atacama desert of Chile, will conduct wide-field and small deep-field surveys of the sky with more than 100,000 detectors on the Prime-Cam instrument. Kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) were chosen as the primary sensor technology for their high density focal plane packing. Additionally, they benefit from low cost, ease of fabrication, and simplified cryogenic readout, which are all beneficial for successful deployment at scale. The cryogenic multiplexing complexity is pulled out of the cryostat and is instead pushed into the digital signal processing of the room temperature electronics. Using the Xilinx Radio Frequency System on a Chip (RFSoC), a highly multiplexed KID readout was developed for the first light Prime-Cam and commissioning Mod-Cam instruments. We report on the performance of the RFSoC-based readout with multiple detector arrays in various cryogenic setups. Specifically we demonstrate detector noise limited performance of the RFSoC-based readout under the expected optical loading conditions.</description>

      <title>The high-contrast performance of the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC), a series of upgrades to the Keck II Adaptive Optics System and Instrument Suite, aims to demonstrate high-resolution spectroscopy of faint exoplanets that are spatially resolved from their host stars. In this paper, we measure KPIC's sensitivity to companions as a function of separation (i.e., the contrast curve) using on-sky data collected over four years of operation. We show that KPIC is able to reach contrasts of $1.3 \times 10^{-4}$ at 90 mas and $9.2 \times 10^{-6}$ at 420 mas separation from the star, and that KPIC can reach planet-level sensitivities at angular separations within the inner working angle of coronagraphic instruments such as GPI and SPHERE. KPIC is also able to achieve more extreme contrasts than other medium-/high-resolution spectrographs that are not as optimized for high-contrast performance. We decompose the KPIC performance budget into individual noise terms and discuss limiting factors. The fringing that results from combining a high-contrast imaging system with a high-resolution spectrograph is identified as an important source of systematic noise. After mitigation and correction, KPIC is able to reach within a factor of 2 of the photon noise limit at separations &lt; 200 mas. At large separations, KPIC is limited by the background noise performance of NIRSPEC.</description>

      <title>The Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper: Completion of the 120-lens array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper is a mosaic telescope comprising 120 Canon telephoto lenses, based on the design of the Dragonfly Telephoto Array. With a wide field of view, and the addition of the "Dragonfly Filter-Tilter" instrumentation holding ultra narrow bandpass filters in front of each lens, the Dragonfly Spectral Line mapper is optimized for ultra low surface brightness imaging of visible wavelength line emission. The Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper was constructed and commissioned in four phases from March 2022 to November 2023. During this time, four individual mounts of 30 lenses each were constructed and commissioned. The commissioning of the telescope included the deployment of the "Dragonfly StarChaser" which carries out image stabilization corrections in the telephoto lens, to enable hour-long exposures to be taken. In addition, we introduced new instrumentation such as a film to cover the optics to keep the filters clean. Here we describe the updated design of the complete 120-lens array, and the implementation of the instrumentation described above. Additionally, we present updated characterization of the cameras and filter transmission for the full array. Finally, we reflect on the construction and commissioning process of the complete 120-lens array Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper, and remark on the feasibility of a larger 1000-lens array.</description>

      <title>Pulscan: Binary pulsar detection using unmatched filters on NVIDIA GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fourier Domain Acceleration Search (FDAS) and Fourier Domain Jerk Search (FDJS) are proven matched filtering techniques for detecting binary pulsar signatures in time-domain radio astronomy datasets. Next generation radio telescopes such as the SPOTLIGHT project at the GMRT produce data at rates that mandate real-time processing, as storage of the entire captured dataset for subsequent offline processing is infeasible. The computational demands of FDAS and FDJS make them challenging to implement in real-time detection pipelines, requiring costly high performance computing facilities. To address this we propose Pulscan, an unmatched filtering approach which achieves order-of-magnitude improvements in runtime performance compared to FDAS whilst being able to detect both accelerated and some jerked binary pulsars. We profile the sensitivity of Pulscan using a distribution (N = 10,955) of synthetic binary pulsars and compare its performance with FDAS and FDJS. Our implementation of Pulscan includes an OpenMP version for multicore CPU acceleration, a version for heterogeneous CPU/GPU environments such as NVIDIA Grace Hopper, and a fully optimized NVIDIA GPU implementation for integration into an AstroAccelerate pipeline, which will be deployed in the SPOTLIGHT project at the GMRT. Our results demonstrate that unmatched filtering in Pulscan can serve as an efficient data reduction step, prioritizing datasets for further analysis and focusing human and subsequent computational resources on likely binary pulsar signatures.</description>

      <title>Gravity.jl: fast and accurate gravitational lens modeling in Julia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Gravity.jl, a new software for the modeling of gravitational lens systems. Gravity.jl is written in the Julia programming language, and is designed to be fast, accurate, and flexible. It can be used to model gravitational lens systems composed of multiple lensing planes, and to perform Bayesian inference on the lens model parameters. In this paper we present the theoretical and statistical ideas behind the code, and we describe its main features. In this first paper of the series, we focus on the modeling of point-like and small extended sources, for which we can linearize the lens equation. We show a practical use of Gravity.jl on a galaxy-scale lens, and we compare the results with those obtained with other codes. We also show how Gravity.jl can be used to perform Bayesian inference on cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Software infrastructure for the highly-distributed semi-autonomous Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper (DSLM) is a semi-autonomous, distributed-aperture based telescope design, featuring a modular setup of 120 Canon telephoto lenses, and equal numbers of ultra-narrowband filters, detectors, and other peripherals. Here we introduce the observatory software stack for this highly-distributed system. Its core is the Dragonfly Communication Protocol (DCP), a pure-Python hardware communication framework for standardized hardware interaction. On top of this are 120 REST-ful FastAPI web servers, hosted on Raspberry Pis attached to each unit, orchestrating command translation to the hardware and providing diagnostic feedback to a central control system running the global instrument control software. We discuss key features of this software suite, including docker containerization for environment management, class composition as a flexible framework for array commands, and a state machine algorithm which controls the telescope during autonomous observations.</description>

      <title>SPRINT for WFAO systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calibration of future wide field adaptive optics (WFAO) systems requires knowledge of the geometry of the system, in particular the alignment parameters between the sub-apertures of the wavefront sensors (WFS), pupil and deformable mirror (DM) actuator grid. Without this knowledge, closed-loop operation is not possible and the registration must be identified with an error significantly smaller than the sub-aperture size to achieve the nominal performance of the adaptive optics system. Furthermore, poor accuracy in this estimation will not only affect performance, but could also prevent the closed loop from being stable. Identification is not trivial because in a WFAO system several elements can move with respect to each other, more than in a SCAO system. For example, the pairing of the sub-aperture and the actuator grating on a DM conjugated to an altitude different from 0 can depend on the size of the pupil on the WFS, the exact conjugation of the DM, the position of the guide star and the field rotation. This is the same for each WFS/DM pair. SPRINT, System Parameters Recurrent INvasive Tracking, is a strategy for monitoring and compensating for DM/WFS mis-registrations and has been developed in the context of single conjugate adaptive optics (SCAO) systems for the ESO Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). In this work, we apply SPRINT in the context of WFAO systems with multiple WFSs and DMs, investigating the best approach for such systems, considering a simultaneous identification of all parameters or subsequent steps working on one DM at a time.</description>

      <title>ForSE+: Simulating non-Gaussian CMB foregrounds at 3 arcminutes in a stochastic way based on a generative adversarial network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ForSE+, a Python package that produces non-Gaussian diffuse Galactic thermal dust emission maps at arcminute angular scales and that has the capacity to generate random realizations of small scales. This represents an extension of the ForSE (Foreground Scale Extender) package, which was recently proposed to simulate non-Gaussian small scales of thermal dust emission using generative adversarial networks (GANs). With the input of the large-scale polarization maps from observations, ForSE+ has been trained to produce realistic polarized small scales at 3' following the statistical properties, mainly the non-Gaussianity, of observed intensity small scales, which are evaluated through Minkowski functionals. Furthermore, by adding different realizations of random components to the large-scale foregrounds, we show that ForSE+ is able to generate small scales in a stochastic way. In both cases, the output small scales have a similar level of non-Gaussianity compared with real observations and correct amplitude scaling as a power law. These realistic new maps will be useful, in the future, to understand the impact of non-Gaussian foregrounds on the measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) signal, particularly on the lensing reconstruction, de-lensing, and the detection of cosmological gravitational waves in CMB polarization B-modes.</description>

      <title>New Candidates for Organic-rich Regions on Ceres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the spatial distribution of organics on Ceres using the visible and near-infrared data collected by the Dawn mission. We employ a spectral mixture analysis (SMA) approach to map organic materials within the Ernutet crater at the highest available spatial resolution revealing a discontinuous, granular distribution and a possible correlation with an ancient crater on which Ernutet has been superimposed. The SMA technique also helps us identify 11 new areas as potential sites for organics. These regions are predominantly located within craters or along their walls, resembling the distribution pattern observed in Ernutet, which implies a possible geological link with materials exposed from beneath the surface. In one of these candidate regions situated in the Yalode quadrangle, we detected the characteristic 3.4-micron absorption band in the infrared spectrum, indicative of organics and carbonates. By combining the spatial resolution of the Framing Camera data with the spectral resolution of the Visual and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer using SMA, we investigated the distribution of the 3.4-micron band in this quadrangle. The absorption pattern correlates with the Yalode/Urvara smooth material unit, which formed after significant impacts on Ceres. The association of organic-rich materials with complex and multiple large-impact events supports for an endogenous origin for the organics on Ceres.</description>

      <title>The development of ground-based Gamma-ray astronomy: a historical overview of the pioneering experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ground-based technique for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes became a rapidly developing and powerful branch of science. Thanks to this technique, over 250 very high-energy gamma-ray sources of galactic and extragalactic origin have been discovered. Many fundamental questions of astrophysics, astro-particle physics, the physics of cosmic rays and cosmology are the focus of this technique. In the past 33 years since the discovery of the first gamma-ray source, the Crab Nebula, the discipline has made remarkable progress. Today, the technology boasts highly sensitive telescopes capable of detecting a point source 100 times fainter than the standard candle, the Crab Nebula, in 25 hours of observation. Further developments in this technology led to the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), the next-generation large instrument. The sensitivity of CTA will be several times higher than that of the current best instruments. This article presents a brief history of ground-based very high energy gamma-ray astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Optically Quiet, But FUV Loud: Results from comparing the far-ultraviolet predictions of flare models with TESS and HST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The far-ultraviolet (FUV) flare activity of low-mass stars has become a focus in our understanding of the exoplanet atmospheres and how they evolve. However, direct detection of FUV flares and measurements of their energies and rates are limited by the need for space-based observations. The difficulty of obtaining such observations may push some works to use widely available optical data to calibrate multi-wavelength spectral models that describe UV and optical flare emission. These models either use single temperature blackbody curves to describe this emission, or combine a blackbody curve with archival spectra. These calibrated models would then be used to predict the FUV flare rates of low-mass stars of interest. To aid these works, we used TESS optical photometry and archival HST FUV spectroscopy to test the FUV predictions of literature flare models. We tested models for partially (M0-M2) and fully convective (M4-M5) stars, 40 Myr and field age stars, and optically quiet stars. We calculated FUV energy correction factors that can be used to bring the FUV predictions of tested models in line with observations. A flare model combining optical and NUV blackbody emission with FUV emission based on HST observations provided the best estimate of FUV flare activity, where others underestimated the emission at all ages, masses and activity levels, by up to a factor of 104 for combined FUV continuum and line emission and greater for individual emission lines. We also confirmed previous findings that showed optically quiet low-mass stars exhibit regular FUV flares.</description>

Abstract: ComPair is a prototype gamma-ray telescope for the development of key technologies for next-generation gamma-ray detectors consisting of four subsystems: a 10-layer double-sided silicon strip detector tracker, a cadmium zinc telluride calorimeter, a cesium iodide calorimeter, and a plastic anti-coincidence detector (ACD). The ACD acts as an active shield to veto charged particle events and consists of 5 plastic scintillating panels. ComPair was launched as a balloon payload from Ft. Sumner, New Mexico and completed a 6-hour flight on August 27, 2023. Here we detail the design adn calibration of the ComPair ACD, and report on the ACD's veto efficiency and other performance metrics during the ComPair fight.</description>

      <title>Spectral Redundancy for Calibrating Interferometers and Suppressing the Foreground Wedge in 21cm Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01422</link>

Abstract: Observations of 21cm line from neutral hydrogen promise to be an exciting new probe of astrophysics and cosmology during the Cosmic Dawn and through the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) to when dark energy accelerates the expansion of the Universe. At each of these epochs, separating bright foregrounds from the cosmological signal is a primary challenge that requires exquisite calibration. In this paper, we present a new calibration method called nucal that extends redundant-baseline calibration, allowing spectral variation in antenna responses to be solved for by using correlations between visibilities measuring the same angular Fourier modes at different frequencies. By modeling the chromaticity of the beam-weighted sky with a tunable set of discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS), we develop a calibration loop that optimizes for spectrally smooth calibrated visibilities. Crucially, this technique does not require explicit models of the sky or the primary beam. With simulations that incorporate realistic source and beam chromaticity, we show that this method solves for unsmooth bandpass features, exposes narrowband interference systematics, and suppresses smooth-spectrum foregrounds below the level of 21cm reionization models, even within much of the so-called "wedge" region where current foreground mitigation techniques struggle. We show that this foreground subtraction can be performed with minimal cosmological signal loss for certain well-sampled angular Fourier modes, making spectral-redundant calibration a promising technique for current and next-generation 21cm intensity mapping experiments.</description>

      <title>The Santa Barbara Binary-Disk Code Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13039</link>

Abstract: We have performed numerical calculations of a binary interacting with a gas disk, using eleven different numerical methods and a standard binary-disk setup. The goal of this study is to determine whether all codes agree on a numerically converged solution, and to determine the necessary resolution for convergence and the number of binary orbits that must be computed to reach an agreed-upon relaxed state of the binary-disk system. We find that all codes can agree on a converged solution (depending on the diagnostic being measured). The zone spacing required for most codes to reach a converged measurement of the torques applied to the binary by the disk is roughly 1% of the binary separation in the vicinity of the binary components. For our disk model to reach a relaxed state, codes must be run for at least 200 binary orbits, corresponding to about a viscous time for our parameters, $0.2 (a^2 \Omega_B /\nu)$ binary orbits, where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. We did not investigate dependence on binary mass ratio, eccentricity, disk temperature, or disk viscosity; therefore, these benchmarks may act as guides towards expanding converged solutions to the wider parameter space but might need to be updated in a future study that investigates dependence on system parameters. We find the most major discrepancies between codes resulted from the dimensionality of the setup (3D vs 2D disks). Beyond this, we find good agreement in the total torque on the binary between codes, although the partition of this torque between the gravitational torque, orbital accretion torque, and spin accretion torque depends sensitively on the sink prescriptions employed. In agreement with previous studies, we find a modest difference in torques and accretion variability between 2D and 3D disk models. We find cavity precession rates to be appreciably faster in 3D than in 2D.</description>

      <title>L-DIT: A dApp for Live Detectability, Identifiability and Trackability for ASOs on the Behavioral Dynamics Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the number of Anthropogenic Space Objects (ASOs) grows, there is an urgent need to ensure space safety, security, and sustainability (S3) for long-term space use. Currently, no globally effective method can quantify the safety, security, and Sustainability of all ASOs in orbit. Existing methods such as the Space Sustainability Rating (SSR) rely on volunteering private information to provide sustainability ratings. However, the need for such sensitive data might prove to be a barrier to adoption for space entities. For effective comparison of ASOs, the rating mechanism should apply to all ASOs, even retroactively, so that the sustainability of a single ASO can be assessed holistically. Lastly, geopolitical boundaries and alignments play a crucial and limiting role in a volunteered rating system, limiting the space safety, security, and sustainability. This work presents a Live Detectability, Identifiability, and Trackability (L-DIT) score through a distributed app (dApp) built on top of the Behavioral Dynamics blockchain (BDB). The BDB chain is a space situational awareness (SSA) chain that provides verified and cross-checked ASO data from multiple sources. This unique combination of consensus-based information from BDB and permissionless access to data allows the DIT scoring method presented here to be applied to all ASOs. While the underlying BDB chain collects, filters, and validates SSA data from various open (and closed if available) sources, the L-DIT dApp consumes the data from the chain to provide L-DIT score that can contribute towards an operator's, manufacturer's, or owner's sustainability practices. Our dApp provides data for all ASOs, allowing their sustainability score to be compared against other ASOs, regardless of geopolitical alignments, providing business value to entities such as space insurance providers and enabling compliance validation and enforcement.</description>

      <title>Windows Into Other Worlds: Pitfalls in the physical interpretation of exoplanet atmospheric spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12765</link>

Abstract: Atmospheric spectroscopy provides a window into the properties of exoplanets. However, the physical interpretation of retrieved data and its implications for the internal properties of exoplanets remains nebulous. This letter addresses three misconceptions held by some atmospheric spectroscopists regarding the connection between observed chemical abundances and theory: (1) Whether atmospheric spectroscopy can provide the bulk atmospheric chemistry, (2) whether it can identify if a planet is cloudless, and (3) whether atmospheric evaporation arguments can be used to dismiss certain compositions inferred through spectroscopy. This letter concludes by exploring applications of remote sensing in the quest for the search for life outside of our solar system.</description>

      <title>Combining reference-star and angular differential imaging for high-contrast imaging of extended sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-contrast imaging (HCI) is a technique designed to observe faint signals near bright sources, such as exoplanets and circumstellar disks. The primary challenge in revealing the faint circumstellar signal near a star is the presence of quasi-static speckles, which can produce patterns on the science images that are as bright, or even brighter, than the signal of interest. Strategies such as angular differential imaging (ADI) or reference-star differential imaging (RDI) aim to provide a means of removing the quasi-static speckles in post-processing. In this paper, we present and discuss the adaptation of state-of-the-art algorithms, initially designed for ADI, to jointly leverage angular and reference-star differential imaging (ARDI) for direct high-contrast imaging of circumstellar disks. Using a collection of high-contrast imaging data sets, we assess the performance of ARDI in comparison to ADI and RDI based on iterative principal component analysis (IPCA). These diverse data sets are acquired under various observing conditions and include the injection of synthetic disk models at various contrast levels. Our results demonstrate that ARDI with IPCA improves the quality of recovered disk images and the sensitivity to planets embedded in disks, compared to ADI or RDI individually. This enhancement is particularly pronounced when dealing with extended sources exhibiting highly ambiguous structures that cannot be accurately retrieved using ADI alone, and when the quality of the reference frames is suboptimal, leading to an underperformance of RDI. We finally apply our method to a sample of real observations of protoplanetary disks taken in star-hopping mode, and propose to revisit the protoplanetary claims associated with these disks.</description>
