      <title>Analysis of optical pattern formation on glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of particular patterns when light passes through glass. Experimentally, we use various glass plates, registering each reflected and transmitted outcome. Thus, we find the condition to form a common pattern, namely, randomly scratched plates produce the halos. We engineer other optical patterns by means of the specular holography method. Using the Defocusing Microscopy technique, we study the geometric properties of the glass, establishing the physical and mathematical model for a simulation. Our computational results agree well with the experimental ones, leading us to conclude that the pattern formation is governed by specular reflection on various points along the scratches. Our findings give an initial explanation for the pattern formation on glass, in particular for the halo design.</description>

      <title>Remote Electric Powering by Germanium Photovoltaic Conversion of an Erbium-Fiber Laser Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The commercially available 4000-Watt continuous-wave Erbium-doped-fiber laser, emitting at the 1567-nanometer wavelength where the atmosphere has high transmission, provides an opportunity for harvesting electric power at remote off the grid locations using a multi-module photovoltaic receiver panel. This paper proposes a 32-element monocrystalline thick-layer Germanium photovoltaic panel for efficient harvesting of a collimated 1.13-meter-diameter beam.The 0.78-meter squared PV panel is constructed from commercial Ge wafers. For incident continuous-wave laser-beam power in the 4000 to 10000 Watt range, our thermal and electrical and infrared simulations predict 660 to 1510 Watts of electrical output at panel temperatures of 350 to 423 Kelvin.</description>

      <title>Agile Free-Form Signal Filtering with a Chaotic-Cavity-Backed Non-Local Programmable Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filter synthesis is an inverse problem that is traditionally approached rationally by considering spatially disjoint resonators, approximating them as lumped elements, and engineering the coupling of selected pairs. This approach strongly limits the design space, making it challenging to build extremely tunable filters. Here, we demonstrate agile free-form signal filtering with an alternative purely-optimization-based design paradigm using a programmable system with many spatially overlapping modes. We back a programmable metallic metasurface with a quasi-2D chaotic cavity, inducing strong non-local interactions between all meta-elements and the connected ports. Thereby, the metasurface efficiently controls the transfer function between the ports. Our all-metallic device has unique advantages: ultra-wideband (UWB) tunability (7.5-13.5GHz), low loss, compactness, guaranteed linearity under high signal-power levels. First, we experimentally confirm theoretical predictions about reflectionless and transmissionless scattering modes; we also experimentally observe transmissionless exceptional points. Second, we impose diverse types of transfer function zeros at desired frequencies within an UWB range. Third, we achieve low-loss reflectionless programmable signal routing. Fourth, we investigate the trade-off between routing fidelity and bandwidth, achieving 20dB discrimination over 10MHz bandwidth. Fifth, we demonstrate UWB tunable multi-band filters that reject (&lt;-24dB) or pass (&gt;-1dB) signals in specified bands whose centers, widths and number are reprogrammable.</description>

      <title>Radiative Thermal Transistor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing thermal analogues of field-effect transistor could open the door to a low-power and even zero-power communication technology working with heat rather than electricity. These solid-sate devices could also find many applications in the field of active thermal management in numerous technologies (microelectronic, building science, energy harvesting,conversion,...). Recent theoretical works has suggested that a photonic transistor made with three terminals can in principle be used to switch, modulate, and even amplify heat flux through exchange of thermal photons. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of thermal transistor effect using a non-contact system composed by a temperature-controlled metal-insulator-based material interacting in far-field regime with two blackbodies held at two different temperatures. We demonstrate that, with a tiny change in the temperature of the active layer, the heat flux received by the cold blackbody can be drastically modified. An amplification parameter of heat flux over 20 is reported.</description>

      <title>Microheater hotspot engineering for repeatable multi-level switching in foundry-processed phase change silicon photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonvolatile photonic integrated circuits employing phase change materials have relied either on optical switching mechanisms with precise multi-level control but poor scalability or electrical switching with seamless integration and scalability but mostly limited to a binary response. Recent works have demonstrated electrical multi-level switching; however, they relied on the stochastic nucleation process to achieve partial crystallization with low demonstrated repeatability and cyclability. Here, we re-engineer waveguide-integrated microheaters to achieve precise spatial control of the temperature profile (i.e., hotspot) and, thus, switch deterministic areas of an embedded phase change material cell. We experimentally demonstrate this concept using a variety of foundry-processed doped-silicon microheaters on a silicon-on-insulator platform to trigger multi-step amorphization and reversible switching of Sb$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ and Ge$_{2}$Sb$_{2}$Se$_{4}$Te alloys. We further characterize the response of our microheaters using Transient Thermoreflectance Imaging. Our approach combines the deterministic control resulting from a spatially resolved glassy-crystalline distribution with the scalability of electro-thermal switching devices, thus paving the way to reliable multi-level switching towards robust reprogrammable phase-change photonic devices for analog processing and computing.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile Silicon Photonic MEMS Switch Based on Centrally-Clamped Stepped Bistable Mechanical Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-performance photonic switches are essential for large-scale optical routing for AI large models and Internet of things. Realizing nonvolatility can further reduce power consumption and expand application scenarios. We propose a nonvolatile 2*2 silicon photonic micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) switch compatible with standard silicon photonic foundry processes. The switch employs electrostatic comb actuator to change the air gap of the horizontal adiabatic coupler and achieves nonvolatility with centrally-clamped stepped bistable mechanical beams. The photonic switch shows a 10 us-scale switching speed and a 10 fJ-scale simulated switching energy in a 100*100 um^2 footprint, with &lt;=26 V driving voltages.</description>

      <title>Visual and quantitative analysis of the trapping volume in dielectrophoresis of nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoparticle manipulations require a careful analysis of the forces at play. Unfortunately, traditional force measurement techniques based on the particle velocity do not provide a sufficient resolution, while balancing approaches involving counteracting forces are often cumbersome. Here, we demonstrate that a nanoparticle dielectrophoretic response can be quantitatively studied by a straightforward visual delineation of the dielectrophoretic trapping volume. We reveal this volume by detecting the width of the region depleted of gold nanoparticles by the dielectrophoretic force. Comparison of the measured widths for various nanoparticle sizes with numerical simulations obtained by solving the particle-conservation equation shows excellent agreement, thus providing access to the particles physical properties, such as polarizability and size. These findings can be further extended to investigate various types of nano-objects $-$ including bio- and molecular aggregates $-$ and offer a robust characterization tool that can enhance the control of matter at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Imaging nanomechanical vibrations and manipulating parametric mode coupling via scanning microwave microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel platform based on scanning microwave microscopy for manipulating and detecting tiny vibrations of nanoelectromechanical resonators using a single metallic tip. The tip is placed on the top of a grounded silicon nitride membrane, acting as a movable top gate of the coupled resonator. We demonstrate its ability to map mechanical modes and investigate mechanical damping effects in a capacitive coupling scheme, based on its spatial resolution. We also manipulate the energy transfer coherently between the mode of the scanning tip and the underlying silicon nitride membrane, via parametric coupling. Typical features of optomechanics, such as anti-damping and electromechanically induced transparency, have been observed. Since the microwave optomechanical technology is fully compatible with quantum electronics and very low temperature conditions, it should provide a powerful tool for studying phonon tunnelling between two spatially separated vibrating elements, which could potentially be applied to quantum sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conducting Polymer Dendrites (CPD) are truly inspiring for unconventional electronics that shapes topological circuitries evolving upon an application. Driven by electrochemical processes, an electrochemical impedance rules signal propagation from one node to another. However, clear models dictating their behavior in an electroactive electrolyte have not been identified yet. In this study, we investigate on CPD in an aqueous electrolyte by impedance spectroscopy to unify their signal transport with an electrical model, aiming to define a circuit simulation block to integrate these objects in systems for in materio information processing.</description>

      <title>Mechanical stresses in pouch cells: a reduced order model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a pouch cell battery, the intercalation of lithium ions into the active particles means the electrodes want to expand. However, since the electrodes are attached to stiff current collectors, this expansion is constrained, leading to a macro-scale deformation and a residually stressed state. This stress state affects the electrochemistry and can also lead to mechanical degradation, causing a reduction in performance. We model the mechanical state of stress in the battery assuming a known compositional expansion of the electrodes, and use asymptotic techniques to generate reduced order models by exploiting the thin aspect ratio, as well as the large stiffness of the current collectors. We obtain analytic expressions for the stress in the bulk of the electrodes and at the interface between electrodes and current collectors, and a reduced-order equation whose solution describes the tension in the current collectors. We compare our results with full 3D finite element simulations with excellent agreement, and use our results with the battery simulation package PyBaMM to predict a realistic stress state in a discharging battery.</description>

      <title>Enhancement in Photoluminescence of Pt/Ag-Pt Embedded ZrO2 Thin Films by Plasma Co-sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platinum, Silver-Platinum embedded Zirconia (Pt/Ag-Pt ZrO2) thin films have been fabricated on silicon wafers and glass substrates using the plasma co-sputtering method. Zirconia thin films are of significant technological importance due to their remarkable electrical, optical, and mechanical properties, as well as their high melting temperature of 2715{\deg}C, which makes them increasingly attractive for various applications. In this study, ZrO2 thin films were deposited for 3 minutes, followed by the deposition of Pt-Ag/Pt onto the fabricated zirconia thin films, with deposition times ranging from 15 to 60 seconds. The varying deposition times of Pt-Ag/Pt influenced the optical and electronic properties of the thin films due to alterations in their surface roughness. The characteristics of the grown zirconia and Pt/Ag-Pt sputtered zirconia nanostructures were investigated using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), UV-visible spectroscopy, and Photoluminescence spectroscopy. The optical transmittance of these thin films was examined across the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges. The investigation revealed various properties, such as enhanced photoluminescence and the emergence of new peaks in the visible range spectra. Plasmonic peaks were induced, and an increase in the sharpness of these peaks was observed between 403.15 nm and 512.10 nm for the Pt/Ag-Pt deposited samples. This enhancement in photoluminescence is attributed to the plasmonic properties of Pt-Ag nanoparticles on the zirconia thin film. The study demonstrates that these optically tuned thin film coatings, with their enhanced photoluminescence properties, can significantly improve the heat-resistance capacity of devices, mitigating issues related to overheating and device shutdown.</description>

      <title>Unusual Pore Volume Dependence of Water Sorption in Monolithic Metal-Organic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolithic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which have a continuous structure composed of small primary MOF particles and amorphous networks, are demonstrated to possess larger pore volume and thus better larger gas uptake capacity compared to their powder forms. Here, we systematically investigated the water vapor adsorption kinetics in a prototypical MOF, i.e., MOF-801. Our results show that the total pore volume (average pore diameter) of the monolithic MOF-801 is 0.831 cm3/g (5.20 nm) which is much larger than that of powder MOF-801, i.e., 0.488 cm3/g (1.95 nm). Unexpectedly, we find that the water uptake capacity of monolithic MOF-801 is much lower than that of powder MOF-801 when the RH ranges from 10% to 90%. Our molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrate that the unexpected water uptake capacity of monolithic MOF-801 at RH of 10%~90% is caused by the water film formed by the capillary condensation in these mesopores of monolithic MOF-801. The water molecules can overcome the capillary force when the RH is higher than 90%, and then leads to the increase of the corresponding water uptake capacity of monolithic MOF-801. Our findings reveal the underlying mechanisms for water adsorption kinetics in both powder and monolithic MOFs, which could motivate and benefit the new passive cooling or water harvesting system design based on MOFs.</description>

      <title>Frequency-resolved Raman Thermometry Analysis via a Multi-layer Heat Transfer Model for Bulk and Low-dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman thermometry is advantageous for measuring the thermal transport of low-dimensional materials due to its non-contact nature. Transient Raman methods have improved the accuracy of steady-state Raman thermometry by removing the need for accurate temperature calibration and laser absorption evaluation. However, current methods often resort to finite element analysis (FEA) to decipher the measured signals. This step is time-consuming and impedes its ubiquitous adaptation. In this work, we replace the FEA by fitting the transient-state Raman signal to a three-dimensional (3D) analytical heat transfer model for measuring the thermal conductivity of two bulk layered materials [i.e., molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) crystals] and the interfacial thermal conductance (h) of CVD-grown MoS2 and molybdenum di-selenide (MoSe2) on quartz (SiO2). Our measured results agree reasonably well with literature and theoretical calculations. We also performed a quantitative sensitivity analysis to give insights on how to improve the measurement sensitivity. Our work provides an efficient way to process the data of transient-based Raman thermometry for high throughput measurements.</description>

      <title>Unifying thermophotovoltaic performance metrics with technoeconomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics (TPV) are becoming a promising new heat engine with rapid recent gains in performance. Their performance is characterized by two metrics: efficiency and power density. As we bridge the gap between lab-scale and system-scale devices, we need to understand how each of these metrics impacts the technoeconomics of a TPV system. In this work, we develop a technoeconomic metric based on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) to understand how the metrics should be weighted relative to each other in terms of importance. We find that systems with high infrastructure and fuel costs should prioritize TPV efficiency, while systems where the TPV cell cost dominates should prioritize power density. We then evaluate how concrete cell improvements could improve the technoeconomics of five example systems, identifying the most impactful specific properties. Namely, improving spectral control with sub-bandgap reflectance is the most effective at reducing LCOE in systems with high infrastructure cost, while increasing view factor and reducing series resistance are most critical in systems with high TPV cell cost. Improving just 1-2 of these properties can reduce the LCOE by 30-50%. This study therefore helps researchers understand which performance metric is more important for their application and how to achieve high values of this performance metric.</description>

      <title>Rapid cargo verification with cosmic ray muon scattering and absorption tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic ray muon tomography is considered a promising method for the non-invasive inspection of shipping containers and trucks. It utilizes highly penetrating cosmic-ray muons and their interactions with various materials to generate three-dimensional images of large and dense, like inter-modal shipping containers, typically not transparent with conventional X-ray radiography technique. The commonly used methods for imaging with muons are based on muon scattering or absorption-transmission data analysis. Due to large thickness of cargo material in shipping container substantial scattering and absorption occur when muons passing through cargo.
  One of the key tasks of customs and border security is to verify shipping container declarations to prevent illegal trafficking, and muon tomography could be a viable choice for this task. In this paper, we demonstrate through Monte Carlo simulations using the GEANT4 toolkit that a combined analysis of muon scattering and absorption data can improve the identification of cargo materials compared to using scattering or absorption data alone. The statistical differences in scattering and absorption data for several cargo materials are quantified. For a particular smuggling scenario where tobacco declared as paper towel rolls, it is demonstrated that the combined analysis can accurately distinguish between tobacco and paper towel rolls with 5.5$\sigma$ accuracy for detector spatial resolution (FWHM) of 0.235 mm, 4.5$\sigma$ for 1.175 mm resolution (FWHM), and 3.5$\sigma$ accuracy for 2.35 mm spatial resolution (FWHM), in a short scanning time of 10 seconds. This rapid detection capability has significant implications for anti-smuggling efforts and cargo inspection.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted 3D Printing of Thermoelectric Materials of Ultrahigh Performances at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric energy conversion is an attractive technology for generating electricity from waste heat and using electricity for solid-state cooling. However, conventional manufacturing processes for thermoelectric devices are costly and limited to simple device geometries. This work reports an extrusion printing method to fabricate high-performance thermoelectric materials with complex 3D architectures. By integrating high-throughput experimentation and Bayesian optimization (BO), our approach significantly accelerates the simultaneous search for the optimal ink formulation and printing parameters that deliver high thermoelectric performances while maintaining desired shape fidelity. A Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based machine learning model is employed to expeditiously predict thermoelectric power factor as a function of ink formulation and printing parameters. The printed bismuth antimony telluride (BiSbTe)-based thermoelectric materials under the optimized conditions exhibit an ultrahigh room temperature zT of 1.3, which is by far the highest in the printed thermoelectric materials. The machine learning-guided ink-based printing strategy can be highly generalizable to a wide range of functional materials and devices for broad technological applications.</description>

      <title>Shape Synthesis and 3D Ceramic Printing of Non-canonical MIMO Dielectric Resonator Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we report a shape synthesis method for multi-mode dielectric resonator antennas (DRA) using characteristic mode theory (CMT) and a binary genetic algorithm (BGA). By including the antenna's characteristic modal responses (resonance frequencies and quality factors) in the cost function, the shape synthesis process is conducted without including excitation feeds. Through the optimization procedure, a non-canonical dielectric body is formed from tetrahedral elements to support the required modal properties. As a demonstration of the proposed design approach, two three-mode MIMO DRAs are synthesized from both a rectangular and a cylindrical volume to operate at 2.45 GHz. The synthesized MIMO DRA's complex shape (based on rectangle) is then fabricated using Nanoparticle jetted zirconia. A combination of probe and slot feeds are employed to excite the desired modes. Due to the orthogonality of the characteristic modes and the careful design of the feeding network, isolation $&gt;20$ dB is achieved between all ports.</description>

      <title>Fracture and size effect in mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resort to variational methods to evaluate the asymptotic behavior of fine metamaterials as a function of cell size. To zeroth order, the metamaterial behaves as a micropolar continuum with both displacement and rotation degrees of freedom, but exhibits linear-elastic fracture mechanics scaling and therefore no size effect. To higher order, the overall energetics of the metastructure can be characterized explicitly in terms of the solution of the zeroth-order continuum problem by the method of {\Gamma}-expansion. We present explicit expressions of the second-order correction for octet frames. As an application, we evaluate the compliance of double-cantilever octet specimens to second order and use the result to elucidate the dependence of the apparent toughness of the specimen on cell size. The analysis predicts the discreteness of the metamaterial lattice to effectively shield the crack-tip, a mechanism that we term lattice shielding. The theory specifically predicts anti-shielding, i. e., coarser is weaker, in agreement with recent experimental observations.</description>

      <title>High-power and narrow-linewidth laser on thin-film lithium niobate enabled by photonic wire bonding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has emerged as a promising platform for the realization of high-performance chip-scale optical systems, spanning a range of applications from optical communications to microwave photonics. Such applications rely on the integration of multiple components onto a single platform. However, while many of these components have already been demonstrated on the TFLN platform, to date, a major bottleneck of the platform is the existence of a tunable, high-power, and narrow-linewidth on-chip laser. Here, we address this problem using photonic wire bonding to integrate optical amplifiers with a thin-film lithium niobate feedback circuit, and demonstrate an extended cavity diode laser yielding high on-chip power of 78 mW, side mode suppression larger than 60 dB and wide wavelength tunability over 43 nm. The laser frequency stability over short timescales shows an ultra-narrow intrinsic linewidth of 550 Hz, while long-term recordings indicate a high passive stability of the photonic wire bonded laser with 46 hours of mode-hop-free operation. This work verifies photonic wire bonding as a viable integration solution for high performance on-chip lasers, opening the path to system level upscaling and Watt-level output powers.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional non-reciprocal transport in photonic topological heterostructure of arbitrary shape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic wave propagation in three-dimensional space typically suffers omnidirectional scattering when encountering obstacles. In this study, we employed Chern vectors to construct a topological heterostructure, where large-volume non-reciprocal topological transport in three-dimension is achieved. The shape of the cross-section in the heterostructure can be arbitrary designed, and we experimentally observed the distinctive cross-shaped field pattern transport, non-reciprocal energy harvesting, and most importantly, the remarkable ability of electromagnetic wave to traverse obstacles and abrupt structure changes without encountering reflections in 3D space.</description>

      <title>CMOS-fabricated ultraviolet light modulators using low-loss alumina piezo-optomechanical photonic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a CMOS-foundry-fabricated piezo-optomechanical photonic integrated circuit platform for ultraviolet and blue wavelengths, using alumina waveguides that are strongly mechanically coupled to monolithically integrated aluminum nitride piezoelectric actuators. Low waveguide losses are measured down to at least 320 nm, where we achieve 1.6 dB/cm. This allows us to demonstrate broadband amplitude modulators based on piezoelectrically actuated MEMS cantilever phase-shifters down to 320 nm, with a high extinction ratio of 30 dB. We further demonstrate the versatility of the platform by designing and demonstrating a modulator that can work with high extinction and low loss at 320 nm and 420 nm, simultaneously, demonstrating control of multiple, disparate wavelengths in one device. We also demonstrate narrow-band resonant racetrack modulators with quality factors of 4.7E5 and a tuning rate of 27.5 MHz/V. These results should open doors for a range of novel applications in UV photonics, quantum science, sensing and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Assisted End-to-End Design for Dispersive Full-Parameter Control of Meta-Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible control light field across multiple parameters is the cornerstone of versatile and miniaturized optical devices. Metasurfaces, comprising subwavelength scatterers, offer a potent platform for executing such precise manipulations. However, the inherent mutual constraints between parameters of metasurfaces make it challenging for traditional approaches to achieve full-parameter control across multiple wavelengths. Here, we propose a universal end-to-end inverse design framework to directly optimize the geometric parameter layout of meta-optics based on the target functionality of full-parameter control across multiple wavelengths. This framework employs a differentiable forward simulator integrating a neural network-based dispersive full-parameter Jones matrix and Fourier propagation to facilitate gradient-based optimization. Its superiority over sequential forward designs in dual-polarization channel color holography with higher quality and tri-polarization three-dimensional color holography with higher multiplexed capacity is showcased. To highlight the universality, we further present polarized spectral multi-information processing with six arbitrary polarizations and three wavelengths. This versatile, differentiable, system-level design framework is poised to expedite the advancement of meta-optics in integrated multi-information display, imaging, and communication, extending to multi-modal sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Influence of fluid rheology on multistability in the unstable flow of polymer solutions through pore constriction arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diverse chemical, energy, environmental, and industrial processes involve the flow of polymer solutions in porous media. The accumulation and dissipation of elastic stresses as the polymers are transported through the tortuous, confined pore space can lead to the development of an elastic flow instability above a threshold flow rate. This flow instability can generate complex flows with strong spatiotemporal fluctuations, despite the low Reynolds number ($\mathrm{Re} \ll 1$); for example, in 1D ordered arrays of pore constrictions, this unstable flow can be multistable, with distinct pores exhibiting distinct unstable flow states. Here, we examine how this multistability is influenced by fluid rheology. Through experiments using diverse polymer solutions having systematic variations in fluid shear-thinning or elasticity, in pore constriction arrays of varying geometries, we show that the onset of multistability can be described using a single dimensionless parameter. This parameter, the streamwise Deborah number, compares the stress relaxation time of the polymer solution to the time required for the fluid to be advected between pore constrictions. Our work thus helps to deepen understanding of the influence of fluid rheology on elastic instabilities, helping to establish guidelines for the rational design of polymeric fluids with desirable flow behaviors.</description>

      <title>A Novel Design of Capacitive Plasmonic Near Field Transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A near field transducer (NFT) is a key photonics component in heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) for the localized heating of the magnetic medium. In this work, we present a novel NFT design through capacitive coupling. In our design, tapered metal bars separated by thin dielectric materials with gap distance G are used to create the plasmonic resonance and focus the electromagnetic field. The design is motivated by the intention to improve thermal stability, which can be achieved through segmentation using thermally stable dielectric material between the plasmonic metal bars. Using COMSOL Multiphysics software, the performance of this capacitive-coupled NFT is systematically modeled. It is shown that the electromagnetic field could gradually be focused through the tapering towards the air bearing surface (ABS). In addition, the focusing effect could be enhanced with a smaller NFT peg size at the resonant wavelength. The material selection for the NFT tip material will be discussed to further address the thermal stability of the device. In conclusion, this capacitive-coupled NFT with dielectric separation gaps and tapering yields an enhanced |E| field intensity at the tip with the potential for an enhanced material thermal stability. Such a design can also exhibit applications in other energy delivery systems as well as plasmonic waveguides and sensors.</description>

      <title>Data on the Move: Traffic-Oriented Data Trading Platform Powered by AI Agent with Common Sense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the digital era, data has become a pivotal asset, advancing technologies such as autonomous driving. Despite this, data trading faces challenges like the absence of robust pricing methods and the lack of trustworthy trading mechanisms. To address these challenges, we introduce a traffic-oriented data trading platform named Data on The Move (DTM), integrating traffic simulation, data trading, and Artificial Intelligent (AI) agents. The DTM platform supports evident-based data value evaluation and AI-based trading mechanisms. Leveraging the common sense capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess traffic state and data value, DTM can determine reasonable traffic data pricing through multi-round interaction and simulations. Moreover, DTM provides a pricing method validation by simulating traffic systems, multi-agent interactions, and the heterogeneity and irrational behaviors of individuals in the trading market. Within the DTM platform, entities such as connected vehicles and traffic light controllers could engage in information collecting, data pricing, trading, and decision-making. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed AI agent-based pricing approach enhances data trading by offering rational prices, as evidenced by the observed improvement in traffic efficiency. This underscores the effectiveness and practical value of DTM, offering new perspectives for the evolution of data markets and smart cities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study employing LLMs in data pricing and a pioneering data trading practice in the field of intelligent vehicles and smart cities.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Behavior of the Dielectric and Pyroelectric Responses of Ferroelectric Fine-Grained Ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revealed the anomalous temperature behavior of the giant dielectric permittivity and unusual frequency dependences of the pyroelectric response of the fine-grained ceramics prepared by the spark plasma sintering of the ferroelectric BaTiO3 nanoparticles. The temperature dependences of the electro-resistivity indicate the frequency-dependent transition in the electro-transport mechanisms between the lower and higher conductivity states accompanied by the maximum in the temperature dependence of the loss angle tangent. The pyroelectric thermal-wave probing revealed the existence of the spatially inhomogeneous counter-polarized ferroelectric state at the opposite surfaces of the ceramic sample. We described the anomalous temperature behavior of the giant dielectric response and losses using the core-shell model for ceramic grains and modified Maxwell-Wagner approach. We assume that core shells and grain boundaries, which contain high concentration of space charge carriers due to the presence of graphite inclusions in the inter-grain space, can effectively screen weakly conductive ferroelectric grain cores. The superparaelectric-like state with a giant dielectric response can appear in the paraelectric shells and inter-grain space due to the step-like thermal activation of localized polarons in the spatial regions, agreeing with experimentally observed frequency-dependent transition of the electro-transport mechanism. The obtained results can be the key for the description of complex electrophysical properties inherent to the strongly inhomogeneous media with electrically coupled insulating ferroelectric nanoregions and semiconducting superparaelectric-like regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: To develop and evaluate a bore-integrated patch antenna array designed for whole-body excitation in ultra-high-field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with improved transmit efficiency and address the limitations of existing RF coil designs. Methods: The proposed patch antenna array utilizes the MRI bore's RF shield as a functional component to enhance the RF magnetic field ($B_1^+$) distribution. Numerical simulations were conducted to compare the performance of the patch antenna array to bore-integrated stripline and local dipole arrays. A decoupling structure was implemented to minimize coupling between adjacent patch antennas. The performance of the patch array was evaluated experimentally. Results: The proposed patch array provides 3.9 times higher averaged transmit (Tx) efficiency in the CP mode and 3.0 times higher for the phase shimming regime versus the bore-integrated stripline array. Conclusion: Compared to the stripline array, the bore-integrated patch antenna array offers significant improvements in Tx efficiency for whole-body UHF MRI. Significance: The findings support the feasibility of integrating arrays into the RF shield of MRI scanners. This could broaden the clinical use of UHF body MRI technology.</description>

Abstract: Nickel nanoparticles (Ni NPs), thanks to their peculiar properties, are interesting materials for many applications including catalysis, hydrogen storage, and sensors. In this work, Ni NPs are synthesized in aqueous solution by a simple and rapid procedure with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as a capping agent, and are extensively characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We investigated their shape, dimension, and their distribution on the surfaces of SiO2 and epitaxial graphene (EG) samples. Ni NPs have an average diameter of ~11 nm, with a narrow size dispersion, and their arrangement on the surface is strongly dependent on the substrate. EG samples functionalized with Ni NPs are further characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as made and after thermal annealing above 350{\deg}C to confirm the degradation of CTAB and the presence of metallic Ni(0). Moreover, high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) topographies reveal the structural stability of the NPs up to 550 {\deg}C.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{PT}$-Symmetry induced Bi-Stability in Non-Hermitian Cavity Magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the steady-state non-Hermitian magnomechanical system driven by a transverse magnetic field directly interacting with YIG sphere and excites cavity magnons and photons. To make the system non-Hermitian, we use a traveling field directly interacting with magnons generating gain to the system. We start by illustrating PT-configuration of the system, which contains two PT broken region around exceptional point and PT protected region along the axis of exceptional point. Late, we discover that the numbers of cavity photons and magnons show bistable behavior depending upon the PT configuration, which becomes more significant as the values of the magnon-photon coupling and traveling field strength increases. We illustrate that steady-state photon only shows bistable behavior when the system in in lossy PT broken configuration, means strength of traveling field is less than the magnon-photon coupling. Otherwise, it will just contain a single stable state because of bistability suppression with gain in the system, which is unlike with any other investigation in this direction. Further, a larger magnon-photon coupling increases photon intensity and decreases magnon intensity, because of photon and magnon energy exchange, leading to enhanced photon bistablity and decreased magnon bistability. However, in case of increasing strength of traveling field, both photon as well as magnon bistability is appeared to be decreasing. We also study the steady-state effective potential of the system and illustrate the occurrence of bistability with nonlinear interactions between contour trajectories, which similarly depends on the PT broken configuration of the system.</description>

      <title>23.8-GHz Acoustic Filter in Periodically Poled Piezoelectric Film Lithium Niobate With 1.52-dB IL and 19.4% FBW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reports the first piezoelectric acoustic filter in periodically poled piezoelectric film (P3F) lithium niobate (LiNbO3) at 23.8 GHz with low insertion loss (IL) of 1.52 dB and 3-dB fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 19.4%. The filter features a compact footprint of 0.64 mm2. The third-order ladder filter is implemented with electrically coupled resonators in 150 nm bi-layer P3F 128 rotated Y-cut LiNbO3 thin film, operating in second-order symmetric (S2) Lamb mode. The record-breaking performance is enabled by the P3F LiNbO3 platform, where piezoelectric thin films of alternating orientations are transferred subsequently, facilitating efficient higher-order Lamb mode operation with simultaneously high quality factor (Q) and coupling coefficient (k2) at millimeter-wave (mmWave). Also, the multi-layer P3F stack promises smaller footprints and better nonlinearity than single-layer counterparts, thanks to the higher capacitance density and lower thermal resistance. Upon further development, the reported P3F LiNbO3 platform is promising for compact filters at mmWave.</description>

      <title>A system built for both deterministic transfer processes and contact photolithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A home-built compact system that functions as both a transfer stage for deterministic transfer processes and a mask aligner for contact photolithography, is constructed. The precision translation sample stage and optical microscope are shared between the two modes. In the transfer mode, assisted by either an adhesive or a heating element, the setup has been used to deterministically transfer freestanding semiconductors, 2D materials, and van der Waals electrodes. When configured in photolithography mode, the proposed instrument has been employed to fabricate various micro-scale patterns and devices, with minimum feature sizes of ~1-2 um achieved. Our prototype instrument provides a feasible solution for preforming high quality deterministic transfer and photolithography processes on one single tool in house.</description>

      <title>Controlled Spalling of Single Crystal 4H-SiC Bulk Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We detail several scientific and engineering innovations which enable the controlled spalling of 10 - 50 micron thick films of single crystal 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC) from bulk substrates. 4H-SiC's properties, including high thermal conductivity and a wide bandgap, make it an ideal candidate for high-temperature, high-voltage power electronic devices. Moreover, 4H-SiC has been shown to be an excellent host of solid-state atomic defect qubits for quantum computing and quantum networking. Because 4H-SiC single crystal substrates are expensive (due to long growth times and limited yield), techniques for removal and transfer of bulk-quality films in the tens-of-microns thickness range are highly desirable to allow for substrate reuse and integration of the separated films. In this work we utilize novel approaches for stressor layer thickness control and spalling crack initiation to demonstrate controlled spalling of 4H-SiC, the highest fracture toughness material spalled to date. Additionally, we demonstrate substrate re-use, bonding of the spalled films to carrier substrates, and explore the spin coherence of the spalled films. In preliminary studies we are able to achieve coherent spin control of neutral divacancy ($VV^{0}$) qubit ensembles and measure a quasi-bulk spin $T_{2}$ of 79.7 $\mu$s in such spalled films.</description>

      <title>CMOS-compatible Strain Engineering for High-Performance Monolayer Semiconductor Transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strain engineering has played a key role in modern silicon electronics, having been introduced as a mobility booster in the 1990s and commercialized in the early 2000s. Achieving similar advances with two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors in a CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) compatible manner would radically improve the industrial viability of 2D transistors. Here, we show silicon nitride capping layers can impart strain to monolayer MoS2 transistors on conventional silicon substrates, enhancing their electrical performance with a low thermal budget (350 {\deg}C), CMOS-compatible approach. Strained back-gated and dual-gated MoS2 transistors demonstrate median increases up to 60% and 45% in on-state current, respectively. The greatest improvements are found when both transistor channels and contacts are reduced to ~200 nm, reaching saturation currents of 488 uA/um, higher than any previous reports at such short contact pitch. Simulations reveal that most benefits arise from tensile strain lowering the contact Schottky barriers, and that further reducing device dimensions (including contacts) will continue to offer increased strain and performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Demixing fluorescence time traces transmitted by multimode fibers</title>

Abstract: Optical methods based on thin multimode fibers (MMFs) are promising tools for measuring neuronal activity in deep brain regions of freely moving mice thanks to their small diameter. However, current methods are limited: while fiber photometry provides only ensemble activity, imaging techniques using of long multimode fibers are very sensitive to bending and have not been applied to unrestrained rodents yet. Here, we demonstrate the fundamentals of a new approach using a short MMF coupled to a miniscope. In proof-of-principle in vitro experiments, we disentangled spatio-temporal fluorescence signals from multiple fluorescent sources transmitted by a thin (200 \mu m) and short (8 mm) MMF, using a general unconstrained non-negative matrix factorization algorithm directly on the raw video data. Furthermore, we show that low-cost open-source miniscopes have sufficient sensitivity to image the same fluorescence patterns seen in our proof-of-principle experiment, suggesting a new avenue for novel minimally invasive deep brain studies using multimode fibers in freely behaving mice.</description>

      <title>Emergence of order from chaos through a continuous phase transition in a turbulent reactive flow system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the Reynolds number is increased, a laminar fluid flow becomes turbulent, and the range of time and length scales associated with the flow increases. Yet, in a turbulent reactive flow system, as we increase the Reynolds number, we observe the emergence of a single dominant time scale in the acoustic pressure fluctuations, as indicated by its loss of multifractality. Such emergence of order from chaos is intriguing and has hardly been studied. We perform experiments in a turbulent reactive flow system consisting of flame, acoustic, and hydrodynamic subsystems interacting nonlinearly. We study the evolution of short-time correlated dynamics between the acoustic field and the flame in the spatiotemporal domain of the system. The order parameter, defined as the fraction of the correlated dynamics, increases gradually from zero to one. We find that the susceptibility of the order parameter, correlation length, and correlation time diverge at a critical point between chaos and order. Our results show that the observed emergence of order from chaos is a continuous phase transition. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence that the critical exponents characterizing this transition fall in the universality class of directed percolation. Our study demonstrates how a real-world complex, non-equilibrium turbulent reactive flow system exhibits universal behavior near a critical point.</description>

      <title>MieAI: A neural network for calculating optical properties of internally mixed aerosol in atmospheric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aerosols influence weather and climate by interacting with radiation through absorption and scattering. These effects heavily rely on the optical properties of aerosols, which are mainly governed by attributes such as morphology, size distribution, and chemical composition. These attributes undergo continuous changes due to chemical reactions and aerosol micro-physics, resulting in significant spatio-temporal variations. Most atmospheric models struggle to incorporate this variability because they use pre-calculated tables to handle aerosol optics. This offline approach often leads to substantial errors in estimating the radiative impacts of aerosols alongwith posing significant computational burdens. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel and computationally efficient machine learning ap proach called MieAI. It allows for online calculation of the optical properties of internally mixed aerosols with a log-normal size distribution. Importantly, MieAI fully incorporates the variability in aerosol chemistry and microphysics. Our evaluation of MieAI against traditional Mie calculations, using number concentrations from ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic model with Aerosol and Reactive Trace gases (ICON-ART) simulations, demonstrates that MieAI exhibits excellent predictive accuracy for aerosol optical properties. MieAI achieves this with errors well within 10%, and it operates more than 1000 times faster than the benchmark approach of Mie calculations. Due to its generalized nature, the MieAI approach can be implemented in any chemistry transport model which represents aerosol size distribution in the form of log-normally distributed internally mixed modes. This advancement has the potential to replace frequently employed lookup tables and play a substantial role in the ongoing attempts to reduce uncertainties in estimating aerosol radiative forcing.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Limits of Charge Carrier Mobilities in Layered Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Layered halide perovskites have emerged as potential alternatives to three-dimensional halide perovskites due to their improved stability and larger material phase space, allowing fine-tuning of structural, electronic, and optical properties. However, their charge carrier mobilities are significantly smaller than that of three-dimensional halide perovskites, which has a considerable impact on their application in optoelectronic devices. Here, we employ state-of-the-art ab initio approaches to unveil the electron-phonon mechanisms responsible for the diminished transport properties of layered halide perovskites. Starting from a prototypical ABX$_{3}$ halide perovskite, we model the case of $n=1$ and $n=2$ layered structures and compare their electronic and transport properties to the three-dimensional reference. The electronic and phononic properties are investigated within density functional theory (DFT) and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), while transport properties are obtained via the ab initio Boltzmann transport equation. The vibrational modes contributing to charge carrier scattering are investigated and associated with polar-phonon scattering mechanisms arising from the long-range Fr\"ohlich coupling and deformation potential scattering processes. Our investigation reveals that the lower mobilities in layered systems primarily originates from the increased electronic density of states at the vicinity of the band edges, while the electron-phonon coupling strength remains similar. Such increase is caused by the dimensionality reduction and the break in octahedra connectivity along the stacking direction. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the electron-phonon coupling mechanisms in layered perovskites and highlight the intrinsic limitations of the charge carrier transport in these materials.</description>

Abstract: Artificial spin ice (ASI) represents a class of uniquely structured superlattices comprising geometrically arranged interacting nanomagnets. This arrangement facilitates the exploration of magnetic frustration phenomena and related spin wave dynamics, contributing to the field of magnonics. In this work, we present a compressive study of spin wave dynamics in square ASI lattices using micromagnetic simulations, explicitly focusing on ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and oscillation modes. We investigate how variations in the aspect ratio of nanomagnets dimensions influence magnetic excitations in both saturated and remanent states. We analyze the frequency variations of FMR peaks corresponding to edges and bulk oscillation modes in relation to both magnetic configuration and nanomagnets dimensions. We emphasize the remanent state of square ASI vertex configurations, particularly focusing on their characteristic energy states (Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV), while detailing how symmetries influence oscillation modes. We observe distinct FMR responses originating from vertices, exhibiting unique characteristics for each energy state. Our results offer a potential method of utilizing the FMR technique to identify energy states in ASI systems.</description>
