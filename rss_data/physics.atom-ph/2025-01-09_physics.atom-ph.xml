      <title>Quantum Twin Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04244v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-correlated interferometer is a newly emerging tool in quantum technology that offers classical-limit-breaking phase sensitivity. But to date, there exists a configurational bottleneck for its practicability due to the low phase-sensitive photon numbers limited by the current detection strategies. Here we establish an innovative development termed as ``quantum twin interferometer'' with dual pairs of entangled twin beams arranged in the parallel configuration, allowing fully exploits the quantum resource through the new configuration of entangled detection. We observe the distributed phase sensing with 3 dB quantum noise reduction in phase-sensing power at the level of milliwatts, which advances the record of signal-to-noise ratio so far achieved in photon-correlated interferometers by three orders of magnitude. The developed techniques in this work can be used to revolutionize a diversity of quantum devices requiring phase measurement.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach for Strong Field QED Tests with He-like Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04423v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detailed comparisons between theory and experiment for quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects in He-like ions have been performed in the literature to search for hints of new physics. Different frequentist statistical analyses of the existing atomic transition energy data have shown contradictory conclusions as to the presence of possible deviations from the theory predictions. We present here an approach using Bayesian statistics which allows to assign quantitative probabilities to the different deviation models from theory for He-like ions for $Z = 5$ to 92. Potential deviations beyond the standard model or higher order QED effects are modeled with $f(Z) \propto Z^k$ functions. Considering the currently available data, no significant difference between theory and experiment is found, and we show that recent experiments have reduced the possible deviations previously observed in the literature. Using past measurements and a weighted average on the different deviation models, we indicate the accuracy required for future measurements to investigated possible divergences.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian dynamics of BIC generation via single-photon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excitation of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in two- or multi-qubit systems lies at the heart of entanglement generation and harnessing in waveguide quantum electrodynamics platforms. However, the generation of qubit pair BICs through single-photon scattering is hindered by the fact that these states are effectively decoupled from propagating photons. We prove that scattering of a parity-invariant single photon on a qubit pair, combined with a properly engineered time variation of the qubit detuning, is not only feasible, but also more effective than strategies based on the relaxation of the excited states of the qubits. The use of tensor network methods to simulate the proposed scheme enables to include photon delays in collision models, thus opening the possibility to follow the time evolution of the full quantum system, including qubits and field, and to efficiently implement and characterize the dynamics in non-ideal cases, which turn out to be optimal for the BIC generation strategy.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the sensitivity of an atom interferometer with a phase-modulation readout scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity of an interferometer depends on its readout scheme. However, little attention has been paid to the readout schemes of atom interferometers from the viewpoint of their sensitivity. The difference in sensitivity between readout schemes or their optimization has not been considered in the literature. Herein we analytically calculate the sensitivities of an atom interferometer with typical readout schemes by applying the two-photon formalism, which was developed for optical interferometers to deal with quantum noise. Our calculations reveal that by using sinusoidal phase modulation, the sensitivity can surpass that obtained by the conventional phase sweeping scheme. The superiority of this phase modulation scheme for both cold and thermal atomic beams is demonstrated. In addition, we show that the phase modulation scheme is advantageous for atom-flux fluctuation and resists atom-flux drift. This study performs a general analysis of the sensitivity of atom interferometers and identifies an advantageous readout scheme.</description>

      <title>An Updated Line List for Spectroscopic Investigation of G Stars II: Refined Solar Abundances via Extended Wavelength Coverage to 10 000 \AA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a line list for the abundance analysis of F and G type stars across the 4080-9675 A wavelength range. A systematic search employing lower excitation potentials, accurate log gf values, and an updated multiplet table led to the identification of 592 lines across 33 species (25 elements), including C, O, Mg (ionized), Al, P, S, Cu, Zr (neutral), and La. To determine the uncertainties in log gf values, we assessed solar abundance using a very high-resolution (R=1000000) disk-integrated solar spectrum. These lines were confirmed to be blend-free in the solar spectrum. The line list was further validated by analyzing the metal-poor star HD 218209 (G6V), which is notable for its well-documented and reliable abundance in literature. The abundances were obtained using the equivalent width (EW) method and further refined by applying the spectrum synthesis method. A comparative analysis with the Gaia ESO line list v.6, provided by the Gaia ESO collaboration, revealed additional neutral and ionized Fe lines. This extensively refined line list will facilitate precise stellar parameter determinations and accurate abundance analyses of spectra within the PolarBASE spectral library.</description>
