      <title>Explicit formulae for stochastic equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the stochastic equilibria for finite-state stochastic matrices amounts to solving an eigen\-vector problem $\pi = \pi P$. Various techniques for doing so are known, some extremely computationally intensive. Herein we shall aim to extract a number of relatively simple analytic results that shed light on this problem. It is very easy to find an explicit general formula for the equilibrium vector (when it is unique) of a $2\times 2$ stochastic matrix. The corresponding explicit general formula for the equilibrium vector (when it is unique) of a $3\times 3$ stochastic matrix is a somewhat messier four-line result. (Though with a bit of work you can shoe-horn it into one line of text.) An explicit general formula for the equilibrium vector (when it is unique) of a $4\times 4$ stochastic matrix requires a paragraph of text. Ultimately, for $n\times n$ stochastic matrices a general and fully explicit construction of the equilibrium vector (when it is unique) can be developed in terms of a suitable adjugate (classical adjoint) matrix, and can subsequently be reduced to the computation of $n$ principal matrix minors. Finally, an application to random walks on graphs is presented.</description>

      <title>Exact calculations beyond charge neutrality in timelike Liouville field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timelike Liouville field theory (also known as imaginary Liouville theory or imaginary Gaussian multiplicative chaos) is expected to describe two-dimensional quantum gravity in a positive-curvature regime, but its path integral is not a probability measure and rigorous exact computations are currently available only in the charge-neutral (integer screening) case. In this paper we show that at the special coupling $b=1/\sqrt{2}$, the Coulomb-gas expansion of the timelike path integral becomes explicitly computable beyond charge neutrality. The reason is that the $n$-fold integrals generated by the interaction acquire a Vandermonde/determinantal structure at $b=1/\sqrt{2}$, which allows exact evaluation in terms of classical special functions. We derive Mellin-Barnes type representations (involving the Barnes $G$-function and, in a three-point case, Gauss hypergeometric functions) for the zero- and one-point functions, for an antipodal two-point function, and for a three-point function with a resonant insertion $\alpha_2=b$. We then address the subtle zero-mode integration: after a Gaussian regularization we obtain an explicit renormalized partition function $C(1/\sqrt{2},\mu)=e(4\pi\sqrt2 \mu)^{-1}$, identify distributional limits in the physically relevant regime $\alpha_j=\frac{1}{2}Q+\mathrm{i} P_j$, and compare with the Hankel-contour prescription recently proposed in the physics literature. These results provide the first rigorously controlled family of exact calculations in timelike Liouville theory outside charge neutrality.</description>

      <title>Fold of a bifurcation solution from the figure-eight choreography in the three body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the figure-eight choreography in the classical three-body problem, both side bifurcation solutions sometimes fold at one side of the bifurcation point with cusp of action. Three numerical examples of such fold for figure-eight choreography under the Lennard-Jones-type potential and one under the homogeneous potential are introduced. Up to the forth order of representation variable of the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduced action in two dimension with three-fold symmetry, the fold is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Transversal Cusp-Airy versus Cusp-Airy for Lozenge Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluctuations of lozenge tilings of hexagons with one or several cuts (nonconvexities) along opposite sides are governed by the (discrete-continuous) tacnode kernel ${\mathbb L}^{\mbox{\tiny dTac}}$, upon letting
  the hexagon become very large (or in other terms, keeping the hexagon fixed, with the tiles becoming very small). This is a point process with a finite number $r$ of (continuous) points along a discrete set of parallel lines within a specific region (see \cite{AJvM1,AJvM2}). Letting $r\to\infty$, one finds a liquid phase inscribed in the polygon, whose boundary (arctic curve) has a cusp near each cut, with two solid phases descending into the cusp (split-cusp). Duse-Johansson-Metcalfe \cite{DJM} show that in this situation the tile-fluctuations should obey the cusp-Airy statistics. It would have seem natural to expect to see the same cusp-Airy kernel in the neighborhood of the cut, for the limit ($r\to \infty$) of the tacnode kernel ${\mathbb L}^{\mbox{\tiny dTac}}$. As it turns out, another statistics appears: the {\em transversal cusp-Airy} statistics, which was a puzzling fact to all of us. This statistics is derived and fully explained in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hartree-Fock and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theories for a large fermionic system with the pseudo-relativistic kinetic energy and an attractive Yukawa interaction potential. We prove that the system is stable if and only if the total mass does not excess a critical value, and investigate the existence and properties of ground states in both sub-critical and critical mass regimes.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Fabry-P\'erot Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise non-Hermitian Fabry-P\'erot resonances in high-contrast resonator systems and study the properties of their associated resonant modes from continuous differential models. We consider two non-Hermitian effects: the exceptional point degeneracy and the skin effect induced by imaginary gauge potentials. Using the propagation matrix formalism, we characterise these two non-Hermitian effects beyond the subwavelength regime. This analysis allows us to (i) establish the existence of exceptional points purely from radiation conditions and to (ii) prove that the non-Hermitian skin effect applies uniformly across resonant modes, yielding broadband edge localisation.</description>

      <title>Tame Complexity of Effective Field Theories in the Quantum Gravity Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective field theories consistent with quantum gravity obey surprising finiteness constraints, appearing in several distinct but interconnected forms. In this work we develop a framework that unifies these observations by proposing that the defining data of such theories, as well as the landscape of effective field theories that are valid at least up to a fixed cutoff, admit descriptions with a uniform bound on complexity. To make this precise, we use tame geometry and work in sharply o-minimal structures, in which tame sets and functions come with two integer parameters that quantify their information content; we call this pair their tame complexity. Our Finite Complexity Conjectures are supported by controlled examples in which an infinite Wilsonian expansion nevertheless admits an equivalent finite-complexity description, typically through hidden rigidity conditions such as differential or recursion relations. We further assemble evidence from string compactifications, highlighting the constraining role of moduli space geometry and the importance of dualities. This perspective also yields mathematically well-defined notions of counting and volume measures on the space of effective theories, formulated in terms of effective field theory domains and coverings, whose finiteness is naturally enforced by the conjectures.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Quantum Entanglement Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is an expository account aimed at viewing entanglement in finite-dimensional quantum many-body systems as a phenomenon of global geometry. While the mathematics of general quantum states has been studied extensively, this article focuses specifically on their entanglement. When a quantum system varies over a classical parameter space, each fiber may look like the same Hilbert space, yet there may be no global identification because of twisting in the gluing data. Describing this situation by an Azumaya algebra, one always obtains the family of pure-state spaces as a Severi-Brauer scheme.
  The main focus is to characterize the condition under which the subsystem decomposition required to define entanglement exists globally and compatibly, by a reduction to the stabilizer subgroup of the Segre variety, and to explain that the obstruction appears in the Brauer class. As a consequence, quantum states yield a natural filtration dictated by entanglement on the Severi-Brauer scheme.
  Using a spin system on a torus as an example, we show concretely that the holonomy of the gluing can produce an entangling quantum gate, and can appear as an obstruction class distinct from the usual Berry numbers or Chern numbers. For instance, even for quantum systems that have traditionally been regarded as having no topological band structure, the entanglement of their eigenstates can be related to global geometric universal quantities, reflecting the background geometry.</description>

      <title>The diffusion equation is compatible with special relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to its parabolic character, the diffusion equation exhibits instantaneous spatial spreading, and becomes unstable when Lorentz-boosted. According to the conventional interpretation, these features reflect a fundamental incompatibility with special relativity. In this Letter, we show that this interpretation is incorrect by demonstrating that any smooth and sufficiently localized solution of the diffusion equation is the particle density of an exact solution of the relativistic Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. This establishes the existence of a causal, stable, and thermodynamically consistent relativistic kinetic theory whose hydrodynamic sector is governed exactly by diffusion at all wavelengths. We further demonstrate that the standard arguments for instability arise from considering solutions that admit no counterpart in kinetic theory, and that apparent violations of causality disappear once signals are defined in terms of the underlying microscopic data.</description>

      <title>Quantum Zeno-like Paradox for Position Measurements: A Particle Precisely Found in Space is Nowhere to be Found in Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a quantum particle in the unit interval $[0,1]$, perform a position measurement with inaccuracy $1/n$ and then a quantum measurement of the projection $|\phi\rangle\langle\phi|$ with some arbitrary but fixed normalized $\phi$. Call the outcomes $X \in[0,1]$ and $Y \in\{0,1\}$. We show that in the limit $n\to\infty$ corresponding to perfect precision for $X$, the probability of $Y=1$ tends to 0 for every $\phi$. Since there is no density matrix, pure or mixed, which upon measurement of any $|\phi\rangle\langle\phi|$ yields outcome 1 with probability 0, our result suggests that a novel type of quantum state beyond Hilbert space is necessary to describe a quantum particle after a perfect position measurement.</description>

      <title>The quasi-normal modes of relativistic Fokker-Planck kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing the well-known unitary equivalence between Fokker-Planck operators and Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians, we compute the quasi-normal-mode spectrum of ultrarelativistic kinetic theories with momentum-space diffusion. We show that the collision operator reduces to a Dirac-delta Schr\"odinger problem in one spatial dimension, and to a Coulomb Schr\"odinger operator with hydrogenic spectrum in three dimensions. Finite spatial wavenumber appears as a perturbation of the associated quantum potential. The hydrodynamic mode is found to obey exact Fick-type diffusion at all real wavenumbers, whereas relativistic kinematics generically produces a continuous ballistic band in the non-hydrodynamic sector, a feature absent in the Newtonian regime.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the objects of limiting compactness: Black hole and Buchdahl star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In General Relativity, there exist two objects of limiting compactness, one with a null boundary defining the horizon of a black hole and the other with a timelike boundary defining a Buchdahl star. The two are characterized by gravitational energy equal to or half the mass. Since non-gravitational mass-energy is the source of gravitational energy, both of these objects are manifestly stable. We demonstrate in this letter, in a simple and general way, that the equilibrium state defining the object is indeed stable, independent of the nature of the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Mode stability of self-similar wave maps without symmetry in higher dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider wave maps from $(1+d)$-dimensional Minkowski space into the $d$-sphere. For every $d \geq 3$, there exists an explicit self-similar solution that exhibits finite time blowup. This solution is corotational and its mode stability in the class of corotational functions is known. Recently, Weissenbacher, Koch, and the first author proved mode stability without symmetry assumptions in $d =3$. In this paper we extend this result to all $d \geq 4$. On a technical level, this is the first successful implementation of the quasi-solution method where two additional parameters are present.</description>

      <title>Derivatives of Gaussian multiplicative chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a logarithmically-correlated Gaussian field $X$ in $d$ dimensions. For all $\gamma \in (-\sqrt{2d},\sqrt{2d})$, we show that the derivatives $\frac{\partial^k}{\partial\gamma^k} :e^{\gamma X_\epsilon}:$ of the regularised Gaussian multiplicative chaos $:e^{\gamma X_\epsilon}:$ converge as $\epsilon \to 0$. By deriving optimal bounds on their growth as $k\to\infty$, we control the power expansion of $:e^{\gamma X_\epsilon}:$ about each $\gamma\in(-\sqrt{2d},\sqrt{2d})$. This yields an alternative approach to complex Gaussian multiplicative chaos in the whole subcritical regime, based entirely on real-valued quantities.
  One of our key technical contributions is to provide a truncated second moment approach to the uniform integrability of the derivatives of multiplicative chaos and its associated complex variant.</description>

We show that in the large $N$ limit, correlations decay exponentially fast, where the acquired mass decays exponentially in the inverse temperature. In fact, each marginal converges to a massive Gaussian Free Field (GFF) on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, quantified in the $2$-Wasserstein distance with a weighted $H^{1}(\mathbb{R}^{2})$ cost function. In contrast to prior work on the torus via parabolic stochastic quantization, our results hold without restrictions on the coupling constants, allowing us to also obtain a massive GFF in a suitable double scaling limit. Our proof combines the Feyel/\"Ust\"unel extension of Talagrand's inequality with some classical tools in Euclidean Quantum Field Theory.</description>

      <title>Iwahori-Coulomb branches, stable envelopes, and quantum cohomology of cotangent bundles of flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Iwahori-Coulomb branches $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N},\mathbf{V}}^{\mathrm{Fl}}$, which are the affine flag analogs of the original Coulomb branches $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^{\mathrm{Gr}}$ defined by Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima. For any conical symplectic resolution $X$, we prove that the $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N},\mathbf{V}}^{\mathrm{Fl}}$-action on the localized equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$, induced by shift operators, satisfies a polynomiality property in terms of stable envelopes.
  We then study the case $X = T^*(G/P)$, the cotangent bundle of a flag variety, for which the Iwahori-Coulomb branch is isomorphic to the trigonometric double affine Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}_{G,\hbar,k}$. The polynomiality property enables us to compute explicitly the above action in terms of the Demazure-Lusztig elements and stable envelopes. Applications include:
  (1) Computation of the Iwarhori-Coulomb branch action for $G/P$ by taking the confluent limit, recovering Peterson-Lam-Shimozono's theorem.
  (2) Construction of an explicit Namikawa-Weyl group action on the equivariant quantum cohomology of $T^*(G/P)$ that preserves the quantum product, extending a result of Li-Su-Xiong.
  (3) Proof of a conjecture of Braverman-Finkelberg-Nakajima stating that, up to a shift of the dilation parameter, $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathfrak{g}^*}^{\mathrm{Gr}}$ is isomorphic to the spherical subalgebra of $\mathcal{H}_{G,\hbar,k}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A single geometric invariant fixes the relative normalization and structure of gravity, Yang-Mills theory, and fermion kinetic terms -- including ghost freedom in the gravitational sector -- without tuning. Our results establish a minimal geometric route to unification that does not rely on extra dimensions or symmetry breaking by hand. Unlike previous gauge-gravity constructions, the relative normalizations and ghost freedom emerge from a single Clifford-algebraic invariant, without explicit symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>A priori estimates of stable and finite Morse index solutions to elliptic equations that arise in Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis studies qualitative properties of solutions to nonlinear elliptic equations of Poisson type with Dirichlet boundary conditions that arise from some physical phenomena, with a particular focus on regularity, stability, and multiplicity of solutions. Building on the modern framework of solution stability and Morse index theory, the work investigates how these notions influence regularity in nonlinear elliptic problems. A central contribution is the construction of a counterexample showing that bounded radial Morse index does not prevent singular behavior of solutions in dimensions three through nine, challenging a natural extension of the Brezis-V\'azquez regularity conjecture. In addition, optimal regularity results are established for radial solutions of a non-autonomous Hardy-H\'enon equation, identifying the precise range of dimensions for which regularity holds. The thesis also addresses existence and multiplicity results for elliptic equations involving nonlinearities with spatially vanishing coefficients. Under suitable assumptions, the existence of multiple distinct solutions is proved using variational and topological methods. Finally, the thesis outlines several directions for future research, including extensions of stability-based regularity techniques to non-autonomous problems and potential applications of these techniques to field theories arising in theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Symmetric polynomials: DIM integrable systems versus twisted Cherednik systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss interrelations between eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonians associated with the commutative (integer ray) subalgebras of the Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra and those of the twisted Cherednik system. In the case of $t=q^{-m}$ with natural $m$, eigenfunctions of the first system of Hamiltonians are the twisted Baker-Akhiezer functions (BAFs) introduced by O. Chalykh, while eigenfunctions of the twisted Cherednik Hamiltonians are twisted non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. Actually, the twisted Cherednik ground state is symmetric and coincides with a peculiar symmetric BAF. We lift this correspondence to excited states, and claim that both Cherednik eigenfunctions and BAF's can be combined to produce symmetric functions, which coincide with each other and are eigenfunctions of the both DIM Hamiltonians and power sums of the twisted Cherednik Hamiltonians at once. This reflects the correspondence between the DIM algebra and the spherical DAHA explicitly.</description>

      <title>Dynamical symmetries of the anisotropic oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the Hamiltonian of an $n$-dimensional isotropic oscillator admits an $SU(n)$ symmetry, making the system maximally superintegrable. However, the dynamical symmetries of the anisotropic oscillator are much more subtle. We introduce a novel set of canonical transformations that map an $n$-dimensional anisotropic oscillator to the corresponding isotropic problem. Consequently, the anisotropic oscillator is found to possess the same number of conserved quantities as the isotropic oscillator, making it maximally superintegrable too (commensurate case). The first integrals are explicitly calculated in the case of a two-dimensional anisotropic oscillator and remarkably, they admit closed-form expressions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the nearsightedness property in the linear tight binding model at zero Fermi-temperature. We focus on the decay property of the density matrix for materials with indirect band gaps. By representing the density matrix in reciprocal space, we establish a qualitatively sharp estimate for the exponential decay rate in homogeneous systems, possibly with localized perturbations. This work refines the estimates presented in (Ortner, Thomas &amp; Chen, 2020) for systems with small band gaps.</description>

      <title>Achronal localization and representation of the causal logic from a conserved current, application to the massive scalar boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12699v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Only recently the concept of achronal localization has been developed as the adequate frame for the description of the localizability of a relativistic quantum mechanical system. Here covariant achronal localizations are gained out of covariant conserved currents computing their flux passing through achronal surfaces. This general method is applied to the probability density currents with causal kernel regarding the massive scalar boson. As (covariant) achronal localizations correspond one-to-one to (covariant) representations of the causal logic, thus, apparently for the first time, a covariant representation of the causal logic for an elementary relativistic quantum mechanical system has been achieved. Similarly a covariant family of representations of the causal logic is derived from the stress-energy tensor of the massive scalar boson. The construction of an achronal localization from a conserved current relies on a version of the divergence theorem for open sets with almost Lipschitz boundary. This result is stated and proved in this work.</description>

      <title>A von Neumann algebraic approach to Quantum Theory on curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14107v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By extending the method developed in our recent paper \cite{LM} we present the AQFT framework in terms of von Neumann algebras. In particular, this approach allows for a locally covariant categorical description of AQFT which moreover satisfies the additivity property and provides a natural and intrinsic framework for a description of entanglement. Turning to dynamical aspects of QFT we show that Killing local flows may be lifted to the algebraic setting in curved space-time. Furthermore, conditions under which quantum Lie derivatives of such local flows exist are provided. The central question that then emerges is how such quantum local flows might be described in interesting representations. We show that quasi-free representations of Weyl algebras fit the presented framework perfectly. Finally, the problem of enlarging the set of observables is discussed. We point out the usefulness of Orlicz space techniques to encompass unbounded field operators. In particular, a well-defined framework within which one can manipulate such operators is necessary for the correct presentation of (semiclassical) Einstein's equation.</description>

Abstract: We extend the matrix representation of magnetic pseudo-differential operators in a tight Gabor frame from [arXiv:1804.05220, arXiv:2212.12229] to asymmetrical quantizations and smooth symbols dominated by a tempered weight (and not just decay/growth properties in the momentum variables). This leads to new results regarding the symbol calculus of such operators and their Schatten-class properties.</description>

      <title>A Non-Reciprocal Elliptic Spectral Solution of the Right-Angle Penetrable Wedge Transmission Problem for $\nu=\sqrt{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional time-harmonic transmission problem for an impedance-matched (\rho = 1) right-angle penetrable wedge at refractive index ratio \nu = \sqrt{2}, in the integrable lemniscatic configuration (\theta_w ,\nu,\rho) = (\pi/4,\sqrt{2},1). Starting from Sommerfeld spectral representations, the transmission conditions on the two wedge faces yield a closed spectral functional system for the Sommerfeld transforms Q(\zeta) and S(\zeta). In this special configuration the associated Snell surface is the lemniscatic curve Y^2 = 2(t^4 + 1), uniformized by square-lattice Weierstrass functions with invariants (g_2,g_3) = (4,0). We construct an explicit meromorphic expression for a scattered transform Q_{scat} as a finite Weierstrass--\zeta sum plus an explicitly constructed pole-free elliptic remainder, with all pole coefficients computed algebraically from the forcing pole set. A birational (injective) uniformization is used to avoid label collisions on the torus and to make the scattered-allocation pole exclusion well posed. The resulting closed form solves the derived spectral functional system and satisfies the local regularity constraints imposed at the physical basepoint. However, numerical reciprocity tests on the far-field coefficient extracted from Q_{scat} indicate that the construction is generally non-reciprocal; accordingly we do not claim that the resulting diffraction coefficient coincides with the reciprocal physical transmission scattering solution. The result remains restricted to this integrable lemniscatic case; the general penetrable wedge remains challenging (see [10--12] and, in a related high-frequency penetrable-corner setting, [13]).</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy in CFT and Modular Nuclearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.09074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of Algebraic Quantum Field Theory, several operator algebraic notions of entanglement entropy can be associated with any pair of causally disjoint spacetime regions $\mathcal{S}_A$ and $\mathcal{S}_B$ with positive relative distance. Among them, the canonical entanglement entropy is defined as the von Neumann entropy of a canonical intermediate type I factor. In this work, we show that the canonical entanglement entropy of the vacuum state is finite for a broad class of conformal nets including the $U(1)$-current model and the $SU(n)$-loop group models. Since previous studies suggest that this finiteness property is related to nuclearity properties of the system, we show that the mutual information is finite in any local QFT satisfying a modular $p$-nuclearity condition for some $0 &lt; p &lt; 1$. A similar finiteness result is established for another notion of entanglement entropy introduced in this paper. We conclude with remarks for future work in this direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the spaces $A^p_{\alpha, \beta}(\Omega)$ of $L^p$-solutions to the Vekua equation (generalized monogenic functions) $D w=\alpha\overline{w}+\beta w$ in a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $D=\sum_{i=1}^n e_i \partial_i$ is the Moisil-Teodorescu operator, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are bounded functions on $\Omega$.
  The main result of this work consists of a Hodge decomposition of the $L^2$ solutions of the Vekua equation, from this orthogonal decomposition arises an operator associated with the Vekua operator, which in turn factorizes certain Schr\"odinger operators. Moreover, we provide an explicit expression of the ortho-projection over $A^p_{\alpha, \beta}(\Omega)$ in terms of the well-known ortho-projection of $L^2$ monogenic functions and an isomorphism operator. Finally, we prove the existence of component-wise reproductive Vekua kernels and the interrelationship with the Vekua projection in Bergman's sense.</description>

Abstract: We provide a unified method to study the adjacency matrices of regular graphs (including infinite ones) using holomorphic functional calculus. By applying this calculus on a specific ellipse that contains the spectrum, we derive an expansion of $h(A)$ using non-backtracking matrices. This framework allows us to systematically obtain discrete trace formulas that link spectral theory with graph combinatorics. To show how this method works, we give new proofs for several well-known problems, such as walk counting, the Ihara-Bass formula, and solutions to the heat and Schr\"odinger equations on graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a rigorous mathematical justification for the relaxation time approximation (RTA) model. We find that only the RTA with an energy-independent relaxation time can be justified in the case of hard interactions. Accordingly, we propose an alternative approach to restore the collision invariance lacking in traditional RTA. Besides, we provide a general statement on the non-analytical structures in the retarded correlators within the kinetic description. For hard interactions, hydrodynamic poles are the long-lived modes. Whereas for soft interactions, commonly encountered in relativistic kinetic theory, the gapless eigenvalue spectrum of linearized collision operator leads to gapless branch-cuts. We note that particle mass and inhomogeneous perturbations would complicate the above-mentioned non-analytical structures.</description>

      <title>Effective criteria for entanglement witnesses in small dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09298v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an effective set of necessary and sufficient criteria for block-positivity of matrices of order $4$ over $\mathbb{C}$. The approach is based on Sturm sequences and quartic polynomial positivity conditions presented in recent literature. The procedure allows us to test whether a given $4\times 4$ complex matrix corresponds to an entanglement witness, and it is exact when the matrix coefficients belong to the rationals, extended by $\mathrm{i}$. The method can be generalized to $\mathcal{H}_2\otimes\mathcal{H}_d$ systems for $d&gt;2$ to provide necessary but not sufficient criterion for block-positivity. We also outline an alternative approach to the problem relying on Gr\"obner bases.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25327v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</description>

      <title>On uniqueness of radial potentials for given Dirichlet spectra with distinct angular momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an inverse spectral problem for radial Schr\"odinger operators with singular potentials. First, we show that the knowledge of the Dirichlet spectra for infinitely many angular momenta~$\ell$ satisfying a M\"untz-type condition uniquely determines the potential. Next, in a neighborhood of the zero potential, we prove local uniqueness from two Dirichlet spectra associated with distinct angular momenta in the cases \((\ell_1,\ell_2) = (0,1)\) and \((0,3)\). Our approach relies on an explicit analysis of the associated singular differential equation, combined with the classical Kneser--Sommerfeld formula. These results sharpen a theorem of Carlson-Shubin~(1994) and confirm, in the linearized setting and for these configurations, a conjecture originally formulated by Rundell and Sacks~(2001).</description>

      <title>Quantum graphs of homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a category $\mathsf{qGph}$ of quantum graphs, whose definition is motivated entirely from noncommutative geometry. For all quantum graphs $G$ and $H$ in $\mathsf{qGph}$, we then construct a quantum graph $[G,H]$ of homomorphisms from $G$ to $H$, making $\mathsf{qGph}$ a closed symmetric monoidal category. We prove that for all finite graphs $G$ and $H$, the quantum graph $[G,H]$ is nonempty iff the $(G,H)$-homomorphism game has a winning quantum strategy, directly generalizing the classical case.
  The finite quantum graphs in $\mathsf{qGph}$ are tracial, real, and self-adjoint, and the morphisms between them are CP morphisms that are adjoint to a unital $*$-homomorphism. We prove that Weaver's two notions of a CP morphism coincide in this context. We also include a short proof that every finite reflexive quantum graph is the confusability quantum graph of a quantum channel.</description>

      <title>Enhanced posterior sampling via diffusion models for efficient metasurfaces inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inverse design of metasurfaces faces inherent challenges due to the nonlinear and highly complex relationship between geometric configurations and their electromagnetic behavior. Traditional optimization approaches often suffer from excessive computational demands and a tendency to converge to suboptimal solutions. This study presents a diffusion-based generative framework that incorporates a dedicated consistency constraint and advanced posterior sampling methods to ensure adherence to desired electromagnetic specifications. Through rigorous validation on small-scale metasurface configurations, the proposed approach demonstrates marked enhancements in both accuracy and reliability of the generated designs. Furthermore, we introduce a scalable methodology that extends inverse design capabilities to large-scale metasurfaces, validated for configurations of up to $98 \times 98$ nanopillars. Notably, this approach enables rapid design generation completed in minute by leveraging models trained on substantially smaller arrays ($23 \times 23$). These innovations establish a robust and efficient framework for high-precision metasurface inverse design.</description>

      <title>Large Coupling Convergence Beyond Definiteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study convergence of operator families of the form $A_\beta = A + \beta B$ towards an effective operator defined on $\ker(B)$, as the coupling constant $\beta$ tends to infinity. Crucially, we focus on the setting where neither $A$ nor $B$ can be assumed to be positive- (or negative-) semi-definite. We are hence outside the classical form-theoretic framework, where results based on Kato's monotone convergence theorem would be applicable. Thus, instead of form methods, our approach builds on classical resolvent identities to study convergence of the family $\{A_\beta\}_{\beta}$. Our findings are that: (i) \emph{Strong} resolvent convergence holds (without further spectral assumptions) if $A + \beta B$ is self-adjoint and the compression of $A$ onto $\ker(B)$ is well behaved. (ii) Under the more detailed assumption that $0 \in \sigma(B)$ is isolated, \emph{norm} resolvent convergence can be established even if $A+\beta B$ is merely closed, provided the quasinilpotent part of $B$ at zero vanishes and certain conditions on the interplay of $A$ and $B$ are met. Importantly, if $B$ is not self-adjoint we find that the limit operator not only depends on $\ker(B)$ as a Hilbert space, but crucially also on the precise form of the Riesz projector at $0 \in \sigma(B)$ onto $\ker(B)$.</description>
