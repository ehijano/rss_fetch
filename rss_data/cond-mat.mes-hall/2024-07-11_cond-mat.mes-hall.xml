      <title>Topology of ultra-localized insulators and superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topology of an insulator can be defined even when all eigenstates of the system are localized - an extreme case of Anderson insulators that we call ultra-localized. We derive the classification of such ultra-localized insulators in all symmetry classes and dimensions. We clarify their bulk-boundary correspondence and show that ultra-localized systems are in many instances phases of matter not described by the known classification of topological insulators and superconductors.</description>

      <title>General Electronic Structure Calculation Method for Twisted Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, two-dimensional twisted systems have gained increasing attention. However, the calculation of electronic structures in twisted material has remained a challenge. To address this, we have developed a general computational methodology that can generate twisted geometries starting from monolayer structure and obtain the precisely relaxed twisted structure through a machine learning-based method. Then the electronic structure properties of the twisted material are calculated using tight-Binding (TB) and continuum model methods, thus the entire process requires minimal computational resources. In this paper, we first introduce the theoretical methods for generating twisted structures and computing their electronic properties. We then provide calculations and brief analyses of the electronic structure properties for several typical two-dimensional materials with different characteristics. This work serves as a solid foundation for researchers interested in studying twisted systems.</description>

      <title>Dirac Electrons in AC-Magnetic Fields: $\pi$-Landau Levels and Chiral Anomaly-Induced Homodyne Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet engineering, which involves controlling systems through time-periodic driving, is a method for coherently manipulating quantum materials and realizing dynamical states with novel functionalities. Most research in solid-state systems has focused on the use of AC-electric fields as the controlling drive. In this study, we investigate the effects of AC-magnetic fields on two-dimensional (2D) Dirac electrons and report the emergence of new states and new transport phenomena. In a magnetic field that temporarily changes its direction, an electron nor a hole can sorely complete a cyclotron orbit. However, their resonant state alternating between electron and hole can do so; This leads to a new localized state that forms a flat band dubbed as a $\pi$-Landau level. Then, what would be the counterpart of the Hall effect in AC-magnetic fields? We find that a DC-current in the transverse direction, i.e. a homodyne Hall current, is generated when an additional AC-electric field is applied. In the case of Dirac electrons, several electronic states contribute to this phenomenon including the $\pi$-Landau level. However, when the chemical potential $\mu$ is near the Dirac point, the dominant contribution comes from the low-energy electrons and we numerically find the homodyne Hall current to behave as $I_y=-\frac{e}{h}\mu$ per valley and spin. We explain this phenomenon through the high-frequency effective Floquet Hamiltonian which resembles the chiral Landau level Hamiltonian of three-dimensional Weyl Hamiltonian exhibiting chiral anomaly. We discuss the experimental feasibility and conclude that it is possible to realize this new exotic state using techniques such as THz metamaterial enhancement of magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the valley Hall conductivity due to interparticle interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Coulomb interaction-mediated contribution to valley Hall effect (VHE) in two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric gapped Dirac materials. We assume that the bare valley Hall current occurs in the system due to the presence of disorder caused by impurities and is determined by the valley-selective anisotropic skew scattering. Applying the Boltzmann transport equation to describe the electron and hole transport in the material, we calculate the renormalized VHE conductivity due to electron-electron and electron-hole scattering processes, considering two regimes: (i) an $n$-doped monolayer hosting a degenerate electron gas, and (ii) an intrinsic semiconductor with the Boltzmann statistics of electron and hole gases. In both regimes, the dominant mechanism of interparticle scattering is due to particles residing in different valleys. Moreover, in case (ii), in addition to direct scattering, electron-hole annihilation starts to play a role with the increase in temperature. It might even become the dominant mechanism of the Coulomb interaction-mediated VHE.</description>

      <title>Extending the Takagi-Taupin equations for x-ray nanobeam Bragg coherent diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach for simulating x-ray nanobeam Bragg coherent diffraction patterns based on the Takagi-Taupin equations. Compared to conventional methods, the current approach can be universally applied to any weakly strained system including semi-infinite crystals that diffract dynamically. It addresses issues such as the curved wavefront and re-divergence of the focused incident beam. We show excellent agreement against experimental data on a strained La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin film on SrTiO3 substrate, and a path to extracting physical information using automatic differentiation.</description>

      <title>Berry phases in Coulomb drag of double-layer graphene system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments suggest quantum interference effects in the Coulomb drag of double-layer graphene systems. By accounting for correlated interlayer impurity scattering under a weak magnetic field, our theoretical results reveal drag resistivities resembling those in weak (anti-)localization. It is established that the quantum interference effect is most significant when the chemical potentials match. The theory clarifies the roles of intra- and interlayer Berry phases in Coulomb drag in double-layer graphene systems and helps delineate the intra- and intervalley contributions. These insights are valuable for designing graphene-based electronic devices exploiting quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Peculiarities of measured dependencies of strength of spin-orbit interaction and anisotropy field on current density in FeCoB nanomagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for measuring the modulation of magnetic anisotropy and the strength of spin-orbit interaction by an electrical current in nanomagnets. Our systematic study explores the current dependencies of these properties across a variety of nanomagnets with different structures, compositions, and sizes, providing unprecedented insights into the complex physical origins of this effect. We identified two distinct contributions to the observed current modulation: one proportional to the current and the other to the square of the current. The squared-current contribution, originating from the Spin Hall effect, uniquely accumulates strength with an increasing number of interfaces, resulting in exceptionally large current modulation of magnetic anisotropy and spin-orbit interaction in multi-layer nanomagnets. Conversely, the linear-current contribution stems from the Ordinary and Anomalous Hall effects and exhibits opposite polarity at different interfaces, making it significant only in asymmetrical single-layer nanomagnets. The squared-current contribution induces substantial anisotropy field changes, up to 30-50$\%$ at typical MRAM recording currents, leading to thermally-activated magnetization reversal and data recording. The linear-current contribution, while smaller, is effective for parametric magnetization reversal, providing sufficient modulation for efficient data recording through resonance mechanisms. This finding highlights the complex nature of spin accumulation and spin dynamics at the nanoscale, presenting an opportunity for further optimization of data recording in MRAM technology.</description>

      <title>Spatially-extended nonlinear generation of short-wavelength spin waves in YIG nanowaveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study nonlinear propagation of spin waves in microscopic yttrium iron garnet waveguides, where the dispersion spectrum is engineered to enable efficient four-magnon interactions over a wide range of wavelengths. We show that under these conditions, the initial monochromatic spin wave nonlinearly generates co-propagating spin waves with well-defined, discrete frequencies. This process is characterized by a low energy threshold and can be observed in a wide range of frequencies and excitation powers. Thanks to the engineered dispersion, the process allows the generation of waves with short wavelengths that cannot be excited directly by a linear excitation mechanism. The nonlinearly generated short-wavelength spin waves continuously acquire the energy from the initial pump wave during co-propagation, which results in compensation of their propagation losses over significant distances. The observed phenomena can be used to implement frequency- and wavelength-conversion operations in magnonic nanodevices and circuits.</description>

      <title>Robust quantum engineering of current flow in carbon nanostructures at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bottom-up on-surface synthesis enables the fabrication of carbon nanostructures with atomic precision. Good examples are graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), 1D conjugated polymers, and nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), which are gathering increasing attention for future carbon nanoelectronics. A key step is the ability to manipulate current flow within these nanomaterials. Destructive quantum interference (QI), long studied in the field of single-molecule electronics, has been proposed as the most effective way to achieve such control with molecular-scale precision. However, for practical applications, it is essential that such QI-engineering remains effective near or above room temperature. To assess this important point, here we combine large-scale molecular dynamics simulations and quantum transport calculations and focus our study on NPGs formed as arrays of laterally bonded GNRs. By considering various NPGs with different inter-GNR chemical connections we disentangle the different factors determining electronic transport in these carbon nanomaterials at 300 K. Our findings unequivocally demonstrate that QI survives at room temperature, with thermal vibrations weakly restricting current flow along GNRs while completely blocking transport across GNRs. Our results thus pave the way towards the future realization of QI-engineered carbon nanocircuitry operating at room temperature, which is a fundamental step towards carbon-based nanoelectronics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Shot noise in Aharonov-Bohm interferometers: Comparison of helical and conventional setups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the shot noise of current through the edge states of a two-dimensional topological insulator placed in magnetic field and compare the obtained results with the shot noise in conventional single-channel spinless Aharonov-Bohm interferometer. We find general formulas for the Fano factors of these setups, assuming that temperature exceeds level spacing in the system. We demonstrate that both in helical and in conventional case the interference effects dramatically change the Fano factor and its magnetic field dependence. For weak tunneling coupling with leads, the Fano factors of both setups exhibit a periodic series of sharp Aharonov-Bohm peaks with variation of magnetic flux piercing the system. Our key finding is that the Fano factor in the helical interferometer provides information about the presence of backscattering defects violating topological protection. In particular, the amplitude of Aharonov-Bohm peaks in the helical setup is proportional to the strength of the defect in contrast to conventional setup, where peaks have finite amplitude even in the ballistic case.</description>

      <title>Mirror-induced effects in cavity polaritonics: influence on edge states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical cavities are widely used to induce strong light-matter coupling and thereby enable the presence of polaritons. While polaritons are at the source of most of the observed physics, the mirrors forming the cavity may also themselves be responsible for a number of phenomena, independently of the strong light-matter coupling regime. Here, we use a toy model of a chain of dipolar emitters coupled to a cuboidal cavity. We unveil several effects originating solely from the boundary conditions imposed by the cavity mirrors, that are dominant when the distances of the emitters to the cavity walls are of the order of the interdipole separation. In particular, we show that mirrors in the direction transverse to the chain may act as effective defects, leading to the emergence of Tamm edge states. Considering a topological chain, we demonstrate that such transverse mirrors may also protect edge states against the effects of the strong light-matter coupling. Finally, we find that mirrors parallel to the chain, by the image charges they involve, induce topological phase transitions even in the case of highly off-resonant photons.</description>

      <title>Exotic edge states of C3 high-fold fermions in honeycomb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalization of the graphene honeycomb model to the case where each site in the honeycomb lattice contains a $n-$fold degenerate set of eigenstates of the $C_3$ symmetry has been recently proposed to describe several systems, including triangulene crystals and photonic lattices. These generalized honeycomb models are defined by $(n_a,n_b)$, the number $C_3$ eigenstates in the $a$ and $b$ sites of the unit cell, resulting in $n_a+n_b$ bands. Thus, the $(1,1)$ case gives the coventional honeycomb model that describes the two low-energy bands in graphene. Generalizations, such as $(2,1)$, $(2,2)$ and $(3,3)$ display several non-trivial features, such as coexisting graphene-like Dirac cones with flat-bands, both at zero and finite-energy, as well as robust degeneracy points where a flat-band and a parabolic band meet at the $\Gamma$-point. Here, we explore the edge states of this class of crystals, using as reference triangulene crystals, and we find several types of edge states absent in the conventional $(1,1)$ honeycomb case, associated to the non-trivial features of the two-dimensional (2D) bands of the high-fold case. First, we find dispersive edge states associated to the finite-energy flat-bands, that occur both at the armchair and zigzag termination. Second, in the case of non-centrosymmetric triangulene crystals that lead to a $S=1$ Dirac band, we have a bonding-antibonding pair of dispersive edge states, localized in the same edge so that their energy splitting is reduced as their localization increases, opposite to the conventional behavior of pairs of states localized in opposite edges. Third, for the $(3,3)$ case, that hosts a gap separating a pair of flat conduction and valence bands, we find non-dispersive edge states with $E=0$ in all edge terminations.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Convolutional Neural Network Architecture Design using Magnetic Skyrmion and Domain Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spintronic-based neuromorphic hardware enables high-density and rapid data processing at nanoscale lengths. leveraged by the topologically protected spin configurations and low current densities to manipulate magnetic structures such as skyrmion and domain wall. The paper presents a compact, energy-efficient multi-bit skyrmionic synapse and domain wall-based ReLU with max-pooling functionalities for hardware neural network applications. A 4-bit,5-bit, and 6-bit skyrmionic synapse is proposed, featuring a circular bilayer vortex-based geometry. The 4-bit skyrmionic synapse consumes an ultra-low energy of 0.8724 fJ per weight update. The proposed skyrmionic synapse comprises an ultra-thin ferromagnetic layer with a strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and a polarizer layer with a vortex-like spin configuration. The interaction between perpendicular current flow and the labyrinth maze-like uniaxial anisotropy profiles induce skyrmionic gyration, resulting in long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) that modifies the synaptic weights. We develop a phenomenology of the synaptic device, implementing 16-state (4-bit), 32-state (5-bit), and 64-state (6-bit) skyrmionic synapses, analyzing them quantitatively using micromagnetics simulations. Furthermore, we design a CMOS hybrid domain wall-based ReLU-max pooled circuit. The activation function works on the variation of the domain wall position implying variation in the device resistance on encountering uniaxial anisotropy variation along the track. To demonstrate the practical application of our 4-bit (16-state) skyrmionic synapse with domain wall-based ReLU-Max Pooling circuit we integrate it into an inference-based convolutional neural network (CNN) for pattern recognition, achieving a comparable accuracy of 98.07% to software-based ideal training.</description>

      <title>Spin-valley-locked Electroluminescence for High-Performance Circularly-Polarized Organic Light-Emitting Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circularly polarized (CP) organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted attention in potential applications including novel display and photonic technologies. However, conventional approaches cannot meet the requirements of device performance, such as high dissymmetry factor, high directionality, narrowband emission, simplified device structure and low costs. Here, we demonstrate spin-valley-locked CP-OLEDs without chiral emitters, but based on photonic spin-orbit coupling, where photons with opposite CP characteristics are emitted from different optical valleys. These spin-valley locked OLEDs exhibit a narrowband emission of 16 nm, a high EQE of 3.65, a maximum luminance of near 98000 cd/m2 and a gEL of up to 1.80, which are among the best performances of active single-crystal CP-OLEDs, achieved with a simple device structure. This strategy opens an avenue for practical applications towards three-dimensional displays and on-chip CP-OLEDs.</description>

      <title>Influence of flat bands on RKKY interaction: perspective of Fano defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the effect of flat bands on the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction by using a coordinate transformation that detangles flat-band states from dispersive ones. Under this transformation, original flat-band systems containing magnetic impurities are mapped onto a generalized Fano-Anderson model, where flat-band states act as Fano defects. From this perspective, several features of exact RKKY couplings calculated numerically can be understood easily. As an illustrative example, we analyze a dimerized diamond chain model, which can exhibit either gapped or gapless spectra depending on the ratio of hopping integrals. We find that anomalous decay in the RKKY couplings arises exclusively in the gapless case and with specific magnetic coupling configurations. Furthermore, the conventional wisdom regarding the signs of RKKY interactions breaks down under certain conditions. These subtleties arising from flat bands find explanation within our present approach. Our investigation offers deeper insights into how flat bands influence carrier-mediated exchange interactions, with implications extending to broader contexts.</description>

      <title>Breaking of Lorentz invariance caused by the interplay between spin-orbit interaction and transverse phonon modes in quantum wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Lorentz invariance breaking in quantum wires due to Rashba spin-orbit interaction and transverse phonons. Using bosonization, we derive an effective action coupling electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom. Stikingly, at a quantum phase transition between straight and bent wire states, we find a gapped phonon mode and a gapless mode with quadratic dispersion, signaling the breaking of Lorentz invariance. We explore stability conditions for general potentials and propose nano-mechanical back-action as a sensitive tool for detecting this transition, with implications for Sliding Luttinger Liquids and dimensional crossover studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional doped Dirac insulators foster simply connected (in both topological and trivial regimes) and annular (deep inside the topological regime) Fermi surfaces (FSs) in the normal state, and allow on-site repulsions among fermions with opposite spin ($U_1$) and parity ($U_2$) eigenvalues. From an unbiased leading-order (one-loop) renormalization group analysis, controlled by a suitable $\epsilon$ expansion, we show that this system develops strong propensity toward the nucleation of scalar $s$-wave and odd-parity pseudoscalar $p$-wave pairings, favored by repulsive $U_1$ and $U_2$ interactions, respectively, irrespective of the underlying FS topology. Our results can be pertinent for the observed superconductivity in various doped narrow gap semiconductors, and the theoretical foundation can readily be applied to investigate similar phenomenon in various doped topological materials.</description>

      <title>Successive electron-vortex binding in quantum Hall bilayers at $\nu=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{3}{4}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons in a quantum Hall fluid can bind with an integer number of vortices to form composite fermions and composite bosons. We show that the quantum Hall bilayer at filling $\nu=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{3}{4}$ with interlayer separation $d$ can be well-described in terms of these composite particles. At small $d$ the system can be understood as interlayer paired electrons and holes, whereas at large $d$ the system is best understood in terms of composite fermions with four vortices attached to each electron. By computing the overlaps of trial wavefunctions with the ground state from exact diagonalization, we find that as $d$ increases, the number of vortices that attach to each electron increases. We also construct trial states for two types of excitation, the Goldstone mode and a meron excitation. These two trial states have good overlaps with the lowest excited states in the exact diagonalization spectrum for small and intermediate $d$ respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of topological Weyl semimetals has recently gained considerable attention. Here, we report the results of density-functional theory calculations regarding the magnetic properties, the electronic structure, and the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of the title compound, which was synthesized already 50 years ago but received little attention, hitherto. We found Cs$_{2}$Co$_{3}$S$_4$ to be a ferrimagnetic half-metal with a total spin magnetic moment of about 3 $\mu_B$ per formula unit. It shows energy band gap of 0.36 eV in the majority-spin channel and a pseudo-gap at the Fermi level in the minority-spin channel. We identified several sets of low-energy Weyl points and traced their dependence on the direction of magnetization. The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity is predicted to reach a magnitude up to 500 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$, which is comparable to values obtained in other celebrated Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to prepare magnonic squeezed states in an optomagnomechanical system, in which magnetostriction induced mechanical displacement couples to an optical cavity via radiation pressure. We discuss two scenarios depending on whether the magnomechanical coupling is linear or dispersive. We show that in both cases the strong mechanical squeezing obtained via two-tone driving of the optical cavity can be efficiently transferred to the magnon mode. In the linear coupling case, stationary magnon squeezing is achieved; while in the dispersive coupling case, a transient magnonic squeezed state is prepared in a two-step protocol. The proposed magnonic squeezed states find promising applications in quantum information processing and quantum sensing using magnons.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Thermal Transport in Tunable Self-Assembled Nanocrystal Supercrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing tunable functional materials with built-in nanoscale heat flow directionality represents a significant challenge with the potential to enable novel thermal management strategies. Here we use spatiotemporally-resolved thermoreflectance to visualize lateral thermal transport anisotropy in self-assembled supercrystals of anisotropic Au nanocrystals. Correlative electron and thermoreflectance microscopy reveal that heat predominantly flows along the long-axis of the anisotropic nanocrystals, and does so across grain boundaries and curved assemblies while voids disrupt heat flow. We finely control the anisotropy via the aspect ratio of constituent nanorods, and it exceeds the aspect ratio for nano-bipyramid supercrystals and certain nanorod arrangements. Finite element simulations and effective medium modeling rationalize the emergent anisotropic behavior in terms of a simple series resistance model, further providing a framework for estimating thermal anisotropy as a function of material and structural parameters. Self-assembly of colloidal nanocrystals promises a novel route to direct heat flow in a wide range of applications that utilize this important class of materials.</description>

      <title>Domain-stored skyrmion structures for a reading error-detectable racetrack memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic racetrack memory (RTM) uses a series of either domains or skyrmions as data bits along nanowires. However, it lacks reading error detection capability in nanowires, which requires high electric current density for the deterministic motion of domain walls (DWs) or skyrmions. Here, we propose a method of a reading error-detectable RTM and explore domain-stored skyrmion structures for this RTM. This method uses domains as memory cells and assigns the presence and absence of a skyrmion in a domain to different bits, enabling the electrical signal of any memory cells to output the opposite sign to that of the adjacent memory cells. Using simulations and Lorentz microscopy, we demonstrate that perpendicularly magnetized nanowires with relatively large Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction can achieve domain-stored skyrmion structures. Additionally, our simulations show that when DWs approach to skyrmions during spin-orbit torque-induced motion, angular momentum transfers from DWs to skyrmions, resulting in fast motion of skyrmions.</description>

Abstract: We study the many-body ground states of three-component quantum particles in two prototypical topological lattice models under strong intercomponent and intracomponent repulsions. At band filling $\nu=3/4$ for hardcore bosons, we demonstrate the emergence of three-component fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect characterized by the $\mathbf{K}$ matrix, through exact diagonalization study of four-fold quasidegenerate ground states with a robust spectrum gap and the combined density-matrix renormalization group calculation of fractional drag charge pumping. Further we formulate the topological characterization of FQH states of three-component Bose-Fermi mixtures at various fillings by the $\mathbf{K}$ matrix. At last we discuss the possible generalization of our approach to identify non-Abelian three-component spin-singlet FQH states.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent theory for the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (PLG) has attracted significant attention due to its potential for observing exotic quantum states. In this work, we present a self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory for the FQAH effect in rhombohedral PLG. In particular, we focus on the convergence of the Hartree-Fock calculation with various reference fields and discuss the stability of the FQAH states in PLG. We show that the so-called charge neutrality scheme provides an unambiguous result for the Hartree-Fock calculation, as it ensures a convergence with respect to the momentum cutoff. Based on the Hartree-Fock band structure, we further carry out exact diagonalization calculations to explore the stability of the FQAH states in PLG. Our work provides an improved and unified (minimal) theoretical framework to understand the FQAH effect in rhombohedral PLG and paves the way for future experimental and theoretical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this review, the thermoelectric properties in nodal-point semimetals with two bands are discussed. For the two-dimensional (2D) cases, it is shown that the expressions of the thermoelectric coefficients take different values depending on the nature of the scattering mechanism responsible for transport, by considering examples of short-ranged disorder potential and screened charged impurities. An anisotropy in the energy dispersion spectrum invariably affects the thermopower quite significantly, as illustrated by the results for a node of semi-Dirac semimetal and a single valley of graphene. The scenario when a magnetic field of magnitude $B$ is applied perpendicular to the plane of the 2D semimetal is also considered. The computations for three-dimensional (3D) cases necessarily involve the inclusion of nontrivial Berry phase effects. In addition to demonstrating the expressions for the response tensors, the exotic behaviour observed in planar Hall and planar thermal Hall set-ups is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Strategies for the alignment of electronic states in quantum-dot tunnel-injection lasers and their influence on the emission dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum-dot tunnel-injection lasers, the excited charge carriers are efficiently captured from the bulk states via an injector quantum well and then transferred into the quantum dots via a tunnel barrier. The alignment of the electronic levels is crucial for the high efficiency of these processes and especially for the fast modulation dynamics of these lasers. In particular, the quantum mechanical nature of the tunneling process must be taken into account in the transition from two-dimensional quantum well states to zero-dimensional quantum dot states. This results in hybrid states, from which the scattering into the quantum-dot ground states takes place. We combine electronic state calculations of the tunnel-injection structures with many-body calculations of the scattering processes and insert this into a complete laser simulator. This allows us to study the influence of the structural design and the resulting electronic states as well as limitations due to inhomogeneous quantum-dot distributions. We find that the optimal electronic state alignment deviates from a simple picture in which the of the quantum-dot ground state energies are one LO-phonon energy below the injector quantum well ground state.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of qubit decoherence is a crucial prerequisite for improving the qubit performance. In this work we discuss the effects of residual Bogolyubov quasiparticles in Schr\"odinger cat qubits, either of the dissipative or Kerr type. The major difference from previous studies of quasiparticles in superconducting qubits is that the Schr\"odinger cat qubits are operated under non-equilibrium conditions. Indeed, an external microwave drive is needed to stabilize "cat states", which are superpositions of coherent degenerate eigenstates of an effective stationary Lindbladian in the rotating frame. We present a microscopic derivation of the master equation for cat qubits and express the effect of the quasiparticles as dissipators acting on the density matrix of the cat qubit. This enables us to determine the conditions under which the quasiparticles give a substantial contribution to the qubit errors.</description>

Abstract: We critically analyze the recently reported observation of integer (IQAHE) and fractional (FQAHE) quantum anomalous Hall effects at zero applied magnetic field in pentalayer graphene. Our quantitative activation and variable range hopping transport analysis of the experimental data reveals that the observed IQAHE and FQAHE at different fillings all have similar excitation gaps of the order of $5-10$ K. In addition, we also find that the observed FQAHE manifests a large hidden background contact series resistance &gt;10 k$\Omega$ of unknown origin whereas this contact resistance is much smaller ~500 $\Omega$ in the observed IQAHE. Both of these findings are surprising as well as inconsistent with the well-established phenomenology of the corresponding high-field integer and fractional quantum Hall effects in 2D semiconductor systems.</description>

Abstract: Flat bands (FBs) in materials can enhance the correlation effects, resulting in exotic phenomena. Line graph (LG) lattices are well known for hosting FBs with isotropic hoppings in $s$-orbital models. Despite their prevalent application in the Kagome metals, there has been a lack of a general approach for incorporating higher-angular-momentum orbitals with spin-orbit couplings (SOCs) into LGs to achieve FBs. Here, we introduce a non-Abelian LG theory to construct FBs in realistic systems, which incorporates internal degrees of freedom and goes beyond $s$-orbital models. We modify the lattice edges and sites in the LG to be associated with arbitrary Hermitian matrices, referred to as the multiple LG. A fundamental aspect involves mapping the multiple LG Hamiltonian to a tight-binding (TB) model that respects the lattice symmetry through appropriate local non-Abelian transformations. We establish the general conditions to determine the local transformations. Based on this mechanism, we demonstrate the realization of $d$-orbital FBs in the Kagome lattice, which could serve as a minimal model for understanding the FBs in transition metal Kagome materials. Our approach bridges the gap between the known FBs in pure lattice models and their realization in multi-orbital systems.</description>

Abstract: We study interaction between two magnetic impurities on top of a two dimensional insulator in the presence of chiral phonons by second-order perturbation theory. We show that this exchange interaction arises from angular momentum of phonons through spin-chiral phonon interaction of the form of spin-orbit coupling. Analytical expressions of the interaction for acoustic and optical phonons are obtained. The exchange interactions are always positive due to the bosonic nature of phonons. We find that the exchange interactions for acoustic and optical phonons show power-law decay with respect to the distance between the two magnetic impurities and are proportional to the temperature of the system at high temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity emerges from the spatial coherence of a macroscopic condensate of Cooper pairs. Increasingly strong binding and localization of electrons into these pairs compromises the condensate's phase stiffness, thereby limiting critical temperatures -- a phenomenon known as the BCS-BEC crossover in lattice systems. In this study, we demonstrate enhanced superconductivity in a multiorbital model of alkali-doped fullerides (A$_3$C$_{60}$) that goes beyond the limits of the lattice BCS-BEC crossover. We identify that the interplay of strong correlations and multiorbital effects results in a localized superconducting state characterized by a short coherence length but robust stiffness and a domeless rise in critical temperature with increasing pairing interaction. To derive these insights, we introduce a new theoretical framework allowing us to calculate the fundamental length scales of superconductors, namely the coherence length ($\xi_0$) and the London penetration depth ($\lambda_{\mathrm{L}}$), even in presence of strong electron correlations.</description>

Abstract: The Bernal-Fowler ice rules stipulate that each water molecule in an ice crystal should form four hydrogen bonds. However, in extreme or constrained conditions, the arrangement of water molecules deviates from conventional ice rules, resulting in properties significantly different from bulk water. In this study, we employ machine learning-driven first-principles simulations to identify a new stabilization mechanism in nanoconfined ice phases beyond conventional ice rules. Instead of forming four hydrogen bonds, nanoconfined crystalline ice can form a quasi-one-dimensional hydrogen-bonded structure that exhibits only two hydrogen bonds per water molecule. These structures consist of strongly hydrogen-bonded linear chains of water molecules that zig-zag along one dimension, stabilized by van der Waals interactions that stack these chains along the other dimension. The unusual interplay of hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions in nanoconfined ice results in atypical proton behavior such as potential ferroelectric behavior, low dielectric response, and long-range proton dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The exploration of magnetic topological insulators is instrumental in exploring axion electrodynamics and intriguing transport phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Here, we report that a family of magnetic compounds Eu$_{2n+1}$In$_{2}$(As,Sb)$_{2n+2}$ ($n=0,1,2$) exhibit both gapless Dirac surface states and chiral hinge modes. Such a hybrid-order topology hatches surface-dependent quantum geometry. By mapping the responses into real space, we demonstrate the existence of chiral hinge modes along the $c$ direction, which originate from the half-quantized anomalous Hall effect on two gapped $ac$/$bc$ facets due to Berry curvature, while the unpinned Dirac surface states on the gapless $ab$ facet generate an intrinsic nonlinear anomalous Hall effect due to the quantum metric. When Eu$_{3}$In$_{2}$As$_{4}$ is polarized to the ferromagnetic phase by an external magnetic field, it becomes an ideal Weyl semimetal with a single pair of type-I Weyl points and no extra Fermi pocket. Our work predicts rich topological states sensitive to magnetic structures, quantum geometry-induced transport and topological superconductivity if proximitized with a superconductor.</description>
