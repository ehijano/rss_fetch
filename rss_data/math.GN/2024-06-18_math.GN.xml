      <title>The DeMorganization of a locale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2009, Caramello proved that each topos has a largest dense subtopos whose internal logic satisfies De Morgan law (also known as the law of the weak excluded middle). This finding implies that every locale has a largest dense extremally disconnected sublocale, referred to as its DeMorganization. In this paper, we take the first steps in exploring the DeMorganization in the localic context, shedding light on its geometric nature by showing that it is always a fitted sublocale and by providing a concrete description. The main result of the paper is that for any metrizable locale (without isolated points), its DeMorganization coincides with its Booleanization. This, in particular, implies that any extremally disconnected metric locale (without isolated points) must be Boolean, generalizing a well-known result for topological spaces to the localic setting.</description>

      <title>Small Hurewicz and Menger sets which have large continuous images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide new techniques to construct sets of reals without perfect subsets and with the Hurewicz or Menger covering properties. In particular, we show that if the Continuum Hypothesis holds, then there are such sets which can be mapped continuously onto the Cantor space. These results allow to separate the properties of Menger and $\mathsf{S}_1(\Gamma,\mathrm{O})$ in the realm of sets of reals without perfect subsets and solve a problem of Nowik and Tsaban concerning perfectly meager subsets in the transitive sense. We present also some other applications of the mentioned above methods.</description>
