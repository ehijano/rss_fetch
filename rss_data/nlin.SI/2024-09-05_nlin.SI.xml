      <title>Stability of standing periodic waves in the massive Thirring model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the spectral stability of the standing periodic waves in the massive Thirring model in laboratory coordinates. Since solutions of the linearized MTM equation are related to the squared eigenfunctions of the linear Lax system, the spectral stability of the standing periodic waves can be studied by using their Lax spectrum. Standing periodic waves are classified based on eight eigenvalues which coincide with the endpoints of the spectral bands of the Lax spectrum. Combining analytical and numerical methods, we show that the standing periodic waves are spectrally stable if and only if the eight eigenvalues are located either on the imaginary axis or along the diagonals of the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Generation Model of a Spatially Limited Vortex in a Stratified Unstable Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new model for the generation of axisymmetric concentrated vortices. The solution of a nonlinear equation for internal gravity waves in an unstable stratified atmosphere is obtained and analyzed within the framework of ideal hydrodynamics. The corresponding expressions describing the dependences on the radius for the radial and vertical velocity components in the inner and outer regions of the vortex include combinations of Bessel functions and modified Bessel functions. The proposed new nonlinear analytical model makes it possible to study the structure and nonlinear dynamics of vortices in the radial and vertical regions. The vortex is limited in height. The maximum vertical velocity component is reached at a certain height. Below this height, radial flows converge towards the axis, and above it, an outflow occurs. The resulting instability in the stratified atmosphere leads to an increase in the radial and vertical velocity components according to the hyperbolic sine law, which turns into exponential growth. The characteristic growth time is determined by the inverse growth rate of the instability. The formation of vortices with finite velocity components, which increase with time, is analyzed. The radial structure of the azimuthal velocity is determined by the structure of the initial perturbation and can change with height. The maximum rotation is reached at a certain height. The growth of the azimuth velocity occurs according to a super-exponential law.</description>

      <title>On the long-wave approximation of solitary waves in cylindrical coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address justification and solitary wave solutions of the cylindrical KdV equation which is formally derived as a long wave approximation of radially symmetric waves in a two-dimensional nonlinear dispersive system. For a regularized Boussinesq equation, we prove error estimates between true solutions of this equation and the associated cylindrical KdV approximation in the L2-based spaces. The justification result holds in the spatial dynamics formulation of the regularized Boussinesq equation. We also prove that the class of solitary wave solutions considered previously in the literature does not contain solutions in the L2-based spaces. This presents a serious obstacle in the applicability of the cylindrical KdV equation for modeling of radially symmetric solitary waves since the long wave approximation has to be performed separately in different space-time regions.</description>
