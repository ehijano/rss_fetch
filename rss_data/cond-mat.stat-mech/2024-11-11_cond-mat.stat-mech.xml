      <title>Universal finite-size scaling in the extraordinary-log boundary phase of 3d $O(N)$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in boundary critical phenomena have led to the discovery of a new surface universality class in the three-dimensional $O(N)$ model. The newly found "extraordinary-log" phase can be realized on a two-dimensional surface for $N&lt; N_c$, with $N_c&gt;3$, and on a plane defect embedded into a three-dimensional system, for any $N$. One of the key features of the extraordinary-log phase is the presence of logarithmic violations of standard finite-size scaling. In this work we study finite-size scaling in the extraordinary-log universality class by means of Monte Carlo simulations of an improved lattice model. We simulate the model with open boundary conditions, realizing the extraordinary-log phase on the surface for $N=2,3$, as well as with fully periodic boundary conditions and in the presence of a plane defect for $N=2,3,4$. In line with theory predictions, renormalization-group invariant observables studied here exhibit a logarithmic dependence on the size of the system. We numerically access not only the leading term in the $\beta$-function governing these logarithmic violations, but also the subleading term, which controls the evolution of the boundary phase diagram as a function of $N$.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak Symmetry Breaking and Entanglement Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When interacting with an environment, the entanglement within quantum many-body systems is rapidly transferred to the entanglement between the system and the bath. For systems with a large local Hilbert space dimension, this leads to a first-order entanglement transition for the reduced density matrix of the system. On the other hand, recent studies have introduced a new paradigm for classifying density matrices, with particular focus on scenarios where a strongly symmetric density matrix undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking to a weak symmetry phase. This is typically characterized by a finite R\'enyi-2 correlator or a finite Wightman correlator. In this work, we study the entanglement transition from the perspective of strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, using solvable complex Brownian SYK models. We perform analytical calculations for both the early-time and late-time saddles. The results show that while the R\'enyi-2 correlator indicates a transition from symmetric to symmetry-broken phase, the Wightman correlator becomes finite even in the early-time saddle due to the single-replica limit, demonstrating that the first-order transition occurs between a near-symmetric phase and a deeply symmetry-broken phase in the sense of Wightman correlator. Our results provide a novel viewpoint on the entanglement transition under symmetry constraints and can be readily generalized to systems with repeated measurements.</description>

      <title>Phase Coexistence in Nonreciprocal Quorum-Sensing Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motility and nonreciprocity are two primary mechanisms for self-organization in active matter. In a recent study [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 148301 (2023)], we explored their joint influence in a minimal model of two-species quorum-sensing active particles interacting via mutual motility regulation. Our results notably revealed a highly dynamic phase of chaotic chasing bands that is absent when either nonreciprocity or self-propulsion is missing. Here, we examine further the phase behavior of nonreciprocal quorum-sensing active particles, distinguishing between the regimes of weak and strong nonreciprocity. In the weakly nonreciprocal regime, this system exhibits multi-component motility-induced phase separation. We establish an analytical criterion for the associated phase coexistence, enabling a quantitative prediction of the phase diagram. For strong nonreciprocity, where the dynamics is chase-and-run-like, we numerically determine the phase behavior and show that it strongly depends on the scale of observation. In small systems, our numerical simulations reveal a phenomenology consistent with phenomenological models, comprising traveling phase-separated domains and spiral-like defect patterns. However, we show that these structures are generically unstable in large systems, where they are superseded by bulk phase coexistence between domains that are either homogeneous or populated by mesoscopic chasing bands. Crucially, this implies that collective motion totally vanishes at large scales, while the breakdown of our analytical criterion for this phase coexistence with multi-scale structures prevents us from predicting the corresponding phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Smart navigation through a rotating barrier: Deep reinforcement learning with application to size-based separation of active microagents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ deep reinforcement learning methods to investigate shortest-time navigation strategies for smart active Brownian particles (agents) that self-propel through a rotating, localized potential barrier in an otherwise static and viscous fluid background. The particle motion is prescribed to begin from a specified start point and terminate at a specified destination point. The potential barrier is modeled as a repulsive Gaussian potential with a finite range that rotates with given angular velocities around a fixed center within the plane of motion. We use an advantage actor-critic approach to train the agents and demonstrate that, by leveraging this approach, the rotating potential can be utilized for size-based sorting and separation of the agents. In other words, agents of different (hydrodynamic) radii reach the end-point at sufficiently well-separated times, enabling their separation. The efficiency of particle separation in this context is discussed using specific criteria. We also study the effect of rotational Brownian noise on the quality of the proposed size-based sorting mechanism. Additionally, we demonstrate how the use of noise-induced training can enhance this mechanism in a noisy background within the range of parameters explored in our work. Reinforcement learning in the context of active particles thus offers promising avenues to unravel optimal navigation strategies within complex environments, with potential applications that can be utilized in microfluidic settings.</description>

      <title>A formal gradient flow interpretation of a class of McKean-Vlasov equations using a new adaptation of the Wasserstein metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new adaptation of the Wasserstein metric over the space of probability measures is presented, the associated formal Otto calculus developed, and some transport inequalities are proven. An instance of this new metric can be viewed as a curved version of the dual space of a second-order Sobolev-like factor space; in a similar way that the linearization of the classical 2-Wasserstein metric is the dual norm of the first-order, homogeneous Sobolev space. This new metric structure permits an intuitive gradient flow interpretation of a class of nonlinear, nonlocal integro-differential evolution equations of the McKean-Vlasov type that arise at the intersection of mathematics, economics, and physics.
  Moreover, in the same way that classical $W_2$ gradient flow theory connects heat flow and the second law of thermodynamics by way of Boltzmann entropy, the generalization here gives rise to a principle of econophysics that is much of the same flavor but for the Gini coefficient of economic inequality.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions of the harmonically confined Vicsek model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete time Vicsek model confined by a harmonic potential explains many aspects of swarm formation in insects. We have found exact solutions of this model without alignment noise in two or three dimensions. They are periodic or quasiperiodic (invariant circle) solutions with positions on a circular orbit or on several concentric orbits and exist for quantized values of the confinement. There are period 2 and period 4 solutions on a line for a range of confinement strengths and period 4 solutions on a rhombus. These solutions may have polarization one, although there are partially ordered period 4 solutions and totally disordered (zero polarization) period 2 solutions. We have explored the linear stability of the exact solutions in two dimensions using the Floquet theorem and verified the stability assignements by direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Observation of Critical Scaling in Spin Glasses below Tc using the Thermoremanent Magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent Thermoremanent Magnetization (TRM) studies have been instrumental in probing energy dynamics within the spin glass phase. In this paper, we will review the evolution of the TRM experiment over the last half century and discuss some aspects related to how it has been employed in the understanding of spin glasses. We will also report on recent experiments using high resolution DC SQUID magnetometry to probe the TRM at temperatures less than but near to the transition temperature Tc. These experiments have been performed as a function of waiting time, temperature, and five different magnetic fields. We find that as the transition temperature is approached from below, the characteristic time scale of the TRM is suppressed up to several orders of magnitude in time. In the highest temperature region, we find that the waiting time effect goes away, and a waiting time independent crossover line is reached. We also find that increasing the magnetic field, further suppresses the crossover line. Using a first principles energy argument across the crossover line, we derive an equation that is an excellent fit to the crossover lines for all magnetic fields probed. The data show strong evidence for an H = 0 Oe phase transition.</description>

      <title>Phases of decodability in the surface code with unitary errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximum likelihood (ML) decoder in the two-dimensional surface code with generic unitary errors is governed by a statistical mechanics model with complex weights, which can be simulated via (1+1)D transfer matrix contraction. Information loss with an increasing error rate manifests as a ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic transition in the contraction dynamics. In this work, we establish entanglement as a separate obstruction to decoding; it can undergo a transition from area- to volume-law scaling in the transfer matrix contraction with increasing unitary error rate. In particular, the volume-law entanglement can coexist with ferromagnetic order, giving rise to a phase in which the encoded information is retained yet is effectively undecodable. We numerically simulate the ML decoding in the surface code subject to both single- and two-qubit Pauli-X rotations and obtain a phase diagram that contains a ferromagnetic area-law, a paramagnetic volume-law, and a potential ferromagnetic volume-law phase. We further show that, starting from the paramagnetic volume-law phase, tilting the single-qubit rotation away from the X-axis couples the stat-mech models for X and Z errors and can lead to a ferromagnetic volume-law phase in which, although Z errors remain correctable, the encoded classical information is hard to recover. To perform numerical simulations, we develop an algorithm for syndrome sampling based on the isometric tensor network representation of the surface code.</description>

      <title>Control of probability flow in Markov chain Monte Carlo -- Nonreversibility and lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0258</link>
      <description>arXiv:1207.0258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is widely used in various fields as a powerful numerical integration technique for systems with many degrees of freedom. In MCMC methods, probabilistic state transitions can be considered as a random walk in state space, and random walks allow for sampling from complex distributions. However, paradoxically, it is necessary to carefully suppress the randomness of the random walk to improve computational efficiency. By breaking detailed balance, we can create a probability flow in the state space and perform more efficient sampling along this flow. Motivated by this idea, practical and efficient nonreversible MCMC methods have been developed over the past ten years. In particular, the lifting technique, which introduces probability flows in an extended state space, has been applied to various systems and has proven more efficient than conventional reversible updates. We review and discuss several practical approaches to implementing nonreversible MCMC methods, including the shift method in the cumulative distribution and the directed-worm algorithm.</description>

      <title>Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in the synchronization of oscillator lattices with time-dependent noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systems of oscillators subject to time-dependent noise typically achieve synchronization for long times when their mutual coupling is sufficiently strong. The dynamical process whereby synchronization is reached can be thought of as a growth process in which an interface formed by the local phase field gradually roughens and eventually saturates. Such a process is here shown to display the generic scale invariance of the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, including a Tracy-Widom probability distribution for phase fluctuations around their mean. This is revealed by numerical explorations of a variety of oscillator systems: rings of generic phase oscillators and rings of paradigmatic limit-cycle oscillators, like Stuart-Landau and van der Pol. It also agrees with analytical expectations derived under conditions of strong mutual coupling. The nonequilibrium critical behavior that we find is robust and transcends the details of the oscillators considered. Hence, it may well be accessible to experimental ensembles of oscillators in the presence of e.g. thermal noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent fluctuations exhibit universal scaling laws that are independent of large-scale statistics. It is often explained that such universality is caused by the loss of information about large-scale statistics during the cascade process. In our previous study [T. Tanogami and R. Araki, Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013090 (2024)], we applied information thermodynamics to turbulence and proved that information of large-scale turbulent fluctuations is propagated to small scales. As a first step toward understanding how universality emerges at small scales under the influence of the information flow from large scales, here we investigate the scale locality of the information flow for the Sabra shell model. First, we analytically show that the information flow can be decomposed into scale-local and scale-nonlocal parts. Then, we prove that the scale-nonlocal part can be ignored compared to the scale-local part. This result implies that the information transfer from large to small scales occurs mainly through scale-local interactions, which is consistent with the scale locality of the energy cascade.</description>

Abstract: In three-dimensional turbulence, information of turbulent fluctuations at large scales is propagated to small scales. Here, we investigate the relation between the information flow and turbulent fluctuations described by a shell model. We first establish a connection between the information flow and phase-space contraction rate. From this relation, we then prove an inequality between the information flow and turbulent fluctuations, which suggests that the information flow from large to small scales amplifies turbulent fluctuations at small scales. This inequality can also be interpreted as a quantification of Landau's objection to the universality of turbulent fluctuations. We also discuss differences between the information flow and the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bipartite entanglement entropy is one of the most useful characterizations of universal properties in a many-body quantum system. Far from equilibrium, there exist two highly effective theories describing its dynamics -- the quasiparticle and membrane pictures. In this work we investigate entanglement dynamics, and these two complementary approaches, in a quantum circuit model perturbed by an impurity. In particular, we consider a dual unitary quantum circuit containing a spatially fixed, non-dual-unitary impurity gate, allowing for differing local Hilbert space dimensions to either side. We compute the entanglement entropy for both a semi-infinite and a finite subsystem within a finite distance of the impurity, comparing exact results to predictions of the effective theories. We find that for a semi-infinite subsystem, both theories agree with each other and the exact calculation. For a finite subsystem, however, both theories qualitatively differ, with the quasiparticle picture predicting a non-monotonic growth in contrast to the membrane picture. We show that such non-monotonic behavior can arise even in random chaotic circuits, pointing to a hitherto unknown shortcoming of the membrane picture in describing such systems.</description>

Abstract: The study of phase transitions in frustrated magnetic systems with $O(N)\times O(2)$ symmetry has been the subject of controversy for more than twenty years, with theoretical, numerical and experimental results in disagreement. Even theoretical studies lead to different results, with some predicting a first-order phase transition while others find it to be second-order. Recently, a series of results from both numerical simulations and theoretical analyses, in particular those based on the Conformal Bootstrap, have rekindled interest in this controversy, especially as they are still not in agreement with each other. Studies based on the functional renormalization group have played a major role in this controversy in the past, and we revisit these studies, taking them a step further by adding non-trivial second order derivative terms to the derivative expansion of the effective action. We confirm the first-order nature of the phase transition for physical values of $N$, i.e. for $N=2$ and $N=3$ in agreement with the latest results obtained with the Conformal Bootstrap. We also study an other phase of the $O(N)\times O(2)$ models, called the sinusoidal phase, qualitatively confirming earlier perturbative results.</description>

      <title>Long-range Correlations in a Data Sequence Extracted Via Polymeric Compaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.09693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A numerical method is proposed to remove the quenched randomness from a data sequence of numbers. A polymer chain of beads is introduced with both a hard core interaction and an appropriate energy associated with the data sequence. The quenched randomness is hypothesized to collapse the chain to a spherical globule. Long-range informational correlations then show up in deviations from the spherical shape. The resulting coefficients within an expansion in terms of spherical harmonics go beyond the usual concept of algorithmic information or Kolmogorov complexity.</description>

      <title>Operadic approach to Markov processes with boundaries on the square lattice in dimension 2 and larger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov processes are omnipresent in any dimension, especially in statistical mechanics; however their algebraic description is complete only in dimension 1 (which is often interpreted as "time"), for which linear algebra provides many tools complementary to the probabilistic approach: in particular, invariant measures are eigenvectors of the generator. In larger dimension, such algebraic tools are absent due to the more involved structure of boundaries. One of the consequences is the difficulty of the construction of infinite-volume Gibbs measures on the whole lattice for such Markov processes. Such constructions are usually handled in an analytical way, with the DLR approach, guesses of approximate boundary conditions and Riesz theorem. We introduce in the present document new operadic tools to describe in a fully algebraic way Markov processes in any dimension on the square lattice. The main consequence is a natural description of probabilistic boundary weights in terms of matrix product representations, for which we generalize the eigenvector property of 1D invariant measures. This approach leads to new algebraic objects, with a local-to-global perspective, that are suitable for the use of Kolmogorov's extension theorem. Moreover, finite size Markov processes on the square lattice can also be seen as a toy case of statistical Euclidean field theory: our algebraic tools are related to other categorical approaches to field theory, with the advantage of providing concrete computational tools.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in symmetric random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry, which serves as a diagnostic tool for symmetry breaking and a proxy for thermalization, has recently been proposed and studied in the context of symmetry restoration for quantum many-body systems undergoing a quench. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration in various symmetric random quantum circuits, particularly focusing on the U(1) symmetry case. In contrast to non-symmetric random circuits where the U(1) symmetry of a small subsystem can always be restored at late times, we reveal that symmetry restoration can fail in U(1)-symmetric circuits for certain weak symmetry-broken initial states in finite-size systems. In the early-time dynamics, we observe an intriguing quantum Mpemba effect implying that symmetry is restored faster when the initial state is more asymmetric. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement asymmetry dynamics for SU(2) and $Z_{2}$ symmetric circuits and identify the presence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect for the corresponding symmetries, respectively. A unified understanding of these results is provided through the lens of quantum thermalization with conserved charges.</description>

      <title>Cascade of phase transitions in the training of Energy-based models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the feature encoding process in a prototypical energy-based generative model, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). We start with an analytical investigation using simplified architectures and data structures, and end with numerical analysis of real trainings on real datasets. Our study tracks the evolution of the model's weight matrix through its singular value decomposition, revealing a series of phase transitions associated to a progressive learning of the principal modes of the empirical probability distribution. The model first learns the center of mass of the modes and then progressively resolve all modes through a cascade of phase transitions. We first describe this process analytically in a controlled setup that allows us to study analytically the training dynamics. We then validate our theoretical results by training the Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM on real data sets. By using data sets of increasing dimension, we show that learning indeed leads to sharp phase transitions in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we propose and test a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis. This shows that the first phase transition is in the same universality class of the one we studied analytically, and which is reminiscent of the mean-field paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition.</description>

      <title>Fast training and sampling of Restricted Boltzmann Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are effective tools for modeling complex systems and deriving insights from data. However, training these models with highly structured data presents significant challenges due to the slow mixing characteristics of Markov Chain Monte Carlo processes. In this study, we build upon recent theoretical advancements in RBM training, to significantly reduce the computational cost of training (in very clustered datasets), evaluating and sampling in RBMs in general. The learning process is analogous to thermodynamic continuous phase transitions observed in ferromagnetic models, where new modes in the probability measure emerge in a continuous manner. Such continuous transitions are associated with the critical slowdown effect, which adversely affects the accuracy of gradient estimates, particularly during the initial stages of training with clustered data. To mitigate this issue, we propose a pre-training phase that encodes the principal components into a low-rank RBM through a convex optimization process. This approach enables efficient static Monte Carlo sampling and accurate computation of the partition function. We exploit the continuous and smooth nature of the parameter annealing trajectory to achieve reliable and computationally efficient log-likelihood estimations, enabling online assessment during the training, and propose a novel sampling strategy named parallel trajectory tempering (PTT) which outperforms previously optimized MCMC methods. Our results show that this training strategy enables RBMs to effectively address highly structured datasets that conventional methods struggle with. We also provide evidence that our log-likelihood estimation is more accurate than traditional, more computationally intensive approaches in controlled scenarios. The PTT algorithm significantly accelerates MCMC processes compared to existing and conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We demonstrate that in the presence of quenched disorder, a broad class of materials exhibits spin-glass freezing at temperatures of order $T^*$, in accordance with experimental observations. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</description>

      <title>Studying the 3d Ising surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15914v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundaries not only are fundamental elements in nearly all realistic physical systems, but also greatly enrich the structure of quantum field theories. In this paper, we demonstrate that conformal field theory (CFT) with a boundary, known as surface CFT in three dimensions, can be studied with the setup of fuzzy sphere. We consider the example of surface criticality of the 3D Ising CFT. We propose two schemes by cutting a boundary in the orbital space or the real space to realise the ordinary and the normal surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere. We obtain the operator spectra through state-operator correspondence. We observe integer spacing of the conformal multiplets, and thus provide direct evidence of conformal symmetry. We identify the ordinary surface primary $o$, the displacement operator $\mathrm{D}$ and their conformal descendants and extract their scaling dimensions. We also study the one-point and two-point correlation functions and extract the bulk-to-surface OPE coefficients, some of which are reported for the first time. In addition, using the overlap of the bulk CFT state and the polarised state, we calculate the boundary central charges of the 3D Ising surface CFTs non-perturbatively. Other conformal data obtained in this way also agrees with prior methods.</description>

      <title>Failure of the large-N expansion in a Bosonic Tensor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the tensor model generalization of the quantum $p$-spherical model in the large-$N$ limit. While the tensor model has the same large-$N$ expansion as the disordered quantum $p$-spherical model, its ground state is superextensive, in contradiction with large-$N$ perturbation theory. Therefore, the large-$N$ expansion of this model catastrophically fails at arbitrarily large-$N$, without any obvious signal in perturbation theory.</description>
