      <title>First observations of the seiche that shook the world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On September 16th, 2023, an anomalous 10.88 mHz seismic signal was observed globally, persisting for 9 days. One month later an identical signal appeared, lasting for another week. Several studies have theorized that these signals were produced by seiches which formed after two landslide generated mega-tsunamis in an East-Greenland fjord. This theory is supported by seismic inversions, and analytical and numerical modeling, but no direct observations have been made -- until now. Using data from the new Surface Water Ocean Topography mission, we present the first observations of this phenomenon. By ruling out other oceanographic processes, we validate the seiche theory of previous authors and independently estimate its initial amplitude at 7.9 m using Bayesian machine learning and seismic data. This study demonstrates the value of satellite altimetry for studying extreme events, while also highlighting the need for specialized methods to address the altimetric data's limitations, namely temporal sparsity. These data and approaches will help in understanding future unseen extremes driven by climate change.</description>

      <title>Recursive Interferometric Surface-wave Suppression For Improved Reflection Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution seismic reflections are essential for imaging and monitoring applications. In seismic land surveys using sources and receivers at the surface, surface waves often dominate, masking the reflections. In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of a two-step procedure to suppress surface waves in an active-source reflection seismic dataset. First, we apply seismic interferometry (SI) by cross-correlation, turning receivers into virtual sources to estimate the dominant surface waves. Then, we perform adaptive subtraction to minimise the difference between the surface waves in the original data and the result of SI. We propose a new approach where the initial suppression results are used for further iterations, followed by adaptive subtraction. This technique aims to enhance the efficacy of data-driven surface-wave suppression through an iterative process. We use a 2D seismic reflection dataset from Scheemda, situated in the Groningen province of the Netherlands, to illustrate the technique's efficiency. A comparison between the data after recursive interferometric surface-wave suppression and the original data across time and frequency-wavenumber domains shows significant suppression of the surface waves, enhancing visualization of the reflections for following subsurface imaging and monitoring studies.</description>

      <title>Towards more efficient agricultural practices via transformer-based crop type classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has great potential to increase crop production and resilience to climate change. Accurate maps of where crops are grown are a key input to a number of downstream policy and research applications. In this proposal, we present preliminary work showing that it is possible to accurately classify crops from time series derived from Sentinel 1 and 2 satellite imagery in Mexico using a pixel-based binary crop/non-crop time series transformer model. We also find preliminary evidence that meta-learning approaches supplemented with data from similar agro-ecological zones may improve model performance. Due to these promising results, we propose further development of this method with the goal of accurate multi-class crop classification in Jalisco, Mexico via meta-learning with a dataset comprising similar agro-ecological zones.</description>

      <title>A Norwegian Approach to Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive geoscientific downscaling model strategy is presented outlining an approach that has evolved over the last 20 years, together with an explanation for its development, its technical aspects, and evaluation scheme. This effort has resulted in an open-source and free R-based tool, 'esd', for the benefit of sharing and improving the reproducibility of the downscaling results. Furthermore, a set of new metrics was developed as an integral part of the downscaling approach which assesses model performance with an emphasis on regional information for society (RifS). These metrics involve novel ways of comparing model results with observational data and have been developed for downscaling large multi-model global climate model ensembles. This paper presents for the first time an overview of the comprehensive framework adopted by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute for downscaling aimed at supporting climate change adaptation. A literature search suggests that this comprehensive downscaling strategy and evaluation scheme are not widely used within the downscaling community. In addition, this strategy involves a new convention for storing large datasets of ensemble results that provides fast access to information and drastically saves data volume.</description>

      <title>Towards Monte Carlo based Full Spectrum Modeling of Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This monograph presents advancements in Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS), a critical tool for emergency response to radiological incidents such as severe nuclear accidents or nuclear weapon detonations. Current AGRS calibration and data evaluation methods struggle to accurately quantify many radioactive materials expected in radiological emergencies, limiting the risk assessment and, hence, the effectiveness of emergency response actions. To address these limitations, this work introduces a full spectrum numerical modeling approach that features three key innovations: high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations that combine an advanced scintillation physics model with detailed geometric representations of the aircraft and detector system; a surrogate model that replicates the Monte Carlo simulations with significantly reduced computation time; and a data evaluation methodology that leverages the surrogate model within a Bayesian inversion framework, enabling the quantification of arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. The methodology presented here, rigorously validated through laboratory and field measurements, achieves not only a significant improvement in accuracy and sensitivity over traditional methods but also substantially expands the operational capabilities of AGRS systems for both emergency response scenarios and geophysical surveys. These innovations lay the groundwork for establishing a new global standard for AGRS, ultimately supporting better-informed protective actions and reducing health risks during radiological emergencies.</description>

      <title>DeFault: Deep-learning-based Fault Delineation Using the IBDP Passive Seismic Data at the Decatur CO2 Storage Site</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) framework is an essential component in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with its success hinging on the comprehensive knowledge of subsurface geology and geomechanics. Passive seismic event relocation and fault detection serve as indispensable tools, offering vital insights into subsurface structures and fluid migration pathways. Accurate identification and localization of seismic events, however, face significant challenges, including the necessity for high-quality seismic data and advanced computational methods. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel deep learning method, DeFault, specifically designed for passive seismic source relocation and fault delineating for passive seismic monitoring projects. By leveraging data domain-adaptation, DeFault allows us to train a neural network with labeled synthetic data and apply it directly to field data. Using DeFault, the passive seismic sources are automatically clustered based on their recording time and spatial locations, and subsequently, faults and fractures are delineated accordingly. We demonstrate the efficacy of DeFault on a field case study involving CO2 injection related microseismic data from the Decatur, Illinois area. Our approach accurately and efficiently relocated passive seismic events, identified faults and aided in the prevention of potential geological hazards. Our results highlight the potential of DeFault as a valuable tool for passive seismic monitoring, emphasizing its role in ensuring CCUS project safety. This research bolsters the understanding of subsurface characterization in CCUS, illustrating machine learning's capacity to refine these methods. Ultimately, our work bear significant implications for CCUS technology deployment, an essential strategy in combating climate change.</description>
