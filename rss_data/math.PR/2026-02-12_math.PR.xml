      <title>The delocalization of eigenvectors of real elliptic matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate delocalization phenomena for eigenvectors of real random matrices that are invariant by orthogonal transformations. A specific phenomenon with these ensembles is that an eigenvector is typically more localized when its eigenvalue is closer to the real axis while for unitarily invariant ensembles, all eigenvectors are delocalized at the same level. More precisely, we measure the delocalization level of a vector $x\in \mathbb{C}^N$ using the Inverse Participation Ratio $\mathrm{IPR}(x) = N|x|_4^4 / |x|_2^4 \geqslant 1$. A higher IPR means a more localized vector. Using the exact distribution of the Schur decomposition of some paradigmatic rotation-invariant matrix models, we prove that conditionally on having an eigenvalue $\lambda$ with $|\mathfrak{Im}(\lambda)| = y / \sqrt{N}$, the IPR of the associated eigenvector converges in distribution towards a random variable $\ell_y$ with an explicit density depending only on $y$. We then prove that $\ell_y \to 3$ when $y \to 0$ and $\ell_y \to 2$ when $y\to +\infty$, coherently with the observed phenomenon.
  This result is explicitly proved for higher-order IPRs and for the real Elliptic Ginibre ensemble at every non-symmetry parameter $\tau \in [0,1[$, including the classical real Ginibre ensemble ($\tau=0$).</description>

      <title>Heat kernel for reflected jump diffusion on Ahlfors regular domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study reflected jump diffusions on Ahlfors regular domains in general metric measure spaces. Under the condition that the Dirichlet form on the ambient space satisfies a capacity upper bound estimate, we construct an extension operator from the reflected Dirichlet space to the ambient Dirichlet space, with a scale-invariant local bound. Second, we establish the mixed stable-like heat kernel estimates for the reflected jump diffusion, assuming that the process on the ambient space satisfies the same type of heat kernel estimates.</description>

      <title>Queues with Rechargeable Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drone delivery systems violate a core assumption in classical queueing models: server capacity is not fixed. Drones (servers) periodically must recharge, creating random fluctuations in service availability. We introduce an Erlang--S$^{*}$ queue that incorporates charging dynamics (probability of charging after service completion $p$ and charging return rate $\gamma$) together with abandonment. We derive fluid and diffusion limits, yielding closed-form steady-state means, variances, and covariances for the joint queue--server process $(Q,S)$. The diffusion limits allow us to derive new staffing rules for the probability of delay and the probability of abandonment targets. A key insight is that server stochasticity induces systematic capacity loss relative to fixed--server systems, leading to a regime--dependent staffing adjustment: additive shifts in underloaded regimes and multiplicative scaling in overloaded regimes. Our simulation experiments confirm both the accuracy of the limit theorems and the performance of the staffing schedule's ability to achieve their targets.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic derivatives for SDEs and SPDEs with distribution dependent noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bismut formula is a crucial tool characterizing regularities of stochastic systems, and has been extensively studied for various models. However it is not yet available for SDEs with distribution dependent noise. In this paper, we first establish a Bismut type formula for the extrinsic derivative of McKean-Vlasov SDEs driven by distribution dependent noise, then make an extension to a class of distribution dependent SPDEs.</description>

      <title>Exact determinant formulas for coalescing particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When particles on a line collide, they may coalesce into one. Such systems model diverse phenomena, from voter dynamics and opinion formation to ancestral lineages in population genetics. Computing exact coalescence probabilities has been difficult because collisions reduce the particle count, while classical determinantal methods require a fixed count throughout. We introduce ghost particles: when two particles merge, the discarded trajectory continues as an invisible walker. Ghosts restore the missing dimension, enabling an exact determinantal formula. We prove that the probability of any specified coalescence pattern is given by a determinant. Integrating out ghost positions yields a closed-form ghost-free formula for the surviving particles. The framework applies to discrete lattice paths, birth-death chains, and continuous diffusions including Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Random chain complexes of real vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a natural class of models of random chain complexes of real vector spaces that some classical ensembles of random matrices, the length $1$ case. We are interested here in the homological properties of these random complexes. For chain complexes of length $1$ or $2$, we characterize the Betti numbers almost surely, in terms of the dimensions of the vector spaces. We further examine complexes of length $3$ with some constraints on dimensions, as well as complexes of arbitrary finite length in which all vector spaces have equal dimension. Across all these settings, we show that the sum of the Betti numbers is almost surely as small as possible, attaining a trivial lower bound $|\chi|$ dictated by the dimensions of the underlying vector spaces and the Euler formula. These results suggest an underlying algebraic heuristic for a phenomenon frequently observed in stochastic topology, that nontrivial homology rarely appears unless forced to.</description>

      <title>Regularities for McKean-Vlasov SDEs with Local Distributional Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ \tilde W^{-\delta,k}$ be the local negative Sobolev space on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with indexes $\delta \in [0,\infty)$ and $k\in [1,\infty].$ We study McKean-Vlasov SDEs with interaction kernels in $\tilde W^{-\delta,k}.$ By developing a time-shift argument which allows the singular interactions vanishing at time $0$, the global well-posedness is proved for regular enough initial distributions and any singular indexes $(\delta,k)\in [0,\infty)\times [1,\infty],$ and for any initial distributions provided $\delta+\frac{d}{k} &lt; 1$. Moreover, the relative entropy and the $\|\cdot\|_{\delta,k*}$-distance induced by $\tilde W^{-\delta,k}$ are estimated for the time-marginal distributions of solutions by using the Wasserstein distance of initial distributions, which describe the regularity of the solution in initial distribution. In particular, the main results apply to Nemytskii-type SDEs which point-wisely depend on the density function and its derivatives, as well as McKean-Vlasov SDEs with interactions more singular than Riesz kernels.</description>

      <title>Factorised stationary states for a long range misanthrope process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The misanthrope process is an interacting particle system where particles move between neighbouring sites with hop rates depending only on the number of particles at the departure and arrival sites. Motivated by a discretised version of the Hammersley--Aldous--Diaconis process, we introduce a partially asymmetric long range misanthrope process (PALRMP) on a finite one-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions where particles can move between sites that are not necessarily neighbours, as long as there are no particles in between the departure and arrival sites. In this model, each site $\ell$ has an inhomogeneous rate parameter $x_\ell$ associated to it, and the hop rate of a particle moving from site $k$ to site $\ell$ depends upon the parameter associated to the target site $x_\ell$, the direction the particle moves, and the number of particles at sites $k$ and $\ell$. We also consider the homogeneous PALRMP, where all the $x_\ell$'s are 1. We find necessary and sufficient conditions on the hop rates under which the stationary distribution is of factorised form for both the PALRMP and the homogeneous PALRMP, as well as the extreme variants, namely the ones where the particle motion is totally asymmetric (TALRMP) and symmetric (SLRMP). As an illustrative example, we study in detail the discrete Hammersley--Aldous--Diaconis process.</description>

      <title>Expected area of the star hull of planar Brownian motion and bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the star hull of planar Brownian motion and bridge. Roughly speaking, this is the smallest starshaped set (with respect to the origin) that contains the trace of the path. In particular, we prove that the expected areas of the star hulls are $\frac{3\pi}{8}$ and $\frac{\pi}{4}$ for planar Brownian motion and bridge, respectively. Our proofs rely on a detailed analysis of the first hitting time and place of a horizontal ray $\mathcal{R}_\rho : = [\rho,\infty)\times\{0\}$ by planar Brownian motion starting at the origin. After deriving a remarkably simple Laplace transform of this joint law, we uncover via a probabilistic argument a surprising conditional structure: conditionally on the first hitting place being the point $(x,0)\in \mathcal{R}_\rho$, the hitting time is distributed as the first passage time to the level $x$ of one-dimensional Brownian motion starting at $0$.</description>

      <title>Fake stationary rough Heston volatility: Microstructure-inspired foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of suitably time-modulated Hawkes processes with heavy-tailed kernels in a nearly unstable regime. We show that, under appropriate scaling, both the intensity processes and the rescaled Hawkes processes converge to a mean-reverting, time-inhomogeneous rough fractional square-root process and its integrated counterpart, respectively. In particular, when the original Hawkes process has a stationary first moment (constant marginal mean), the limiting process takes the form of a time-inhomogeneous rough fractional Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) equation with a constant mean-reversion parameter and a time-dependent diffusion coefficient. This class of equations is particularly appealing from a practical perspective, especially for the so-called $\textit{fake stationary rough Heston}$ model. We further investigate the properties of such limiting scaled time-inhomogeneous Volterra equations, including moment bounds, path regularity and maximal inequality in the $L^p$ setting for every $p&gt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the complexity of the Hamiltonian in the pure $p$-spin spin glass model accompanied with a polynomial-type potential on $\mathbb{R}^N$. In this Hamiltonian, the Gaussian field is anisotropic, and the potential lacks rotational invariance. Our main result derives the logarithmic limit for the expected number of critical points in terms of a variational formula. As a consequence, by identifying the critical location of the phase transition from our representation, we provide an upper bound for the ground state energy of the model.</description>

      <title>How fast does the range of simple random walk grow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a discrete-time simple random walk $(X_t)_{t\ge 0}$ on an infinite, connected, locally finite graph $G$. Let $R_t := |\{X_0,\dots,X_t\}|$ denote its range at time $t$, and $T_n:=\inf\{t\ge 0: R_t\ge n\}$ the $n-$th discovery time. We establish a general estimate on $\mathbb E[T_n]$ in terms of two coarse geometric parameters of $G$, and deduce the universal bounds $\mathbb E[T_n]\le 4n^3\log n$ and $\mathbb E[R_t]\gtrsim (t/\log t)^{1/3}$. Moreover, we show that this is essentially sharp by constructing a multi-scale version of Feige's Lollipop graph satisfying $\mathbb E[T_n]\gtrsim n^{3}$ for all dyadic integers $n$. In light of this example, we ask whether the existence of \emph{trapping phases} where the range grows sub-diffusively necessarily implies the existence of \emph{expanding phases} where it grows super-diffusively. Finally, we provide a simple \emph{uniform transience} condition under which the expected range grows linearly, and conjecture that all vertex-nonamenable graphs exhibit linear range.</description>

      <title>First-order phase transition for Gibbs point processes with saturated interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study first-order phase transitions in continuum Gibbs point processes with saturated interactions. These interactions form a broad class of Hamiltonians in which the local energy in regions of high particle density depends only on the number of points. Building on ideas of Pirogov-Sinai-Zahradnik theory and its adaptations to the continuum, we develop a general method for establishing the existence of two distinct infinite-volume Gibbs measures with different intensities in this setting, demonstrating a first-order phase transition. Our approach extends previous results obtained for the Quermass model and applies in particular to a new class of diluted pairwise interactions introduced in this work.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Thresholds for Bipartite Latent-Space Graphs Under Noisy Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study information-theoretic phase transitions for the detectability of latent geometry in bipartite random geometric graphs RGGs with Gaussian d-dimensional latent vectors while only a subset of edges carries latent information determined by a random mask with i.i.d. Bern(q) entries. For any fixed edge density p in (0,1) we determine essentially tight thresholds for this problem as a function of d and q. Our results show that the detection problem is substantially easier if the mask is known upfront compared to the case where the mask is hidden.
  Our analysis is built upon a novel Fourier-analytic framework for bounding signed subgraph counts in Gaussian random geometric graphs that exploits cancellations which arise after approximating characteristic functions by an appropriate power series. The resulting bounds are applicable to much larger subgraphs than considered in previous work which enables tight information-theoretic bounds, while the bounds considered in previous works only lead to lower bounds from the lens of low-degree polynomials. As a consequence we identify the optimal information-theoretic thresholds and rule out computational-statistical gaps. Our bounds further improve upon the bounds on Fourier coefficients of random geometric graphs recently given by Bangachev and Bresler [STOC'24] in the dense, bipartite case. The techniques also extend to sparser and non-bipartite settings, at least if the considered subgraphs are sufficiently small. We furhter believe that they might help resolve open questions for related detection problems.</description>

      <title>Permanents of matrix ensembles: computation, distribution, and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a computational and experimental study of permanents. On the computational side, we use the GPU to greaatly accelerate the computation of permanents over $\mathbb{C},$ $\mathbb{R},$ $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{Q}.$ In particular, we use this to compute the permanents of DFT and Schur matrices far beyond the ranges hitherto known. On the experimental side, we present two new observations. First, for Haar-distributed unitary matrices~$U$, the permanent $\perm(U)$ follows a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma^2)$ -- we confirm this via a number of tests for $n$ up to~23 with $50{,}000$ samples. The DFT matrix permanent is an extreme outlier for every prime $n\ge 7$. In contrast, for Haar-random \emph{orthogonal} matrices~$O$, the permanent $\perm(O)$ is approximately real Gaussian but with positive excess kurtosis that decays as~$O(1/n)$, indicating slower convergence. For matrices with Gaussian entries (GUE, GOE, Ginibre), the permanent follows an $\alpha$-stable distribution with stability index $\alpha\approx 1.0$--$1.4$, well below the Gaussian value $\alpha=2$.
  Secondly, we study the permanent along geodesics on the unitary group. For the geodesic from the identity to the $n$-cycle permutation matrix, we find a universal scaling function $f(t)=\frac{1}{n}\ln|\perm(\gamma(t))|$ that is independent of~$n$ in the large-$n$ limit, with a midpoint value \[
  \perm(\gamma({\textstyle\frac12}))
  = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\cdot 2e^{-n}\bigl(1+\tfrac{1}{3n}+O(n^{-2})\bigr) \] for odd~$n$ and zero for even~$n$. For the geodesic to the DFT matrix, the permanent recovers $10$--$40$ times above its valley minimum when $n$ is prime, but not when $n$ is composite -- a geodesic fingerprint of primality.</description>

      <title>Convolution comparison measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a precise functional comparison between classical and free convolutions. If $\mu$ and $\nu$ are compactly supported probability measures, we show that the expectation of $f$ over the classical convolution $\mu * \nu$ is at least the expectation of $f$ over the free convolution $\mu \boxplus \nu$, as long as the fourth derivative of $f$ is non-negative. Conversely, the non-negativity of the fourth derivative is necessary for such a comparison.
  This comparison is based on the positivity of a related measure on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, which we dub the convolution comparison measure. We give an expression for this measure using a curious identity involving Hermitian matrices.</description>

      <title>Almost Sure Convergence of Nonlinear Stochastic Approximation: An Interplay of Noise and Step Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the almost sure convergence of the Stochastic Approximation algorithm to the fixed point $x^\star$ of a nonlinear operator under a negative drift condition and a general noise sequence with finite $p$-th moment for some $p &gt; 1$. Classical almost sure convergence results of Stochastic Approximation are mostly analyzed for the square-integrable noise setting, and it is shown that any non-summable but square-summable step size sequence is sufficient to obtain almost sure convergence. However, such a limitation prevents wider algorithmic application. In particular, many applications in Machine Learning and Operations Research admit heavy-tailed noise with infinite variance, rendering such guarantees inapplicable. On the other hand, when a stronger condition on the noise is available, such guarantees on the step size would be too conservative, as practitioners would like to pick a larger step size for a more preferable convergence behavior. To this end, we show that any non-summable but $p$-th power summable step size sequence is sufficient to guarantee almost sure convergence, covering the gap in the literature.
  Our guarantees are obtained using a universal Lyapunov drift argument. For the regime $p \in (1, 2)$, we show that using the Lyapunov function $\norm{x-x^\star}^p$ and applying a Taylor-like bound suffice. For $p &gt; 2$, such an approach is no longer applicable, and therefore, we introduce a novel iterate projection technique to control the nonlinear terms produced by high-moment bounds and multiplicative noise. We believe our proof techniques and their implications could be of independent interest and pave the way for finite-time analysis of Stochastic Approximation under a general noise condition.</description>

      <title>An improved lower bound on the Banach--Mazur distance to the cross-polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be an $n\times m$ matrix with independent standard Gaussian entries and let $G_m = \Gamma(B_1^m)$ be the associated Gaussian Gluskin polytope (equivalently, a random $n$-dimensional quotient of $\ell_1^m$). In the regime $m = n^3$ we prove that, with probability at least $1-2/n$, $$ d_{\mathrm{BM}}(G_m,B_1^n) \ge c n^{4/7}(\log n)^{-C}, $$ where $B_1^n = \conv\{\pm e_1,\dots,\pm e_n\}$ is the cross-polytope. This improves the previously best-known exponent $5/9$ (up to logarithmic factors) for this Gaussian model; in particular, the same lower bound holds for $\sup_{K} d_{\mathrm{BM}}(K,B_1^n)$.
  The main new ingredient is a conditioning-compatible treatment of the regime of ``many small-coefficients''. After passing to a suitable Gaussian quotient, we apply a Maurey-type sparsification that reduces the relevant entropy (in effect shrinking the support size from $k$ to $k/\log(n\rho)$) at the cost of a Euclidean thickening. We control this enlargement via a Gaussian measure bound stable under Euclidean thickening. In the complementary regime of ``few small-coefficients'', we give a streamlined argument avoiding the global tilting step in earlier work. Together these ingredients rebalance entropy and small-ball estimates and yield the exponent $4/7$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Initialization in Depth: Lyapunov Initialization and Limit Theorems for Deep Leaky ReLU Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of effective initialization methods requires an understanding of random neural networks. In this work, a rigorous probabilistic analysis of deep unbiased Leaky ReLU networks is provided. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the logarithm of the norm of network activations, establishing that, as the number of layers increases, their growth is governed by a parameter called the Lyapunov exponent. This parameter characterizes a sharp phase transition between vanishing and exploding activations, and we calculate the Lyapunov exponent explicitly for Gaussian or orthogonal weight matrices. Our results reveal that standard methods, such as He initialization or orthogonal initialization, do not guarantee activation stabilty for deep networks of low width. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose a novel initialization method, referred to as Lyapunov initialization, which sets the Lyapunov exponent to zero and thereby ensures that the neural network is as stable as possible, leading empirically to improved learning.</description>

      <title>Note on the trace of random walks on pseudorandom graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the graph-theoretic properties of the trace of random walks on pseudorandom graphs. We show that for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists a constant $C$ such that the cover time of an $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph $G$ with $d/\lambda\ge C$ is at most $(1+\varepsilon)n\log n$, meaning the expected number of steps needed to reach all vertices at least once is at most $(1+\varepsilon)n\log n$ regardless of the starting vertex. Furthermore, we prove that with high probability, the trace of a random walk of length $(1+\varepsilon)n\log n$ on $G$ is Hamiltonian, regardless of the starting vertex. These results also hold for random $d$-regular graphs with sufficiently large $d$. These findings answer two questions proposed by Frieze, Krivelevich, Michaeli, and Peled [PLMS, 2018]. Notably, our results imply a bound on a stronger version of the cover time: with high probability, all vertices are covered after $(1+\varepsilon)n\log n$ steps, regardless of the starting vertex. Our proofs rely on the spectral properties of the adjacency matrix and the graph expansion. All results are asymptotically optimal.</description>

      <title>Variational Optimality of F\"ollmer Processes in Generative Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and analyze generative diffusions that transport a point mass to a prescribed target distribution over a finite time horizon using the stochastic interpolant framework. The drift is expressed as a conditional expectation that can be estimated from independent samples without simulating stochastic processes. We show that the diffusion coefficient can be tuned \emph{a~posteriori} without changing the time-marginal distributions. Among all such tunings, we prove that minimizing the impact of estimation error on the path-space Kullback--Leibler divergence selects, in closed form, a F\"ollmer process -- a diffusion whose path measure minimizes relative entropy with respect to a reference process determined by the interpolation schedules alone. This yields a new variational characterization of F\"ollmer processes, complementing classical formulations via Schr\"odinger bridges and stochastic control. We further establish that, under this optimal diffusion coefficient, the path-space Kullback--Leibler divergence becomes independent of the interpolation schedule, rendering different schedules statistically equivalent in this variational sense.</description>

      <title>Cutoff Sobolev inequalities for local and non-local $p$-energies on metric measure spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $p&gt;1$, we study subordination phenomena for local and non-local regular $p$-energies on metric measure spaces. Under suitable geometric assumptions, we show that if a local regular $p$-energy satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality together with a cutoff Sobolev inequality with scaling function $\Psi$, then all associated stable-like non-local $p$-energies with scaling functions strictly below $\Psi$ are regular and satisfy the corresponding non-local cutoff Sobolev inequalities. Moreover, if a stable-like non-local regular $p$-energy with scaling function $\Psi$ satisfies the corresponding non-local cutoff Sobolev inequality, then the same conclusion holds for all associated stable-like non-local $p$-energies with scaling functions below $\Psi$. These results provide a non-linear extension of the classical subordination principle beyond the Dirichlet form framework.</description>

      <title>Drift-Randomized Milstein-Galerkin Finite Element Method for Semilinear Stochastic Evolution Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kruse and Wu [Math. Comp. 88 (2019) 2793--2825] proposed a fully discrete randomized Galerkin finite element method for semilinear stochastic evolution equations (SEEs) driven by additive noise and showed that this method attains a temporal strong convergence rate exceeding order $\frac{1}{2}$ without imposing any differentiability assumptions on the drift nonlinearity. They further discussed a potential extension of the randomized method to SEEs with multiplicative noise and introduced the so-called drift-randomized Milstein-Galerkin finite element fully discrete scheme, but without providing a corresponding strong convergence analysis.
  This paper aims to fill this gap by rigorously analyzing the strong convergence behavior of the drift-randomized Milstein-Galerkin finite element scheme. By avoiding the use of differentiability assumptions on the nonlinear drift term, we establish strong convergence rates in both space and time for the proposed method. The obtained temporal convergence rate is $O(\Delta t^{1-\varepsilon_0})$, where $\Delta t$ denotes the time step size and $\varepsilon_0$ is an arbitrarily small positive number. Numerical experiments are reported to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00651v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov categories have recently turned out to be a powerful high-level framework for probability and statistics. They accommodate purely categorical definitions of notions like conditional probability and almost sure equality, as well as proofs of fundamental results such as the Hewitt--Savage 0/1 Law, the de Finetti Theorem and the Ergodic Decomposition Theorem.
  In this work, we develop additional relevant notions from probability theory in the setting of Markov categories. This comprises improved versions of previously introduced definitions of absolute continuity and supports, as well as a detailed study of idempotents and idempotent splitting in Markov categories. Our main result on idempotent splitting is that every idempotent measurable Markov kernel between standard Borel spaces splits through another standard Borel space, and we derive this as an instance of a general categorical criterion for idempotent splitting in Markov categories.</description>

Abstract: Since the celebrated paper by El Karoui, Peng and Quenez [Mathematical Finance, 7 (1997), 1--71], backward stochastic differential equations have found wide applications in stochastic control, financial technology and machine learning. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theory on the existence and uniqueness of adapted solutions to a one-dimensional nonlinear backward stochastic differential equation (1D BSDE for short), and assume that the generator $g$ has a unilateral linear or super-linear growth in the first unknown variable $y$, and has an at most quadratic growth in the second unknown variable $z$. We develop a unified methodology, featured by the test function method and the a priori estimate technique, to establish several existence theorems and comparison theorems, which immediately yield corresponding existence and uniqueness results. We also overview relevant known results and give some practical applications of our theoretical results. Finally, we list some open problems on the well-posedness of 1D BSDEs.</description>

Abstract: We investigate for which Gaussian processes there do or do not exist reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that contain almost all of their paths. In particular, we establish a new result that makes it possible to exclude the existence of such RKHSs in many cases. Moreover, we combine this negative result with some known techniques to establish positive results. Here it turns out that for many classical families of Gaussian processes we can fully characterize for which members of these families there exist RKHSs containing the paths. Similar characterizations are obtained for Gaussian processes, for which the RKHSs of their covariance functions are Sobolev spaces or Sobolev spaces of mixed smoothness.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Functional Central Limit Theorems for Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17070v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-time-scale stochastic approximation (SA), two iterates are updated at different rates, governed by distinct step sizes, with each update influencing the other. Previous studies have demonstrated that the convergence rates of the error terms for these updates depend solely on their respective step sizes, a property known as decoupled convergence. However, a functional version of this decoupled convergence has not been explored. Our work fills this gap by establishing decoupled functional central limit theorems for two-time-scale SA, offering a more precise characterization of its asymptotic behavior. Our results show that, on each time scale, the limiting dynamics has the same form as in standard SA, and the coupling between the two iterates enters the limit only through the associated coefficients. To achieve these results, we leverage the martingale problem approach and establish tightness as a crucial intermediate step. Furthermore, to address the interdependence between different time scales, we introduce an innovative auxiliary sequence to eliminate the primary influence of the fast-time-scale update on the slow-time-scale update.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subcritical population processes are attracted to extinction and do not have non-trivial stationary distributions, which prompts the study of quasi-stationary distributions (QSDs) instead. In contrast to what generally happens for stationary distributions, QSDs may not be unique, even under irreducibility conditions. The general conditions for uniqueness of QSDs are not always easy to check. For the branching process, besides the quasi-limiting distribution there are many other QSDs. In this paper, we investigate whether adding little extra information to the continuous-time branching process is enough to obtain uniqueness. We consider the branching process with genealogy and branching random walks, and show that they have a unique QSD.</description>

      <title>Particle Systems and McKean--Vlasov Dynamics with Singular Interaction through Local Times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a system of reflected Brownian motions on the positive half-line in which each particle has a drift toward the origin determined by the local times at the origin of all the particles. If this local time drift is too strong, such systems exhibit a breakdown in their solutions in that there is a time beyond which the system cannot be extended. In the finite particle case we give a complete characterisation of this finite time breakdown, relying on a novel dynamic graph structure. We consider the mean-field limit of the system in the symmetric setting, which admits a McKean--Vlasov representation, and establish propagation of chaos. In the absence of breakdowns, the McKean--Vlasov equation exhibits multiple stationary and unique self-similar solutions and we prove convergence to these profiles.

      <title>Convergence Rate of the Join-the-Shortest-Queue System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15736v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) policy is among the most widely used load balancing algorithms and has been extensively studied. However, an exact characterization of the system behavior remains challenging. Most prior research has focused on analyzing its performance in the steady state in certain asymptotic regimes, such as the heavy-traffic regime. However, the convergence rate to the steady state in these regimes is often slow, so steady-state and heavy-traffic characterizations may be less informative over practical time horizons. To address this limitation, we provide a finite-time convergence rate analysis of a JSQ system with two symmetric servers. In sharp contrast to the existing literature, we directly study the original system rather than an approximate limiting system such as a diffusion approximation. Our results demonstrate that for such a system, the convergence rate to its steady state, measured in the total variation distance, is $O \left(\frac{1}{(1-\rho)^3} \frac{1}{t} \right)$, where $\rho \in (0,1)$ is the traffic intensity.</description>

      <title>Measure Theory of Conditionally Independent Random Function Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In sequential design strategies, common in geostatistics and Bayesian optimization, the selection of a new observation point $X_{n+1}$ of a random function $\mathbf f$ is informed by past data, captured by the filtration $\mathcal F_n=\sigma(\mathbf f(X_0),\dots,\mathbf f(X_n))$. The random nature of $X_{n+1}$ introduces measure-theoretic subtleties in deriving the conditional distribution $\mathbb P(\mathbf f(X_{n+1})\in A \mid \mathcal F_n)$. Practitioners often resort to a heuristic: treating $X_0,\dots, X_{n+1}$ as fixed parameters within the conditional probability calculation. This paper investigates the mathematical validity of this widespread practice. We construct a counterexample to prove that this approach is, in general, incorrect. We also establish our central positive result: for continuous Gaussian random functions and their canonical conditional distribution, the heuristic is sound. This provides a rigorous justification for a foundational technique in Bayesian optimization and spatial statistics. We further extend our analysis to include settings with noisy evaluations and to cases where $X_{n+1}$ is not adapted to $\mathcal F_n$ but is conditionally independent of $\mathbf f$ given the filtration.</description>

      <title>The strong convergence phenomenon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a seminal 2005 paper, Haagerup and Thorbj{\o}rnsen discovered that the norm of any noncommutative polynomial of independent complex Gaussian random matrices converges to that of a limiting family of operators that arises from Voiculescu's free probability theory. In recent years, new methods have made it possible to establish such strong convergence properties in much more general situations, and to obtain even more powerful quantitative forms of the strong convergence phenomenon. These, in turn, have led to a number of spectacular applications to long-standing open problems on random graphs, hyperbolic surfaces, and operator algebras, and have provided flexible new tools that enable the study of random matrices in unexpected generality. This survey aims to provide an introduction to this circle of ideas.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Busemann process indexed by tilts in the super-differential of the limit shape exists and is unique in the strong sense in the i.i.d.\ planar corner growth model. This means that every probability space that supports the field of i.i.d.~weights supports a copy of the process and any two realizations of the process are equal almost surely.</description>

      <title>Scaling limits of critical FK-decorated random planar maps with $q=4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the first scaling limit for FK($q$)-weighted planar maps in the critical case $q=4$, resolving a problem that has remained open since Sheffield's seminal work arXiv:1108.2241. In that work, Sheffield proved a scaling limit for $q&lt;4$ via the celebrated hamburger-cheeseburger bijection, which initiated the peanosphere (mating-of-trees) approach to Liouville quantum gravity. We prove that, at criticality, the associated burger count $\mathcal{S}$ and discrepancy $\mathcal{D}$ satisfy \[ \left(\frac{\mathcal{S}_{\lfloor nt \rfloor}}{\sqrt{n}}, \frac{\log(n)}{{2\pi }\sqrt{n}} \mathcal{D}_{\lfloor nt \rfloor}\right)_{t\in\mathbb{R}} \stackrel{\text{d}}{\longrightarrow} (B^1_t, B^2_{t})_{t\in\mathbb{R}}, \] where $B^1$ and $B^2$ are independent two-sided Brownian motions. To the best of our knowledge, no conjecture for the correct discrepancy scaling factor had previously been formulated. Matching the limiting process with the critical mating of trees arXiv:2109.00275, we establish the first rigorous planar map convergence towards CLE$_4$ and critical ($\gamma=2$) Liouville quantum gravity, in the peanosphere sense. Our proof is based on a novel approach that reveals the exactly solvable nature of the model through a correspondence with the (bicoloured) fully packed loop-$O(2)$ model on triangulations, and yields critical geometric exponents matching the predictions of conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Limiting Behavior of Randomly Perturbed Diffusions with Invariant Repelling Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study small perturbations of diffusion processes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that leave invariant a finite collection of hypersurfaces. Each surface is assumed to be repelling for the unperturbed process, and the unperturbed motion on each of the surfaces is assumed to be ergodic. These surfaces separate the space into a finite number of domains, each of which carries an invariant measure of the unperturbed process. We describe the asymptotics of the densities of the invariant measures near the invariant surfaces. We then describe the asymptotic behavior of the perturbed process: at different time scales (depending on the size of the perturbation), metastable distributions are described in terms of linear combinations of the ergodic invariant measures of the unperturbed system. The coefficients in the linear combination depend on the time scale but are shown not to depend on the perturbation.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Gibbs measure for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the one-dimensional torus $\mathbb T$, that was introduced in a seminal paper by Lebowitz, Rose and Speer (1988). We show that in the large torus limit, the measure exhibits a phase transition, depending on the size of the nonlinearity. This phase transition was originally conjectured on the basis of numerical simulation by Lebowitz, Rose and Speer (1988). Its existence is however striking in view of a series of negative results by McKean (1995) and Rider (2002).</description>

      <title>A model for horizontally restricted random square-tiled surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A square-tiled surface (STS) is a (finite, possibly branched) cover of the standard square-torus with possible branching over exactly 1 point. Alternately, STSs can be viewed as finitely many axis-parallel squares with sides glued in parallel pairs. After a labelling of the squares by $\{1, \dots, n\}$, we can describe an STS with $n$ squares using two permutations $\sigma, \tau \in S_n$, where $\sigma$ encodes how the squares are glued horizontally and $\tau$ encodes how the squares are glued vertically. Hence, a previously considered natural model for STSs with $n$ squares is $S_n \times S_n$ with the uniform distribution. We modify this model to obtain a new one: We fix $\alpha \in [0,1]$ and let $\mathcal{K}_{\mu_n}$ be a conjugacy class of $S_n$ with at most $n^\alpha$ cycles. Then $\mathcal{K}_{\mu_n} \times S_n$ with the uniform distribution is a model for STSs with restricted horizontal gluings. Since horizontal cycles of the $\sigma$ permutation are related to the number of maximal horizontal cylinders, this new model serves as a random model for STSs with at most $n^\alpha$ maximal horizontal cylinders. We deduce the asymptotic (as $n$ grows) number of components, genus distribution, most likely stratum and set of holonomy vectors of saddle connections for random STSs in this new model.</description>

      <title>Quantitative low-temperature spectral asymptotics for reversible diffusions in temperature-dependent domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive novel low-temperature asymptotics for the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. The novelty is that this operator is endowed with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions at the boundary of a domain which depends on the temperature. From the point of view of stochastic processes, this gives information on the long-time behavior of the diffusion conditioned on non-absorption at the boundary, in the so-called quasistationary regime. Our results provide precise estimates of the spectral gap and principal eigenvalue, extending the Eyring-Kramers formula. The phenomenology is richer than in the case of a fixed boundary and gives new insight into the sensitivity of the spectrum with respect to the shape of the domain near critical points of the energy function. Our work is motivated by--and is relevant to--the problem of finding optimal hyperparameters for accelerated molecular dynamics algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion models are an important tool for generative modelling, serving as effective priors in applications such as imaging and protein design. A key challenge in applying diffusion models for downstream tasks is efficiently sampling from resulting posterior distributions, which can be addressed using Doob's $h$-transform. This work introduces a self-supervised algorithm for fine-tuning diffusion models by learning the optimal control, enabling amortised conditional sampling. Our method iteratively refines the control using a synthetic dataset resampled with path-based importance weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework on class-conditional sampling, inverse problems and reward fine-tuning for text-to-image diffusion models.</description>

      <title>ItDPDM: Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05082v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative modeling of non-negative, discrete data, such as symbolic music, remains challenging due to two persistent limitations in existing methods. Firstly, many approaches rely on modeling continuous embeddings, which is suboptimal for inherently discrete data distributions. Secondly, most models optimize variational bounds rather than exact data likelihood, resulting in inaccurate likelihood estimates and degraded sampling quality. While recent diffusion-based models have addressed these issues separately, we tackle them jointly. In this work, we introduce the Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model (ItDPDM), inspired by photon arrival process, which combines exact likelihood estimation with fully discrete-state modeling. Central to our approach is an information-theoretic Poisson Reconstruction Loss (PRL) that has a provable exact relationship with the true data likelihood. ItDPDM achieves improved likelihood and sampling performance over prior discrete and continuous diffusion models on a variety of synthetic discrete datasets. Furthermore, on real-world datasets such as symbolic music and images, ItDPDM attains superior likelihood estimates and competitive generation quality-demonstrating a proof of concept for distribution-robust discrete generative modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for horizontal differentiation in which firms compete on a product manifold representing the feasible combinations of characteristics. This approach generalizes both the Hotelling line and Salop circle to any Riemannian space, allowing for a unified analysis of product space. We show that equilibrium existence and stability are governed by intrinsic geometric properties, specifically curvature, symmetry and dimension. We prove that negative curvature and high intrinsic dimension act as stabilizers of minimum differentiation equilibria, moving the analysis beyond the symmetry-induced instabilities found in simpler, fixed domains. By characterizing curvature as a measure of consumer heterogeneity, we demonstrate that intrinsic geometry is a fundamental determinant of competitive outcomes.</description>

      <title>Sharp Thresholds for Temporal Motifs and Doubling Time in Random Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study two natural models of \textit{random temporal} graphs. In the first, the \textit{continuous} model, each edge $e$ is assigned $l_e$ labels, each drawn uniformly at random from $(0,1]$, where the numbers $l_e$ are independent random variables following the same discrete probability distribution. In the second, the \textit{discrete} model, the $l_e$ labels of each edge $e$ are chosen uniformly at random from a set $\{1,2,\ldots,T\}$. In both models we study the existence of \textit{$\delta$-temporal motifs}. Here a $\delta$-temporal motif consists of a pair $(H,P)$, where $H$ is a fixed static graph and $P$ is a partial order over its edges. A temporal graph $\mathcal{G}=(G,\lambda)$ contains $(H,P)$ as a $\delta$-temporal motif if $\mathcal{G}$ has a simple temporal subgraph on the edges of $H$ whose time labels are ordered according to $P$, and whose life duration is at most $\delta$. We prove \textit{sharp existence thresholds} for all $\delta$-temporal motifs, and we identify a qualitatively different behavior from the analogous static thresholds in Erdos-Renyi random graphs. Applying the same techniques, we then characterize the growth of the largest $\delta$-temporal clique in the continuous variant of our random temporal graphs model. Finally, we consider the \textit{doubling time} of the reachability ball centered on a small set of vertices of the random temporal graph as a natural proxy for temporal expansion. We prove \textit{sharp upper and lower bounds} for the maximum doubling time in the continuous model.</description>

      <title>On the strength of connectedness of unions of random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G_1,\dots, G_m$ be independent identically distributed random subgraphs of the complete graph ${\cal K}_n$. We analyse the threshold behaviour of the strength of connectedness of the union $\cup_{i=1}^mG_i$ defined on the vertex set of ${\cal K}_n$. Let $a=\min\{t\ge 1:\, {\bf P}\{\delta(G_1)=t&gt;0\}\}$ be the minimal non zero vertex degree attained with positive probability. Given $k\ge 0$ let $\lambda(k)=\ln n+k\ln\frac{m}{n}-\frac{m}{n} {\bf E} X$, where $X$ stands for the number of non isolated vertices of $G_1$. Letting $n,m\to+\infty$ we show that ${\bf P}\{\cup_{i=1}^mG_i$ is $a(k+1)$-connected$\} \to 1 $ for $\lambda(k)\to -\infty$, and ${\bf P}\{\cup_{i=1}^mG_i$ is $ak+1$-connected$\} \to 0 $ for $\lambda(k)\to +\infty$. In particular, the connectivity strength of the union graph $\cup_{i=1}^mG_i$ increases in steps of size $a$. Our results are obtained in a more general setting where the contributing random subgraphs do not need to be identically distributed.</description>
