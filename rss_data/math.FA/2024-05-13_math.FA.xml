      <title>An asymmetric Myers-Nakai theorem for non-reversible Finsler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we provide a generalization of the celebrated Myers-Nakai Theorem for Riemannian manifolds to the framework of non-reversible Finsler manifolds, based on the ideas used in a previous generalization for reversible Finsler manifolds proved in \cite{GJR-13}. In the reversible (i.e. metric) case, the function space used to characterize Finsler isometries is the normed algebra $C^1_b(M)$, of bounded and $C^1$-smooth real valued functions with bounded derivative on a Finsler manifold $M$, endowed with its natural norm. This function space had to be adapted in order for it to reflect the quasi-metric structure of non-reversible Finsler manifolds, resulting in a partial loss of the normed space structure. In order to achieve the desired result, we define new algebraic/quasi-metric structures to model the behavior of the aforementioned function space. The construction is based on the cone of smooth semi-Lipschitz functions.</description>

      <title>Generalized de Branges-Rovnyak spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the reproducing kernel $k$ of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_k$ we study spaces $\mathcal{H}_k(b)$ whose reproducing kernel has the form $k(1-bb^*)$, where $b$ is a row-contraction on $\mathcal{H}_k$. In terms of reproducing kernels this it the most far-reaching generalization of the classical de Branges-Rovnyaks spaces, as well as their very recent generalization to several variables. This includes the so called sub-Bergman spaces in one or several variables. We study some general properties of $\mathcal{H}_k(b)$ e.g. when the inclusion map into $\mathcal{H}$ is compact. Our main result provides a model for $\mathcal{H}_k(b)$ reminiscent of the Sz.-Nagy-Foia\c{s} model for contractions. As an application we obtain sufficient conditions for the containment and density of the linear span of $\{k_w:w\in\mathcal{X}\}$ in $\mathcal{H}_k(b)$. In the standard cases this reduces to containment and density of polynomials. These methods resolve a very recent conjecture regarding polynomial approximation in spaces with kernel $\frac{(1-b(z)b(w)^*)^m}{(1-z\overline w)^\beta}, 1\leq m&lt;\beta, m\in\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>A topology on the Fremlin tensor product of locally convex-solid vector lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose E and F are locally convex-solid vector lattices. Although we have a suitable vector lattice structure for the tensor product E and F (known as the Fremlin tensor product and denoted by E\otimesF), there is a lack of topological structure on E\otimes F, in general. In this note, we consider a topological attitude on E\otimes F that makes it into a locally convex-solid vector lattice, as well.</description>

      <title>Approximation by a new sequence of operators involving Laguerre polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper offers a newly created integral approach for operators employing the orthogonal modified Laguerre polynomials and P\u{a}lt\u{a}nea basis. These operators approximate the functions over the interval $[0,\infty)$. Further, the moments are established for the proposed operators, and the universal Korovkin's theorem is used to derive the approximation properties of the operators. We examine convergence using a variety of analytical methods, including the Lipschitz class, Peetre's K-functional, the second-order modulus of smoothness, and the modulus of continuity. Moreover, an asymptotic formula associated with the Voronovskaja-type is established. The approximation is estimated through the weighted modulus of continuity, and convergence of the proposed operators in weighted spaces of functions is investigated as well. Ultimately, we employ numerical examples and visual representations to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: In this article we study unbounded order convergence (uO-convergence) on infinitely distributive lattices. For a sublattice Y of an infinitely distributive lattice L, we show that the order closure and unbounded order closure is also a sublattices. We also extend several results that hold for vector lattices.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of $w_{\rho}$-Birkhoff--James orthogonality and $w_{\rho}$-parallelism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the concepts of Birkhoff--James orthogonality and parallelism in Hilbert space operators, induced by the operator radius norm $w_{\rho}(\cdot)$. In particular, we completely characterize Birkhoff--James orthogonality and parallelism with respect to $w_{\rho}(\cdot)$. As an application of the results presented, we obtain a well-known characterization due to R.~Bhatia and P.~\v{S}emrl for the classical Birkhoff--James orthogonality of Hilbert space operators. Some other related results are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Curves defined by a class of discrete operators: approximation result and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In approximation theory classical discrete operators, like generalized sampling, Sz\'{a}sz-Mirak'jan, Baskakov and Bernstein operators, have been extensively studied for scalar functions. In this paper, we look at the approximation of curves by a class of discrete operators and we exhibit graphical examples concerning several cases. The topic has useful implications about the computer graphics and the image processing: we discuss applications on the approximation and the reconstruction of curves in images.</description>

      <title>Extreme points of matrix convex sets and their spanning properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This expository article gives a survey of matrix convex sets, a natural generalization of convex sets to the noncommutative (dimension-free) setting, with a focus on their extreme points. Mirroring the classical setting, extreme points play an important role in understanding matrix convex sets, and a natural question is, "are matrix convex sets the matrix convex hull of their extreme points?" That is, does a Krein-Milman theorem hold for matrix convex sets? This question requires more care in the noncommutative setting, as there are several notions of extreme points for matrix convex sets. Three of the most important notions are matrix extreme points, matrix exposed points, and free extreme points. For each of these types of extreme points, we examine strengths and shortcomings in terms of a Krein-Milman theorem for matrix convex sets.</description>

      <title>A generation theorem for the perturbation of strongly continuous semigroups by unbounded operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the well-posedness of the evolution equation of the form $u'(t)=Au(t)+Cu(t)$, $t\ge 0$, where $A$ is the generator of a $C_0$- semigroup and $C$ is a (possibly unbounded) linear operator in a Banach space $\mathbb{X}$. We prove that if $A$ generates a $C_0$-semigroup $\left (T_A(t)\right )_{t \geq 0}$ with $\|T(t)\| \le Me^{\omega t}$ in a Banach space $\mathbb{X}$ and $C$ is a linear operator in $\mathbb{X}$ such that $D(A)\subset D(C)$ and $\| CR(\mu ,A)\| \le K/(\mu -\omega)$ for each $\mu&gt;\omega$, then, the above-mentioned evolution equation is well-posed, that is, $A+C$ generates a $C_0$-semigroup $\left (T_{A+C}(t)\right )_{t \geq 0}$ satisfying $\| T_{A+C}(t)\| \le Me^{(\omega +MK)t}$. Our approach is to use the Hille-Yosida Theorem. Discussions on the persistence of asymptotic behavior of the perturbed equations such as the roughness of exponential dichotomy are also given. The obtained results seem to be new.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of higher rank Baumslag-Solitar semigroups and their related C*-algebras. We focus on two extreme, but interesting, classes - one is related to products of odometers and the other is related to Furstenberg's $\times p,, \times q$ conjecture. For the former class, whose C*-algebras are studied by H. Li and the second author, we here characterize the factoriality of the associated von Neumann algebras and further determine their types; for the latter, we obtain their canonical Cartan subalgebras. In the rank 1 case, we study a more general setting which encompasses (single-vertex) generalized Baumslag-Solitar semigroups. One of our main tools is from self-similar higher rank graphs and their C*-algebras.</description>

      <title>A complete pair of solvents of a quadratic matrix pencil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $B$ and $C$ be square complex matrices. The differential equation \begin{equation*} x''(t)+Bx'(t)+Cx(t)=f(t) \end{equation*} is considered. A solvent is a matrix solution $X$ of the equation $X^2+BX+C=\mathbf0$. A pair of solvents $X$ and $Z$ is called complete if the matrix $X-Z$ is invertible. Knowing a complete pair of solvents $X$ and $Z$ allows us to reduce the solution of the initial value problem to the calculation of two matrix exponentials $e^{Xt}$ and $e^{Zt}$. The problem of finding a complete pair $X$ and $Z$, which leads to small rounding errors in solving the differential equation, is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a new comparison between the Legendre transform of the cumulant generating function and the half-space depth of an arbitrary log-concave probability distribution on the real line, that carries on to the multidimensional setting. Combined with sharp estimates for the Cram\'{e}r transform of rotationally invariant measures, we are led to some new phase-transition type results for the asymptotics of the expected measure of random polytopes. As a byproduct of our analysis, we address a question on the sharp exponential separability constant for log-concave distributions, in the symmetric case.</description>

      <title>New approach to affine Moser-Trudinger inequalities via Besov polar projection bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the affine inequalities on $\mathbb{R}^n$ for Sobolev functions in $W^{s,p}$ with $1 \leq p &lt; n/s$ obtained recently by Haddad-Ludwig [16, 17] to the remaining range $p \geq n/s$. For each value of $s$, our results are stronger than affine Moser-Trudinger and Morrey inequalities. As a byproduct, we establish the analog of the classical $L^p$ Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu inequalities related to the Moser-Trudinger case $p=n$. Our main tool is the affine invariant provided by Besov polar projection bodies.</description>

      <title>Set Convergences via bornology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the equivalence between various set convergences, as studied in [7, 13, 22], induced by an arbitrary bornology $\mathcal{S}$ on a metric space $(X,d)$. Specifically, it focuses on the upper parts of the following set convergences: convergence deduced through uniform convergence of distance functionals on $\mathcal{S}$ ($\tau_{\mathcal{S},d}$-convergence); convergence with respect to gap functionals determined by $\mathcal{S}$ ($G_{\mathcal{S},d}$-convergence); and bornological convergence ($\mathcal{S}$-convergence). In particular, we give necessary and sufficient conditions on the structure of the bornology $\mathcal{S}$ for the coincidence of $\tau_{\mathcal{S},d}^+$-convergence with $\mathsf{G}_{\mathcal{S},d}^+$-convergence, as well as $\tau_{\mathcal{S},d}^+$-convergence with $\mathcal{S}^+$-convergence. A characterization for the equivalence of $\tau_{\mathcal{S},d}^+$-convergence and $\mathcal{S}^+$-convergence, in terms of certain convergence of nets, has also been given earlier by Beer, Naimpally, and Rodriguez-Lopez in [13]. To facilitate our study, we first devise new characterizations for $\tau_{\mathcal{S},d}^+$-convergence and $\mathcal{S}^+$-convergence, which we call their miss-type characterizations.</description>

      <title>Fixed Point Theory Analysis of a Lambda Policy Iteration with Randomization for the \'Ciri\'c Contraction Operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply methods of the fixed point theory to a Lambda policy iteration with a randomization algorithm for weak contractions mappings. This type of mappings covers a broader range than the strong contractions typically considered in the literature, such as \'Ciri\'c contraction. Specifically, we explore the characteristics of reinforcement learning procedures developed for feedback control within the context of fixed point theory. Under relatively general assumptions, we identify the sufficient conditions for convergence with a probability of one in infinite-dimensional policy spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.10727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence of fixed points for asymptotically nonexpansive mappings with center 0 defined on closed convex subsets of various Banach spaces. Three applications are given. Firstly, we prove that our results refine those concerning alternate convexically nonexpansive (in short; ACN) mappings studied by P. N. Dowling in " On a fixed point result of Amini-Harandi in strictly convex Banach spaces, Acta. Math. Hungar., 112 (1-2), (2006), 85-88" . Secondly, by using Lau's result in " Closed convex invariant subsets of $L_p(G)$, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., {\bf 232}, (1977), 131-142", we give another characterization for the noncompactness of locally compact groups $G$. Finally, we discuss the existence of a solution for a nonlinear transport equation without using compactness results.</description>

Abstract: For Schauder bases, Dilworth et al. introduced and characterized the partially greedy property, which is strictly weaker than the (almost) greedy property. Later, Berasategui et al. defined and studied the strong partially greedy property for general bases. Let $\mathbf n$ be any strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. In this paper, we define the strong partially greedy property with respect to $\mathbf n$, called the ($\mathbf n$, strong partially greedy) property. We give characterizations of this new property, study relations among ($\mathbf n$, strong partially greedy) properties for different sequences $\mathbf n$, establish Lebesgue-type inequalities for the ($\mathbf n$, strong partially greedy) parameter, investigate ($\mathbf n$, strong partially greedy) bases with gaps, and weighted ($\mathbf n$, strong partially greedy) bases, to name a few. Furthermore, we introduce the ($\mathbf n$, almost greedy) property and equate the property to a strengthening of the ($\mathbf n$, strong partially greedy) property. This paper can be viewed both as a survey of recent results regarding strong partially greedy bases and as an extension of these results to an arbitrary sequence instead of $\mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Sums of squares certificates for polynomial moment inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces and develops the algebraic framework of moment polynomials, which are polynomial expressions in commuting variables and their formal mixed moments. Their positivity and optimization over probability measures supported on semialgebraic sets and subject to moment polynomial constraints is investigated. A positive solution to Hilbert's 17th problem for pseudo-moments is given. On the other hand, moment polynomials positive on actual measures are shown to be sums of squares and formal moments of squares up to arbitrarily small perturbation of their coefficients. When only measures supported on a bounded semialgebraic set are considered, a stronger algebraic certificate for moment polynomial positivity is derived. This result gives rise to a converging hierarchy of semidefinite programs for moment polynomial optimization. Finally, as an application, two open nonlinear Bell inequalities from quantum physics are settled.</description>

      <title>Normed linear spaces which are isometric to order unit spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the linear direct sum of a real normed linear space with an order unit space and with a base normed space to obtain respectively a new order unit space and a new base normed space. As a consequence, we find that an $\ell_1$-space may be shown to be an order unit space. (However, not in the natural order.) Dually, an $\ell_{\infty}$-space may be shown to be a base normed space. To understand this aberration, we characterize the real normed linear spaces which are isometrically isomorphic to order unit spaces. We prove that other than the classical case of $\ell_{\infty}$, $\ell_1$ is also isometrically isomorphic to an order unit space whereas $\ell_2$ is not isometrically isomorphic to any order unit space.</description>

      <title>Factorizations for quasi-Banach time-frequency spaces and Schatten classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deduce factorization properties for a quasi-Banach module over a quasi-Banach algebra. Especially we extend a result by Hewitt and prove that if any such algebra which possess a bounded left approximate identity, then any element in the module can be factorized. As applications, we deduce factorization properties for Wiener amalgam spaces, for an extended family of modulation spaces and for Schatten symbol classes in pseudo-differential calculus under multiplications like convolutions, twisted convolutions and symbolic products. For example we show for Wiener amalgam spaces that WL^{1,r}*WL^{p,q}=WL^{p,q} when r in (0,1], and p and q are finite and larger than r. In particular we improve Rudin's identity L^1*L^1=L^1.</description>

      <title>Decay estimates for Cayley transforms and inverses of semigroup generators via the $\mathcal{B}$-calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $-A$ be the generator of a bounded $C_0$-semigroup $(e^{-tA})_{t \geq 0}$ on a Hilbert space. First we study the long-time asymptotic behavior of the Cayley transform $V_{\omega}(A) := (A-\omega I) (A+\omega I)^{-1}$ with $\omega &gt;0$. We give a decay estimate for $\|V_{\omega}(A)^nA^{-1}\|$ when $(e^{-tA})_{t \geq 0}$ is polynomially stable. Considering the case where the parameter $\omega$ varies, we estimate $\|(\prod_{k=1}^n V_{\omega_k}(A))A^{-1}\|$ for exponentially stable $C_0$-semigroups $(e^{-tA})_{t \geq 0}$. Next we show that if the generator $-A$ of the bounded $C_0$-semigroup has a bounded inverse, then $\sup_{t \geq 0} \|e^{-tA^{-1}} A^{-\alpha} \| &lt; \infty$ for all $\alpha &gt;0$. We also present an estimate for the rate of decay of $\|e^{-tA^{-1}} A^{-1} \|$, assuming that $(e^{-tA})_{t \geq 0}$ is polynomially stable. To obtain these results, we use operator norm estimates offered by a functional calculus called the $\mathcal{B}$-calculus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a dimension-free stability result for polydisc slicing due to Oleszkiewicz and Pelczy\'nski (2000). Intriguingly, compared to the real case, there is an additional asymptotic maximiser. In addition to Fourier-analytic bounds, we crucially rely on a self-improving feature of polydisc slicing, established via probabilistic arguments.</description>

      <title>Weakly Parametric Pseudodifferential Calculus for Twisted $C^*$-dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a twisted $C^*$-dynamical system $(\mathscr{A},\mathbb{R}^n,\alpha,e)$ over a unital $C^*$-algebra we establish a weakly parametric pseudodifferential calculus analogously to the celebrated weakly parametric calculus due to Grubb and Seeley. If the $C^*$-algebra $\mathscr{A}$ has an $\alpha$-invariant trace then we prove an expansion of the resolvent trace (with respect to the dual trace on multipliers) for suitable pseudodifferential multipliers. The question whether the expansion holds true as a Hilbert space trace expansion in concrete GNS spaces for $\mathscr{A}$ will be addressed in a future publication.</description>

      <title>Wold Decomposition and C*-envelopes of Self-Similar Semigroup Actions on Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Wold decomposition for representations of a self-similar semigroup $P$ action on a directed graph $E$. We then apply this decomposition to the case where $P=\mathbb{N}$ to study the C*-envelope of the associated universal non-selfadjoint operator algebra $\mathcal{A}_{\mathbb{N}, E}$ by carefully constructing explicit non-trivial dilations for non-boundary representations. In particular, it is shown that the C*-envelope of $\mathcal{A}_{\mathbb{N}, E}$ coincides with the self-similar C*-algebra $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Z}, E}$.</description>

      <title>Operation with Concentration Inequalities and Conjugate of Parallel Sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08206v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the concentration of the measure theory formalism, we consider the transformation $\Phi(Z)$ of a random variable $Z$ having a general concentration function $\alpha$. If the transformation $\Phi$ is $\lambda$-Lipschitz with $\lambda&gt;0$ deterministic, the concentration function of $\Phi(Z)$ is immediately deduced to be equal to $\alpha(\cdot/\lambda)$. If the variations of $\Phi$ are bounded by a random variable $\Lambda$ having a concentration function (around $0$) $\beta: \mathbb R_+\to \mathbb R$, this paper sets that $\Phi(Z)$ has a concentration function analogous to the so-called parallel produuct of $\alpha$ and $\beta$: $(\alpha^{-1} \cdot \beta^{-1})^{-1}$. We apply this result to (i) express the concentration of large-tailed random vectors, (ii) generalize Hanson Wright inequality, and (iii) provide useful insights on the so-called "multilevel concentration" that appears when $\Lambda$ is the product of $n$ random variables. This last result is obtained when we formulate the conjugate functions of the parallel sum of $n$ real mappings.</description>

      <title>Local convergence rates for Wasserstein gradient flows and McKean-Vlasov equations with multiple stationary solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-linear versions of log-Sobolev inequalities, that link a free energy to its dissipation along the corresponding Wasserstein gradient flow (i.e. corresponds to Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequalities in this context), are known to provide global exponential long-time convergence to the free energy minimizers, and have been shown to hold in various contexts. However they cannot hold when the free energy admits critical points which are not global minimizers, which is for instance the case of the granular media equation in a double-well potential with quadratic attractive interaction at low temperature. This work addresses such cases, extending the general arguments when a log-Sobolev inequality only holds locally and, as an example, establishing such local inequalities for the granular media equation with quadratic interaction either in the one-dimensional symmetric double-well case or in higher dimension in the low temperature regime. The method provides quantitative convergence rates for initial conditions in a Wasserstein ball around the stationary solutions. The same analysis is carried out for the kinetic counterpart of the gradient flow, i.e. the corresponding Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. The local exponential convergence to stationary solutions for the mean-field equations, both elliptic and kinetic, is shown to induce for the corresponding particle systems a fast (i.e. uniform in the number or particles) decay of the particle system free energy toward the level of the non-linear limit.</description>
