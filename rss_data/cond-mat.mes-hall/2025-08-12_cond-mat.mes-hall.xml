      <title>Radiative Heat Transfer and 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative heat transfer is of great interest from a fundamental point of view and for energy harvesting applications. This is a material dependent phenomenon where confined plasmonic excitations, hyperbolicity and other properties can be effective channels for enhancement, especially at the near field regime. Materials with reduced dimensions may offer further benefits of enhancement compared to the bulk systems. Here we study the radiative thermal power in the family of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers in their H- and T-symmetries. For this purpose, the computed from first principles electronic and optical properties are then used in effective models to understand the emerging scaling laws for metals and semiconductors as well as specific materials signatures as control knobs for radiative heat transfer. Our combined approach of analytical modeling with properties from ab initio simulations can be used for other materials families to build a materials database for radiative heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Incommensuration in odd-parity antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inversion-asymmetric antiferromagnets (AFMs) with odd-parity spin-polarization pattern have been proposed as a new venue for spintronics. These AFMs require commensurate ordering to ensure an effective time-reversal symmetry, which guarantees a strictly antisymmetric spin polarization of the electronic states. Recently, nonsymmorphic centrosymmetric crystals have been identified as a broad class of materials which could exhibit unit-cell doubling magnetism with odd-parity spin-polarization. Here we investigate the stability of these states against incommensuration. We first demonstrate that the symmetry conditions which permit a p-wave spin polarization pattern also permit the existence of a non-relativistic Lifshitz invariant in the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau free energy. This implies magnetism with an incommensurate ordering vector, independent of its microscopic origin. AFMs with f- or h-wave spin-polarization are also prone to incommensurability, especially when they have an itinerant origin. Here the symmetry which ensures the odd-parity spin-polarization also guarantees the existence of van Hove saddle points off the time-reversal-invariant momenta, which promote incommensurate spin fluctuations in quasi-two-dimensional electronic systems. Finally, we study the effect of weak spin-orbit coupling in locally noncentrosymmetric materials and find that it favors antiferromagnetic phases with in-plane magnetic moments. However, the inclusion of the spin-orbit coupling also introduces a new mechanism for driving incommensuration. Our results imply that odd-parity AFMs are likely to be preceded by an incommensurate phase, or emerge directly from the normal state via a first order transition. These conclusions are consistent with the phase diagram of several candidate materials.</description>

      <title>Topological hydrodynamics in spin-triplet superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the structure of the underlying SO(3) $\mathbf d$-vector order parameter, spin triplet superconductors exhibit a bulk-edge correspondence linking the circulation of supercurrent to the bulk magnetic skyrmion density, giving rise to topological hydrodynamics of magnetic skyrmions. To probe the interplay of charge and spin dynamics, we propose a blueprint for a spin-triplet superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), which functions without a Josephson weak link. The triplet SQUID undergoes nonsingular $4\pi$ phase slips, in which current relaxation is facilitated by spin dynamics that trace out a magnetic skyrmion texture. Inductively coupling the device to a tank circuit and probing the nonlinear supercurrent response via Oersted field measurements could provide an experimental signature of ferromagnetic spin-triplet superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Observation of anomalous Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Abelian topological phases, which go beyond traditional Abelian topological band theory, are garnering increasing attention. This is further spurred by periodic driving, leading to predictions of many novel multi-gap Floquet topological phases, including anomalous Euler and Dirac string phases induced by non-Abelian Floquet braiding, as well as Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators (FNTIs) that exhibit multifold bulk-edge correspondence. Here, we report the first experimental realization of anomalous FNTIs, which demonstrate topological edge modes in all three gaps despite having a trivial bulk charge. Concretely, we construct an experimentally feasible one-dimensional three-band Floquet model and implement it in acoustics by integrating time-periodic coupling circuits to static acoustic crystals. Furthermore, we observe counterintuitive topological interface modes in the domain-wall formed by an anomalous FNTI and its counterpart with swapped driving sequences, modes previously inaccessible in Floquet Abelian systems. Our work paves the way for further experimental exploration of the uncharted non-equilibrium topological physics.</description>

      <title>Randomly twisted bilayer graphene -- the cascade transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is known to have disorder in its twist angle. We show that in terms of a Dirac equation with a random gauge potential ${\bf A}({\bf r})$ this disorder becomes huge when the average twist angle is near the magic angle where the Dirac velocity vanishes. The density of states (DOS) then diverges at the Dirac point as $\rho(E)\sim E^{(2/z)-1}$ with $z\gg 1$ and we deduce that all electrons occupy energies very near $E=0$. We prove a sum rule on the disorder averaged eigenfunctions from which we deduce that each added electron contributes equal intraband Coulomb interaction energy. The various bands in TBG are related by either ${\bf A}({\bf r})\rightarrow {\bf A}({-\bf r})$ or ${\bf A}({\bf r})\rightarrow -{\bf A}({\bf r})$ which affects the interband interaction energy. We find, within Hartree-Fock, jumps in the chemical potential at each integer filling, accounting for the cascade transitions.</description>

      <title>Wannier Center Analysis on Possible Three-Dimensional Topological Phases in \alpha-Type Layered Organic Conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological features of possible three-dimensional (3D) states in \alpha-type layered organic conductors are investigated within a unified framework based on Wannier charge centers (WCCs), aiming to identify their actual topological states. Among the 3D Dirac/Weyl semimetal states of multilayered \alpha-(ET)2I3, the type-I Dirac semimetal state, induced by interlayer spin-orbit coupling (SOC), most effectively explains the observed chiral transport phenomena attributed to the chiral magnetic effect, which originates from the spiral structures of the WCC sheets. In multilayered \alpha-(BETS)2I3, a 3D weak topological insulator (TI) state consistently emerges, irrespective of the presence of interlayer SOC and/or inversion symmetry breaking. The strong TI state suggested by experimental observations appears unlikely to be realized.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Moment vs Angular Momentum: Spin Hall Response in Bismuth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin currents can carry either spin angular momentum or its associated magnetic moment, which are no longer strictly proportional in multiband systems. Using a multiband $k \cdot p$ model, we compute the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity tensors of elemental Bi. The magnetic-moment tensor emerges about two orders of magnitude larger and far less anisotropic than the angular-momentum tensor, while quasiparticle damping activates otherwise longitudinal components. The magnetic-moment spin Hall angle exceeds unity, demonstrating that a clear distinction between the two currents is indispensable for multiband systems.</description>

      <title>Conical Intersections Shed Light on Hot Carrier Cooling in Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental observations of vibronic coherences in electronically excited colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals offer a window into the ultrafast dynamics of hot carrier cooling. In previous work, we showed that, in amine-passivated quantum dots (QDs), these coherences arise during relaxation through a cascade of conical intersections between electronically excited states. Here, we demonstrate the generality of this framework by application to QDs with surface-bound carboxylate ligands. A model involving a similar cascade of conical intersections accurately reproduces the frequencies of vibronic coherences observed with broadband multidimensional spectroscopy. The impact of ligands on the relaxation dynamics is attributed to two distinct mechanisms involving either electronic or vibrational coupling between the core and ligands. Compared to the amine-passivated QDs studied previously, the electronic coupling mechanism is less prominent in carboxylate-passivated QDs. Furthermore, comparison of acetate and formate ligands reveals that truncating the ligand alkyl chains alters the relaxation behavior predicted by the model.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Induced Quantum Metric Dipole in Dirac Semimetal Cd3As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometry, comprising Berry curvature and quantum metric, plays a fundamental role in governing electron transport phenomena in solids. Recent studies show that the quantum metric dipole drives scattering-free nonlinear Hall effect in topological antiferromagnets, prompting the questions of whether this effect can occur in nonmagnetic systems and be externally tuned by a magnetic field. Our work addresses these frontiers by demonstrating that the quantum metric dipole is actively tuned by an external magnetic field to generate a time-reversal-odd nonlinear Hall response in a nonmagnetic topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. Alongside the well-known chiral-anomaly-induced negative longitudinal magnetoresistance, an exotic nonlinear planar Hall effect emerges with increasing magnetic field. Careful scaling analysis indicates that this nonlinear planar Hall effect is controlled by the magnetic-field-modulated quantum metric dipole. Constructing a k.p effective model of the Dirac bands under Zeeman and orbital coupling, we derive the evolution of the quantum metric dipole as a function of the magnetic field, providing a comprehensive explanation of the experimental results. Our results establish a band-structure-based strategy for engineering nonlinear magnetotransport in nonmagnetic materials via the quantum metric dipole, opening a pathway toward magnetic-field-tunable nonlinear quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Chern band in rhombohedral graphene multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e flat bands in rhombohedral multilayer graphene provide a platform for exploring interaction-driven topological phases, where a single isolated band often forms a Chern band. However, non-Abelian degenerate Chern bands with internal symmetries such as SU($N$) have so far been realized only in highly engineered systems. Here, we show that a doubly degenerate non-Abelian Chern band with Chern number $|C|=1$ emerges spontaneously at filling $\nu=2$ in rhombohedral 3-, 4-, and 5-layer graphene, regardless of the presence of an hBN substrate. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we map out phase diagrams as functions of displacement field and electronic periodicity, and analytically demonstrate that the Fock term drives spontaneous symmetry breaking and generates non-Abelian Berry curvature. Our findings unveil a new class of interaction-driven non-Abelian topological phases, distinct from quantum anomalous Hall and fractional Chern phases.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric-gate Mach--Zehnder interferometry in graphene: Multi-path conductance oscillations and visibility characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene provides an excellent platform for investigating electron quantum interference due to its outstanding coherent properties. In the quantum Hall regime, Mach--Zehnder (MZ) electronic interferometers are realized using p--n junctions in graphene, where electron interference is highly protected against decoherence. In this work, we present a phenomenological framework for graphene-based MZ interferometry with asymmetric p--n junction configurations. We show that the enclosed interferometer area can be tuned by asymmetric gate potentials, and additional MZ pathways emerge in higher-filling-factor scenarios, e.g. $\left(\nu_{n},\nu_{p}\right)=\left(-3,+3\right)$. The resulting complicated beat oscillations in asymmetric-gate MZ interference are efficiently analyzed using a machine-learning--based Fourier transform, which yields improved peak-to-background ratios compared to conventional signal-processing techniques. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the asymmetric gate on the interference visibility, finding that interference visibility is enhanced under symmetric gate conditions.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-induced Half Quantized Conductance in One-dimensional Topological Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantized conductance from topologically protected edge states is a hallmark of two-dimensional topological phases. In contrast, edge states in one-dimensional (1D) topological systems cannot transmit current across the insulating bulk, rendering their topological nature invisible in transport. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with gain and loss, and show that the zero-energy conductance exhibits qualitatively distinct behaviors between the topologically trivial and nontrivial phases, depending on the hybridization and dissipation strengths. Crucially, we analytically demonstrate that the conductance can become half-quantized in the topologically nontrivial phase, a feature absent in the trivial phase. We further show that the half quantization predominantly originates from transport channels involving gain/loss and edge states. Our results uncover a new mechanism for realizing quantized transport in 1D topological systems and highlight the nontrivial role of dissipation in enabling topological signatures in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Strong and selective magnon-phonon coupling in van der Waals antiferromagnet CoPS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Raman scattering response of the biaxial antiferromagnet CoPS$_3$ has been investigated as a function of both magnetic field and temperature. The peaks observed in the low-frequency spectral range (90--200~cm$^{-1}$) have been identified as hybrid magnon--phonon excitations. The energies of the bare magnon and phonon modes, as well as the effective coupling strengths between different excitation pairs, have been determined. The strong and selective magnon--phonon interaction largely accounts for the pronounced splitting of two phonon-like modes observed at 152~cm$^{-1}$ and 158~cm$^{-1}$ in the antiferromagnetic phase of CoPS$_3$. Based on the identification of bare magnon excitations and their magnetic-field dependence, we propose an updated set of parameters for the effective exchange ($J_{\mathrm{eff}} = 9.9$~meV) and biaxial magnetic anisotropy ($D = 4.3$~meV and $E = -0.7$~meV) and advocate for an apparent anisotropic $g$-factor ($g_x = g_y = 2$, $g_z = 4$) in the CoPS$_3$ antiferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Electronic band structure of a nodal line semimetal candidate ErSbTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LnSbTe family is well known for hosting a plethora of intriguing characteristics stemming from its crystalline symmetry, magnetic structure, 4f electronic correlations and spin orbit coupling (SOC) phenomena. In this paper, we have systematically studied the bulk electrical and thermodynamic properties and electronic structure of the nodal line semimetal candidate ErSbTe using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) corroborated with first principles based theoretical band structure calculations with and without considering the effect of SOC, a critical factor dictating the band degeneracy which depends on the choice of the Ln atom. Corroborative temperature dependent susceptibility, electrical resistivity and thermodynamic measurements, coherently exhibit paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition approximately at 1.94 K, and another sharp anomaly at 1.75 K. The zero field cooled resistivity measurement does not show the characteristic hump like feature in the other LnSbTe materials. The electronic band structure of ErSbTe, exhibits a diamond shaped Fermi surface. Along the high symmetry direction GX, electronic bands are projected to cross over the Fermi energy, necessitated by the nonsymmorphic symmetry of the system. The other crossing along this direction is gapped, which evolves along the momentum space reaching its maximum along the GM direction.</description>

Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect has attracted considerable attention and undergone extensive investigation in recent years. However, theoretical studies addressing size-dependent effects remain largely unexplored. In this work, we establish a unified semiclassical framework based on the Boltzmann transport equation, incorporating generalized boundary conditions to bridge the ballistic and diffusive transport regimes. Our analysis reveals that the nonlinear Hall effect arises from the combined action of two distinct mechanisms: the Berry curvature dipole and the Fermi-surface integral of Berry curvature. Furthermore, we investigate the Hall effect in topological crystalline insulators (TCIs), elucidating that the size dependence originates from competition between the two transport mechanisms. By connecting the two distinct regimes, our theoretical framework provides a comprehensive understanding of the nonlinear Hall effect in finite-sized systems, offering both fundamental insights and a useful analytical tool for more size-dependent investigations.</description>

      <title>Tunable Interfacial Thermal Conductance in Graphene/Germanene van der Waals Heterostructure using an Optimized Interlayer Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modeling interfacial thermal transport in van der Waals heterostructures is challenging due to the limited availability of interlayer interaction potentials. We develop a pairwise interlayer potential for graphene/germanene van der Waals heterostructure using the binding energy obtained from ab-initio density functional theory calculations and use it to calculate the interfacial thermal conductivity. Our calculations reveal that the interfacial thermal conductivity shows superior tunability with external strain. The phonon density of states calculations show a blueshift in the phonon spectra with an applied compressive strain in the direction of heat flow, increasing the interfacial thermal conductance to $\sim$136% of the unstrained value. In contrast, a tensile strain is found to cause an opposite effect, reducing the conductance to $\sim$70% of the unstrained value. Moreover, due to increased availability of phonons for heat transfer, both temperature and interaction strength are found to correlate positively with the interfacial thermal conductance for both directions of heat flow.</description>

      <title>Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene, taking into account both the pseudospin and intrinsic spin of electrons, within a simplified model of a rotating nanotube or infinitesimally narrow ring. Based on considerations of the relativistic phase of the wave function and employing the effective Larmor theorem, we demonstrate that the Sagnac fringe shift retains a form analogous to that for free electrons, governed by the electron's vacuum mass. In the case of a narrow ring, an additional $\pi$-phase shift arises due to the Berry phase associated with the honeycomb graphene lattice. The Mashhoon fringe shift, which characterizes the dynamics of intrinsic spin, retains its conventional form in graphene, with its dependence on the Fermi velocity. Our analysis highlights both the similarities and differences between spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom in graphene.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insight into BEOL Thermal Transport via Optical Metrology and Multiphysics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As integrated circuits continue to scale down and adopt three-dimensional (3D) stacking, thermal management in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) has emerged as a critical design constraint. In this study, we present a combined experimental and simulation framework to quantitatively characterize and mechanistically understand thermal transport in BEOL multilayers. Using the Square-Pulsed Source (SPS) method, a time-resolved optical metrology technique, we measure cross-plane thermal resistance and areal heat capacity in semiconductor chips at nanometer resolution. Two fabricated chip samples, polished to the M4 and M6 interconnection layers, are analyzed to extract thermal properties of distinct multilayer stacks. Results show that thermal resistance follows a series model, while areal heat capacity scales linearly with metal content. To uncover the underlying physical mechanisms, we perform finite element simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics, examining the influence of via connectivity and dielectric thermal conductivity on effective cross-plane heat transport. The simulations reveal that dielectric materials, due to their large volume fraction, are the primary limiting factor in BEOL thermal conduction, while the via structure plays a secondary but significant role. This combined experimental-simulation approach provides mechanistic insight into heat transport in advanced IC architectures and offers practical guidance for optimizing thermal pathways in future high-performance 3D-stacked devices.</description>

      <title>QVNTVS, Open-Source Quantum Well Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Wells (QW) are of great importance in optoelectronic devices such as LEDs and LASERs, being the emissive layers.Simulating the quantum particles in different QW topologies like rectangular finite potential wells, multiple potential wells, and triangular biased potential well heterojunctions enables faster modeling, theoretical characterization, and more. QVNTVS performs energy level and wavefunction calculations, recombination probability, transition energy, and optical emission computations quickly and accurately. Contrasting with the existing simulators, QVNTVS is an open-source project and can produce solutions for niche problems like potential wells under an electric field, heterojunctions, recombination, and transition matrices. QVNTVS simulates QWs by solving the Time-Independent Schr\"odinger Equation for different potential profiles in a discretized space using the finite-difference method and computes the properties of the device using the extracted information from the solution. The results align with the analytical calculations and the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Gate tunable spin-charge interconversion in a graphene/ReS$_{2}$ heterostructure up to room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene is a material with great potential in the field of spintronics, combining good conductivity with low spin--orbit coupling (SOC), which allows for the transport of spin currents over long distances. However, this lack of SOC also limits the capacity for manipulating spin current. A key strategy to address this limitation is to induce SOC in graphene via proximity to other two-dimensional (2D) materials. Such proximity-induced SOC can enable spin--charge interconversion (SCI) in graphene, with potential applications in next-generation logic devices. Here, we place graphene in close proximity to the room-temperature ferroelectric candidate ReS$_\mathrm{2}$, inducing SCI for both in-plane and out-of-plane polarized spin current. We attribute the SCI for in-plane polarized current to either the Rashba--Edelstein effect (REE) or the unconventional spin Hall effect (SHE) at the graphene/ReS$_\mathrm{2}$ interface, and the SCI for out-of-plane polarized current to either the conventional SHE in the proximitised graphene, or the unconventional SHE in the bulk of the ReS$_\mathrm{2}$. SCI due to in-plane spin is characterised over a wide range of temperature, up to 300 K and a range of gate voltages.</description>

      <title>Rabi Oscillations Modulated Noise Squeezing in Active Quantum Dot Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation of squeezed light is usually implemented in nonlinear \c{hi}(2) or \c{hi}(3) materials. Semiconductor lasers and optical amplifiers (SOAs) also offer non-linearities but they differ from passive elements in that they add amplified spontaneous emission noise (ASE). In a semiconductor laser, squeezing to below the shot noise limit has been demonstrated. An SOA contains no cavity and it adds significant noise. Gain saturation can lead, in principle, to squeezing of the photon number quadrature to below the shot noise level but often the noise is reduced only to below the ASE level of a linear amplifier. At the same time, the noise in the phase quadrature increases according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Short resonant pulses interacting with a quantum dot SOA induce coherent effects such as Rabi oscillations. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that Rabi oscillations cause cyclical noise squeezing which varies periodically with the excitation pulse area. The noise in the present experiments does not reach the quantum limit so we term this condition quasi squeezing. It occurs during the portions of the Rabi cycle when the quantum dots provide gain and repeats with every fourfold increase of the pulse excitation energy which amounts to a 2{\pi} increase in pulse area. In all other cases, the noise exhibits the properties of a coherent state.</description>

      <title>Gradient Electronic Landscapes in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide a versatile platform for quantum electronics. Experiments generally require encapsulating graphene within hBN flakes, forming a protective van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure that preserves delicate properties of the embedded crystal. To produce functional devices, heterostructures are typically shaped by electron beam lithography and etching, which has driven progress in 2D materials research. However, patterns are primarily restricted to in-plane geometries such as boxes, holes, and stripes, limiting opportunities for advanced architectures. Here, we use thermal scanning-probe lithography (tSPL) to produce smooth topographic landscapes in vdW heterostructures, controlling the thickness degree of freedom with nanometer precision. We electrically gate a sinusoidal topography to impose an electric-field gradient on the graphene layer to spatially modulate charge-carrier doping. We observe signatures of the landscape in transport measurements-resistance-peak spreading and commensurability oscillations-establishing tSPL for tailoring high-quality quantum electronics.</description>

      <title>On Noise-Sensitive Automatic Tuning of Gate-Defined Sensor Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In gate-defined quantum dot systems, the conductance change of electrostatically coupled sensor dots allows the observation of the quantum dots' charge and spin states. Therefore, the sensor dot must be optimally sensitive to changes in its electrostatic environment. A series of conductance measurements varying the two sensor-dot-forming barrier gate voltages serve to tune the dot into a corresponding operating regime. In this paper, we analyze the noise characteristics of the measured data and define a criterion to identify continuous regions with a sufficient signal-gradient-to-noise ratio. Hence, accurate noise estimation is required when identifying the optimal operating regime. Therefore, we evaluate several existing noise estimators, modify them for 1D data, optimize their parameters, and analyze their quality based on simulated data. The estimator of Chen et al. turns out to be best suited for our application concerning minimally scattering results. Furthermore, using this estimator in an algorithm for flank-of-interest classification in measured data shows the relevance and applicability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Charge Stability Diagrams for Automated Tuning Solutions (SimCATS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dots must be tuned precisely to provide a suitable basis for quantum computation. A scalable platform for quantum computing can only be achieved by fully automating the tuning process. One crucial step is to trap the appropriate number of electrons in the quantum dots, typically accomplished by analyzing charge stability diagrams (CSDs). Training and testing automation algorithms require large amounts of data, which can be either measured and manually labeled in an experiment or simulated. This article introduces a new approach to the realistic simulation of such measurements. Our flexible framework enables the simulation of ideal CSD data complemented with appropriate sensor responses and distortions. We suggest using this simulation to benchmark published algorithms. Also, we encourage the extension by custom models and parameter sets to drive the development of robust, technology-independent algorithms.

      <description>arXiv:2508.08239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) of a quantum system in a given parameter space captures both the geometry of the state manifold and the topology of the system. While the local QGT elements have been successfully measured in various platforms, the challenge of detecting them in electronic transport systems - such as tunnel or molecular junctions - has yet to be resolved. To fill this gap, we propose a measurement protocol based on weak and resonant parameter modulations, and theoretically demonstrate how the local QGT in such systems can be directly probed from changes of the tunnel conductance. This approach enables the measurement of both geometrical and topological features of quantum states in a broad class of transport-based quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05341v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of different exotic topological phases of quantum matter on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processor is attracting growing interest. Here, we develop a one-dimensional 43-qubit superconducting quantum processor, named as Chuang-tzu, to simulate and characterize emergent topological states. By engineering diagonal Aubry-Andr$\acute{\mathrm{e}}$-Harper (AAH) models, we experimentally demonstrate the Hofstadter butterfly energy spectrum. Using Floquet engineering, we verify the existence of the topological zero modes in the commensurate off-diagonal AAH models, which have never been experimentally realized before. Remarkably, the qubit number over 40 in our quantum processor is large enough to capture the substantial topological features of a quantum system from its complex band structure, including Dirac points, the energy gap's closing, the difference between even and odd number of sites, and the distinction between edge and bulk states. Our results establish a versatile hybrid quantum simulation approach to exploring quantum topological systems in the NISQ era.</description>

Abstract: Polytungstates are oxygen-linked assemblies of highly oxidized tungsten polyhedra, valued for their tunability and stability in diverse applications. Traditional synthesis methods (hydrothermal, solvothermal, solid-state) offer material variety but are limited in scalability and their ability to yield nanostructured materials due to long reaction times and high temperatures. Here, we introduce flame aerosol synthesis as a single-step, rapid and dry method to prepare K$_2$W$_7$O$_{22}$ nanoparticulate powders and coatings. Thereby, monocrystalline and phase-pure K$_2$W$_7$O$_{22}$  with varying crystal-sizes were obtained by controlling flame temperature, residence time and metal ion concentration during particle formation by nucleation, coagulation and sintering. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy identified the high potassium tolerance of the K$_2$W$_7$O$_{22}$  lattice (K/W ratio up to 0.6) and phase stability up to 400 $^\circ$C, before other polytungstates and WO$_3$ polymorphs were formed, respectively. Porous films of such K$_2$W$_7$O$_{22}$  nanoparticles featured n-type semiconductor behavior that was utilized for the chemoresistive quantification of the air pollutant benzene down to 0.2 parts-per-million at 20% relative humidity. Such sensors were quite selective over other compounds (e.g. alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, CO, NH$_3$ or H$_2$), in particular to chemically similar toluene and xylene (&gt;18).</description>

      <title>Quantized Thouless Pumping of Dark Solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinearity enables the emergence of localized waves such as solitons that maintain their shapes during propagation. Solitons are broadly classified into bright and dark solitons. While a bright soliton exhibits a density peak, a dark soliton presents as a defect on a continuous wave background. A distinctive feature of dark solitons is the abrupt phase change in their wave function, which can host Majorana zero modes in topological fermionic superfluids. Recent studies have shown that bright solitons can undergo quantized transport through Thouless pumping, where the bright soliton functions as a Wannier function. However, it remains unclear whether Thouless pumping can also occur for dark solitons, which fundamentally differ from bright solitons. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the occurrence of both integer and fractional Thouless pumping for dark solitons within both a continuous model under optical lattices and a tight-binding model. Specifically, we find that a dark soliton is transported by one or half a unit cell, following the center-of-mass position of a Wannier function, as a system parameter is slowly varied over one cycle. Our work opens new avenues for exploring Thouless pumping for defects with phase changes, such as dark solitons, vortex solitons, ring dark solitons, and vortices.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate electrically switchable, non-volatile dipoles in graphene/thin hBN/$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ heterostructures, stabilized purely by interfacial charge transfer across an atomically thin dielectric barrier. This mechanism requires no sliding or twisting to explicitly break inversion symmetry and produces robust ferroelectric-like hysteresis loops that emerge prominently near 30~K. Systematic measurements under strong in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields reveal negligible effects on the hysteresis characteristics, confirming that the primary mechanism driving the dipole switching is electrostatic. Our findings establish a distinct and robust route to electrically tunable ferroelectric phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures, opening opportunities to explore the interplay between interfacial charge transfer and temperature-tuned barrier crossing of dipole states at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Secondary finite-size effects and multi-barrier free energy landscapes in molecular simulations of hindered ion transport</title>

Abstract: Ion transport through nanoscale channels and pores is pivotal to numerous natural processes and industrial applications. Experimental investigation of the kinetics and mechanisms of such processes is, however, hampered by the limited spatiotemporal resolution of existing experimental techniques. While molecular simulations have become indispensable for unraveling the underlying principles of nanoscale transport, they also suffer from some important technical limitations. In our previous works, we identified strong polarization-induced finite-size effects in molecular dynamics simulations of hindered ion transport, caused by spurious long-range interactions between the traversing ion and the periodic replicates of other ions. To rectify these artifacts, we introduced the Ideal Conductor/Dielectric Model (\textsc{Icdm}), which treats the system as a combination of conductors and dielectrics, and constructs an analytical correction to the translocation free energy profile. Here, we investigate some limitations of this model. Firstly, we propose a generalized approach based on Markov State models that is capable of estimating translocation timescales in the thermodynamic limit for free energy profiles with multiple comparable barriers. Second, we identify a new category of polarization-induced finite-size effects, which significantly alter the spatial distribution of non-traversing ions in smaller systems. These secondary effects cannot be corrected by the ICDM model and must be avoided by selecting sufficiently large system sizes. Additionally, we demonstrate through multiple case studies that finite-size artifacts can reverse expected trends in ion transport kinetics. Our findings underscore the necessity for careful selection of system sizes and the judicious application of the \textsc{Icdm} model to rectify residual finite-size artifacts.</description>

      <title>g-Factor Enhanced Upper Critical Field in Superconducting PdTe2 due to Quantum Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pauli limiting field of superconductors determines the maximal possible value of magnetic field at which superconductivity remains possible. For weak-coupling superconductors, it is determined by an established relation that can be found by setting the condensation energy equal to the magnetization free energy. The latter is a function of the carrier g-factor. Here, we demonstrate in a van der Waals superconductor PdTe2, that quantum confinement can tune the effective g-factor causing the Pauli limit to become thickness dependent. We experimentally probe the in-plane upper critical field (Hc2||) of PdTe2 at intermediate thicknesses down to 20mK. Hc2|| is enhanced by more than an order of magnitude as the thickness is varied from 50nm down to 19nm. We model its temperature and thickness dependence, revealing that both orbital and spin Zeeman depairing mechanisms impact its value. While the variation of the orbital interaction is expected, our findings reveal how the Zeeman interaction impacts superconductivity in thin films. They aid in the search for mixed and odd pairing superconductivity where an enhancement of Hc2|| can be occasionally associated with those unconventional pairing symmetries.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and Crystal Symmetry Effects on Spin Hall Conductivity in Altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets, which reconcile zero net magnetization with pronounced spin splitting, offer fresh opportunities for spin-based functionalities in next-generation electronic and spintronic devices. In this paper, we explore the unconventional spin Hall conductivity (USHC) in three prototypical altermagnets -- RuO$_2$, CrSb, and MnTe -- and elucidate how distinct magnetic and crystal symmetries modulate their spin Hall responses. RuO$_2$ exhibits only trivial USHC contributions under a tilted geometry, demonstrating that symmetry projections alone can induce apparent unconventional elements. In contrast, CrSb and MnTe manifest robust, symmetry-driven USHC without structural tilts, enabled by easy-axis orientations that reduce magnetic symmetry. Through extensive first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the complementary roles of the time-reversal-even and time-reversal-odd components in determining the overall SHC. Our findings indicate that controlling the interplay between crystal and magnetic symmetry -- for instance, by epitaxial strain or doping -- can provide an experimental avenue to tune USHC magnitudes and directions in altermagnets. These results pave the way for the engineering of multifunctional spintronic devices, where enhanced coherence and robust spin transport are realized in zero-net-moment materials with easily tailored spin configurations.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum electrodynamics in synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics (QED), a cornerstone framework that describes light-matter interactions rooted in Abelian symmetries, renders the harnessing of synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields as a fundamental yet uncharted frontier. Here, we develop a general theory of light-matter interaction of quantum emitters embedded in non-Abelian photonic lattices. Based on analytical solutions to the non-Abelian Landau dressed states beyond the continuum limit, we reveal chiral photon emission and vortices with emergent nonreciprocity enabled by selective coupling between emitters and spin-momentum-locked bands. When coexisting with Abelian and non-Abelian magnetic fields, emitters hybridize with Landau dressed orbits to form spin-polarized, squeezed Landau polaritons that carry quantized angular momenta, with Rabi frequencies tunable via Landau levels and pseudospin interactions. Multi-emitter dynamics further exhibit collective phenomena governed by real-space staggered phases induced by nonsymmorphic crystalline symmetry. These results bridge non-Abelian physics with quantum optics, and establish non-Abelian gauge fields as a versatile tool for synthesizing topological quantum optical states, angular momentum transfer, and controlling photon-mediated correlations in QED systems, relevant for applications in quantum simulations and chiral quantum optical networks.</description>

      <title>Information Transport in Classic-Quantum Hybrid System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many important quantities in quantum information science, such as entropy and entanglement, are non-linear functions of the density matrix and cannot be expressed as operator observables. Standard open-system approaches evolve only a single copy of the density matrix, making it impossible to track the dynamics of such quantities. A formalism proposed by some of the present authors addressed this challenge by evolving multiple virtual replicas, but was limited to the weak-coupling regime. Here, we extend this approach to strong coupling between a quantum system and classical environments. The resulting multi-replica master equation enables direct evaluation of entropy flow and related metrics in strongly hybridized quantum-classical systems. Our results show that quantum coherence and hybridization jointly suppress net entropy transfer, creating a thermodynamic bottleneck. This framework provides a general tool for studying entropy dynamics and guiding the design of more robust, resource-efficient quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the validity of the Cutler-Mott relations outside the Landau Fermi-liquid concept. We consider a two-site charge Kondo circuit as a paradigmatic example of a system possessing both Fermi- and non-Fermi liquid properties. It is shown that the generalized Cutler-Mott-like relations derived in the paper hold in both operating regimes of the charge Kondo quantum circuit describing a smooth crossover between low- and high- temperature regimes. We discuss applicability of the generalized Cutler-Mott relations for computing a figure of merit of the non-Fermi liquid quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: Ultrathin nanowires could play a central role in next-generation downscaled electronics. Here, we explore some of the most promising candidates identified from previous high-throughput screening: CuC$_2$, TaSe$_3$, and AuSe$_2$, to gain insight into the thermodynamic and anharmonic behaviors of nanowires that could be exfoliated from weakly-bonded three-dimensional materials. We analyze thermal stability, linear thermal expansion, and anharmonic heat capacity using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. Notably, our work unveils exotic features common among all the 1D wires: a colossal record negative thermal expansion and very large deviations from the Dulong-Petit law due to strong anharmonicity.</description>

      <title>Observation of Metal-Insulator and Spectral Phase Transitions in Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian extensions of the Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model reveal a rich variety of phase transitions arising from the interplay of quasiperiodicity and non-Hermiticity. Despite their theoretical significance, experimental explorations remain challenging due to complexities in realizing controlled non-Hermiticity. Here, we present the first experimental realization of the unitary almost-Mathieu operator (UAMO) which simulates the AAH model by employing single-photon quantum walks. Through precise control of quasiperiodicity, we systematically explore the phase diagram displaying a phase transition between localized and delocalized regimes in the Hermitian limit. Subsequently, by introducing non-reciprocal hopping, we experimentally probe the parity-time (PT) symmetry-breaking transition that is characterized by the emergence of complex quasienergies. Moreover, we identify a novel spectral transition exclusive to discrete-time settings, where all quasienergies become purely imaginary. Both transitions are connected to changes in the spectral winding number, demonstrating their topological origins. These results clarify the interplay between localization, symmetry breaking, and topology in non-Hermitian quasicrystals, paving the way for future exploration of synthetic quantum matter.</description>

Abstract: Steady illumination of a non-centrosymmetric semiconductor results in a bulk photovoltaic current, which is contributed by real-space displacements (`shifts') of charged quasiparticles as they transit between Bloch states. The shift induced by interband excitation via absorption of photons has received the prevailing attention. However, this excitation-induced shift can be far outweighed ($\ll$) by the shift induced by intraband relaxation, or by the shift induced by radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs. This outweighing ($\ll$) is attributed to (i) time-reversal-symmetric, intraband Berry curvature, which results in an anomalous shift of quasiparticles as they scatter with phonons, as well as to (ii) topological singularities in the interband Berry phase (`optical vortices'), which makes the photovoltaic current extraordinarily sensitive to the linear polarization vector of the light source. Both (i-ii) potentially lead to nonlinear conductivities of order $mAV^{-2}$, without finetuning of the incident radiation frequency, band gap, or joint density of states. A case study of BiTeI showcases the anomalous shift and optical vorticity in a realistic material.</description>

      <title>Algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect and generalized Fermi surface formula in arbitrary dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, characterized by a proliferation of exponentially localized edge modes in open-boundary systems, has led to the discovery of numerous novel physical phenomena that challenge the limits of conventional band theory. In sharp contrast to this familiar exponential localization, we report a distinct phenomenon--the algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect--which arises generically in non-Hermitian systems with two or more spatial dimensions. In such cases, the amplitude of skin modes typically decays from the boundary following a power law, rather than an exponential form--a behavior not captured by existing theoretical frameworks. To bridge this gap and describe the transition in localization from one to higher dimensions, we develop a generalized Fermi surface framework applicable to open-boundary systems in arbitrary dimensions. This framework not only reproduces known results for the exponential skin effect in 1D, but also predicts a new class of skin effects with algebraic decay in 2D and above. We demonstrate this framework in both tight-binding and continuum models in two and three dimensions. This investigation not only unveils a novel category of the non-Hermitian skin effect but also offers a comprehensive theoretical structure that describes skin effects in any non-Hermitian system, irrespective of its spatial dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Temperature Induced Transition and Convergence of Thermal Conductivity in Germanene Monolayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an anomalous temperature-induced transition in thermal conductivity in germanene monolayer around a critical temperature $T_c = 350 \, \text{K}$. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations reveal a transition from $\kappa \sim T^{-2}$ scaling below $T_c$ to $\kappa \sim T^{-1/2}$ above, contrasting with conventional $\kappa \sim T^{-1}$ behavior. This anomalous scaling correlates with the long-scale characteristic timescale $\tau_2$ obtained from double exponential fitting of the heat current autocorrelation function. Phonon mode analysis using normal mode decomposition indicates that a redshift in ZO phonons reduces the acoustic-optical phonon gap, causing an overlap, enhances the phonon-phonon scattering, driving the anomalous scaling behavior. Moreover, nonequilibrium simulations find a convergent thermal conductivity of germanene with sample size, in agreement with mode coupling theory, owing to the high scattering of ZA phonons due to the inherent buckling of germanene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15339v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) is a powerful tool to probe the surface reconstruction during MBE growth. However, raw RHEED patterns are difficult to interpret, especially when the wafer is rotating. A more accessible representation of the information is therefore the so-called Azimuthal RHEED (ARHEED), an angularly resolved plot of the electron diffraction pattern during a full wafer rotation. However, ARHEED requires precise information about the rotation angle as well as of the position of the specular spot of the electron beam. We present a Deep Learning technique to automatically construct the Azimuthal RHEED from bare RHEED images, requiring no further measurement equipment. We use two artificial neural networks: an image segmentation model to track the center of the specular spot and a regression model to determine the orientation of the crystal with respect to the incident electron beam of the RHEED system. Our technique enables accurate, and potentially real-time ARHEED construction on any growth chamber equipped with a RHEED system.</description>

      <title>Exchangeless braiding of Majorana zero modes in weakly coupled Kitaev chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exchangeless braiding of Majorana modes is studied in minimal networks of weakly hybridized Kitaev chains of finite length using a rigorous many-body framework. In particular, for two coupled chains it is shown that exchangeless braiding is achieved by $2\pi$ rotations of the phase $\phi$ of the superconducting order parameter of one of the chains. This braiding protocol is verified by the numerical calculation of the non-Abelian Wilczek-Zee phase of the low-energy many-body subspaces ${\cal H}_{0}(\phi)$ based on the Bertsch-Robledo ground-state overlap formula. In the parameter space spanned by the total chain length, the strength of the weak hybridization connecting the chains, and the on-site potential, we identify two regions with different braiding outcomes, i.e., a projective $\sigma_{x}$-gate and a projective $\sigma_{z}$-gate phase. The transition between these phases is a continuous crossover, the location of which is reliably given by a simple four-Majorana mode model. This demonstrates the resilience of the anyonic properties of the Majorana modes against finite-size effects and weak links between Kitaev chains.</description>

Abstract: Quantum dots in SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures host coherent electron spin qubits, which are promising for future quantum computers. The silicon quantum well hosts near-degenerate electron valley states, creating a low-lying excited state that is known to reduce spin qubit readout and control fidelity. The valley energy splitting is dominated by the microscopic disorder in the SiGe alloy and at the Si/SiGe interfaces, and while Si devices are compatible with large-scale semiconductor manufacturing, achieving a uniformly large valley splitting energy across a many-qubit device spanning mesoscopic distances is an outstanding challenge. In this work we study valley splitting variations in a 1D quantum dot array manufactured by Intel. We observe correlations in valley splitting, at both sub-100nm (single gate) and &gt;1{\mu}m (device) lengthscales, that are consistent with alloy disorder-dominated theory and simulation. Our results develop the mesoscopic understanding of Si/SiGe heterostructures necessary for scalable device design.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric optimization and quantum-to-classical crossover in gate-controlled two-dimensional semiconducting nanojunctions</title>

Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric performance of 2D nanojunctions with gate tunable architectures and varying channel lengths from 3 to 12 nm using a combination of first principles simulations, including density functional theory, DFT with nonequilibrium Greens function formalism (nanoDCAL), and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our study reveals a gate, temperature, and length dependent transition from quantum to classical in electron transport, transitioning from quantum tunneling in short junctions to thermionic emission in longer ones. We observe nontrivial dependencies of the thermoelectric figure of merit on the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivities, and thermal conductivities as a result of this crossover and gate controlling. We identify that maximizing ZT requires tuning the chemical potential just outside the band gap, where the system lies at the transition between insulating and conducting regimes. While extremely large Seebeck coefficients are observed in the insulating state, they do not yield high ZT due to suppressed electrical conductivity and dominant phononic thermal transport. The optimal ZT larger than 2.3 is achieved in the shortest 3 nm junction at 500 K, where quantum tunneling and thermionic emission coexist. These findings offer fundamental insights into transport mechanisms in 2D semiconducting nanojunctions and present design principles for high efficiency nanoscale thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchy of Topological and Superconducting States in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect are conventionally viewed as mutually exclusive: the former is suppressed by magnetic fields, while the latter relies on them. Here, we report the surprising coexistence of these two phenomena in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. In this system, a superconducting phase is not destroyed -- but instead stabilized -- by an out-of-plane magnetic field. Strikingly, this superconducting state coexists and competes with a sequence of quantum Hall states that appear at both integer and half-integer Landau level fillings. Both the superconducting and quantum Hall states exhibit sharply defined thermal transitions or crossovers, with nearly identical onset temperatures -- pointing to a shared underlying mechanism. Taken together, our observations uncover an unprecedented interplay between superconducting and topological phases, challenging conventional paradigms and opening a new frontier in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Hall Effect with Extended Topologically Protected Features in Altermangetic Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional topological classification theory dictates that time-reversal symmetry confines the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification, permitting only a single pair of gapless helical edge states. Here, we utilize the recently discovered altermagnetism to circumvent this fundamental constraint. We demonstrate the realization of a unique QSH phase possessing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states in altermagnetic multilayers. This exotic QSH phase, characterized by a mirror-spin Chern number, emerges from the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering. Moreover, using first-principles calculations, we identify altermagnetic Fe$_2$Se$_2$O multilayers as promising material candidates, in which the number of gapless helical edge states scales linearly with the number of layers, leading to a correspondingly large, exactly quantized, and experimentally accessible spin-Hall conductance. Our findings unveil a new mechanism for stabilizing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states, significantly expanding the scope of QSH effects, and provide a blueprint for utilizing altermagnetism to engineer desired topological phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the localization of electronic states in the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) using a magnetic localization landscape (MLL) approach. By studying a continuum Schr\"odinger model with disordered electrostatic potential, we demonstrate that the MLL, defined via a modified landscape function incorporating magnetic effects, captures key features of quantum state localization. The MLL effective potential reveals the spatial confinement regions and provides predictions of eigenstate energies, particularly in regimes where traditional semiclassical approximations break down. Numerical simulations show that below a critical energy, states localize around minima of the effective potential, while above it, they cluster around maxima-with edge effects becoming significant near boundaries. Bridging the gap between semiclassical intuition and full quantum models, the MLL offers a robust framework to understand transport and localization in disordered quantum Hall systems, and extends the applicability of landscape theory to magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of magnon hydrodynamics in collinear antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the transport of spin angular momentum and linear momentum carried by magnons in electrically insulating collinear antiferromagnets (AFs). Focusing on both transverse and longitudinal geometries, we model magnons as a viscous fluid and explore the hydrodynamic transport regime that emerges when the magnon-magnon scattering length is shorter than the momentum-relaxation length, such that momentum-conserving processes dominate over momentum-relaxing ones. We develop a theoretical framework to investigate viscous effects in the magnon hydrodynamic regime, which give rise to measurable transport signatures such as nonlocal resistance and spin and thermal conductance. Accounting for both momentum and spin relaxations, we derive hydrodynamic equations governing magnon momentum and spin transport. Notably, interspecies scattering between antiferromagnetic magnons with opposite spin angular momentum induces drag-like effects that strongly modify spin current propagation. We derive expressions for magnon conductivity and introduce an accessibility parameter quantifying intra-band momentum transfer. Our results establish antiferromagnetic insulators as a promising platform for observing magnon-fluid dynamics and exploring collective spin transport phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancement of spin-based devices as a replacement for CMOS technology demands lower spin-switching energy in ferromagnetic (FM) materials. Ferroelectric (FE) materials offer a promising avenue for influencing FM properties, yet the mechanisms driving this interplay remain inadequately understood. In this study, we investigate iron-adsorbed FE ABO$_3$ perovskites using a combination of first-principles calculations and machine learning. Our findings reveal a universal correlation between the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of iron and the induced magnetic dipole moments within the BO$_2$ layer and basal oxygen atoms of ABO$_3$ at the FE/FM interface. By identifying key material descriptors and achieving high predictive accuracy, this research provides a robust framework for selecting and optimizing ABO$_3$ substrates for energy-efficient spintronic devices. These insights contribute to the rational design of novel low-power spin-based technologies.</description>

Abstract: The Higgs mode in superconductors corresponds to oscillations of the amplitude of the order parameter. While its detection typically entails resonant optical excitation, we present a purely transport-based setup wherein it is excited in a voltage biased Josephson junction. Demonstrating the importance of order parameter dynamics, the interplay of Higgs resonance and Josephson physics enhances the second harmonic Josephson current oscillating at twice the usual Josephson frequency in transparent junctions featuring single-band s-wave superconductors. If the leads have unequal equilibrium superconducting gaps, this second harmonic component may even eclipse its first harmonic counterpart, thus furnishing a unique hallmark of the Higgs oscillations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the theory of the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect between a Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain and a conductor. The effect consists of the generation of a spin current across the spin chain-conductor interface in response to the temperature difference between the two systems. In this setup, the current is given by the convolution of the local spin susceptibilities of the spin chain and the conductor. We find the spin current to be fully controlled, both in the magnitude and the sign, by the backscattering interaction between spinons, fractionalized spin excitations of the Heisenberg chain. In particular, it vanishes when the spinons form a non-interacting spinon gas. Our analytical results for the local spin susceptibility at the open end of the spin chain are in excellent agreement with numerical DMRG simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.</description>

Abstract: We study optical manifestations of multigap band topology in multiband superconductors with a nontrivial topological Euler class. We introduce a set of lattice models for non-Abelian superconductors with the Euler invariant signified by a nontrivial quantum geometry. We then demonstrate that the topological Bogoliubov excitations realized in these models provide for a characteristic first-order optical response distinct from those of the other known topological superconductors. We find that the spectral distribution of the optical conductivity universally admits a topological jump originating from the Euler class in the presence of $d$-wave superconducting pairings, and naturally differs from the features induced by the quantum geometry in the noninteracting bands without pairing terms. Further to uncovering observable signatures in first-order optical conductivities, we showcase that the higher-order optical responses of the non-Abelian Euler superconductor can result in enhanced nonlinear currents that fingerprint the exotic topological invariant. Finally, by employing a diagrammatic approach, we generalize our findings beyond the specific models of Euler superconductors.</description>

      <title>Two-Photon Interference from an InAs Quantum Dot emitting in the Telecom C-Band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-photon interference from an InAs/InAlGaAs quantum dot (QD) emitting in the telecom C-band with a raw two-photon interference visibility of $V_{HOM}=(71.9\pm0.2)$ % is demonstrated. This is achieved by a two-fold approach: an improvement of the molecular beam epitaxial growth for better QDs, and integration of the QDs into an optical circular Bragg grating resonator for a Purcell enhancement of the radiative decay rate. The quantum optical properties of the fabricated device are studied by means of time-correlated single-photon counting under quasi-resonant excitation of the charged exciton line. A reduced lifetime of $T_1=(257.5\pm0.2)$ ps is found corresponding to a Purcell factor of $F_P\geqq(4.7\pm0.5)$. Pronounced anti-bunching of the second-order autocorrelation function at zero time delay $g^{(2)} (0)=(0.0307\pm0.0004)$ confirms the single-photon emission character. The two-photon interference is demonstrated with an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer in Hong-Ou-Mandel configuration. We discuss strategies how to further improve the indistinguishability, and provide a survey of the state-of-the art.</description>

      <title>Mesostructural origins of the anisotropic compressive properties of low-density closed-cell foams: A deeper understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many closed-cell foams exhibit an elongated cell shape in the foam rise direction, resulting in anisotropic compressive properties. Nevertheless, the underlying deformation mechanisms and how cell shape anisotropy induces this mechanical anisotropy are not yet fully understood, in particular for the foams with a high cell face fraction and low relative density. Moreover, the impacts of mesostructural stochastics are often overlooked. This contribution conducts a systematic numerical study on the anisotropic compressive behaviour of low-density closed-cell foams, which accounts for cell shape anisotropy, cell structure and different mesostructural stochastics. Representative volume elements (RVE) of foam mesostructures are modeled, with cell walls described as Reissner-Mindlin shells in a finite rotation setting. A mixed stress-strain driven homogenization scheme is introduced, which allows for enforcing an overall uniaxial stress state. Quantitative analysis of the cell wall deformation behaviour confirms the dominant role of membrane deformation in the initial elastic region, while the bending contribution gets important only after buckling, followed by membrane yielding. Based on the identified deformation mechanisms, analytical models are developed that relates mechanical anisotropy to cell shape anisotropy. It is found that cell shape anisotropy translates into the anisotropy of compressive properties through three pathways, cell load-bearing area fraction, cell wall buckling strength and cell wall inclination angle. Besides, the resulting mechanical anisotropy is strongly affected by the cell shape anisotropy stochastics while almost insensitive to the cell size and cell wall thickness stochastics. The present findings provide deeper insights into the relationships between the anisotropic compressive properties and mesostructures of low-density closed-cell foams.</description>

Abstract: 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets have emerged as promising materials for spintronic applications due to their unique magnetic properties and tunability. Controlling ferromagnetism via external stimuli is critical for both fundamental research and device integration. In particular, modulation of magnetic anisotropy and exchange interactions through strain offers a viable pathway for functional control. Owing to their weak interlayer coupling, vdW ferromagnets exhibit pronounced sensitivity to strain, enabling effective tuning of their magnetic states. In this study, electric-field-induced magnetoelectric coupling is investigated in the above-room-temperature vdW ferromagnet Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ integrated on a ferroelectric PMN-PT substrate. It is demonstrated that application of an electric field leads to a substantial reduction in coercive force along with dynamic reconfiguration of the magnetic domain structure. These effects are attributed to electric-field-induced modulation of the vdW interlayer gap and enhancement of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. These findings reveal a strong interplay between electric fields and magnetism in vdW systems, offering a viable route toward the development of low-power, multifunctional magnetic devices. This work establishes a foundation for the electric-field control of magnetic properties in vdW ferromagnets and highlights their potential in next-generation spintronic technologies.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the quantum dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle confined to a curved path from the dynamics of a two-dimensional curved thin-layer system incorporating spin connection contributions. We demonstrate that the geodesic curvature, normal curvature, and geodesic torsion govern the emergent non-Abelian gauge potential, while the geodesic and Gaussian curvatures govern the effective scalar potential in the Hamiltonian. The resulting spin precession dynamics induced by the gauge potential are analyzed with and without the adiabatic approximation. Under this approximation, the surface topology is linked to the rotation angle of spin orientation along a surface boundary and to the pseudo-magnetic flux. Spin texture evolution along helices illustrates distinct behaviors under geodesic versus non-geodesic propagation. Furthermore, the spin evolution along Viviani's curve exemplifies surface dependence. The curve's topology ensures closure of the spin direction and independence of the spin from the path direction. Our theory establishes a framework for spin-state manipulation via engineered nanostructured channels, enabling novel topological quantum control strategies.</description>

Abstract: Transmons are widely adopted in quantum computing architectures for their engineered insensitivity to charge noise and correspondingly long relaxation times. Despite this advantage, transmons often exhibit large fluctuations in dephasing times across different devices and also within qubits on the same device. Existing transmon qubits are assumed to be insensitive to charge noise. However, very little recent attention has been paid to the dependence of dephasing on the local charge environment. In this study, we see fluctuations in the dephasing time, $T_{\phi}$, which correlate to charge offset. While charge offset fluctuations are slow, parity switches are fast processes tied to the charge offset and can affect $T_{\phi}$ in Ramsey experiments. We implement a protocol to detect parity switching events using single-shot methods, which are interleaved within a Ramsey measurement. We find that events that remain in the same parity state have a higher $T_2$ than measurements averaged over both parities. Our results show that transmons can be limited by charge-noise, even with $E_\text{J}/E_\text{C} \approx 50$. Consequently, parity flip rates must be considered as a device characterization metric.</description>
