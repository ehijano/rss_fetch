      <title>scPilot: Large Language Model Reasoning Toward Automated Single-Cell Analysis and Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present scPilot, the first systematic framework to practice omics-native reasoning: a large language model (LLM) converses in natural language while directly inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and on-demand bioinformatics tools. scPilot converts core single-cell analyses, i.e., cell-type annotation, developmental-trajectory reconstruction, and transcription-factor targeting, into step-by-step reasoning problems that the model must solve, justify, and, when needed, revise with new evidence.
  To measure progress, we release scBench, a suite of 9 expertly curated datasets and graders that faithfully evaluate the omics-native reasoning capability of scPilot w.r.t various LLMs. Experiments with o1 show that iterative omics-native reasoning lifts average accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation and Gemini-2.5-Pro cuts trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% versus one-shot prompting, while generating transparent reasoning traces explain marker gene ambiguity and regulatory logic. By grounding LLMs in raw omics data, scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses.

      <title>Bidirectional Mamba for Single-Cell Data: Efficient Context Learning with Biological Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables high-resolution analysis of cellular heterogeneity, but its complexity, which is marked by high dimensionality, sparsity, and batch effects, which poses major computational challenges. Transformer-based models have made significant advances in this domain but are often limited by their quadratic complexity and suboptimal handling of long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce GeneMamba, a scalable and efficient foundation model for single-cell transcriptomics built on state space modeling. Leveraging the Bi-Mamba architecture, GeneMamba captures bidirectional gene context with linear-time complexity, offering substantial computational gains over transformer baselines. The model is pretrained on nearly 30 million cells and incorporates biologically informed objectives, including pathway-aware contrastive loss and rank-based gene encoding. We evaluate GeneMamba across diverse tasks, including multi-batch integration, cell type annotation, and gene-gene correlation, demonstrating strong performance, interpretability, and robustness. These results position GeneMamba as a practical and powerful alternative to transformer-based methods, advancing the development of biologically grounded, scalable tools for large-scale single-cell data analysis.</description>
