      <title>Phonon scattering from spatial relaxation of one-dimensional Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the nonequilibrium relaxation of a spatial density modulation in a one-dimensional, weakly interacting Bose gas, and its connection to the equilibrium scattering rate $\smash{\gamma_k\propto k^{3/2}}$ of the system's phononic excitations. We show that the relaxation is generally governed by a nonequilibrium scattering rate $\gamma_{k,t}$ coupled to quantum fluctuations, which approaches its equilibrium value $\gamma_k$ only at long times. Numerical simulations of quantum kinetic equations reveal an algebraic convergence, $\smash{\gamma_{k,t} - \gamma_k \sim t^{-2/3}}$, confirmed by analytical predictions. More broadly, our results establish a theoretical framework for experimentally probing phonon dynamics through the temporal evolution of local perturbations in quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Generalized one-dimensional nonpolynomial Schr\"odinger equation for Bose-Einstein condensates with generic transverse confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a dimensional reduction of Bose-Einstein condensates confined by generalized transverse potentials, parametrized by an exponent $n$. Starting from the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we employ a variational ansatz to derive an effective one-dimensional nonpolynomial Schr\"odinger equation, which self-consistently determines the transverse width dynamics. The model generalizes existing formalisms for cigar- and funnel-shaped geometries. We validate the approach through comprehensive numerical tests, demonstrating excellent agreement with full 3D simulations for ground-state properties across various interaction regimes. Finally, real-time simulations of matter-wave scattering at potential barriers verify the model's dynamical robustness, successfully replicating the spatiotemporal evolution and energy-dependent transmission characteristics observed in full 3D calculations.</description>

      <title>Detecting Collective Excitations in Self-Gravitating Bose-Einstein Condensates via Faraday Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Faraday waves as a probe for collective excitations in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (SGBECs). Using a semi-classical approach based on linear stability analysis of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Newton equations, we derive a damped Mathieu equation governing parametric instabilities. Our analysis reveals well-separated regions of parametric resonance and Jeans instability in parameter space, with distinct growth rate characteristics: Jeans instability decreases monotonically to zero at the critical wavenumber $k_J$, while parametric resonance exhibits non-monotonic behavior with a clear maximum. These findings provide explicit experimental guidelines for accessing the parametric resonance regime. Numerical simulations demonstrate the transition from Faraday wave formation to Jeans collapse as gravitational strength increases, validating our theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Scalable spin squeezing from spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is a property of Hamiltonian equilibrium states which, in the thermodynamic limit, retain a finite average value of an order parameter even after a field coupled to it is adiabatically turned off. In the case of quantum spin models with continuous symmetry, we show that this adiabatic process is also accompanied by the suppression of the fluctuations of the symmetry generator -- namely, the collective spin component along an axis of symmetry. In systems of $S=1/2$ spins or qubits, the combination of the suppression of fluctuations along one direction and of the persistence of transverse magnetization leads to spin squeezing -- a much sought-after property of quantum states, both for the purpose of entanglement detection as well as for metrological uses. Focusing on the case of XXZ models spontaneously breaking a U(1) (or even SU(2)) symmetry, we show that the adiabatically prepared states have nearly minimal spin uncertainty; that the minimum phase uncertainty that one can achieve with these states scales as $N^{-3/4}$ with the number of spins $N$; and that this scaling is attained after an adiabatic preparation time scaling linearly with $N$. Our findings open the door to the adiabatic preparation of strongly spin-squeezed states in a large variety of quantum many-body devices including e.g. optical lattice clocks.</description>

      <title>Orthogonalization speed-up from quantum coherence after a sudden quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nonequilibrium phenomenon, reminiscent of Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe (OC), that arises in the transient dynamics following an interaction quench between a quantum system and a localized defect. Even if the system comprises only a single particle, the overlap between the asymptotic and initial superposition states vanishes according to a power-law scaling with the number of energy eigenstates entering the initial state and an exponent that depends on the interaction strength. The presence of quantum coherence in the initial state is reflected onto the discrete counterpart of an infinite discontinuity in the system spectral function, a hallmark of Anderson's OC, as well as in the quasiprobability distribution of work due to the quench transformation. The positivity loss of the work distribution is directly linked with a reduction of the minimal time imposed by quantum mechanics for the state to orthogonalize. We propose an experimental test of coherence-enhanced orthogonalization dynamics based on Ramsey interferometry of a trapped cold-atom system.</description>
