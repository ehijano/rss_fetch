      <title>Harmonic functions with highly intersecting zero sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the number of isolated zeros of a harmonic map $h:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}^2$ inside the ball of radius $r$ can grow arbitrarily fast with $r$, while its maximal modulus grows in a controlled manner. This result is an analogue, in the context of harmonic maps, of the celebrated Cornalba-Shiffman counterexamples to the transcendental B\'{e}zout problem.</description>

      <title>On those Weights Satisfying a Weak-Type Inequality for the Maximal Operator and Fractional Maximal Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{MR447956}, Muckenhoupt and Wheeden formulated a weighted weak $(p,p)$ inequality where the weight for the weak $L^p$ space is treated as a multiplier rather than a measure. They proved such inequalities for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator and the Hilbert transform for weights in the class $A_p$, while also deriving necessary conditions to characterize the weights for which these estimates hold. In this paper, we establish the sufficiency of these conditions for the maximal operator when $p &gt; 1$ and present corresponding results for the fractional maximal operators. This completes the characterization and resolves the open problem posed by Muckenhoupt and Wheeden for $p &gt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Perturbed lattice crosses and Heisenberg uniqueness pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on two questions raised by H. Hedenmalm and A. Montes-Rodr\'iguez on Heisenberg Uniqueness Pairs for perturbed lattice crosses.
  The first of them deals with a complete characterization of $\beta&gt;0$ for which, for a fixed $\theta \in \mathbb{R},$ the translated lattice cross $\Lambda_{\beta}^{\theta} = ((\mathbb{Z} + \{\theta\}) \times \{0\}) \cup (\{0\} \times \beta \mathbb{Z})$ satisfies that $(\Gamma,\Lambda_{\beta}^{\theta})$ is a Heisenberg Uniqueness Pair, where $\Gamma$ is the hyperbola in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with axes as asymptotes. We show that $(\Gamma,\Lambda_{\beta}^{\theta})$ is a Heisenberg Uniqueness Pair if and only if $\beta \le 1$, confirming a prediction made by Hedenmalm and Montes-Rodr\'iguez.
  Furthermore, under modified decay conditions on the measures under consideration, we are able to prove sharp results for when a perturbed lattice cross $\Lambda_{\bf A,B}$ is such that $(\Gamma,\Lambda_{\bf A,B})$ is a Heisenberg Uniqueness Pair. In particular, under such decay conditions, this solves another question posed by Hedenmalm and Montes-Rodr\'iguez.
  Our techniques run through the analysis of the action of the operator that maps the Fourier transform of an $L^1$ function $\psi$ to the Fourier transform of $t^{-2} \psi(1/t)$. In other words, we analyze the operator taking the restriction to the $x$-axis of a solution $u$ to the Klein-Gordon equation to its restriction to the $y$-axis. This operator turns out to be related to the action of the four-dimensional Fourier transform on radial functions, which enables us to use the framework and techniques of discrete uncertainty principles for the Fourier transform.</description>

      <title>Smoothing of the higher-order Stokes phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For nearly a century and a half the Stokes phenomenon had been perceived as a discontinuous change in the asymptotic representation of a function. In 1989 Berry demonstrated how it is possible to smooth out this discontinuity in broad classes of problems with the prefactor for the exponentially small contribution that is being switched on/off taking the universal form of an error function. Following pioneering work of Berk {\it et al.} \cite{BNR82} and the Japanese school of formally exact asymptotics \cite{Aokietal1994,AKT01}, the concept of the higher-order Stokes phenomenon was introduced in \cite{HLO04} and \cite{CM05}, whereby the ability for the exponentially small terms to cause a Stokes phenomenon may change, depending on the values of parameters in the problem, corresponding to the associated singularities in the Borel plane transitioning between different Riemann sheets. Until now, the higher-order Stokes phenomenon has also been treated as a discontinuous event. In this paper we show how the higher-order Stokes phenomenon is, in fact, also smooth and occurs universally with a prefactor that takes the form of a new special function, based on a Gaussian convolution of an error function that gives rise to a rich structure. We provide a rigorous derivation of the result, with examples spanning the gamma function, a second-order nonlinear ODE and the telegraph equation, giving rise to a ghost-like smooth contribution that is present in the vicinity of a Stokes line, but which rapidly tends to zero on either side. We also include a rigorous derivation and example of the effect of the smoothed higher-order Stokes phenomenon on the individual terms in the asymptotic series, where the additional contributions appear prefactored by an error function.</description>

      <title>Framing global structural identifiability in terms of parameter symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key initial step in mechanistic modelling of dynamical systems using first-order ordinary differential equations is to conduct a global structural identifiability analysis. This entails deducing which parameter combinations can be estimated from certain observed outputs. The standard differential algebra approach answers this question by re-writing the model as a system of ordinary differential equations solely depending on the observed outputs. Over the last decades, alternative approaches for analysing global structural identifiability based on so-called full symmetries, which are Lie symmetries acting on independent and dependent variables as well as parameters, have been proposed. However, the link between the standard differential algebra approach and that using full symmetries remains elusive. In this work, we establish this link by introducing the notion of parameter symmetries, which are a special type of full symmetry that alter parameters while preserving the observed outputs. Our main result states that a parameter combination is structurally identifiable if and only if it is a differential invariant of all parameter symmetries of a given model. We show that the standard differential algebra approach is consistent with the concept of considering structural identifiability in terms of parameter symmetries. We present an alternative symmetry-based approach, referred to as the CaLinInv-recipe, for analysing structural identifiability using parameter symmetries. Lastly, we demonstrate our approach on a glucose-insulin model and an epidemiological model of tuberculosis.</description>

      <title>Parabolic Muckenhoupt Weights Characterized by Parabolic Fractional Maximal and Integral Operators with Time Lag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, motivated by the regularity theory of the solutions of doubly nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations the authors introduce the off-diagonal two-weight version of the parabolic Muckenhoupt class with time lag. Then the authors introduce the uncentered parabolic fractional maximal operator with time lag and characterize its two-weighted boundedness (including the endpoint case) via these weights under an extra mild assumption (which is not necessary for one-weight case). The most novelty of this article exists in that the authors further introduce a new parabolic shaped domain and its corresponding parabolic fractional integral with time lag and, moreover, applying the aforementioned two-weighted boundedness of the uncentered parabolic fractional maximal operator with time lag, the authors characterize the (two-)weighted boundedness (including the endpoint case) of these parabolic fractional integrals in terms of the off-diagonal (two-weight) parabolic Muckenhoupt class with time lag; as applications, the authors further establish a parabolic weighted Sobolev embedding and a priori estimate for the solution of the heat equation. The key tools to achieve these include the parabolic Calder\'on--Zygmund-type decomposition, the chaining argument, and the parabolic Welland inequality which is obtained by making the utmost of the geometrical relation between the parabolic shaped domain and the parabolic rectangle.</description>

      <title>Voronoi summation formulas, oscillations of Riesz sums, and Ramanujan-Guinand and Cohen type identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive Vorono\"{\dotlessi} summation formulas for the Liouville function $\lambda(n)$, the M\"{o}bius function $\mu(n)$, and for $d^{2}(n)$, where $d(n)$ is the divisor function. The formula for $\lambda(n)$ requires explicit evaluation of certain infinite series for which the use of the Vinogradov-Korobov zero-free region of the Riemann zeta function is indispensable. Several results of independent interest are obtained as special cases of these formulas. For example, a special case of the one for $\mu(n)$ is a famous result of Ramanujan, Hardy, and Littlewood. Cohen type and Ramanujan-Guinand type identities are established for $\lambda(n)$ and $\sigma_a(n)\sigma_b(n)$, where $\sigma_s(n)$ is the generalized divisor function. As expected, infinite series over the non-trivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$ now form an essential part of all of these formulas. A series involving $\sigma_a(n)\sigma_b(n)$ and product of modified Bessel functions occurring in one of our identities has appeared in a recent work of Dorigoni and Treilis in string theory. Lastly, we obtain results on oscillations of Riesz sums associated to $\lambda(n), \mu(n)$ and of the error term of Riesz sum of $d^2(n)$ under the assumption of the Riemann Hypothesis, simplicity of the zeros of $\zeta(s)$, the Linear Independence conjecture, and a weaker form of the Gonek-Hejhal conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a new observability property for nonautonomous linear control systems in finite dimension; the nonuniform complete observability, which is more general than the uniform complete observability. The main result of this work will prove that nonuniform complete observability is preserved via output feedback. In addition, the duality between this concept and the recently introduced concept of nonuniform complete controllability will be proved, leading to the result of preservation of nonuniform complete controllability via input feedback.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Unpredictable Solutions of Quasilinear Impulsive Systems with Regular Discontinuity Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of asymptotic unpredictability was recently introduced in (Commun. Nonlinear Sci. Numer. Simul. 134, 108029, 2024) for semiflows. Likewise unpredictable trajectories, asymptotically unpredictable ones are also capable of producing sensitivity in a dynamics, which is an indispensable feature of chaos. In the present study, we newly propose piecewise continuous asymptotically unpredictable functions, and investigate the existence and uniqueness of such solutions in a quasilinear impulsive system of differential equations comprising a term which is periodic in the time argument. The class of functions and the impulsive system under discussion admit regular discontinuity moments. Some techniques for obtaining discontinuous asymptotically unpredictable functions are additionally provided. Even though piecewise continuous unpredictable functions are asymptotically unpredictable, it is demonstrated that the converse is not true. In other words, the set of discontinuous unpredictable functions is properly contained in the set of asymptotically unpredictable ones. Appropriate examples are given with regard to all theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of excited states to $-\Delta u+u-u^3=0$ in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.08356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the uniqueness of several excited states to the ODE $\ddot y(t) + \frac{2}{t} \dot y(t) + f(y(t)) = 0$, $y(0) = b$, and $\dot y(0) = 0$ for the model nonlinearity $f(y) = y^3 - y$. The $n$-th excited state is a solution with exactly $n$ zeros and which tends to $0$ as $t \to \infty$. These represent all smooth radial nonzero solutions to the PDE $\Delta u + f(u)= 0$ in $H^1$. We interpret the ODE as a damped oscillator governed by a double-well potential, and the result is proved via rigorous numerical analysis of the energy and variation of the solutions. More specifically, the problem of uniqueness can be formulated entirely in terms of inequalities on the solutions and their variation, and these inequalities can be verified numerically.</description>

Abstract: We prove that a self-similar Cantor set in $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ has a fractal uncertainty principle if and only if it does not contain a pair of orthogonal lines. The key ingredient in our proof is a quantitative form of Lang's conjecture in number theory due to Ruppert and Beukers &amp; Smyth. Our theorem answers a question of Dyatlov and has applications to open quantum maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if a fractal set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ avoids lines in a certain quantitative sense, which we call line porosity, then it has a fractal uncertainty principle. The main ingredient is a new higher dimensional Beurling-Malliavin multiplier theorem.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory integrals and weighted gradient flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate estimating scalar oscillatory integrals by integrating by parts in directions based on $(x_1 \partial_{x_1} f(x) ,..., x_n \partial_{x_n}f(x))$, where $f(x)$ is the phase function. We prove a theorem which provides estimates that are uniform with respect to linear perturbations of the phase and investigate some consequences. When the phase function is quasi-homogeneous the theorem gives estimates for the associated surface measure Fourier transforms that are generally not too far off from being sharp. In addition, the theorem provides a new proof, up to endpoints, that the well-known oscillatory integral estimates of Varchenko [V] when the Newton polyhedron of the phase function is nondegenerate extend to corresponding bounds for surface measure Fourier transforms when the index is less than $\frac{1}{2}$. A sharp version of this was originally proven in [G2].</description>

      <title>Characterization of boundedness on Wiener amalgam spaces of multilinear Rihaczek distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give several characterizations for the boundedness of multilinear Rihaczek distributions acting from Wiener amalgam spaces to modulation and Fourier modulation spaces. Moreover, we establish the crucial self-improvement property which has its independent significance. As applications, sharp exponents are established for the boundedness in several typical cases. Correspondingly, the boundedness of pseudodifferential operators on Wiener amalgam spaces with symbols in modulation and Fourier modulation spaces are also established. In some typical cases, we also give the sharp exponents for the boundedness of pseudodifferential operators, including the recapture and essential extensions of the main results in \cite[IMRN, (10):1860-1893, (2010)]{CorderoNicola2010IMRNI} and \cite[JFAA, 23(4):810-816, (2017)]{Cunanan2017JoFAaA}.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-Squares &amp; Gaussian Processes I: Certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of distributions which may be considered as a smoothed probabilistic version of the ultrametric property that famously characterizes the Gibbs distributions of various spin glass models. This class of \emph{high-entropy step} (HES) distributions is expressive enough to capture a distribution achieving near-optimal average energy on spin glass models in the so-called full Replica-Symmetry Breaking (fRSB) regime.
  Simultaneously, with high probability, there are polynomial-size certificates on the average energy achievable by \emph{any} HES distribution which are tight within a constant factor. These certificates can be found in polynomial time by a semidefinite program corresponding to a sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy we introduce, termed the HES SoS hierarchy. This improves over classical sum-of-squares certificates which are loose by a factor of $n^{\lfloor p/2 - 1\rfloor/2}$.</description>

      <title>Sampling in quasi shift-invariant spaces and Gabor frames generated by ratios of exponential polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two families of generators (functions) $\mathcal{G}$ that consist of entire and meromorphic functions enjoying a certain periodicity property and contain the classical Gaussian and hyperbolic secant generators. Sharp results are proved on the density of separated sets that provide non-uniform sampling for the shift-invariant and quasi shift-invariant spaces generated by elements of these families. As an application, we obtain new sharp results on the density of semi-regular lattices for the Gabor frames generated by elements from these families.</description>

      <title>Generating QES potentials supporting zero energy normalizable states for an extended class of truncated Calogero Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent interest in the search for generating potentials for which the underlying Schr\"{o}dinger equation is solvable, we report in the recent work several situations when a zero-energy state becomes bound depending on certain restrictions on the coupling constants that define the potential. In this regard, we present evidence of the existence of regular zero-energy normalizable solutions for a system of quasi-exactly solvable (QES) potentials that correspond to the rationally extended many-body truncated Calogero-Sutherland (TCS) model. Our procedure is based upon the use of the standard potential group approach with an underlying $so(2, 1)$ structure that utilizes a point canonical transformation with three distinct types of potentials emerging having the same eigenvalues while their common properties are subjected to the evaluation of the relevant wave functions. These cases are treated individually by suitably restricting the coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>Existence of solitary waves in particle lattices with power-law forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of small solitary waves for one-dimensional lattices of particles that each repel every other particle with a force that decays as a power of distance. For force exponents $\alpha+1$ with $\frac43&lt;\alpha&lt;3$, we employ fixed-point arguments to find near-sonic solitary waves having scaled velocity profiles close to non-degenerate solitary-wave profiles of fractional KdV or generalized Benjamin-Ono equations. These equations were recently found to approximately govern unidirectional long-wave motions in these lattices.</description>
