      <title>High-magnitude, spatially variable, and sustained strain engineering of 2D semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors often combine high elasticity and in-plane strength, making them ideal for strain-induced tuning of electronic characteristics, akin to strategies used in silicon electronics. However, current techniques fall short in achieving high-magnitude (&gt;1%), spatially resolved, and stable strain in these materials. Here, we apply biaxial tensile strain up to 2.2%, with +/-0.12% resolution over micrometre-scale regions in monolayer MoS2 via conformal transfer onto patterned substrates fabricated using two-photon lithography. The induced strain is stable for months and enables local band gap tuning of ~0.4 eV in monolayer MoS2, ~25% of its intrinsic band gap. This represents a distinct demonstration of simultaneous high-magnitude, spatially resolved, and sustained strain in 2D monolayers. We further extend the approach to bilayer WS2-MoS2 heterostructures. This strain-engineering technique opens a new regime of strain-enabled control in 2D semiconductors to support the development of wide-spectrum optoelectronic devices and nanoelectronics with engineered electronic landscapes.</description>

      <title>First-principles phonon physics using the Pheasy code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameter-free calculations of lattice dynamics from first principles have achieved significant progress in the past decades, with a wealth of applications in thermodynamics, phase transitions, and transport properties of materials. Current approaches to derive the interatomic force constants (IFCs) of lattice potential become challenging and sometimes infeasible when going beyond third-order anharmonicity, due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of higher-order IFCs. In this work, we present a robust and user-friendly program, Pheasy, which accurately reconstructs the potential energy surface of crystalline solids via a Taylor expansion of arbitrarily high order. Given force-displacement datasets, the program enables an efficient and accurate extraction of IFCs using advanced machine-learning algorithms, and further calculates a wide range of harmonic and anharmonic phonon related properties. We show in three prototypical examples how the obtained IFCs have been successfully applied to study anharmonic lattice dynamics and thermal transport. Through these detailed benchmarks, we have also identified the optimal approach for IFC extractions and offered general guidelines for high-fidelity lattice-dynamical simulations, addressing the large uncertainties in the IFCs extracted from existing various schemes. Overall, the Pheasy project aims to create a phonon code ecosystem that connects diverse phonon simulation platforms and offers access to the broad research community.</description>

      <title>Construction and Tuning of CALPHAD Models Using Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials and Experimental Data: A Case Study of the Pt-W System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces PhaseForgePlus -- a computationally efficient, fully open-source workflow for physically-informed CALPHAD model generation and parameter fitting. Using the Pt-W system as an example, we show that the integration of Machine Learning Potentials into the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit can produce physically grounded Gibbs energy descriptions requiring only slight adjustments to produce accurate phase diagrams. Employing the Jansson derivative method in the context of experimental observations, such adjustments can be efficiently and robustly determined through gradient-informed optimization procedures.</description>

      <title>Optimizing $\alpha''$-Fe$_{16}$N$_2$ as permanent magnet via alloying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on systematic first-principles calculations, we investigate the effects of 27 alloying elements on the intrinsic magnetic properties of Fe$_{16}$N$_2$, in order to further optimize its properties for permanent magnet applications. Analysis on the thermodynamic stabilities based on formation energy and distance to the convex hull reveals that 20 elements can be substituted into Fe$_{16}$N$_2$, where there is no strong site-preference upon doping. It is observed that all alloying elements can essentially reduce the saturation magnetization, whereas the magnetic anisotropy can be significantly modified. In terms of the Boltzmann-average intrinsic properties, we identify 8 elements as interesting candidates, with Co, Mo, and W as the most promising cases for further experimental validations.</description>

      <title>A Crystallographic Metric for Continuous Quantification of Unit Cell Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing the deviation of a real structure from a hypothetical higher-symmetry ideal can be a powerful tool to understand and interpret phase transitions. Here we introduce a simple yet effective metric that quantifies the degree of unit cell distortion relative to a cube, called the cubic deviation metric. This enables continuous comparisons between unit cells of different geometries. We demonstrate the potential of this tool with four separate case study applications to real material systems: 1) discontinuous structural phase transitions in pseudobrookites; 2) homological structure classification; 3) structure-correlated piezoelectricity in hexagonal materials; and 4) superconducting materials design in the cuprate family. Although this metric does not replace detailed structural or group theory analysis, it enables comparison across different compositional and structural compound variants, even in the presence of disorder or absence of group-subgroup correlation.</description>

      <title>Magnetism at the interface of $MoSe_2/V_2O_5$ heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetism in doped transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers and van der Waals interfaced materials have motivated the search for sustainable magnetic states at the nanoscale with the prospect of building devices for spintronics applications. In this study, we report the existence of magnetism in a heterostructure made up of an $MoSe_2$ transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer and a $V_2O_5$ substrate. Using density functional theory simulations, we find that ferromagnetic ordering can be found in the $MoSe_2/V_2O_5$ heterostructure even though the individual components are nonmagnetic. By examining the electronic structure and magnetic properties of this system we find how the occurring ferromagnetism evolves if the transition metal dichalcogenide or the $V_2O_5$ substrate can host point defects. Our study suggests that the balance between charge transfer and spin reorganization can lead to interface magnetism in novel hybrid materials.</description>

      <title>Study of Optical Properties of MOCVD-Grown Rutile GeO2 Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rutile germanium dioxide (r-GeO$_2$) is a promising ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductor, offering a high theoretical Baliga figure of merit, potential for p-type doping, and favorable thermal and electrical properties. In this work, we present a comprehensive optical investigation of crystalline r-GeO$_2$ thin films grown on r-TiO$_2$ (001) substrates via metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy reveals broad visible emissions with distinct peaks near 470~nm and 520~nm. CL mapping indicates enhanced emission intensity in regions with larger crystalline domains, highlighting the correlation between domain size and optical quality. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirms the presence of Ge$^{4+}$ oxidation state and provides a bandgap estimation of $\sim$4.75~eV based on valence band and secondary electron cutoff analysis. UV--Vis transmittance measurements show a sharp absorption edge near 250--260~nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap in the range of 4.81--5.0~eV. These findings offer valuable insights into the defect-related emission behavior and band-edge characteristics of r-GeO$_2$, reinforcing its potential for future applications in power electronics and deep-ultraviolet optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of disordered crystalline premixing in sputter-deposited Ni(V)/Al multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sputter deposition of alternating layers of Ni(V) and Al forms a reactive multilayer known to undergo self-propagating formation reactions when ignited. The sequential deposition process leads to nm-scale premixing of reactants at each included interface which ultimately affects multilayer exothermicity. This work performs the direct measurement of a disordered face-centered cubic (FCC) solid solution premixed phase at the interfaces of Ni(V)/Al multilayers via scanning transmission electron microscopy. The crystallinity of the observed phase differs from previously reported a priori predictions of an amorphous interlayer. The disordered FCC phase retains its symmetry after annealing for 16 h at 135 C, but the lattice parameter shifts consistent with an Al-rich composition. The existence of a crystalline premix in Ni(V)/Al is attributed to the electronic contribution to the entropy of crystallization.</description>

      <title>Local interface effects modulate global charge order and optical properties of 1T-TaS$_2$/1H-WSe$_2$ heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1T-TaS$_2$ is a layered charge density wave (CDW) crystal exhibiting sharp phase transitions and associated resistance changes. These resistance steps could be exploited for information storage, underscoring the importance of controlling and tuning CDW states. Given the importance of out-of-plane interactions in 1T-TaS$_2$, modulating interlayer interactions by heterostructuring is a promising method for tailoring CDW phase transitions. In this work, we investigate the optical and electronic properties of heterostructures comprising 1T-TaS$_2$ and monolayer 1H-WSe$_2$. By systematically varying the thickness of 1T-TaS$_2$ and its azimuthal alignment with 1H-WSe$_2$, we find that intrinsic moir\'e strain and interfacial charge transfer introduce CDW disorder in 1T-TaS$_2$ and modify the CDW ordering temperature. Furthermore, our studies reveal that the interlayer alignment impacts the exciton dynamics in 1H-WSe$_2$, indicating that heterostructuring can concurrently tailor the electronic phases in 1T-TaS$_2$ and the optical properties of 1H-WSe$_2$. This work presents a promising approach for engineering optoelectronic behavior of heterostructures that integrate CDW materials and semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport and the impact of hydrogen adsorption in Linde Type A zeolitic imidazolate frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal transport in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is of practical interest in diverse applications such as gas storage and separations, since insufficient heat dissipation can lead to detrimental effects. Despite investigations, influence of molecular infiltration on the heat transport remains unclear in many of MOFs due to poor understanding of mechanisms governing heat conductions. Here, we report molecular dynamics investigations of thermal transport properties in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). We investigated Linde Type A topological ZIFs (ZIF-lta) exhibiting exceptionally low thermal conductivity with unusual trend of temperature dependence deviating from many crystalline materials, despite long-range crystalline order in them. We demonstrate that heat is predominantly carried by phonons with mean free paths comparable to their wavelengths, analogous to diffusons in amorphous solids owing to strong anharmonicity caused by complexity of unit cell consisting of a large number of metal centers. We further show that adsorbed hydrogen molecules increase thermal conductivity of ZIFs, mainly contributed by additional vibrational modes, as a result of gas-gas or gas-framework interactions. Our work advances fundamental understanding into the thermal transport in MOFs and suggests a means to engineer heat conduction via gas infiltrations.</description>

      <title>A Non-Local Orientation Field Phase-Field Model for Misorientation- and Inclination- Dependent Grain Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to incorporate grain boundary (GB) anisotropy in phase-field modeling by extending the standard partial differential equations formulation to include a non-local functional of an orientation field. Regardless of the number of grains in the simulation, the model uses a single orientation field and incorporates grain misorientation and inclination information obtained from sampling the orientation field at optimized locations in the vicinity of the grain boundary. The formalism enables simple and precise tuning of GB energy anisotropy while avoiding an extensive fitting procedure. The functional includes an explicit GB anisotropy function to control the GB energy as a function of both misorientation and inclination. The model is validated by reproducing the linear grain growth rate, Wulff shapes with varying misorientations and anisotropic coefficients, and analytical equilibrium dihedral angles at triple junctions. Polycrystalline simulations demonstrate grain growth, coalescence, triple junction behavior, and the influence of anisotropy on grain morphology.</description>

      <title>A Novel Methodology of Visualizing Orthorhombic Phase Uniformity in Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Devices Using Piezoresponse Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) thin films are promising for next-generation memory and logic devices due to their CMOS compatibility and scalability. The spatial uniformity of the orthorhombic (O) phase is crucial for optimizing ferroelectric properties like remnant polarization. This work introduces a novel piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) approach for 2D mapping of O-phase uniformity in HZO films (5 nm, 9 nm, and 20 nm), further quantifing O-phase distribution by distinguishing polarized O-phase regions from non-polarized tetragonal/monoclinic (T/M) phases. Our results reveal that the 9 nm film exhibits the most uniform O-phase and highest remnant polarization. This PFM-based method enables comprehensive phase characterization without requiring complicated facilities, broadening access to phase analysis and advancing ferroelectric thin-film research for memory and logic applications.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced Low Spin to High Spin Transition in a [2x2] Fe(II) Metallogrid: Diode Laser-Pumped Photocrystallography at the P11 Beamline in PETRA III, DESY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the photoinduced spin crossover (SCO) transition from a 2HS-2LS to a 3HS-1LS state in a [2x2] Fe(II) metallogrid complex using molecular crystals with static photocrystallography at a first ever attempt in the beamline P11 of the PETRA III synchrotron, DESY. A class 3B diode laser was used to induce the transition under controlled irradiation conditions. Structural characterization was achieved through single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) measurements post-irradiation, revealing significant changes in average Fe-N distances, consistent with SCO behavior. Our experimental setup enables precise alignment necessary for photo-excitation using a class 3B diode laser along with a compact focusing optics. The longest dimension of the combined setup of the diode head and the focusing optics is not more than 32cm. The setup showcasing the utility of a compact diode laser system which can even be conveniently used in synchrotron-based pump-probe photocrystallography experiments for a wide range of molecular crystals.</description>

      <title>Optical properties of emeraldine salt polymers from ab initio calculations: comparison with recent experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present absorption coefficient {\alpha}({\omega}), transverse dielectric function {\epsilon}({\omega}), optical conductivity {\sigma}({\omega}), and reflectance R({\omega}) calculated for an emeraldine salt conducting polymer in its crystalline three-dimensional polaronic structure. We utilize Kohn-Sham DFT electronic wavefunctions and energies implemented in the expression of the macroscopic transverse dielectric function in the framework of the band theory without the electron-hole interaction. Contributions of intra-band transitions are taken into account by adding a Drude-like term to the dielectric function calculated ab-initio. Comparison with optical properties, recently measured on high-quality emeraldine salts (Nature 441(2006)65-68), and with optical absorption spectra, recorded on other emeraldine salts, is very satisfactory. The calculated spectra are discussed in terms of energy-band structure, density of states, inter- and intra-band transitions and transverse dielectric function.</description>

Abstract: Phase-field models accurately simulate microstructure evolution, but their dependence on solving complex differential equations makes them computationally expensive. This work achieves a significant acceleration via a novel deep learning-based framework, utilizing a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) coupled with Cubic Spline Interpolation and Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP). We demonstrate the method for binary spinodal decomposition by predicting microstructure evolution for intermediate alloy compositions from a limited set of training compositions. First, using microstructures from phase-field simulations of binary spinodal decomposition, we train the CVAE, which learns compact latent representations that encode essential morphological features. Next, we use cubic spline interpolation in the latent space to predict microstructures for any unknown composition. Finally, SLERP ensures smooth morphological evolution with time that closely resembles coarsening. The predicted microstructures exhibit high visual and statistical similarity to phase-field simulations. This framework offers a scalable and efficient surrogate model for microstructure evolution, enabling accelerated materials design and composition optimization.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale variations of chemical and electronic landscape on the surface of Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ visualized by ARPES and XPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiple crystalline terminations in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ display distinct topological and trivial surface states, which have successfully been distinguished experimentally. However, a model of pure terminations is known to be inadequate because these surfaces exhibit a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and point disorder. Here we perform a spectromicroscopy study of the surface chemistry and surface electronic structure using photoemission measurements in combination with first-principles calculations of core levels. We identify an intermediate region with properties distinct from both the sulfur and tin terminations, and demonstrate that the spectral features in this region can be associated with a disordered tin termination with a varying density of surface tin-vacancies. Finally, we show how a combination of algorithmic and machine learning analysis of photoemission data can be used to extract identifying features, classify spatial regions, and correlate local chemistry with local electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Focused Ion Beam patterning of MnSb(1-101) based spintronic devcies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low temperature transport measurements are presented of ferromagnetic MnSb devices with the magnetic properties patterned using a Ga focused ion beam FIB system at 30 keV. FIB patterning introduces disorder and this is quantified in this paper through measurements of the longitudinal resistivity and the anomalous Hall effect contribution to the Hall conductivity. The MnSb structural phase is the niccolite phase with a surface state in addition to bulk states. FIB doses up to 1E16 Ga ions per square cm reduces the anisotropic magnetoresistance signal but increases the size of the anomalous Hall effect signal in out of plane magnetic fields, B. The anomalous Hall effect contribution to the Hall conductivity is e squared divided by h in the undamaged devices, where e is the electronic charge and h is Plancks constant. This quantity is sensitive to the level of disorder induced by the Ga ion beam, reducing to zero at dose levels greater than 1E16 Ga ions per square cm. The resistivity shows a logarithmic B dependence after the magnetization has saturated with the low field anisotropic magnetoresistance contribution of 0.12 percent. The conductivity change is e squared divided by h in the magnetic field range of logarithmic B behavior. The resistivity shows a reduced fit to a logarithmic B dependence at high FIB dose levels and is dependent on the damage uniformity. Patterning nanostructured magnetic behavior in MnSb, with compatibility to altermagnetic materials, in particular the niccolite phase of CrSb and non trivial Berry phase contributions to transport make this ferromagnetic material and patterning technique useful for future spintronic device development.</description>

      <title>Reducing critical current for spin-transfer-torque-induced magnetization reversal in CPP-GMR devices: effect of low damping and enhanced spin scattering asymmetry in $Co_2FeGa_{0.5}Ge_{0.5}$ Heusler alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-transfer torque (STT) in magnetoresistance devices has enabled key applications such as STT-magnetoresistive random access memory, spin torque oscillators, and energy-assisted magnetic recording. In the device structures, where a free layer (FL) magnetization is manipulated by spin injection from a spin injection layer (SIL), the critical current density required for operation is directly proportional to the damping ($\alpha$) constant of FL and inversely proportional to the STT efficiency, which depends on the spin polarization ($P$) of the materials. Here, we investigate the effect of low $\alpha$ and high $P$ of $Co_2FeGa_{0.5}Ge_{0.5}$(CFGG) Heusler alloy on the operation current required for STT-induced magnetization reversal in current perpendicular-to-plane giant magnetoresistance devices. Devices with CFGG as a FL material achieved a large reduction in the operation current, as compared to those with conventional NiFe-FL owing to the very low $\alpha$ of CFGG, demonstrating the advantage of CFGG as a FL material. As the advantage of high spin polarization CFGG for SIL, we analyzed the effect of bilayer SIL consisting of CoFe and thin CFGG layers, focusing on utilizing the spin scattering asymmetry at the CoFe/CFGG interface. Devices with the CoFe/CFGG-SIL exhibited the lowest critical current, demonstrating enhanced STT efficiency. In addition, the correlation of STT efficiency with magnetoresistance ratio were comprehensively investigated, showing that device-to-device distribution in STT-efficiency was smaller in CoFe/CFGG-SIL. These findings highlight the potential of CFGG Heusler alloy and CoFe/CFGG bilayer structures as key components for the development of efficient and stable STT-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic physical properties of flexible van der Waals semiconductor InSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: InSe is a van der Waals semiconductor in which mechanical flexibility, high electronic mobility, and non-trivial electronic structures converge, making it an attractive platform for both intriguing fundamental studies and promising device developments. However, the nucleation and growth of phase-pure, intrinsic InSe crystals require stringent thermodynamical conditions, and have therefore remained elusive. Since InSe melts incongruently, the widely used synthesis methods based on cooling of a 1:1 In-Se mixture will produce either aggregates of multiphase crystallites or uncontrolled In-rich, heavily electron-doped InSe. This fundamental thermodynamic constraint provides a compelling explanation for the large discrepancies observed in the reported physical properties of InSe. We overcome these limitations by utilizing the traveling solvent floating zone (TSFZ) method to produce high quality, centimeter-size InSe single crystals. Electrical, thermal, and thermoelectric transport measurements demonstrate that TSFZ-InSe single crystals closely approach the intrinsic limit, establishing it as a benchmark material for the future studies of this important material.</description>

      <title>Emerging electro-optic molecular crystals for optoelectronic integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of communication technology necessitates the development of hybrid optical modulators that integrate silicon photonics with electro-optic (EO) materials to enable ultrafast, low-power, and compact photonic devices. However, no existing material simultaneously meets the requirements for high EO performance, process compatibility, and thermal stability, which are essential for practical optoelectronic integration. Here, we present 4-(4'-nitrophenylazo)diphenylamine (NDPA) and its derivative, novel nonlinear optical molecular crystals discovered through materials screening incorporating crystal habit prediction. They demonstrate crystallization into high-quality aligned thin films and ultrafine silicon slot fillings through the capillary action of melts. The resulting EO performance much exceed that of conventional lithium niobate and are comparable to state-of-the-art EO polymers, with excellent thermal stability maintained for over 1000 hours at 393 K. The present EO materials satisfying all the requirements above are promising candidates for silicon-organic hybrid optical modulators, opening a significant step toward scalable and high-performance optoelectronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Orientational Effects in the Low Pair Continuum of Aluminium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the predictions of the dynamic structure factor (DSF) of ambient polycrystalline aluminium from time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) in the pair continuum regime to recent ultrahigh resolution x-ray Thomson scattering measurements, collected at the European XFEL. TDDFT predicts strong anisotropy in the DSF at the wavenumber examined here, even with $q$-blurring accounted for. The experimental spectrum has more than sufficient resolution and signal-to-noise levels to resolve these orientation dependencies, and therefore the orientational averaging of the polycrystalline sample is observed rigorously. Once the orientation averaging is accounted for, TDDFT is able to reproduce the experimental spectrum adequately. Finally, comparisons of predicted DSFs from jellium to experiment demonstrates the importance of accounting for lattice effects in modelling the spectrum from a polycrystal.</description>

      <title>Cavity-QED-controlled two-dimensional Moir\'e Excitons without twisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an all-optical Moir\'e-like exciton confinement by means of spatially periodic optical cavities. Such periodic photonic structures can control the material properties by coupling the matter excitations to the confined photons and their quantum fluctuations. We develop a low energy non-perturbative quantum electro-dynamical description of strongly coupled excitons and photons at finite momentum transfer. We find that in the classical limit of a laser driven cavity the induced optical confinement directly emulates Moir\'e physics. In a dark cavity instead, the sole presence of quantum fluctuations of light generates a sizable renormalization of the excitonic bands and effective mass. We attribute these effects to long-range cavity-mediated exciton-exciton interactions which can only be captured in a non-perturbative treatment. With these findings we propose spatially structured cavities as a promising avenue for cavity material engineering.</description>

      <title>Avalanche Dynamics in Stick-Slip Cutting of Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated nanoscale wear on multilayered MoS2, the flagship transition metal dichalcogenide, by elastically driving sharp diamond tips under normal loads sufficient to induce in-plane fracture. The accompanying friction and the resulting wear structures were first characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), revealing a stick-slip regime that drives progressive exfoliation of MoS2 chips. At high normal forces, the slip phase displays hallmark signatures of avalanche dynamics, observed for the first time at the nanoscale, evidenced by a Generalized Extreme Value distribution of friction force drops. The AFM characterization is corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations, which reproduce experimental trends and uncover atomistic details of the wear process, including local amorphization, layer curving, and the involvement of distinct dissipative channels. Notably, it appears that only one-fifth of the energy inputted into the system is used to damage the MoS2 surface irreversibly. These results offer new insight into the physical mechanisms governing friction and wear in layered solids and provide a framework for precision cutting and nanomachining in van der Waals materials, relevant to next-generation devices at sub-micrometer scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation and control of spin currents are crucial for advancing next-generation spintronic technologies. These technologies depend on materials capable of efficiently sourcing and interconverting spin and charge currents, while overcoming some limitations associated with conventional ferromagnets and heavy metals. Kagome topological antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetals, such as Mn$_3$Sn, present unique advantages owing to their distinct magnetic order and significant Berry curvature-driven transport phenomena. In this study, we systematically investigate spin current generation and spin-to-charge conversion phenomena in epitaxial (0001)-oriented Mn$_3$Sn thin films. Our findings reveal a spin Hall angle of 0.9$\%$ and a nearly isotropic in-plane spin Hall conductivity of 44.4~($\hbar$/e) $\Omega^{-1}$.cm$^{-1}$ at room temperature, originating from a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic contributions, as discussed in light of first-principle calculations. Furthermore, in Mn$_3$Sn(0001)/Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ heterostructures, we observe a high spin-mixing conductance of 28.52 nm$^{-2}$ and an interfacial spin-transparency of approximately 72$\%$. Notably, we also find that the spin diffusion length in Mn$_3$Sn(0001) epitaxial films exceeds 15 nm at room temperature. Our results highlight the potential of the topological Weyl noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn as an efficient material for spin transport and conversion in prospective spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Automated Construction of Artificial Lattice Structures with Designer Electronic States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating matter with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) enables creation of atomically defined artificial structures that host designer quantum states. However, the time-consuming nature of the manipulation process, coupled with the sensitivity of the STM tip, constrains the exploration of diverse configurations and limits the size of designed features. In this study, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for creating artificial structures by spatially manipulating carbon monoxide (CO) molecules on a copper substrate using the STM tip. The automated workflow combines molecule detection and manipulation, employing deep learning-based object detection to locate CO molecules and linear assignment algorithms to allocate these molecules to designated target sites. We initially perform molecule maneuvering based on randomized parameter sampling for sample bias, tunneling current setpoint and manipulation speed. This dataset is then structured into an action trajectory used to train an RL agent. The model is subsequently deployed on the STM for real-time fine-tuning of manipulation parameters during structure construction. Our approach incorporates path planning protocols coupled with active drift compensation to enable atomically precise fabrication of structures with significantly reduced human input while realizing larger-scale artificial lattices with desired electronic properties. To underpin of efficiency of our approach we demonstrate the automated construction of an extended artificial graphene lattice and confirm the existence of characteristic Dirac point in its electronic structure. Further challenges to RL-based structural assembly scalability are discussed.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Epsilon-WO3 Nanoparticles and Its Bipolaron Driven Opto-electronic Properties at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unique polymorph of binary tungsten trioxide, the epsilon phase of WO3, has non-centrosymmetric ferroelectric structure, typically stable below -43 degree C in bulk. We have stabilized the epsilon-WO3 at room temperature (RT) and nanostructured powders via flame spray pyrolysis synthesis. These nanopowders are drop cast into uniform thin films to enable RT measurement of ferroelectric and optoelectronic properties. We report ferroelectric hysteresis, nanoscale domains, and dipole switching measured via Piezo-response force microscopy (PFM). The epsilon-WO3 films also display optical second harmonic generation (SHG) and anticlockwise ferroelectric butterfly capacitance versus voltage hysteresis, further demonstrating the ferroelectric nature of epsilon-WO3. Remarkably, epsilon-WO3 shows ferroelectric polarization responses to optical stimuli and form bipolaron at RT, a spin-zero quasiparticle previously found only in cryogenic temperatures. The bipolaron formation and its interaction with electro-optical stimuli results in a single layer solid-state blue coloration, a ferrochromic effect. A mechanism of the ferrochromic effect is discussed. In summary, epsilon-WO3 appears to be a ferroelectric with the simplest structure, forming bosonic spin-zero bipolaron at RT, and it's dipoles respond to opto-electrical signals; therefore, this material holds significant promise for transforming the field of optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Interface Structure and Electronic Properties in Cubic Boron Nitride - Diamond Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterointerfaces of cubic boron nitride (cBN) with diamond have garnered significant interest due to their ultra-wide bandgaps and small lattice mismatch ($\sim1.5$\%), offering promising advancements in high-power and high-frequency electronic devices. However, the realization of this heterointerface has been limited by challenging growth conditions and insufficient understanding of interfacial properties. In this work, we employ density-functional theory to investigate the structural and electronic properties of diamond/cBN heterostructures as a function of interfacial stoichiometry, cBN thickness, and surface termination and passivation. Formation energies and interfacial bond lengths reveal that boron-terminated heterojunctions are the most stable while abrupt nitrogen-terminated heterojunctions are least stable, but can be stabilized by carbon-mixing. Bandstructures are computed for the heterostructures using hybrid functionals, where we find the abrupt boron-terminated and nitrogen-terminated heterojunctions exhibit $p$-type and $n$-type conductivity, respectively, while carbon-mixed heterojunctions retain wide insulating bandgaps ($4.2-4.4$ eV). The effective masses of the abrupt interfaces are found to vary strongly with stoichiometry. Intriguingly, charge analysis reveals two-dimensional electron or hole gas regions with ultra-high densities on the order of $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$, with distinct spatial localization on either side of the interface. Band alignments show type-I and type-II band offsets tunable by interfacial composition. Further analysis of the band alignments reveals that the diamond valence bands consistently lie above the cBN valence bands by $0.25-2.1$ eV. Interestingly, the interface termination type switches the relative conduction band position of diamond relative to the cBN conduction band, exhibiting a type-I to type-II band alignment transition.</description>

      <title>Deep Kernel Bayesian Optimisation for Closed-Loop Electrode Microstructure Design with User-Defined Properties based on GANs</title>

Abstract: The generation of multiphase porous electrode microstructures with optimum morphological and transport properties is essential in the design of improved electrochemical energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion batteries. Electrode characteristics directly influence battery performance by acting as the main sites where the electrochemical reactions coupled with transport processes occur. This work presents a generation-optimisation closed-loop algorithm for the design of microstructures with tailored properties. A deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Network is used as a deep kernel and employed to generate synthetic three-phase three-dimensional images of a porous lithium-ion battery cathode material. A Gaussian Process Regression uses the latent space of the generator and serves as a surrogate model to correlate the morphological and transport properties of the synthetic microstructures. This surrogate model is integrated into a deep kernel Bayesian optimisation framework, which optimises cathode properties as a function of the latent space of the generator. A set of objective functions were defined to perform the maximisation of morphological properties (e.g., volume fraction, specific surface area) and transport properties (relative diffusivity). We demonstrate the ability to perform simultaneous maximisation of correlated properties (specific surface area and relative diffusivity), as well as constrained optimisation of these properties. This is the maximisation of morphological or transport properties constrained by constant values of the volume fraction of the phase of interest. Visualising the optimised latent space reveals its correlation with morphological properties, enabling the fast generation of visually realistic microstructures with customised properties.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Axial Load Capacity in Steel Storage Rack Columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict the axial load-bearing capacity, (kN), of cold-formed steel structural members. The methodology emphasizes robust model selection and interpretability, addressing the limitations of traditional analytical approaches in capturing the nonlinearities and geometrical complexities inherent to buckling behavior. The dataset, comprising key geometric and mechanical parameters of steel columns, was curated with appropriate pre-processing steps including removal of non-informative identifiers and imputation of missing values. A comprehensive suite of regression algorithms, ranging from linear models to kernel-based regressors and ensemble tree methods was evaluated. Among these, Gradient Boosting Regression exhibited superior predictive performance across multiple metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and was consequently selected as the final model. Model interpretability was addressed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), enabling insight into the relative importance and interaction of input features influencing the predicted axial capacity. To facilitate practical deployment, the model was integrated into an interactive, Python-based web interface via Streamlit. This tool allows end-users-such as structural engineers and designers, to input design parameters manually or through CSV upload, and to obtain real-time predictions of axial load capacity without the need for programming expertise. Applied to the context of steel storage rack columns, the framework demonstrates how data-driven tools can enhance design safety, streamline validation workflows, and inform decision-making in structural applications where buckling is a critical failure mode</description>

      <title>Additive Manufacturing of PEEK/Lunar Regolith Composites for Sustainable Lunar Manufacturing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As humanity advances toward long-term lunar presence under NASA's Artemis program, the development of lunar-based manufacturing and construction (LBMC) capabilities has become increasingly critical. The high cost of transporting materials from Earth makes in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) essential, with lunar regolith serving as a promising local feedstock. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers a compelling platform for LBMC due to its geometric flexibility, material efficiency, and capacity for on-demand, site-specific production. This study investigates material extrusion (MEX) AM of polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) composites containing 10 to 50 wt% lunar regolith simulant (LRS). PEEK and LMS-1D powders were melt-compounded via twin-screw extrusion, printed using a high-temperature chamber, and annealed at 300 degrees C. The samples were characterized through density measurements, thermal analysis, tensile testing, and microstructural and elemental mapping. All filaments exhibited densities above 96%, though as-printed porosity increased from less than 1% in neat PEEK to 7.5% at 50 wt% LRS due to elevated melt viscosity. Regolith incorporation enhanced crystallinity (17.4 to 20.5%) and elastic modulus (by 6-41%), while reducing delamination and warping, which improved dimensional accuracy and print success rates. Tensile strength declined gradually from 107 MPa to 90 MPa up to 40 wt% LRS, then dropped sharply to approximately 70 MPa at 50 wt%. Annealing improved density and stiffness for composites containing up to 30 wt% LRS, with marginal benefit at higher contents. Microstructural and elemental analyses confirmed a continuous PEEK matrix with uniformly dispersed regolith particles. This work establishes processing windows and trade-offs for regolith-rich PEEK composites, supporting ISRU-enabled AM of future lunar infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Phase-fraction guided denoising diffusion model for augmenting multiphase steel microstructure segmentation via micrograph image-mask pair synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks, particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation strategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage mask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while also reducing inference time compared to conventional approach. The method integrates generation and conditioning into a unified framework, offering a scalable solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.</description>

      <title>Learning the action for long-time-step simulations of molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equations of classical mechanics can be used to model the time evolution of countless physical systems, from the astrophysical to the atomic scale. Accurate numerical integration requires small time steps, which limits the computational efficiency -- especially in cases such as molecular dynamics that span wildly different time scales. Using machine-learning (ML) algorithms to predict trajectories allows one to greatly extend the integration time step, at the cost of introducing artifacts such as lack of energy conservation and loss of equipartition between different degrees of freedom of a system. We propose learning data-driven structure-preserving (symplectic and time-reversible) maps to generate long-time-step classical dynamics, showing that this method is equivalent to learning the mechanical action of the system of interest. We show that an action-derived ML integrator eliminates the pathological behavior of non-structure-preserving ML predictors, and that the method can be applied iteratively, serving as a correction to computationally cheaper direct predictors.</description>

      <title>In situ Al$_2$O$_3$ passivation of epitaxial tantalum and aluminum films enables long-term stability in superconducting microwave resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-term stability of superconducting microwave resonators is essential for scalable quantum technologies; however, surface and interface degradation continue to limit device stability. Here, we demonstrate exceptional stability in microstrip resonators fabricated from epitaxial tantalum and aluminum films, protected by in situ deposited Al$_2$O$_3$ under ultra-high vacuum. These resonators initially exhibit internal quality factors (Qi) exceeding one million and maintain high performance with minimal degradation after up to fourteen months of air exposure. In contrast, devices relying on native surface oxides show substantial declines in Qi over time, indicating increased microwave losses. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the in situ Al$_2$O$_3$ effectively suppresses interfacial oxidation and preserves the chemical integrity of the underlying superconducting films, whereas native oxides permit progressive oxidation, leading to device degradation. These findings establish a robust, scalable passivation strategy that addresses a longstanding materials challenge in the development of superconducting quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Mixed spin states for robust ferromagnetism in strained SrCoO$_3$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epitaxial strain in transition-metal oxides can induce dramatic changes in electronic and magnetic properties. A recent study on the epitaxially strained SrCoO$_3$ thin films revealed persistent ferromagnetism even across a metal-insulator transition. This challenges the current theoretical predictions, and the nature of the local spin state underlying this robustness remains unresolved. Here, we employ high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Co-$L_3$ edge to probe the spin states of strained SrCoO$_3$ thin films. Compared with CoO$_6$ cluster multiplet calculations, we identify a ground state composed of a mixed high- and low-spin configuration, distinct from the previously proposed intermediate-spin state. Our results demonstrate that the robustness of ferromagnetism arises from the interplay between this mixed spin state and the presence of ligand holes associated with negative charge transfer. These findings provide direct experimental evidence for a nontrivial magnetic ground state in SrCoO$_3$ and offer new pathways for designing robust ferromagnetic systems in correlated oxides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ultrafast experiments on superconductors, a pump laser pulse often heats up the electronic system and suppresses the density of superfluid electrons. Subsequently, the electrons undergo a cooling process due to electron-phonon thermalization so that the superfluid density recovers in time. We show that if a supercurrent is initiated by a probe pulse in the cooling process, an intriguing phenomenon of 'supercurrent amplification' occurs, meaning that the net current grows in time with the increasing superfluid density. Using the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we uncover its microscopic origin as the momentum-relaxing scattering of quasi-particles by impurities and phonons, in stark contrast to the widely accepted intuition that impurities always attenuate currents. We further show that supercurrent amplification has important experimental manifestations, including the ultrafast Meissener effect and an optical reflectivity exceeding unity.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Elastic Electron Scattering: Perturbation theory misses fundamental aspects of Bragg scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elastic electron scattering is one of the primary means of investigating materials on the atomic scale. It is usually described by modeling the sample as a fixed, static, perturbative potential, thereby completely neglecting the quantum nature of the atoms inside. In this work, we present a quantum treatment of elastic electron scattering. We show that the interaction of the probe beam and the sample results in entanglement between the two systems, which can have far-reaching consequences, particularly on coherence and image contrast. As a timely example, we discuss decoherence in Bragg scattering on nanoparticles. We also investigate under which conditions the conventional scattering theory is recovered.</description>

      <title>Force and geometric signatures of the creep-to-failure transition in a granular pile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Granular creep is the slow, sub-yield movement of constituents in a granular packing due to the disordered nature of its grain-scale interactions. Despite the ubiquity of creep in disordered materials, it is still not understood how to best predict the creep-to-failure regime based on the forces and interactions among constituents. To address this gap, we perform experiments to explore creep and failure in quasi two-dimensional piles of photoelastic disks, allowing the quantification of both grain movements and grain-scale contact force networks. Through controlled external disturbances, we investigate the emergence and evolution of grain rearrangements, force networks, and voids to illuminate signatures of creep and failure. Surprisingly, the force chain structure remains dynamic even in the absence of particle motion. We find that shifts in force chains provide an indication to larger, avalanche-scale disruptions. We reveal connections between these force signatures and the geometry of the voids in the pile. Overall, our novel experiments and analyses deepen our mechanical and geometric understanding of the creep-to-failure transition in granular systems.</description>

      <title>Metallophilicity Enhances Electron Transport through Parallel Organometallic 1D Chain Junctions Formed In Situ</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reveal the role of aurophilic interactions in the formation and conductance of gold cyanide molecular wires of variable length-to-width ratios assembled at the tip of an STM break junction in ambient conditions. Specifically, we identify electron transport signatures through 1D single chains containing variable number of monomeric repeats of gold cyanide AuCN, linked in series (AuCN)n, and through adjacent molecular wires linked in parallel. When bound in series, destructive quantum interference causes an exponential decay of conductance in (AuCN)n 1D wires for n=1-3. But when bound in parallel, aurophilic coupling through the gold atoms of neighboring chains reorders electronic states and results in significant enhancement of conductance. Our work reveals that metallophilicity can play a significant role in junction assembly and electron transport characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of green energy carriers such as hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) via photocatalytic processes provides a clean method for addressing environmental and energy issues. To achieve highly efficient photocatalysts for H2 and CH4 generation, the present work introduces the P/N heterojunctions in a high-entropy oxide (HEO) with d0/d10 electronic junctions. The study uses CuO as a P-type semiconductor and the HEO containing d0 (Ti, Zr, Nb, Ta) and d10 (Zn) cations as an N-type semiconductor. The material exhibits improvements in optical properties, such as light absorption, charge mobility and reduced electron-hole recombination. The integration of two concepts, atomic-scale d0/d10 electronic junctions and micro-scale P/N heterojunctions, leads to enhanced H2 and CH4 production. Particularly after the partial removal of vacancies in the heterojunction, H2 production from photocatalytic water splitting reaches 0.71 mmol/g.h, and CH4 evolution from CO2 conversion reaches 2.40 umol/g.h with 72% selectivity for methanation. The integrated strategy of this study has a high potential in developing active heterostructured catalysts for clean fuel production.</description>

      <title>From trigonal to triclinic: Symmetry-tuned Rashba effects in buckled honeycomb SrHfO$_{3}$-based heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing the interplay of symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling, we investigate Rashba spin splitting in buckled honeycomb (SrHfO$_3$)$_2$/(LaAlO$_3$)$_4$(111) superlattices using density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a Hubbard $U$ term and a Wannier-based tight-binding (TB) model. In the non-centrosymmetric $P1$ phase, pronounced Rashba-type splitting emerges near the $M$ and $K$ points accompanied by a helical in-plane spin texture, while the centrosymmetric $P321$ phase remains spin-degenerate. A Wannier-based tight-binding Hamiltonian, extended analytically with on-site spin-orbit coupling, reproduces the DFT results. A Rashba coefficient of $\alpha_R = 0.34$ eV$ \cdot$ Angstrom and energy $E_R = 29$ meV are extracted directly from the DFT band structure placing the system among moderately strong oxide Rashba materials. $\Gamma$-phonon calculation confirms the dynamical stability of the $P1$ structure and the results reveal the critical role of symmetry breaking and inter-orbital hybridization in enabling Rashba effects, supported by enhanced imaginary second-nearest-neighbor hoppings and Berry curvature. These findings establish SrHfO$_3$-based buckled heterostructures as a promising platform for engineering Rashba effects in oxide-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking total energies with Hund's J terms in Hubbard-corrected spin-crossover chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of the Hund's J terms in various DFT+U+J corrections to semi-local spin-density functional theory is assessed for a series of four octahedrally coordinated Fe(II) spin-crossover molecules spanning the covalent end of the ligand field spectrum. We report values and analyze trends for the Hubbard U and Hund's J parameters determined via minimum-tracking linear response for all valence atomic subspaces and relevant spin states in these molecules. We then methodically apply them via simplified rotationally-invariant Hubbard functionals in search of the simplest combination to yield reliable adiabatic energy differences with respect to those obtained using CASPT2/CC. The observed failure of canonical, positively-signed Hund's J terms in furthering the already robust capacity of DFT+U to obtain accurate energetics prompts an evaluation of their limitations when seeking to account for the static correlation phenomena in such strongly covalent systems and suggests directions for their improvement.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-adapted models for multifold fermions with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multifold fermions, quasiparticles with multiple degeneracy protected by crystalline symmetries, exhibit a variety of intriguing phenomena stemming from their large topological charges and unique band structures. A comprehensive understanding of their response to external stimuli remains challenging, especially for types protected by nonsymmorphic symmetries where various degrees of freedom are intricately coupled. Here, we systematically construct effective models for multifold fermions that incorporate external fields based on crystalline symmetry. Specifically, we develop a $\boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{p}$ model for the threefold fermion protected by space group I2$_1$3 (No.~199) in the presence of spin--orbit coupling, and derive the terms for external fields. By complementing this with a tight-binding model, we investigate the magnetic field response and reveal the pair annihilation of magnetic monopoles. Furthermore, we construct a $\boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{p}$ model for the eightfold fermion in space group P$\bar{4}3n1'$ (No.~218), including its coupling to external fields. This work provides a robust theoretical foundation for advancing the study of external field responses and transport phenomena in multifold fermions, opening new avenues to explore their rich physics.</description>

      <title>Design and demonstration of a direct air capture system with moisture-driven CO2 delivery into aqueous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A moisture-driven air capture (DAC) system was designed and demonstrated. A laboratory-scale system delivering ~1 g CO2 per day was demonstrated in a laminar flow hood and a small pilot-scale system that could deliver ~100 g CO2 daily was operated outdoors in a 4.2 m2 (areal surface area) raceway pond. Elongated mesh tube packets were designed to contain AER beads with high surface area for contacting the air and were found to reduce drying and CO2 loading time ~4-fold over larger mesh bags. Whereas this system was designed for CO2 delivery for cultivating photosynthetic microbes, its potential uses are much broader and include CO2 use in the food and beverage industry, conversion to fuels and chemicals, and sequestration. Techno-economic assessments for a practical scenario based on current results are \$670/tonne to capture CO2 into an alkaline solution and an additional \$280/tonne to extract CO2 from solution, purify and compress to 15 MPa for sequestration. An aspirational scenario modelling reasonable improvements to develop AER sorbents with a capacity of 4 mmol CO2 per gram of sorbent and water uptake of 50 wt.%, which leads to sorbent drying and loading within 1 h, shows a potential to reach \$51/tonne to capture CO2 into an alkaline solution and an additional \$109/tonne to get to 15 MPa for sequestration. Life cycle analysis shows the aspirational moisture-driven process uses up to 87% less energy than thermal and/or vacuum swing DAC by using energy from water evaporation; however, ~330 wt.% water uptake by the sorbent contained in a hydrophilic mesh packets leads to ~33-fold higher water use than the thermodynamic limits, which emphasizes future research is needed to increase sorbent hydrophobicity while maintaining and further increasing ion exchange capacity needed to bind CO2.</description>

      <title>A magnetic tight-binding model: surface properties of transition metals and cobalt nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:1901.00841v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic and surface properties of some transition metals have been investigated within the tight-binding approximation, including Coulomb correlations. These surface properties are calculated after applying a charge neutrality rule that is restricted to the d-band. This formalism gives a charge distribution containing delocalized sp-states in agreement with a linear muffin-tin orbital calculation. It enables the description of local magnetism, surface energies, and work functions without recourse to the total energy. The present investigation is focused on the study of fcc cobalt, bcc iron, fcc nickel, and fcc platinum surfaces, as well as an exploration of fcc cobalt nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Tight-binding model: correction of the d-band approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.03911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic structure, when restricted to the d-band approximation, is a computational model that is both efficient and useful for describing transition metals. In the absence of considering delocalized sp-states, this approximation gives rise to incorrect surface energies, binding energies, and an inaccurate description of ferromagnetic transition metals. The present work compares the complexity of implementing corrections with the possibility of using an accurate sp-d approach. Basic force fields based on the second moment approximation continue to be utilized for the description of interactions in transition metals. In contrast, the present study proposes an elementary and more accurate interatomic potential based on hopping parameters depending on distances. The charge distribution and the Stoner model are also analyzed to provide appropriate corrections to the tight-binding picture used to describe ferromagnetic metals and alloys.</description>

      <title>Antiferroelectric Hafnia Down to the 2D Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferroelectricity is a material property characterized by alternating electric dipoles spontaneously ordered in antiparallel directions. Antiferroelectrics are promising for energy storage, solid-state cooling, and memory technologies; however, these materials are scarce, and their scalability remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that single-crystalline hafnia, a lead-free CMOS-compatible material, exhibits antiferroelectricity under compressive-strain conditions. We observe antiparallel sublattice polarization and stable double-hysteresis in single-crystalline (111)-oriented epitaxial La-doped hafnia films grown on yttrium-stabilized zirconia and show that the antipolar orthorhombic phase of hafnia adheres to the Kittel model of antiferroelectricity. Notably, compressive strain strengthens the antiferroelectric order in thinner La-doped hafnia films, achieving an unprecedented 850 C ordering temperature in the two-dimensional limit, highlighting hafnia's potential for advanced antiferroelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Anomalous frequency scaling of acoustic phonon damping in nickel cavities fabricated by ps-laser delamination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-shot picosecond (ps) laser induced delamination allows for the direct generation of suspended membranes from a continuous metallic film, offering a promising platform for control of ultrafast magnetization dynamics driven by acoustic waves. Using the picosecond-ultrasonics method, we demonstrate that long-lived low-frequency acoustic waves can be optically-excited in the delaminated cavities. At the same time, higher-frequency modes &gt;60GHz exhibit a surprisingly fast damping, following a scaling law incompatible with the expected attenuation mediated by phonon-phonon scattering. Comparing measurements between delaminated cavities and a benchmark nickel film in contact with the substrate, we link our findings with structural modifications of the nickel crystal induced by the delamination process.</description>

      <title>Towards Identifying the PL6 Center in SiC: From First-Principles Screening to Hyperfine Validation of Competing Defect Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The PL6 color center in 4H-SiC, known for its excellent ambient-temperature spin and optical properties, has an unresolved microscopic origin. In this first-principles study, we systematically investigate potential structures to clarify its nature. We first rigorously examine the DV-antisite hypothesis (a divacancy paired with a carbon antisite, $\mathrm{C_{Si}}$), analyzing the energetic, electronic, and spin properties of various $V_\mathrm{Si}V_\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{C_{Si}}$ configurations. Two $\mathrm{C_{3v}}$-symmetric $\mathrm{kk+C_{Si}}$ complexes emerge as strong candidates within this framework. Subsequently, a critical comparison of hyperfine interaction signatures is performed between these candidates, the alternative OV model [specifically OV(hh) and OV(kk), an oxygen replacing C together with a Si vacancy], and experimental data. This analysis demonstrates that the OV(hh) structure more accurately reproduces PL6's hyperfine features. Furthermore, re-evaluation of the proposed OV(hk) model for the related PL5 center reveals zero-field splitting parameter $E$ inconsistencies with experimental results, suggesting that PL5 and PL6 may have distinct origins. These findings provide crucial theoretical insights and motivate targeted experimental validation for these quantum defects.</description>

      <title>Using Thermodynamics and Microstructure to Mitigate Overfitting in Pellet Reduction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct reduction of iron using hydrogen-rich gas is rapidly emerging as a key strategy for green steel production. This process involves complex, multiscale phenomena, encompassing solid-state phase transformations and gas transport through pores, that must be accurately represented for predictive industrial implementation. Here, we present a thermodynamically sound pellet-scale model that describes these mechanisms and can serve as a foundation for improving the understanding of pellet reduction kinetics in H$_2$/CO-containing atmospheres. The model assumes that the gas phase remains in thermodynamic equilibrium, meaning that the composition of the gas instantaneously adjusts to any changes in the system. This reduces the number of fitting parameters drastically compared to other existing models, while maintaining a strict thermodynamic upper bound estimate. A driving force term is included in the reaction rate equation based on the partial pressure of O$_2$ in the equilibrated gas phase. This constrained equilibrium-based approach ensures that the three iron oxide reduction steps and the formation of graphite and cementite in carbon-containing gases occur only if they are thermodynamically possible. It is demonstrated that fitting kinetic parameters based on conversion degree data alone leads to overfitting. This is true both for existing models and the model introduced here, despite the fact that the latter contains fewer parameters. To overcome this overfitting problem, spatially resolved microstructural data at key reduction stages can be considered, as shown here for recently reported data for a pellet reduced in H$_2$ atmosphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transverse thermoelectric effects interconvert charge and heat currents in orthogonal directions due to the breaking of either time-reversal symmetry or structural symmetry, enabling simple and versatile thermal energy harvesting and solid-state cooling/heating within single materials. In comparison to the complex module structures required for the conventional Seebeck and Peltier effects, the transverse thermoelectric effects provide the complete device structures, potentially resolving the fundamental issue of multi-module degradation of thermoelectric conversion performance. This review article provides an overview of all currently known transverse thermoelectric conversion phenomena and principles, as well as their characteristics, and reclassifies them in a unified manner. The performance of the transverse thermoelectric generator, refrigerator, and active cooler is formulated, showing that thermal boundary conditions play an essential role to discuss their behaviors. Examples of recent application research and material development in transverse thermoelectrics are also introduced, followed by a discussion of future prospects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a significant reduction of low-temperature damping losses in tensile-strained, ultrathin Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) films grown by pulsed laser deposition, exhibiting ultralow damping constants and tunable magnetic anisotropy. Comparative broadband FMR measurements show that tensile-strained YIG films on Gd3Sc2Ga3O12 (GSGG) retain low damping even at nanometer thicknesses and cryogenic temperatures, outperforming relaxed films on Gd3Ga5O12. Based on static magnetometry measurements and microstructural characterization, we attribute these enhanced dynamic properties to the suppression of interdiffusion across the YIG/GSGG interface, resulting from enhanced chemical stability and favorable growth kinetics by the presence of Sc. Our findings highlight the importance of chemical and kinetic factors in achieving few-nanometer-thick YIG film with negligible low-temperature damping dissipation and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for cryogenic spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of Li-based batteries in the electrification of society cannot be understated, however their operational lifetime is often limited by the formation of dendrites, i.e. the localised deposition of Li that can cause shorts between the two electrodes leading to the failure of the battery. Nanocrystalline bimetallic current collectors can be used for anode-free Li-metal batteries, with improved Li plating and limited or suppressed formation of dendrites. Here, we demonstrate that the microstructure of an alpha-Brass current collector, Cu 63% Zn 37%, used in an anode-free Li-metal battery evolves during cycling. It initially had a nanocrystalline deformation layer approximately 80 nm in thickness after polishing. After 100 cycles, the initial deformed brass layer was partially converted to a ternary Laves phase Cu3ZnLi2 within a nanocrystalline brass matrix that grew to 200 - 250 nm in thickness. Upon Li stripping, the phase partially decomposes electrochemically, but what remains can sequester Li thus forming "dead Li" thereby contributing to capacity loss. We propose a mechanism for the microstructural evolution including dynamic recrystallization and phase formation. Since this ternary Laves phase emerges during electrochemical cycling alone, binary alloy current collectors must be assessed for metastable ternary phase formation under different cycling conditions to either stabilize and exploit such phases or electrochemically fully strip them.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Signatures of Structural Disorder and Electron-Phonon Interactions in Trigonal Selenium Thin Films for Solar Energy Harvesting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selenium is experiencing renewed interest as a elemental semiconductor for a range of optoelectronic and energy applications due to its irresistibly simple composition and favorable wide bandgap. However, its high volatility and low radiative efficiency make it challenging to assess structural and optoelectronic quality, calling for advanced, non-destructive characterization methods. In this work, we employ a closed-space encapsulation strategy to prevent degradation during measurement and enable sensitive probing of vibrational and optoelectronic properties. Using temperature-dependent Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy, we investigate grown-in stress, vibrational dynamics, and electron-phonon interactions in selenium thin films synthesized under nominally identical conditions across different laboratories. Our results reveal that short-range structural disorder is not intrinsic to the material, but highly sensitive to subtle processing variations, which strongly influence electron-phonon coupling and non-radiative recombination. We find that such structural disorder and grown-in stress likely promote the formation of extended defects, which act as dominant non-radiative recombination centers limiting carrier lifetime and open-circuit voltage in photovoltaic devices. These findings demonstrate that the optoelectronic quality of selenium thin films can be significantly improved through precise control of synthesis and post-deposition treatments, outlining a clear pathway toward optimizing selenium-based thin film technologies through targeted control of crystallization dynamics and microstructural disorder.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Itinerant Magnetic Domain Wall and Quasiparticle Boundary State in Spin-Density-Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15999v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional magnetic domain walls are characterized by reorientation of local spins. However, what occurs at the boundary of itinerant magnets is largely unknown. Here using spin-sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy, we investigated the microscopic domain wall structure of the spin-density-wave (SDW) state in a prototypical itinerant antiferromagnet - chromium (Cr). At the boundary of two incommensurate SDW domains, we found the spins undergo finite-scale decay rather than reorientation. This generates a double-Q SDW state, which is further evidenced by an accompanying second-order charge modulation. In the commensurate SDW domains, a clear SDW energy gap is observed. Interestingly, the screw dislocations induced half vortex and anti-vortex of SDW, paired by antiphase domain wall. The spin density vanished at such antiphase domain walls. Remarkably, for the first time we observed the SDW quasiparticle states at the boundary, resembling the Andreev bound states in superconductors. These unique SDW boundary structures can be viewed as consequences of local interference of two SDWs, either with different Q or reversed phases. Our findings thus reveal a new type of domain wall distinct to that of local moment magnetism, with a mechanism rooted in the itinerant nature of SDW.</description>

Abstract: We show that the three commonly employed approaches that define the same dc (or low-frequency) intrinsic linear anomalous Hall response actually lead to different results for intrinsic nonlinear transport. The difference is due to an intrinsic anomalous distribution (IAD). It originates from a nonlinear field effect during scattering, but its value is completely independent of scattering, because it represents the local equilibration of electron wave packets with field corrected energy. The proper definition of intrinsic current that is detectable in experiment must incorporate the effect of IAD. We also show that IAD is indispensable for consistency with fundamental physical relations. In addition, we predict that under ac driving, the intrinsic reponses in rectified and double-frequency channels exhibit distinct frequency dependence, for which we estimate the signals that can be probed in antiferromagnetic CuMnAs.</description>

      <title>Tunable Coupling, Topology, and Chirality by Antimagnons in Magnetic Multilayer</title>

Abstract: Realizing novel topological states in magnonic systems unlocks robust, low-power spin-wave devices. In this letter, we show that incorporating left-handed spin waves (antimagnons) fundamentally reorganizes band topology, and enables tunable spin-wave coupling and chirality. We proposed a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger like model, the 2D-SSH4 chain, where dipolar interactions between magnons and antimagnons generate topological bands with nonzero Chern numbers. This framework explains the origin of topological surface states in ferromagnetic multilayer and shows they share the same topological origin as classic magnetostatic surface spin waves. Our model also offers a straightforward framework for designing more complex magnetic multilayer connected by dipolar interactions, such as antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic multilayer. In these dipolar-coupled multilayers, both coherent and dissipative interlayer spin-wave couplings together with the layer resolved chirality, are tunable via external magnetic fields and spin torques. Our results provide a practical platform for topological magnonics, enabling control of magnon chirality and coupling in future devices.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phenomena in systems with unconventional magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we review the recent advances on superconducting phenomena in junctions formed by superconductors and unconventional magnets. Conventional magnets, such as ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, are characterized by broken time-reversal symmetry but only ferromagnets produce a finite net magnetization due to parallel spin alignment and spin-split bands in momentum. Very recently, a new type of magnets has been reported and here we refer to them as unconventional magnets because they exhibit special properties of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets: they exhibit zero net magnetization (like antiferromagnets) and a nonrelativistic spin splitting of energy bands (like ferromagnets), both leading to anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces. An interesting property of unconventional magnets is that their magnetic order can be even or odd with respect to momentum, where $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets are the most representative examples. In this regard, $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets are seen as counterparts in magnetism of the unconventional $d$- and $p$-wave superconducting states, respectively. While the impact of conventional magnetism on superconductivity has been largely studied, the combination of unconventional magnets and superconductivity has only lately attracted considerably attention. This work provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the interplay between superconductivity and unconventional magnets. In particular, we focus on the fundamental emerging superconducting phenomena and also discuss the potential implications towards quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial spin texture in a superconducting electron gas revealed by exchange interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19599v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing states and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We observed an unusual in-plane uniaxial anisotropy in the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic. This anisotropy is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic 'half-Rashba' spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. The interactions between the uniaxial spin texture and the magnetic overlayer offer new ways to explore the interplay between magnetism and 2D superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Valley-polarized Quantum Anomalous Hall and Topological Metal Phase in Rashba induced pseudospin-1 lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling induced pseudospin-$1$ system Dice lattice under the influence of a staggered electric potential and magnetization. The band structure and topological phases of the system are investigated and compared with the pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system honeycomb lattice. Under individual influence of the staggered electric field and magnetization, the system undergoes a distinct phase transition: (i) a staggered electric potential drives the system from a quantum anomalous Hall $(C_n = 2)$ to a valley polarized quantum anomalous Hall phase $(C_n = -1)$ associated with edge modes with a flip in the chirality; while (ii) a staggered magnetization changes the system to a topological metal associated with unconventional antichiral edge bands, from a topological insulator. These results are further supported by calculations of the Chern phase diagrams, Hall conductance, zigzag, and armchair edge states. Our findings enhance the understanding of new topological phases in the 2D pseudospin-$1$ system and open up a new platform to explore the anti-chiral edge states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze two simple model planar molecules: an ionic molecule with D3 symmetry and a covalent molecule with D6 symmetry. Both symmetries allow the existence of chiral molecular orbitals and normal modes that are coupled to each other in a Jahn-Teller manner, invariant under U (1) symmetry with generator a pseudo angular momentum. In the ionic molecule, the chiral mode possesses an electric dipole but lacks physical angular momentum, whereas, in the covalent molecule, the situation is reversed. In spite of that, we show that in both cases the chiral modes can be excited by a circularly polarized light and are subsequently able to induce rotational motion of the entire molecule.</description>

      <title>Soft-X-ray momentum microscopy of nonlinear magnon interactions below 100-nm wavelength</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnons represent quantised collective motions of long-range ordered spins. For wavelength below 100 nm, exchange interactions dominate their physics, which gives rise to a so far unexplored regime of nonlinearities and couplings between magnons and other quasiparticles. Besides their selective excitation, also the detection of such short-wavelength spin waves remains a challenge of current research and technology. Here, we probe the intensity and wave vector of magnons by means of quasi-elastic, resonant soft-X-ray scattering. This Magnon Momentum Microscopy (MMM) can access magnons directly in momentum space with remarkable sensitivity and high photon efficiency up to THz frequencies and down to few-nanometre wavelengths. The two-dimensional information obtained by this light-scattering-based technique is especially valuable for studying the nonlinear interactions of exchange-dominated magnons within technologically relevant thin-film samples. In doing so, we uncover a rich variety of deeply nonlinear magnon interactions, highlighting their potential for applications in novel computing schemes. With its intrinsic element-selectivity and ability to probe also buried layers, soft-X-ray MMM has the potential to establish itself as an advanced tool for ultrabroadband studies of short-wavelength magnonics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Long-Range Machine Learning Force Fields for Liquid and Materials Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a sophisticated tool for cost-efficient atomistic simulations approaching DFT accuracy, with recent message passing MLFFs able to cover the entire periodic table. We present an invariant message passing MLFF architecture (MPNICE) which iteratively predicts atomic partial charges, including long-range interactions, enabling the prediction of charge-dependent properties while achieving 5-20x faster inference versus models with comparable accuracy. We train direct and delta-learned MPNICE models for organic systems, and benchmark against experimental properties of liquid and solid systems. We also benchmark the energetics of finite systems, contributing a new set of torsion scans with charged species and a new set of DLPNO-CCSD(T) references for the TorsionNet500 benchmark. We additionally train and benchmark MPNICE models for bulk inorganic crystals, focusing on structural ranking and mechanical properties. Finally, we explore multi-task models for both inorganic and organic systems, which exhibit slightly decreased performance on domain-specific tasks but surprising generalization, stably predicting the gas phase structure of $\simeq500$ Pt/Ir organometallic complexes despite never training to organometallic complexes of any kind.</description>

      <title>The Enduring Relevance of Semiempirical Quantum Mechanics</title>

Abstract: The development of semiempirical models to simplify quantum mechanical descriptions of atomistic systems is a practice that started soon after the discovery of quantum mechanics and continues to the present day. There are now many methods for atomistic simulation with many software implementations and many users, on a scale large enough to be considered as a software market. Semiempirical models occupied a large share of this market in its early days, but the research activity in atomistic simulation has steadily polarized over the last three decades towards general-purpose but expensive ab initio quantum mechanics methods and fast but special-purpose molecular mechanics methods. I offer perspective on recent trends in atomistic simulation from the middle ground of semiempirical modeling, to learn from its past success and consider its possible paths to future growth. In particular, there is a lot of ongoing research activity in combining semiempirical quantum mechanics with machine learning models and some unrealized possibilities of tighter integration between ab initio and semiempirical quantum mechanics with more flexible theoretical frameworks and more modular software components.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of $R$Co$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ ($R=$ La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) single crystals: An emerging structure-type for anisotropic Kondo lattice studies</title>

Abstract: Systematic investigations of rare-earth ($R$) based intermetallic materials are a leading strategy to reveal the underlying mechanisms governing a range of physical phenomena, such as the formation of a Kondo lattice and competing electronic and magnetic anisotropies. In this work, the magnetic, thermal and transport properties of $R$Co$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ ($R=$ La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) single crystals are presented. LaCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is characterized as a Pauli paramagnet and transport measurements, with the current along and perpendicular to the orthorhombic $c$-axis ($\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$, respectively), reveal a clear electronic anisotropy, with $\rho_{ab }\approx(4-7)\rho_{c }$ at $300$ K. We show that CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is a Kondo-lattice for which the Kondo coherence temperature $T_{\text{K}}^{*}$, deduced from broad maximums in $\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$ at $\approx$ 68 and 46 K, respectively, is also anisotropic. This finding is related to a possible underlying anisotropy of the Kondo coupling in CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$. The Pr- and Nd-based materials present strong easy-axis anisotropy ($c$-axis) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders below $T=4.84$ K and $T=8.1$ K, respectively. Metamagnetic transitions from this AFM to a spin-polarized paramagnetic phase state are investigated by isothermal magnetization measurements. The Sm-based compound is also an easy-axis AFM with a transition at $T=21.6$ K.</description>

      <title>Probing broken time-reversal symmetry with tailored-light photocurrents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-field-driven photocurrents represent a powerful tool for generating photocurrents without external bias in light-matter systems that lack inversion symmetry. While these photocurrents are used in electronic applications, such as current sources, switches, and photovoltaics, their presence can also be used to probe material properties in and out of equilibrium, such as topology. Here we advance this path of light-field-driven photocurrent spectroscopy by utilizing tailored laser fields for ultrafast photocurrent generation to study time-reversal symmetry (TRS) broken phases. We employ combinations of bichromatic linearly-polarized laser beams that individually respect mirror (spatial) and time-reversal symmetry, individually precluding photocurrents, but when combined can break symmetries and generate photocurrents. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that unique choices of the relative polarization angle and two-color phase imposes a forbidden photocurrent selection rule in TRS-invariant systems, as the tailored light maintains TRS while breaking all other spatial symmetries. We then employ state-of-the-art ab-initio simulations to validate this physical mechanism, and, crucially, predict its breaking in materials with intrinsically-broken TRS, creating a background free signal for magnetism and Chern physics. Our work paves way for probing TRS-broken phases of matter in an ultrafast time-resolved manner, not requiring the application of external magnetic fields or even circularly-polarized electric fields.</description>

Abstract: Solving the many-electron problem, even approximately, is one of the most challenging and simultaneously most important problems in contemporary condensed matter physics with various connections to other fields. The standard approach is to follow a divide and conquer strategy that combines various numerical and analytical techniques. A crucial step in this strategy is the derivation of an effective model for a subset of degrees of freedom by a procedure called downfolding, which often corresponds to integrating out energy scales far away from the Fermi level. In this work we present a rigorous formulation of this downfolding procedure, which complements the renormalization group picture put forward by Honerkamp [PRB 85, 195129 (2012)}]. We derive an exact effective model in an arbitrarily chosen target space (e.g. low-energy degrees of freedom) by explicitly integrating out the the rest space (e.g. high-energy degrees of freedom). Within this formalism we state conditions that justify a perturbative truncation of the downfolded effective interactions to just a few low-order terms. Furthermore, we utilize the exact formalism to formally derive the widely used constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), uncovering underlying approximations and highlighting relevant corrections in the process. Lastly, we detail different contributions in the material examples of fcc Nickel and the infinite-layer cuprate SrCuO$_2$. Our results open up a new pathway to obtain effective models in a controlled fashion and to judge whether a chosen target space is suitable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical and first-principles study of a two-dimensional altermagnet exhibiting spin-valley locking and strain-tunable topological phases. By constructing a minimal tight-binding model constrained by altermagnetic symmetry, we show that biaxial strain can drive a transition from a trivial insulator to a type-II quantum spin Hall (QSH) phase. Furthermore, we derive an analytical strain-induced perturbation theory that identifies two critical curves, dividing the phase space into four regions corresponding to a trivial insulator, a type-II QSH phase, and two quantum anomalous Hall phases with opposite Chern numbers. Remarkably, the Chern number can be reversed purely by changing the strain direction --without modifying magnetization or applying magnetic fields. The model reveals a universal phase diagram for materials with the same symmetry and valley structure. First-principles calculations on monolayer CrO confirm the predicted topological transitions, establishing strain engineering as an effective route for topological control in two-dimensional altermagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Discovery of spontaneous mesoscopic strain waves in nematic domains using dark-field X-ray microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic nematic order is a correlated phase of matter in which low-energy electronic states spontaneously break a discrete rotational symmetry of a crystal lattice. Bilinear coupling between the electronic nematic and strains of the same symmetry yields a single pseudoproper ferroelastic phase transition at which both the nematic and lattice strain onset concurrently. To minimize elastic energy, the crystal forms structural twin domains, each with a distinct orientation of the nematic director (i.e. each with a specific sign of the induced shear strain). While the effects of externally induced strains on these domains are well established, the intrinsic behavior of spontaneous strain fields within individual domains has been hitherto unexplored, largely due to the lack of appropriate experimental tools. Here, we report the discovery of spontaneous mesoscopic strain waves within individual nematic domains of an underdoped iron-based superconductor, observed using dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM). This technique combines high spatial and reciprocal-space resolution with full-field, bulk-sensitive imaging, enabling direct visualization of subdomain strain modulations emerging concurrently with the onset of nematic order. The elastic compatibility relations that govern inhomogeneous strains in continuous solids provide a natural mechanism for the emergent strain waves that we observe. Our findings reveal a broadly relevant form of strain self-organization and position DFXM as a powerful tool for probing the local interplay between lattice strain and electronic order.</description>

Abstract: Electronic nematicity is widely observed in quantum materials with varying degrees of electronic correlation, manifesting through charge, spin, orbital, or superconducting degrees of freedom. A phenomenological model capable of describing this broad set of systems must also account for nemato-elasticity, by which nematic and elastic degrees of freedom become intertwined. However, being a tensor gauge field theory, elasticity must satisfy the compatibility relations which guarantee the integrability of lattice deformations. Here, we develop a formalism for nemato-elasticity that manifestly respects the elastic compatibility relations. We show that these constraints bifurcate the phase space of nematic fluctuations into two orthogonal sectors: one compatible and thus critical, the other incompatible and therefore gapped. The suppression of the latter leads to universal direction-selective nematic criticality in any crystal lattice. Moreover, the critical nematic modes are protected from pinning effects induced by microscopic defect strains, which necessarily induce both longitudinal and transverse correlated random fields. Finally, our results also reconcile seemingly contradictory nematic phenomena, such as the mean-field character of the nematic transition and the widespread presence of domain formation.</description>

      <title>Theory of Electronic Nematic Criticality Constrained by Elastic Compatibility</title>

Abstract: The defining property of electronic nematicity -- the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry -- implies an unavoidable coupling between the nematic order parameter and elastic strain fields, known as nemato-elasticity. While both quantities are rank-2 tensors, the strain tensor is constrained through the Saint Venant compatibility relations. These three coupled second-order partial differential equations arise from the lattice displacement vector's role as a potential field, and they reflect the underlying gauge invariance of geometric deformations which are violated only in the presence of crystalline defects. In this work, we develop a theory of nemato-elasticity that incorporates elastic compatibility explicitly through a co-rotating helical basis. With our formalism, we show elasticity bestows tensor compatibility upon the nematic order parameter by suppressing incompatible nematic fluctuations. As a result, nemato-elasticity is markedly different from bare nematicity. In ideal media devoid of defects, we show the suppression of incompatible nematicity underlies direction-selective criticality, even in the absence of crystalline anisotropy. In systems with defects, meanwhile, we show that elastic pinning fields emanate from quenched defects, generating random longitudinal and transverse conjugate fields for the local nematic order parameter. The coexistence of direction-selective nematic criticality with pinning effects from random fields is explained within our theory from the transformation to the helical basis, implying that local experimental probes of nematicity will be influenced by a linear -- but nonlocal -- combination of long-ranged and short-ranged helical nematic modes. Because the compatibility relations are gauge constraints endowed in the isotropic medium, our results constitute universal features of nemato-elastic criticality present in all crystalline systems.</description>
