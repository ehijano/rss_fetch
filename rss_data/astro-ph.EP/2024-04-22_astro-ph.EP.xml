      <title>Age analysis of extrasolar planets: Insight from stellar isochrone models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing evidence from stellar kinematics and galactic chemical evolution (GCE) suggesting that giant planets (M$_{P}\geq$0.3$M_{J}$) are relatively young compared to the most commonly occurring population of small planets (M$_{P} &lt;$0.3$M_{J}$). To further test the validity of these results, we analyzed the ages for a large number of 2336 exoplanet hosting stars determined using three different but well-established isochrone fitting models, namely, PARSEC, MIST, and Yonsei Yale (YY). As input parameters, we used Gaia DR3 parallaxes, magnitudes, and photometric temperature, as well as spectroscopically determined more accurate temperatures and metallicities from the Sweet Catalog. Our analysis suggests that $\sim$~50$\%$ to 70$\%$ of stars with planets are younger than the sun. We also find that, among the confirmed exoplanetary systems, stars hosting giant planets are even younger compared to small planet hosts. The median age of $\sim$~2.61 to 3.48~Gyr estimated for the giant planet-hosting stars (depending on the model input parameters) suggests that the later chemical enrichment of the galaxy by the iron-peak elements, largely produced from Type Ia supernovae, may have paved the way for the formation of gas giants. Furthermore, within the giant planet population itself, stars hosting hot Jupiters (orbital period $\le$10 days) are found to be younger compared to the stellar hosts of cool and warm Jupiters (orbital period $&gt;$10 days), implying that hot Jupiters could be the youngest systems to emerge in the progression of planet formation.</description>

      <title>ALMA 2D Super-resolution Imaging of Taurus-Auriga Protoplanetary Disks: Probing Statistical Properties of Disk Substructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, ALMA observations of protoplanetary disks revealed various substructures including gaps and rings. Their origin may be probed through statistical studies on the physical properties of the substructures. We present the analyses of archival ALMA Band 6 continuum data of 43 disks (39 Class II and 4 Herbig Ae) in the Taurus-Auriga region. We employ a novel 2D super-resolution imaging technique based on sparse modeling to obtain images with high fidelity and spatial resolution. As a result, we have obtained images with spatial resolutions comparable to a few au ($0''.02 - 0''.1$), which is two to three times better than conventional CLEAN methods. All dust disks are spatially resolved, with the radii ranging from 8 to 238 au with a median radius of 45 au. Half of the disks harbor clear gap structures, whose radial locations show a bimodal distribution with peaks at $\lesssim20$ au and $\gtrsim30$ au. We also see structures indicating weak gaps at all the radii in the disk. We find that the widths of these gaps increase with their depths, which is consistent with the model of planet-disk interactions. The inferred planet mass-orbital radius distribution indicates that the planet distribution is analogous to our Solar System. However, planets with Neptune mass or lower may exist in all the radii.</description>

      <title>The PEPSI Exoplanet Transit Survey (PETS). V: New Na D transmission spectra indicate a quieter atmosphere on HD 189733b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absorption lines from exoplanet atmospheres observed in transmission allow us to study atmospheric characteristics such as winds. We present a new high-resolution transit time-series of HD 189733b, acquired with the PEPSI instrument at the LBT and analyze the transmission spectrum around the Na D lines. We model the spectral signature of the RM-CLV-effect using synthetic PHOENIX spectra based on spherical LTE atmospheric models. We find a Na D absorption signature between the second and third contact but not during the ingress and egress phases, which casts doubt on the planetary origin of the signal. Presupposing a planetary origin of the signal, the results suggest a weak day-to-nightside streaming wind in the order of 0.7 km/s and a moderate super-rotational streaming wind in the order of 3 - 4 km/s, challenging claims of prevailing strong winds on HD 189733b.</description>

      <title>Empirical stability criteria for 3D hierarchical triple systems I: Circumbinary planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we revisit the problem of the dynamical stability of hierarchical triple systems with applications to circumbinary planetary orbits. We carry out more than 3 10^8 numerical simulations of planets between the size of Mercury and the lower fusion boundary (13 Jupiter masses) which revolve around the center of mass of a stellar binary over long timescales. For the first time, three dimensional and eccentric planetary orbits are considered. We explore systems with a variety of binary and planetary mass ratios, binary and planetary eccentricities from 0 to 0.9 and orbital mutual inclinations ranging from 0 to 180 degrees. The simulation time is set to 10^6 planetary orbital periods. We classify the results of those long term numerical integrations into three categories: stable, unstable and mixed. We provide empirical expressions in the form of multidimensional, parameterized fits for the two borders that separate the three dynamical domains . In addition, we train a machine learning model on our data set in order to have an alternative tool of predicting the stability of circumbinary planets. Both the empirical fits and the machine learning model are tested against randomly generated circumbinary systems with very good results regarding the predictions of orbital stability. The empirical formulae are also applied to the Kepler and TESS circumbinary systems, confirming the stability of the planets in these systems. Finally, we present a REST API with a web based application for convenient access of our simulation data set.</description>

      <title>TOI-837b is a Young Saturn-sized Exoplanet with a Massive 70 $M_{\oplus}$ Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exhaustive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of TOI-837, a F9/G0 35 Myr young star, hosting a transiting exoplanet, TOI-837b, with an orbital period of 8.32d. Utilising data from TESS and ground-based observations, we determine a planetary radius of 0.82 R_J for TOI-837b. Through detailed HARPS spectroscopic time series analysis, we derive a Doppler semi-amplitude of 36 m/s, corresponding to a planetary mass of 0.39 M_J. The derived planetary properties suggest a substantial core of approximately 70 M_E, constituting about 60% of the planet's total mass. This finding poses a significant challenge to existing theoretical models of core formation. We propose that future atmospheric observations with JWST could provide insights into resolving ambiguities of TOI-837b, offering new perspectives on its composition, formation, and evolution.</description>

      <title>Formation of the four terrestrial planets in the Jupiter-Saturn chaotic excitation scenario: fundamental properties and water delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jupiter-Saturn chaotic excitation (JSCE) scenario proposes that the protoplanetary disk was dynamically excited and depleted beyond ~1-1.5 au in a few Myr, offering a new and plausible explanation for several observed properties of the inner solar system. Here, we expanded our previous work by conducting a comprehensive analysis of 37 optimal terrestrial planet systems obtained in the context of the JSCE scenario. Each optimal system harbored exactly four terrestrial planets analogs to Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. We further investigated water delivery, feeding zones, and accretion history for the planet analogs, which allowed us to better constrain the water distribution in the disk. The main findings of this work are as follows: 1) the formation of four terrestrial planets with orbits and masses similar to those observed in our solar system in most of our sample, as evidenced by the dynamically colder and hotter orbits of Venus-Earth and Mercury-Mars analogs, and the high success rates of similar mutual orbital separations (~40-85%) and mass ratios of the planets (~70-90%) among the 37 systems; and 2) water was delivered to all terrestrial planets during their formation through the accretion of water-bearing disk objects from beyond ~1-1.5 au. The achievement of Earth's estimated bulk water content required the disk to contain sufficient water mass distributed within those objects initially. This requirement implies that Mercury, Venus, and Mars acquired water similar to the amount on Earth during their formation. Several of our planet analogs also matched additional constraints, such as the timing of Moon formation by a giant impact, Earth's late accretion mass and composition, and Mars's formation timescale.</description>

      <title>Detection of Na in the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-55b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral signatures of optical absorbers, when combined with those of infrared molecules, play a critical role in constraining the cloud properties of exoplanet atmospheres. We aim to use optical transmission spectroscopy to confirm the tentative color signature previously observed by multiband photometry in the atmosphere of hot Jupiter HAT-P-55b. We observed a transit of HAT-P-55b with the OSIRIS spectrograph on the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). We created two sets of spectroscopic light curves using the conventional band-integrated method and the newly proposed pixel-based method to derive the transmission spectrum. We performed Bayesian spectral retrieval analyses on the transmission spectrum to interpret the observed atmospheric properties. The transmission spectra derived from the two methods are consistent, both spectrally resolving the tentative color signature observed by MuSCAT2. The retrievals on the combined OSIRIS and MuSCAT2 transmission spectrum yield the detection of Na at 5.5$\sigma$ and the tentative detection of MgH at 3.4$\sigma$. The current optical-only wavelength coverage cannot constrain the absolute abundances of the atmospheric species. Space-based observations covering the molecular infrared bands or ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy are needed to further constrain the atmospheric properties of HAT-P-55b.</description>

      <title>Evidence and concerns about a latent, embryonic phase tectonic evolution and the existence of the young subsurface ocean on Mimas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New models challenge the long-standing conclusion about Mimas, an icy satellite of Saturn, being an inactive snowball, suggesting the existence of a young stealth ocean. Unfortunately, no observable evidence has been found yet implying tectonic activity and the theoretical subsurface ocean. Here, we present the first structural geological map of the icy satellite, with the signs of various tectonic features, along with a simple crosscutting chronology of lineaments formation. In accordance with the supposedly young age of the stealth ocean, the observed phenomena are described as putative lineaments, ridges, and troughs. Simple tectonic features are identified as young compared to complex structures. The pattern of the linear features seems to overlap with the allocation of various modeled global nonlinear tidal dissipation patterns. In such a way, it may provide the first observed evidence for the existence of the theoretical subsurface stealth ocean. However, the overlapping and crosscutting relation between craters and the observed features may raise concerns about the recent formation of such linear features, indicating possibly long-time dormant or already stopped tectonic processes at the early embryonic phase of lineament formation billions of years ago.</description>

      <title>Mass-radius relationships and contraction of condensed planets by cooling or despinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condensed planets contract or expand as their temperature changes. With the exception of the effect of phase changes, this phenomenon is generally interpreted as being solely related to the thermal expansivity of the planet's components. However, changes in density affect pressure and gravity and, consequently, the planet's compressibility. A planet's radius is also linked to its rate of rotation. Here again, changes in pressure, gravity and compressibility are coupled. In this article we clarify how the radius of a condensed planet changes with temperature and rotation, using a simple and rigorous thermodynamic model. We consider condensed materials to obey a simple equation of state which generalizes a polytopic EoS as temperature varies. Using this equation, we build simple models of condensed planet's interiors including exoplanets, derive their mass-radius relationships, and study the dependence of their radius with temperature and rotation rate. We show that it depends crucially on the value of $\rho_s g R/K_s$ ($\rho_s$ being surface density, $g$ gravity, $R$ radius, $K_s$ surface incompressibility). This non-dimensional number is also the ratio of the dissipation number which appears in compressible convection and the Grune\"isen mineralogic parameter. While the radius of small planets depends on temperature, this is not the case for large planets with large dissipation numbers; Earth and a super-Earth like CoRoT-7b are in something of an intermediate state, with a moderately temperature-dependent radius. Similarly, while the radius of these two planets are functions of their rotation rates, this is not the case for smaller or larger planets.</description>

      <title>Constraints on PDS 70 b and c from the dust continuum emission of the circumplanetary discs considering in situ dust evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The young T Tauri star PDS 70 has two gas accreting planets sharing one large gap in a pre-transitional disc. Dust continuum emission from PDS 70 c has been detected by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 7, considered as the evidence of a circumplanetary disc, but the emission from PDS 70 b has not. We constrain the planet mass and the gas accretion rate of the planets by introducing a model of dust evolution in the CPDs and reproducing the detection and non-detection. We first develop a 1D steady gas disc model of the CPDs reflecting the planet properties. We then calculate the radial distribution of the dust profiles considering the dust evolution in the gas disc and calculate the total flux density of dust thermal emission from the CPDs. We find positive correlations between the flux density and three planet properties, the planet mass, gas accretion rate, and their product called "MMdot". We then find that the MMdot of PDS 70 c is larger than 0.4 MJ^2/Myr, and the planet mass and the gas accretion rate are larger than 5MJ and 0.02 MJ/Myr, respectively. This is the first case to succeed in obtaining constraints on planet properties from the flux density of dust continuum from a CPD. We also find some loose constraints on the properties of PDS 70 b from the non-detection. We propose possible scenarios for the planets explaining the non-detection respectively detection of the dust emission. The first explanation is that planet c has larger planet mass and/or larger gas accretion rate than planet b. The other possibility is that the CPD of planet c has a larger amount of dust supply and/or weaker turbulence than that of planet b. If the dust supply to planet c is larger than b due to its closeness to the outer dust ring, it is also quantitatively consistent with that planet c has weaker H-alpha line emission than planet b considering the dust extinction effect.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Empirical Models of Ionospheric Heating to Global Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intense currents produced during geomagnetic storms dissipate energy in the ionosphere through Joule heating. This dissipation has significant space weather effects, and thus it is important to determine the ability of physics-based simulations to replicate real events quantitatively. Several empirical models estimate Joule heating based on ionospheric currents using the AE index. In this study, we select 11 magnetic storm simulations from the CCMC database and compare the integrated Joule heating in the simulations with the results of empirical models. We also use the SWMF global magnetohydrodynamic simulations for 12 storms to reproduce the correlation between the simulated AE index and simulated Joule heating. We find that the scale factors in the empirical models are half what is predicted by the SWMF simulations.</description>

      <title>Infrared-Radio-follow-up Observations for Detection of the Magnetic Radio Emission of Extra-Solar Planets: A New Window to Detect Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several methods for indirectly detecting exoplanets, such as transit, radial velocity, astrometry, and the conventional gravitational microlensing approach. These methods rely on observing the effects of exoplanets on the emission or motion of observed stars. All these techniques have focused on the optical or infrared domains. However, an alternative method for exoplanet detection via microlensing events involves planets orbiting the source star, creating a binary source system. In this study, we explore a novel approach to detecting and studying exoplanets exclusively through their radio emissions resulting from magnetospheric processes. We propose utilizing the Roman telescope as a survey observer to detect microlensing events. Subsequently, we investigate the potential for detecting planetary radio signals through follow-up observations of these microlensing events in the radio band using the SKA telescope. This method is viable due to the comparable radio emission levels of exoplanets and their parent stars, unlike optical and infrared emissions. We conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to replicate the observations by the Nancy Roman Telescope, followed by a follow-up observation in radio frequencies using the SKA telescope. We determine that approximately 1155 exoplanets exhibit detectable signals by the SKA telescope during the 7-season observations by the Nancy Roman Telescope. This result indicates that such a method cannot only facilitate the direct detection of exoplanets but also enable the measurement of their magnetic field strength through analysis of their radio emissions.</description>

      <title>A Fresh Look into the Interaction of Exoplanets Magnetosphere with Stellar Winds using MHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous numerical studies have been carried out in recent years that simulate different aspects of exoplanets' magnetosphere and stellar winds. These studies have focused primarily on hot Jupiters with sun-like stars. This study addresses the challenges inherent in utilizing existing MHD codes to model hot Jupiter-star systems. Due to the scaling of the system and the assumption of a uniformly flowing stellar wind at the outer boundary of the simulation, MHD codes necessitate a minimum distance of greater than 0.4 au for a Jupiter-like planet orbiting a sun-like star to avoid substantial violations of the code's assumptions. Additionally, employing the GAMERA (Grid Agnostic MHD for Extended Research Applications) MHD code, we simulate star-planet interactions considering various stellar types (Sun-like and M Dwarf stars) with both Jupiter-like and Earth-like planets positioned at varying orbital distances. Furthermore, we explore the impact of tidal locking on the total power within the magnetosphere-ionosphere systems.</description>

      <title>MESSENGER observations of Mercury's planetary ion escape rates and their dependence on true anomaly angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the escape of Mercury's sodium-group ions (Na+-group, including ions with m/q from 21 to 30 amu/e) and their dependence on true anomaly angle (TAA), i.e., Mercury's orbital phase around the Sun, using measurements from MESSENGER. The measurements are categorized into solar wind, magnetosheath, and magnetosphere, and further divided into four TAA intervals. Na+-group ions form escape plumes in the solar wind and magnetosheath, with higher fluxes along the solar wind's motional electric field. The total escape rates vary from 0.2 to 1 times 10^{25} atoms/s with the magnetosheath being the main escaping region. These rates exhibit a TAA dependence, peaking near the perihelion and similar during Mercury's remaining orbit. Despite Mercury's tenuous exosphere, Na+-group ions escape rate is comparable to other inner planets. This can be attributed to several processes, including that Na+-group ions may include several ion species, efficient photoionization frequency for elements within Na+-group, etc.</description>

      <title>Is climate variability the result of frequency modulation by the solar cycle? Evidence from the El Nino Southern Oscillation, Australian climate, Central England Temperature, and reconstructed solar activity and climate records</title>

Abstract: Oceanic atmospheric oscillations and climate variability are tightly linked and both exhibit broad band spectral content that ranges, with roughly equal strength, from annual to centennial periodicity. The explanation for variability based on the integration of weather noise leads to a spectral content heavily weighted to low frequencies; explaining the variability as resulting from solar forcing leads to a narrow band, approximately eleven year period, spectral content. In both cases the spectral content is incompatible with the observed spectrum. It is known that the Southern Oscillation is frequency modulated, i.e. the time interval between successive events varies on an approximately centenary scale. In this paper we develop a model of the Southern Oscillation responding to the slowly changing frequency of the solar cycle. This results in a frequency modulated oscillation, the spectrum of which is intrinsically broad and flat and therefore compatible with the observed spectrum. Fortunately, the change in frequency of the solar cycle with time has been reconstructed from tree ring data for the last millennium. It is possible to identify time intervals when the frequency was dominated by a single frequency in which case the model oscillation is relatively simple. The 11 year period component of the model time variation was shown to correlate closely with the 11 year period components of observed Southern Oscillation and climate variability. A characteristic of a frequency modulated variable, the equal spacing of spectral peaks, was utilized via a double Fourier transform method to recover solar cycle periodicity from instrumental and reconstructed climate records, with the recovered periodicity and the known periodicity of the solar cycle in good agreement. The concept outlined provides a new way of viewing and assessing the Sun climate connection.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Tidal Migration of Hot Jupiters on the Rotation of Sun-like Main-sequence Stars</title>

Abstract: The tidal interactions of planets affect the stellar evolutionary status and the constraint of their physical parameters by gyrochronology. In this work, we incorporate the tidal interaction and magnetic braking of the stellar wind into MESA and calculate a large grid of 25000 models, covering planets with masses of 0.1-13.0$\,$$M_{\mathrm{J}}$ with different orbital distances that orbit late-type stars of different metallicities. We also explore the effect of different stellar initial rotations on the tidal interactions. Our results show that in the case of tidal inward migration, the stellar rotation periods are always lower than that of the star without planet before the planet is engulfed and the difference in the rotation period of its host star always increases with time. After the planet is engulfed, the stellar rotation periods are still lower than that of star without planet, but the difference of periods can be quickly eliminated if the star has a thick convective envelope(smaller mass and larger metallicity), regardless of the mass of the planet and the initial rotation period of the star. In the case of stars with thinner convective envelopes(larger mass and smaller metallicity), the stars will be spined up and remain the faster rotation in a long time. Meanwhile, the planet is easily swallowed and the period differences are large if the initial rotation period of its host star is higher. Final, we also study the evolution of WASP-19 and estimate the range of tidal quality parameter $Q'_{*} = (4.6 \pm 0.9) \times 10^{6}$ and initial semi-major axis as $(0.035 \pm 0.004)$$\,$au.</description>

      <title>Co-evolution of dust grains and protoplanetary disks II: structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks; an analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous study (Tsukamoto {\it et al.} 2023), we investigated formation and early evolution of protoplanetary disks with 3D non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics simulations considering dust growth, and found that the modified equations of the conventional steady accretion disk model which consider the magnetic braking, { dust growth} and ambipolar diffusion reproduce the disk structure obtained from simulations very well. In this paper, as a sequel of the our previous study, we analytically investigate the structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks corresponding to Class 0/I young stellar objects using the modified steady accretion disk model combining an analytical model of envelope accretion. We estimate that the disk radius is several AU at disk formation epoch and increases to several 100 AU at the end of the accretion phase. The disk mass is estimated to be $0.01 M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm disk} \lesssim 0.1 M_\odot$ for a disk with radius of several 10 AU and mass accretion rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm disk} \sim 10^{-6} M_\odot {\rm yr^{-1}}$. We also found that, with typical disk ionization rates and moderate mass accretion rate ($\dot{M}_{\rm disk}\gtrsim10^{-8} M_\odot {\rm yr^{-1}}$), magneto-rotational instability is suppressed in the disk because of low plasma $\beta$ and efficient ambipolar diffusion. We argue that the radial profile of specific angular momentum (or rotational velocity) at the disk outer edge should be continuously connected to that of the envelope if the disk evolves by magnetic braking, and should be discontinuous if the disk evolves by internal angular momentum transport process such as gravitational instability or magneto-rotational instability. Future detailed observations of the specific angular momentum profile around the disk outer edge are important for understanding the angular momentum transport mechanism of protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Intrinsic Stellar Noise with Stellar Atmospheric Parameters and Chromospheric Activity</title>

Abstract: Accurately characterizing intrinsic stellar photometric noise induced by stellar astrophysics, such as stellar activity, granulation, and oscillations, is of crucial importance for detecting transiting exoplanets. In this study, we investigate the relation between the intrinsic stellar photometric noise, as quantified by the Kepler rrmsCDPP measurement, and the level of stellar chromospheric activity, as indicated by the S-index of Ca II HK lines derived from the LAMOST spectra. Our results reveal a clear positive correlation between S-index and rrmsCDPP, and the correlation becomes more significant at higher activity levels and on longer timescales. We have therefore built an empirical relation between rrmsCDPP and S-index as well as Teff, logg, [Fe/H], and apparent magnitude with the XGBoost regression algorithm, using the LAMOST-Kepler common star sample as the training set. This method achieves a precision of ~20 ppm for inferring the intrinsic noise from the S-index and other stellar labels on a 6-hour integration duration. We have applied this empirical relation to the full LAMOST DR7 spectra database, and obtained the intrinsic noise predictions for 1,358,275 stars. The resultant catalog is publicly available and expected to be valuable for optimizing target selection for future exoplanet-hunting space missions, such as the Earth 2.0 mission.</description>

      <title>Protostellar spin-up and fast rotator formation through binary star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Edited) Many fast rotator stars (rotation periods of &lt; 2 days) are found in unresolved binaries with separations of tens of au. This correlation leads to the question of whether the formation of binary stars inherently produces fast rotators. We aim to understand whether the formation of companions plays a role in spinning up stars. We use magneto-hydrodynamical simulations to study the formation of multiple star systems from turbulent and non-turbulent protostellar cores. We track the angular momentum accreted by individual star and inner disc systems by using a sink particle technique. We run a resolution study to extrapolate protostellar properties. We find in all simulations that the primary star can experience spin-up events that are correlated with the formation of companions. The primary star can spin up by up to 84% of its pre-fragmentation angular momentum and by up to 18% of its pre-fragmentation mass-specific angular momentum. The mechanism for the spin-up is gravitational disc instabilities in the circumstellar disc around the primary star, leading to the accretion of material with high specific angular momentum. The simulations that experience the strongest disc instabilities fragment to form companions. Simulations with weaker spin-up events experience disc instabilities triggered by a companion flyby, and the disc instability in these cases does not produce further fragments. We conclude that the primary star in multiple star systems may end up with a higher spin than single stars. This is because gravitational instabilities in the circumstellar disc around the primary star can trigger a spin-up event. In the strongest spin-up events, the instability is likely to cause disc fragmentation and the formation of companions. This companion formation coupled with shorter disc lifetimes, because the companion truncates the circumstellar disc, can help produce fast rotators.</description>

      <title>Thirteen New M Dwarf + T Dwarf Pairs Identified with WISE/NEOWISE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 13 new widely separated T dwarf companions to M dwarf primaries, identified using WISE/NEOWISE data by the CatWISE and Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 projects. This sample represents a $\sim$60% increase in the number of known M+T systems, and allows us to probe the most extreme products of binary/planetary system formation, a discovery space made available by the CatWISE2020 catalog and the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 effort. Highlights among the sample are WISEP J075108.79-763449.6, a previously known T9 thought to be old due to its SED, which we now find is part of a common-proper-motion pair with L 34-26 A, a well studied young M3 V star within 10 pc of the Sun; CWISE J054129.32-745021.5 B and 2MASS J05581644-4501559 B, two T8 dwarfs possibly associated with the very fast-rotating M4 V stars CWISE J054129.32-745021.5 A and 2MASS J05581644-4501559 A; and UCAC3 52-1038 B, which is among the widest late T companions to main sequence stars, with a projected separation of $\sim$7100 au. The new benchmarks presented here are prime $JWST$ targets, and can help us place strong constraints on formation and evolution theory of substellar objects as well as on atmospheric models for these cold exoplanet analogs.</description>

      <title>Nodal precession of a hot Jupiter transiting the edge of a late A-type star TOI-1518</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TOI-1518b, a hot Jupiter around a late A-type star, is one of the few planetary systems that transit the edge of the stellar surface (the impact parameter $b\sim0.9 $) among hot Jupiters around hot stars (Cabot et al. 2021). The high rotation speed of the host star ($\sim85$ km s$^{-1}$) and the nearly polar orbit of the planet ($\sim 120$ deg) may cause a nodal precession. In this study, we report the nodal precession undergone by TOI-1518\,b. This system is the fourth planetary system in which nodal precession is detected. We investigate the time change in $b$ from the photometric data of TOI-1518 acquired in 2019 and 2022 with TESS and from the spectral transit data of TOI-1518b obtained in 2020 with two high-dispersion spectrographs; CARMENES and EXPRES. We find that the value of $b$ is decreasing with $db/dt=-0.0116\pm0.0036$\,year$^{-1}$, indicating that the transit trajectory is moving toward the center of the stellar surface. We also estimate the minimum value of the quadrupole mass moment of TOI-1518 $J_{2,\mathrm{min}}=4.41\times 10^{-5}$ and the logarithm of the Love number of TOI-1518 $\log{k_2}= -2.17\pm 0.33$ from the nodal precession.</description>

Abstract: Although there is abundant and diverse observational evidence in support of white dwarf stars hosting planets or debris disks which form in the catastrophic destruction of various planetary bodies, the key processes that explain these observations are still being intensely investigated. The study of white dwarf planetary systems offers a unique perspective on exo-solar composition, that cannot be obtained by any other means. This chapter describes the various observational techniques that are used in order to find and characterize exo-planets and debris disks around white dwarfs. In turn, it discusses how to theoretically interpret these observations by surveying an array of various research tools and models currently employed in this field.</description>

      <title>Reconnaissance ultracool spectra in the Euclid Deep Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Euclid will carry out a deep survey benefiting the discovery and characterisation of ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), especially in the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs), which the telescope will scan repeatedly throughout its mission. The photometric and spectroscopic standards in the EDFs are important benchmarks, crucial for the classification and characterisation of new UCD discoveries and for the calibration of the mission itself. Aims. We aim to provide a list of photometric UCD candidates and collect near-infrared reconnaissance spectra for M, L, and T-type UCDs in the EDFs as future Euclid UCD references. Methods. In EDF North, we cross-matched public optical and infrared surveys with certain photometric criteria to select UCDs. In EDF Fornax and EDF South, we used photometrically classified samples from the literature. We also include UCDs identified by Gaia DR2. We selected 7 UCD targets with different spectral types from the lists and obtained low-resolution 0.9-2.5 {\mu}m spectra of them using GTC/EMIR and the VLT/X-shooter. We also selected a young, bright L dwarf near EDF Fornax to test the coherence of these two facilities. We included an extra T dwarf in EDF North with its published J-band spectrum. Results. We retrieved a list of 81 (49, 231) M, 8 (29, 115) L, and 1 (0, 2) T dwarf candidates in EDF North, Fornax, and South, respectively. They are provided to guide future UCD discoveries and characterisations by Euclid. In total, we collected near-infrared spectra for 9 UCDs, including 2 M types, 3 L types, and 4 T types in or close to the 3 EDFs. The Euclidised spectra show consistency in their spectral classification, which demonstrates that slitless Euclid spectroscopy will recover the spectral types with high fidelity for UCDs, both in the EDFs and in the wide survey. We also demonstrate that Euclid will be able to distinguish different age groups of UCDs.</description>
