      <title>Run-and-Tumble Escape in Pursuit-Evasion Dynamics of Intelligent Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit-evasion game is studied for two adversarial active agents, modelled as a deterministic self-steering pursuer and a stochastic, cognitive evader. The pursuer chases the evader by reorienting its propulsion direction with limited maneuverability, while the evader escapes by executing sharp, unpredictable turns, whose timing and direction the pursuer cannot anticipate. To make the target responsive and agile when the threat level is high, the tumbling frequency is set to increase with decreasing distance from the pursuer; furthermore, the range of preferred tumbling directions is varied. Numerical simulations of such a pursuit-target pair in two spatial dimensions reveal two important scenarios. For dominant pursuers, the evader is compelled to adopt a high-risk strategy that allows the pursuer to approach closely before the evader executes a potentially game-changing backward maneuver to pull away from the pursuer. Otherwise, a strategy where the evader tumbles forward with continuous slight adjustments of the propulsion direction can significantly increase the capture time by preventing the pursuer from aligning with the target propulsion direction, while maintaining the persistence of the target motion. Our results can guide the design of bioinspired robotic systems with efficient evasion capabilities.</description>

      <title>Physical Principles of Size and Frequency Scaling of Active Cytoskeletal Spirals</title>

Abstract: Cytoskeletal filaments transported by surface immobilized molecular motors with one end pinned to the surface have been observed to spiral in a myosin-driven actin 'gliding assay'. The radius of the spiral was shown to scale with motor density with an exponent of -1/3, while the frequency was theoretically predicted to scale with an exponent of 4/3. While both the spiraling radius and frequency depend on motor density, the theory assumed independence of filament length, and remained to be tested on cytoskeletal systems other than actin-myosin. Here, we reconstitute dynein-driven microtubule spiraling and compare experiments to theory and numerical simulations. We characterize the scaling laws of spiraling MTs and find the radius dependence on force density to be consistent with previous results. Frequency on the other hand scales with force density with an exponent of ~1/3, contrary to previous predictions. We also predict that the spiral radius scales proportionally and the frequency scales inversely with filament length, both with an exponent of ~1/3. A model of variable persistence length best explains the length dependence observed in experiments. Our findings that reconcile theory, simulations, and experiments improve our understanding of the role of cytoskeletal filament elasticity, mechanics of microtubule buckling and motor transport and the physical principles of active filaments.</description>

      <title>In Silico Evaluation of Cardiac Tissue-Engineered Patch Interventions</title>

Abstract: Myocardial infarction significantly degrades heart function, and current treatments can bring forth serious cost and complications including blood clots and infections. To improve the current state of treatment, researchers are developing tissue patches from induced-pluripotent stem cells that can be incorporated into the heart, improving organ function after a myocardial infarction. These tissue patches include surface patches, attached to the epicardium of the heart, and thick transmural patches that replace the infarcted region. However, little is known about the impact of cardiac tissue patches on pump function in a patient's heart. In addition, it is not clear what patch structural properties - such as active stress generation, muscle fiber alignment, or material stiffness - may best augment existing heart tissue. Computational modeling can be used to examine different implementations and patch properties, illuminating the mechanical impact of cardiac tissue patches in the beating heart. In this work, we computationally implement different cardiac tissue patches to understand benefits of particular patch types and properties. We find that in transmural cardiac tissue patches, both activation and fiber alignment improve function. A transmural patch generating 10% of healthy active stress can increase stroke volume by 18%, and higher generated active stress in a circumferential muscle fiber orientation can recover stroke volume by over 50%. Furthermore, we find that surface cardiac tissue patches can enhance heart function slightly despite limiting diastolic filling, especially when fibrotic thinning has occurred. These conclusions identify broad design goals for the engineering of cardiac tissue patches to improve heart function after a myocardial infarction.</description>

      <title>Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps</title>

Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>

      <title>From Order to Chimeras: Unraveling Dynamic Patterns in Active Fluids with Nonlinear Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore pattern formation in an active fluid system involving two chemical species that regulate active stress: a fast-diffusing species ($A$) and a slow-diffusing species ($I$). The growth of species $A$ is modelled using a nonlinear logistic term. Through linear stability analysis, we derive phase diagrams illustrating the various dynamical regimes in parameter space. Our findings indicate that an increase in the P\'eclet number results in the destabilisation of the uniform steady state. In contrast, counter-intuitively, an increase in the nonlinear growth parameter of $A$ actually stabilises the homogeneous steady-state regime. Additionally, we observe that greater asymmetry between the species leads to three distinct dynamical phases, while low asymmetry fails to produce oscillatory instability. Numerical simulations conducted in instability regimes show patterns that range from irregular, arrhythmic configurations at high P\'eclet numbers to both transient and robust symmetry-breaking chimera states. Notably, these chimera patterns are more prevalent in the oscillatory instability regime, and our stability analysis indicates that this regime is the most extensive for high nonlinear growth parameters and moderately high P\'eclet numbers. Further, we also find soliton-like structures where aggregations of species $A$ merge, and new aggregations spontaneously emerge, and these patterns are prevalent in the phase of stationary instability. Overall, our study illustrates that a diverse array of patterns can emerge in active matter influenced by nonlinear growth in a chemical species, with chimeras being particularly dominant when the nonlinear growth parameter is elevated.</description>

      <title>Rhythmic sharing: A bio-inspired paradigm for zero-shot adaptive learning in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08644v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain rapidly adapts to new contexts and learns from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms struggle to mimic. Inspired by the mechanical oscillatory rhythms of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm utilizing link strength oscillations, where learning is associated with the coordination of these oscillations. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, allowing the network to sense and adapt to subtle contextual changes without supervision. The network becomes a generalist AI architecture, capable of predicting dynamics of multiple contexts including unseen ones. These results make our paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of cognition. Because our paradigm is agnostic to specifics of the neural network, our study opens doors for introducing rapid adaptive learning into leading AI models.</description>
