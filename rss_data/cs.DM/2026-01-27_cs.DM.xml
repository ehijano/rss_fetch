      <title>A Characterization of Geodetic Graphs in Terms of their Embedded Even Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of finding the general classification of geodetic graphs is still open. We believe that one of the obstacles to attain this goal is that geodetic graphs lack a structural description. In other words, their fundamental properties have not yet been established in terms of the description of the complete graphs, paths and cycles contained within them. The absence of this information makes their generation and enumeration (as inherent parts of their general classification) a difficult task. This paper examines the structural qualities of geodetic graphs using their so-called embedded even graphs. To this effect, the necessary and sufficient conditions for eliminating the nongeodecity of each pair of C-opposite vertices in an even cycle C have been formulated, while the bigeodecity of the embedded even graphs of a geodetic graph has been established. In a sense, this allows us to arrive at the conclusion that the basic building blocks of geodetic graphs are precisely this class of bigeodetic ones.</description>

      <title>On the Subspace Orbit Problem and the Simultaneous Skolem Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Orbit Problem asks whether the orbit of a point under a matrix reaches a given target set. When the target is a single point, the problem was shown to be decidable in polynomial time by Kannan and Lipton. This decidability result was later extended by Chonev et al. to targets of dimension 3 (in arbitrary ambient dimension), but decidability remains open for subspaces of dimension 4. At the other extreme, the special case of the Orbit Problem in which the target set is a hyperplane of codimension 1 is equivalent to the Skolem Problem for linear recurrence sequences, whose decidability has been open for many decades.
  In this paper, we show that the Orbit Problem is decidable if the target subspace has dimension logarithmic in the dimension of the orbit. Over rationals, we moreover obtain a complexity bound NP^RP in this case. On the other hand, we show that the version of the Orbit Problem where the dimension of the target subspace is linear in the dimension of the orbit is as hard as the Skolem Problem.</description>

      <title>On the existence of heavy columns in binary matrices with distinct rows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of heavy columns in binary matrices with distinct rows. A column of an m x n binary matrix is called heavy if the number of ones in it is at least m/2. We introduce two recursive algorithms, A1 and A2, that examine properties of subma trices obtained by row filtering and column deletion. We prove that if algorithm A1 returns True for a binary matrix with distinct rows, then the matrix contains at least one heavy column (Theorem 1). Further more, we prove that if algorithm A2 returns True for a binary matrix with distinct rows, distinct columns, and no all-zero columns, then the matrix also contains at least one heavy column (Theorem 2). The key innovation in A2 is an early termination condition: if exactly one row has a zero in some column, that column is immediately identified as heavy. The proofs employ a novel argument based on the existence of unpaired rows with respect to specific columns, combined with careful analysis of the recursive structure of the algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.17169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the complexity of the minimum feedback vertex set problem (MFBVS) for tournaments with forbidden subtournaments. The MFBVS problem in general tournaments is known to be NP-complete. We prove that the MFBVS problem for $W_5$-free and $U_5$-free tournaments is in P, and for $T_5$-free tournaments it remains NP-complete. Moreover, we prove a necessary condition for all $H$ such that the MFBVS problem for $H$-free tournaments is in P. We also show that the necessary condition is not sufficient.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Linear Tur\'{a}n Number for Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hypergraph $H$ is said to be \emph{linear} if every pair of vertices lies in at most one hyperedge. Given a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $r$-uniform hypergraphs, an $r$-uniform hypergraph $H$ is \emph{$\mathcal{F}$-free} if it contains no member of $\mathcal{F}$ as a subhypergraph. The \emph{linear Tur\'{a}n number} $ex_r^{\mathrm{lin}}(n,\mathcal{F})$ denotes the maximum number of hyperedges in an $\mathcal{F}$-free linear $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices.
  Gy\'arf\'as, Ruszink\'o, and S\'ark\"ozy~[\emph{Linear Tur\'an numbers of acyclic triple systems}, European J.\ Combin.\ (2022)] initiated the study of bounds on the linear Tur\'an number for acyclic $3$-uniform linear hypergraphs.
  In this paper, we extend the study of linear Tur\'{a}n number for acyclic systems to higher uniformity. We first give a construction for any linear $r$-uniform tree with $k$ edges that yields the lower bound $ ex_r^{\mathrm{lin}}(n,T_k^r)\ge {n(k-1)}/{r}, $ under mild divisibility and existence assumptions. Next, we study hypertrees with four edges. We prove the exact bound $ ex_r^{\mathrm{lin}}(n,B_4^r)\le {(r+1)n}/{r} $ and characterize the extremal hypergraph class, where $B_4^r$ is formed from $S_3^r$ by appending a hyperedge incident to a degree-one vertex. We also prove the bound $ ex_r^{\mathrm{lin}}(n,E_4^r)\le {(2r-1)n}/{r} $ for the crown $E_4^r$. Finally, we give a construction showing $ ex_r^{\mathrm{lin}}(n,P_4^r)\ge {(r+1)n}/{r} $ under suitable assumptions and conclude with a conjecture on sharp upper bound for $P_4^r$.</description>

      <title>Computing bounded solutions to linear Diophantine equations with the sum of divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient computational method for finding all solutions $n\leq U$ to the Diophantine equation $a\sigma(n) = bn + c$, where integer coefficient $a,b,c$ and an upper bound $U$ are given. Our method is implemented in SageMath computer algebra system within the framework of recursively enumerated sets and natively benefits from MapReduce parallelization. We used it to discover new solutions to many published equations and close gaps in between the known large solutions, including but not limited to hyperperfect and $f$-perfect numbers, as well as to significantly lift the existence bounds in open questions about quasiperfect and almost-perfect numbers.</description>

      <title>Persistent Permutability in Choice Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistence is a strong, global, behavioural property of a Petri net, meaning that no activity can disable a different activity. Persistent permutability is a weaker property, pertaining to individual interleavings of a Petri net and stating that a non-persistent sequence can be permuted into a persistent one. We identify Petri net classes for which persistent permutability already suffices to imply overall persistence. These classes generalise free-choice nets and are related to Petri's concept of ``confusion'', while they are distinguished from each other by diverse restrictions on the choice structure of a net. We prove Ochmanski's conjecture to be correct for these classes.</description>

      <title>Di-Graphs with tightly connected Clusters: Effective Graph Laplacians and Resolvent Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study Laplacians on graphs for which connectivity within certain sub-graphs tends to infinity. Our main focus are graphs sharing a common node set on which edge weights within certain clusters grow to infinity. As intra-cluster connectivity increases, we show that the corresponding graph Laplacians converge -- in the resolvent sense -- to an effective graph Laplacian. This effective limit Laplacian is defined on a coarsened graph, where each highly connected cluster is collapsed into a single node. In the undirected setting, the effective Laplacian arises naturally from agregating over tightly connected clusters. In the directed case, the limiting graph structure depends on the precise manner in which connectivity increases; with the corresponding effects mediated by the left and right kernel structure of the Laplacian restricted to high-connectivity clusters. Our results shed light on the emergence of coarse-grained dynamics in large-scale networks and contribute to spectral graph theory of directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Remarks about Connection and Dirac matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The connection Laplacian L and the Dirac matrix D are both n x n matrices defined from a given finite simplicial complex G with n sets. In both cases, there is interlacing of the eigenvalues for subcomplexes. This gives general upper bounds of the eigenvalues both for L and D in terms of inclusion or intersection degrees. We conjecture that L always dominates both D and the inverse of L in a weak Loewner sense. In a second part we look at dynamical systems (G,T), where T is a simplicial map on G. Both L and D generalize to dynamical versions of L and D. The modified L is still unimodular with an explicit Green function inverse and modified Dirac part still comes from an exterior derivative d. We also review the Lefschetz fixed point theorem for a simplicial map T on a simplicial complex G which implies the Brouwer fixed point theorem: any simplicial map on a contractible finite abstract simplicial complex G has a fixed simplex.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Graphs by Counting Homomorphisms from Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lov\'asz (1967) showed that two graphs $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic if, and only if, they are homomorphism indistinguishable over all graphs, i.e., $G$ and $H$ admit the same number of number of homomorphisms from every graph $F$. Subsequently, a substantial line of work studied homomorphism indistinguishability over restricted graph classes. For example, homomorphism indistinguishability over minor-closed graph classes $\mathcal{F}$ such as the class of planar graphs, the class of graphs of treewidth $\leq k$, pathwidth $\leq k$, or treedepth $\leq k$, was shown to be equivalent to quantum isomorphism and equivalences with respect to counting logic fragments, respectively.
  Via such characterisations, the distinguishing power of e.g. logical or quantum graph isomorphism relaxations can be studied with graph-theoretic means. In this vein, Roberson (2022) conjectured that homomorphism indistinguishability over every graph class excluding some minor is not the same as isomorphism. We prove this conjecture for all vortex-free graph classes. In particular, homomorphism indistinguishability over graphs of bounded Euler genus is not the same as isomorphism. As a negative result, we show that Roberson's conjecture fails when generalised to graph classes excluding a topological minor.
  Furthermore, we show homomorphism distinguishing closedness for several graph classes including all topological-minor-closed and union-closed classes of forests, and show that homomorphism indistinguishability over graphs of genus $\leq g$ (and other parameters) forms a strict hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Additive sink subtraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subtraction games are a classical topic in Combinatorial Game Theory. A result of Golomb~(1966) shows that every subtraction game with a finite move set has an eventually periodic nim-sequence, but the known proof yields only an exponential upper bound on the period length. Flammenkamp (1997) conjectures a striking classification for three-move subtraction games: non-additive rulesets exhibit linear period lengths of the form ``the sum of two moves'', where the choice of which two moves displays fractal-like behavior, while additive sets $S=\{a,b,a+b\}$ have purely periodic outcomes with linear or quadratic period lengths. Despite early attention in \emph{Winning Ways} (1982), the general additive case remains open. We introduce and analyze a dual winning convention, which we call {\sc sink subtraction}. Unlike the standard wall convention, where moves to negative positions are forbidden, the sink convention declares a player the winner upon moving to a non-positive position. We show that {\sc additive sink subtraction} admits a complete solution: the nim-sequence is purely periodic with an explicit linear or quadratic period formula, and we conjecture a duality between additive sink subtraction and classical wall subtraction. Keywords: Additive Subtraction Game, Nimber, Periodicity, Sink Convention.</description>

      <title>On Piecewise Affine Reachability with Bellman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the following reachability problem for piecewise affine maps: Given two vectors $\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{t} \in \mathbb{Q}^d$ and a piecewise affine map $f \colon \mathbb{Q}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{Q}^d$, does there exist $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f^{n}(\mathbf{s}) = \mathbf{t}$? In this work, we focus on this reachability problem for a subclass of piecewise affine maps -- Bellman operators arising from Markov decision processes. We prove that the reachability problem for $\max$- and $\min$-Bellman operators is decidable in any dimension under either of the following conditions: (i) the target vector $\mathbf{t}$ is not the fixed point of the operator $f$; or (ii) the initial and target vectors $\mathbf{s}$ and $\mathbf{t}$ are comparable with respect to the componentwise order. Furthermore, we show that in the two-dimensional case, the reachability problem for Bellman operators is decidable for arbitrary $\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{t} \in \mathbb{Q}^2$. This stands in sharp contrast to the known undecidability of reachability for general piecewise affine maps in dimension $d = 2$.</description>

      <title>NPA Hierarchy for Quantum Isomorphism and Homomorphism Indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Man\v{c}inska and Roberson [FOCS'20] showed that two graphs are quantum isomorphic if and only if they admit the same number of homomorphisms from any planar graph. Atserias et al. [JCTB'19] proved that quantum isomorphism is undecidable in general, which motivates the study of its relaxations. In the classical setting, Roberson and Seppelt [ICALP'23] characterized the feasibility of each level of the Lasserre hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations of graph isomorphism in terms of equality of homomorphism counts from an appropriate graph class. The NPA hierarchy, a noncommutative generalization of the Lasserre hierarchy, provides a sequence of semidefinite programming relaxations for quantum isomorphism. In the quantum setting, we show that the feasibility of each level of the NPA hierarchy for quantum isomorphism is equivalent to equality of homomorphism counts from an appropriate class of planar graphs. Combining this characterization with the convergence of the NPA hierarchy, and noting that the union of these classes is the set of all planar graphs, we obtain a new proof of the result of Man\v{c}inska and Roberson [FOCS'20] that avoids the use of quantum groups. Moreover, this homomorphism indistinguishability characterization also yields a randomized polynomial-time algorithm deciding exact feasibility of each fixed level of the NPA hierarchy of SDP relaxations for quantum isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Lower bounding the MaxCut of high girth 3-regular graphs using the QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study MaxCut on 3-regular graphs of minimum girth $g$ for various $g$'s. We obtain new lower bounds on the maximum cut achievable in such graphs by analyzing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). For $g \geq 16$, at depth $p \geq 7$, the QAOA improves on previously known lower bounds. Our bounds are established through classical numerical analysis of the QAOA's expected performance. This analysis does not produce the actual cuts but establishes their existence. When implemented on a quantum computer, the QAOA provides an efficient algorithm for finding such cuts, using a constant-depth quantum circuit. To our knowledge, this gives an exponential speedup over the best known classical algorithm guaranteed to achieve cuts of this size on graphs of this girth. We also apply the QAOA to the Maximum Independent Set problem on the same class of graphs.</description>

      <title>Discrepancy of Arithmetic Progressions in Boxes and Convex Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combinatorial discrepancy of arithmetic progressions inside $[N] := \{1, \ldots, N\}$ is the smallest integer $D$ for which $[N]$ can be colored with two colors so that any arithmetic progression in $[N]$ contains at most $D$ more elements from one color class than the other. Bounding the discrepancy of such set systems is a classical problem in discrepancy theory. More recently, this problem was generalized to arithmetic progressions in grids like $[N]^d$ (Valk{\'o}) and $[N_1]\times \ldots \times [N_d]$ (Fox, Xu, and Zhou). In the latter setting, Fox, Xu, and Zhou gave upper and lower bounds on the discrepancy that match within a $\frac{\log |\Omega|}{\log \log |\Omega|}$ factor, where $\Omega := [N_1]\times \ldots \times [N_d]$ is the ground set. In this work, we use the connection between factorization norms and discrepancy to improve their upper bound to be within a $\sqrt{\log|\Omega|}$ factor from the lower bound. We also generalize Fox, Xu, and Zhou's lower bound, and our upper bounds to arithmetic progressions in arbitrary convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Basis Number of Graphs Excluding Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The basis number of a graph $G$ is the minimum $k$ such that the cycle space of $G$ is generated by a family of cycles using each edge at most $k$ times. A classical result of Mac Lane states that planar graphs are exactly graphs with basis number at most 2, and more generally, graphs embedded on a fixed surface are known to have bounded basis number. Generalising this, we prove that graphs excluding a fixed minor $H$ have bounded basis number. Our proof uses the Graph Minor Structure Theorem, which requires us to understand how basis number behaves in tree-decompositions. In particular, we prove that graphs of treewidth $k$ have basis number bounded by some function of $k$. We handle tree-decompositions using the proof framework developed by Boja\'nczyk and Pilipczuk in their proof of Courcelle's conjecture. Combining our approach with independent results of Miraftab, Morin and Yuditsky (2025) on basis number and path-decompositions, one can moreover improve our upper bound to a polynomial one: there exists an absolute constant $c&gt;0$ such that every $H$-minor free graph has basis number $O(|H|^c)$.</description>
