      <title>DeFi Arbitrage in Hedged Liquidity Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirically, the prevailing market prices for liquidity tokens of the constant product market maker (CPMM) -- as offered in practice by companies such as Uniswap -- readily permit arbitrage opportunities by delta hedging the risk of the position. Herein, we investigate this arbitrage opportunity by treating the liquidity token as a derivative position in the prices of the underlying assets for the CPMM. In doing so, not dissimilar to the Black-Scholes result, we deduce risk-neutral pricing and hedging formulas for these liquidity tokens. Furthermore, with our novel pricing formula, we construct a method to calibrate a volatility to data which provides an updated (non-market) price which would not permit arbitrage if quoted by the CPMM. We conclude with a discussion of novel AMM designs which would bring the pricing of liquidity tokens into the modern financial era.</description>

      <title>Crypto Inverse-Power Options and Fractional Stochastic Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent empirical evidence has highlighted the crucial role of jumps in both price and volatility within the cryptocurrency market. In this paper, we integrate price--volatility co-jumps and volatility short-term dependency into a coherent model framework, featuring fractional stochastic volatility. We particularly focus on inverse options, including the emerging Quanto inverse options and their power-type generalizations, aiming at mitigating cryptocurrency exchange rate risk and adjusting inherent risk exposure. Characteristic function-based pricing--hedging formulas are derived for these inverse options. The model framework is applied to asymmetric Laplace jump-diffusions and Gaussian-mixed tempered stable-type processes, employing three types of fractional kernels, for an extensive empirical analysis involving model calibration on two independent Bitcoin options data sets, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Key insights from our theoretical analysis and empirical findings include: (1) the superior performance of fractional stochastic-volatility models compared to various benchmark models, including those incorporating jumps and stochastic volatility, along with high computational efficiency when utilizing a piecewise kernel, (2) the practical necessity of considering jumps in both price and volatility, along with rough volatility, in pricing and hedging cryptocurrency options, (3) stability of calibrated parameter values in line with stylized facts.</description>
