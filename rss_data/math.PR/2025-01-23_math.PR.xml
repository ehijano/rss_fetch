      <title>On large deviation probabilities for self-normalized sums of random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reduced the large deviation problem for a self-normalized random walk to one for an auxiliary usual bivariate random walk. This enabled us to prove the classical theorem for self-normalized walks by Q.-M. Shao (1997) under slightly more general conditions and, moreover, to provide a graphical interpretation for the emerging limit in terms of the rate function for the bivariate problem. Furthermore, using this approach, we obtained exact (rather than just logarithmic) large deviation asymptotics for the probabilities of interest. Extensions to more general self-normalizing setups including the multivariate case were discussed.</description>

      <title>Friedlin-Wentzell solutions of discrete Hamilton Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a sequence of finite irreducible Markov chains with exponentially small transition rates: the transition graph is a fixed, finite, strongly connected directed graph; the transition rates decay exponentially on a paramenter N with a given rate that varies from edge to edge. The stationary equation uniquely identifies the invariant measure for each N, but at exponential scale in the limit as N goes to infinity reduces to a discrete equation for the large deviation rate functional of the invariant measure, that in general has not an unique solution. In analogy with the continuous case of diffusions, we call such equation a discrete Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Likewise in the continuous case we introduce a notion of viscosity supersolutions and viscosity subsolutions and give a detailed geometric characterization of the solutions in terms of special faces of the polyedron of Lipschitz functions on the transition graph. This parallels the weak KAM theory in a purely discrete setting. We identify also a special vanishing viscosity solution obtained in the limit from the combinatorial representation of the invariant measure given by the matrix tree theorem. This gives a selection principle on the set of solutions to the discrete Hamilton Jacobi equation obtained by the Friedlin and Wentzell minimal arborescences construction; this enlights and parallels what happens in the continuous setting.</description>

      <title>Limit shape of the leaky Abelian sandpile model with multiple layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a triple generalization of the Leaky Abelian Sandpile Model (LASM) of Alevy and Mkrtchyan, originally analyzed in the case of the square lattice in dimension two. First, we work in any dimension. Second, each site can hold several different stacks of sand, one for each of a certain given number of different layers or colors. Third, when a stack of one color at a site topples, it can send sand not only to its nearest neighbors in equal amounts, but to all possible locations and colors, according to a fixed but arbitrary mass distribution. Stacks of different colors can topple according to different distributions and different leakiness parameters, however the toppling rule should be site-independent. We obtain three main results. First, in this generality, when the LASM is started with $N$ grains of sand in one color at the origin, the final stable configuration, after scaling down by $\log N$, converges to a limit shape as $N$ goes to infinity. Second, when the leakiness parameter converges to infinity and the toppling distribution has finite range, the limit shape converges to a polytope. Third, when the leakiness parameters converge to one, which means the leakiness disappears, the limit shape of the sandpile converges to an ellipsoid. From a technical point of view, we rely on a strong relation between the Green function for random walk and the shape of the sandpile. Finally, the limit shape exhibits interesting duality properties, which we also investigate.</description>

      <title>On a Problem of Kac concerning Anisotropic Lacunary Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a lacunary sequence $(n_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$, arbitrary positive weights $(c_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ that satisfy a Lindeberg-Feller condition, and a function $f: \mathbb{T} \to \mathbb{R}$ whose Fourier coefficients $\hat{f_k}$ decay at rate $\frac{1}{k^{1/2 + \varepsilon}}$, we prove central limit theorems for $\sum_{k \leq N}c_kf(n_kx)$, provided $(n_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ satisfies a Diophantine condition that is necessary in general. This addresses a question raised by M. Kac [Ann. of Math., 1946].</description>

      <title>On Elephant Random Walk with Random Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the elephant random walk (ERW) with memory consisting of randomly selected steps from its history. It is a time-changed variant of the standard elephant random walk with memory consisting of its full history. At each time point, the time changing component is the composition of two uniformly distributed independent random variables with support over all the past steps. Several conditional distributional properties including the conditional mean increments and conditional displacement of ERW with random memory are obtained. Using these conditional results, we derive the recursive and explicit expressions for the mean increments and mean displacement of the walk.</description>

      <title>Stability of travelling wave solutions to reaction-diffusion equations driven by additive noise with H\"older continuous paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate stability of travelling wave solutions to a class of reaction-diffusion equations perturbed by infinite-dimensional additive noise with H\"older continuous paths, covering in particular fractional Wiener processes with general Hurst parameter. In the latter example, we obtain explicit error bounds on the maximal distance from the solution of the stochastic reaction-diffusion equation to the orbit of travelling wave fronts in terms of the Hurst parameter and the spatial regularity for small noise amplitude. Our bounds can be optimised for short times in terms of the Hurst parameter and for large times in terms of the spatial regularity of the noise covariance of the driving fractional Wiener process.</description>

      <title>Uniform temporal trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of random temporal networks, we introduce a class of random trees that we coin \emph{uniform temporal trees}. A uniform temporal tree is obtained by assigning independent uniform $[0,1]$ labels to the edges of a rooted complete infinite $n$-ary tree and keeping only those vertices for which the path from the root to the vertex has decreasing edge labels.
  The $p$-percolated uniform temporal tree, denoted by $\mathcal{T}_{n,p}$, is obtained similarly, with the additional constraint that the edge labels on each path are all below $p$. We study several properties of these trees, including their size, height, the typical depth of a vertex, and degree distribution. In particular, we establish a limit law for the size of $\mathcal{T}_{n,p}$ which states that $\frac{|\mathcal{T}_{n,p}|}{e^{np}}$ converges in distribution to an $\exponential(1)$ random variable as $n \to \infty$. For the height $H_{n,p}$, we prove that $\frac{H_{n,p}}{np}$ converges to $e$ in probability. Uniform temporal trees show some remarkable similarities to uniform random recursive trees.</description>

      <title>A new cutoff criterion for non-negatively curved chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cutoff phenomenon was recently shown to systematically follow from non-negative curvature and the product condition, for all Markov diffusions. The proof crucially relied on a classical \emph{chain rule} satisfied by the carr\'e du champ operator, which is specific to differential generators and hence fails on discrete spaces. In the present paper, we show that an approximate version of this chain rule in fact always holds, with an extra cost that depends on the log-Lipschitz regularity of the considered observable. As a consequence, we derive a new cutoff criterion for non-negatively curved chains on finite spaces. The latter allows us to recover, in a simple and unified way, a number of historical instances of cutoff that had been established through model-specific arguments. Emblematic examples include random walk on the hypercube, random transpositions, random walk on the multislice, or MCMC samplers for popular spin systems such as the Ising and Hard-core models on bounded-degree graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $0&lt;q&lt;1$, let $Maj$ be the distribution on the symmetric group $S_n$ such that a permutation $\pi \in S_n$ is selected with probability proportional to $q^{maj(\pi)}$. The distribution has connections to $q$-Plancherel measure. We describe an algorithm that realizes $Maj$, and use it to prove known results of $q$-Plancherel measure without the need of representation theory. This sampler is transparent and elegant, allowing properties of $Maj$ about its limit shape, pattern normality, and cycle structure to be obtained.</description>

      <title>Optimal Rebate Design: Incentives, Competition and Efficiency in Auction Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the design of an efficient rebate policy in auction markets, focusing on a continuous-time setting with competition among market participants. In this model, a stock exchange collects transaction fees from auction investors executing block trades to buy or sell a risky asset, then redistributes these fees as rebates to competing market makers submitting limit orders. Market makers influence both the price at which the asset trades and their arrival intensity in the auction. We frame this problem as a principal-multi-agent problem and provide necessary and sufficient conditions to characterize the Nash equilibrium among market makers. The exchange's optimization problem is formulated as a high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with Poisson jump processes, which is solved using a verification result. To numerically compute the optimal rebate and transaction fee policies, we apply the Deep BSDE method. Our results show that optimal transaction fees and rebate structures improve market efficiency by narrowing the spread between the auction clearing price and the asset's fundamental value, while ensuring a minimal gain for both market makers indexed on the price of the asset on a coexisting limit order book.</description>

      <title>Replicator dynamics as the large population limit of a discrete Moran process in the weak selection regime: A proof via Eulerian specification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the large population limit of a multi-strategy discrete-time Moran process in the weak selection regime. We show that the replicator dynamics is interpreted as the large-population limit of the Moran process. This result is obtained by interpreting the discrete process in its Eulerian specification, proving a compactness result in the Wasserstein space of probability measures for the law of the proportions of strategies, and passing to the limit in the continuity equation that describes the evolution of the proportions.</description>

      <title>Constrained mean-field control with singular control: Existence, stochastic maximum principle and constrained FBSDE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies some mean-field control (MFC) problems with singular control under general dynamic state-control-law constraints. We first propose a customized relaxed control formulation to cope with the dynamic mixed constraints and establish the existence of an optimal control using some compactification arguments in the proper canonical spaces to accommodate the singular control. To characterize the optimal pair of regular and singular controls, we treat the controlled McKean-Vlasov process as an infinite-dimensional equality constraint and recast the MFC problem as an optimization problem on canonical spaces with constraints on Banach space, allowing us to derive the stochastic maximum principle (SMP) and a constrained BSDE using a novel Lagrange multipliers method. In addition, we further investigate the uniqueness and the stability result of the solution to the constrained FBSDE associated to the constrained MFC problem with singular control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.10657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the extension of signed bimeasures on $\delta$-rings and for the existence of relative kernels. This result generalises the construction method of regular conditional probabilities to the more general setting of extended signed measures. Building on this result, we obtain the most general theory of stochastic integrals based on random measures, thus extending and generalising the whole integration theory developed in the celebrated Rajput and Rosinski's paper (\textit{Probab.~Theory Relat.~Fields}, \textbf{82} (1989) 451-487) and the recent results by Passeggeri (\textit{Stoch.~Process.~Their Appl.}, \textbf{130}, (3), (2020), 1735-1791).</description>

      <title>Time-inhomogeneous KPZ equation from non-equilibrium Ginzburg-Landau SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework, which is a mesoscopic-fluctuation-scale analog of Yau's method [46] for hydrodynamic limits, for deriving KPZ equations with time-dependent coefficients from time-inhomogeneous interacting particle systems. To our knowledge, this is the first derivation of a time-inhomogeneous KPZ equation whose solution theory has an additional nonlinearity that is absent in the time-homogeneous case. So, we also show global well-posedness for the SPDE. To be concrete, we restrict to time-inhomogeneous Ginzburg-Landau SDEs. The method for deriving KPZ is based on a Cole-Hopf transform, whose analysis is the bulk of this paper. The key ingredient for said analysis is a ``local" second-order Boltzmann-Gibbs principle, shown by stochastic calculus of the Ginzburg-Landau SDEs and regularity estimates for their Kolmogorov equations, all of which likely generalizes to many other particle systems. This addresses a ``Big Picture Question" in [47] on deriving KPZ equations. It is also, to our knowledge, a first result on KPZ-type limits in a non-equilibrium like that in [6].</description>

      <title>Some properties of a non-hydrostatic stochastic oceanic primitive equations model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how relaxing the classical hydrostatic balance hypothesis affects theoretical aspects of the LU primitive equations well-posedness. We focus on models that sit between incompressible 3D LU Navier-Stokes equations and standard LU primitive equations, aiming for numerical manageability while capturing non-hydrostatic phenomena. Our main result concerns the well-posedness of a specific stochastic interpretation of the LU primitive equations. This holds with rigid-lid type boundary conditions, and when the horizontal component of noise is independent of z. In fact these conditions can be related to the dynamical regime in which the primitive equations remain valid. Moreover, under these conditions, we show that the LU primitive equations solution tends toward the one of the deterministic primitive equations for a vanishing noise, thus providing a physical coherence to the LU stochastic model.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic classification of the cutoff phenomenon in Markov processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the cutoff phenomenon for Markov processes under information divergences such as $f$-divergences and R\'enyi divergences. We classify most common divergences into four types, namely $L^2$-type, $\mathrm{TV}$-type, separation-type and $\mathrm{KL}$ divergence, in which we prove that the cutoff phenomenon are equivalent and relate the cutoff time and window among members within each type. To justify that this classification is natural, we provide examples in which the family of Markov processes exhibit cutoff in one type but not in another. We also establish new product conditions in these settings for the processes to exhibit cutoff, along with new results in non-reversible or non-normal situations. The proofs rely on a functional analytic approach towards cutoff.</description>

      <title>Crossing bridges between percolation models and Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this survey, we explore the connections between two areas of probability: percolation theory and population genetic models. Our first goal is to highlight a construction on Galton-Watson trees, which has been described in two different ways: Bernoulli bond percolation and neutral mutations. Next, we introduce a novel connection between the Divide-and-Color percolation model and a particular multi-type Galton-Watson tree. We provide a gentle introduction to these topics while presenting an overview of the results that connect them.</description>

      <title>Subcritical annulus crossing in spatial random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider general continuum percolation models obeying sparseness, translation invariance, and spatial decorrelation. In particular, this includes models constructed on general point sets other than the standard Poisson point process or the Bernoulli-percolated lattice. Moreover, in our setting the existence of an edge may depend not only on the two end vertices but also on a surrounding vertex set and models are included that are not monotone in some of their parameters. We study the critical annulus-crossing intensity $\widehat{\lambda}_{c}$, which is smaller or equal to the classical critical percolation intensity $\lambda_{c}$ and derive a condition for $\widehat{\lambda}_{c}&gt;0$ by relating the crossing of annuli to the occurrence of long edges. This condition is sharp for models that have a modicum of independence. In a nutshell, our result states that annuli are either not crossed for small intensities or crossed by a single edge. Our proof rests on a multiscale argument that further allows us to directly describe the decay of the annulus-crossing probability with the decay of long edges probabilities.
  We apply our result to a number of examples from the literature. Most importantly, we extensively discuss the weight-dependent random connection model in a generalised version, for which we derive sufficient conditions for the presence or absence of long edges that are typically easy to check. These conditions are built on a decay coefficient $\zeta$ that has recently seen some attention due to its importance for various proofs of global graph properties.</description>

      <title>Exponential Ergodicity in $\W_1$ for SDEs with Distribution Dependent Noise and Partially Dissipative Drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Being concerned with ergodicity of McKean--Vlasov SDEs, we establish a general result on exponential ergodicity in the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance. The result is successfully applied to non-degenerate and multiplicative Brownian motion cases, degenerate second order systems, and even the additive $\alpha$-stable noise, where the coefficients before the noise are allowed to be distribution dependent and the drifts are only assumed to be partially dissipative. Our results considerably improve existing ones whose coefficients before the noise are distribution-free.</description>

      <title>Statistical Learning with Sublinear Regret of Propagator Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of learning problems in which an agent liquidates a risky asset while creating both transient price impact driven by an unknown convolution propagator and linear temporary price impact with an unknown parameter. We characterize the trader's performance as maximization of a revenue-risk functional, where the trader also exploits available information on a price predicting signal. We present a trading algorithm that alternates between exploration and exploitation phases and achieves sublinear regrets with high probability. For the exploration phase we propose a novel approach for non-parametric estimation of the price impact kernel by observing only the visible price process and derive sharp bounds on the convergence rate, which are characterised by the singularity of the propagator. These kernel estimation methods extend existing methods from the area of Tikhonov regularisation for inverse problems and are of independent interest. The bound on the regret in the exploitation phase is obtained by deriving stability results for the optimizer and value function of the associated class of infinite-dimensional stochastic control problems. As a complementary result we propose a regression-based algorithm to estimate the conditional expectation of non-Markovian signals and derive its convergence rate.</description>

      <title>A semigroup approach to the reconstruction theorem and the multilevel Schauder estimate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reconstruction theorem and the multilevel Schauder estimate have central roles in the analytic theory of regularity structures [17]. Inspired by [26], we provide elementary proofs for them by using the semigroup of operators. Essentially, we use only the semigroup property and the upper estimates of kernels. Moreover, we refine the several types of Besov reconstruction theorems [18, 7] and introduce the new framework "regularity-integrability structures". The analytic theorems in this paper are applied to the study of quasilinear SPDEs [5] and an inductive proof of the convergence of random models [4].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stochastic homogenization for a family of integral functionals with convex and nonstandard growth integrands defined on Orlicz-Sobolev's spaces. One fundamental in this topic is to extend the classical compactness results of the two-scale convergence in the mean method to this type of spaces. Moreover, it is shown by the two-scale convergence in the mean method that the sequence of minimizers of a class of highly oscillatory minimizations problems involving convex functionals converges to the minimizers of a homogenized problem with a suitable convex function.</description>

      <title>A stochastic perturbation approach to nonlinear bifurcating problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating probabilistic terms in mathematical models is crucial for capturing and quantifying uncertainties in real-world systems. However, stochastic models typically require large computational resources to produce meaningful statistics. For this reason, the development of reduction techniques becomes essential for enabling efficient and scalable simulations of complex scenarios while quantifying the underlying uncertainties. In this work, we study the accuracy of Polynomial Chaos (PC) surrogate expansion of the probability space on a bifurcating phenomenon in fluid dynamics, namely the Coanda effect. In particular, we propose a novel non-deterministic approach to generic bifurcation detection problems, where the stochastic setting provides a different perspective on the non-uniqueness of the solution, also avoiding expensive simulations for many instances of the parameter. Thus, starting from the formulation of the Spectral Stochastic Finite Element Method (SSFEM), we extend the methodology to deal with solutions of a bifurcating problem, by working with a perturbed version of the deterministic model. We discuss the link between deterministic and stochastic bifurcation diagrams, highlighting the surprising capability of PC polynomial coefficients to give insights into the deterministic solution manifold.</description>

      <title>Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homogenisation theory has seen recent application in the derivation of stochastic transport models for fluids dynamics. In this work, we first construct the Lagrange-to-Euler map of an ideal fluid flow, modelled by a stochastic flow of diffeomorphism, as the deterministic homogenized limit of a parameterized flow map that decomposes into rapidly fluctuating and slow components. Specifically, we prove the convergence of this parameterized map to a scale-separated limit under the assumptions of a weak-invariance principle for the rapidly fluctuating component and path continuity for the slow component. In this limit, the rapidly fluctuating component becomes a stochastic flow of diffeomorphism that can introduce stochastic transport into the dynamics of the slow component, which remains to be closed.
  The second contribution of this work formulates two distinct types of variational closures for the slow component of the homogenized flow whilst utilising the composite structure of the full stochastic flow. In one case, the critical points of the new principle satisfy a system of random partial differential equations equivalent to a system of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) under stochastic transport via a transformation by the stochastic flow. Additionally, we show these equations are stochastic Euler-Poincar\'e equations previously derived in Holm, Proc. Royal Soc. (2015). In the other case, we modify the assumptions on the slow component of composite flow and the associated variational principle to derive averaged models inspired by previous work such as Generalised Lagrangian Mean (GLM) and Lagrangian Average Euler Poincar\'e (LAEP).</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport for $\epsilon$-Contaminated Credal Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a version for lower probabilities of Monge's and Kantorovich's optimal transport problems. We show that, when the lower probabilities are the lower envelopes of $\epsilon$-contaminated sets, then our version of Monge's, and a restricted version of our Kantorovich's problems, coincide with their respective classical versions. We also give sufficient conditions for the existence of our version of Kantorovich's optimal plan, and for the two problems to be equivalent. As a byproduct, we show that for $\epsilon$-contaminations the lower probability versions of Monge's and Kantorovich's optimal transport problems need not coincide. The applications of our results to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A Data-driven Contact Estimation Method for Wheeled-Biped Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12345v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contact estimation is a key ability for limbed robots, where making and breaking contacts has a direct impact on state estimation and balance control. Existing approaches typically rely on gate-cycle priors or designated contact sensors. We design a contact estimator that is suitable for the emerging wheeled-biped robot types that do not have these features. To this end, we propose a Bayes filter in which update steps are learned from real-robot torque measurements while prediction steps rely on inertial measurements. We evaluate this approach in extensive real-robot and simulation experiments. Our method achieves better performance while being considerably more sample efficient than a comparable deep-learning baseline.</description>
