      <title>Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics II:Reduction of a complex system to a simple one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium thermodynamics far from equilibrium is investigated in terms of a generalized ``Nambu dynamics'' (termed Nambu non-equilibrium thermodynamics (NNET)); NNET consists of Nambu dynamics with multiple Hamiltonians and an entropy causing dissipation.
  It is shown that a general complex non-linear non-equilibrium system far from equilibrium can be reduced to a simple NNET, on the basis of an existence proposition of NNET. This proposition is, however, proved only formally, so that there may exist various obstacles to destroy it.
  Non-equilibrium thermodynamics studied in this article is quite general, including the case in which the product of dynamical and affinity forces forms a higher-order mixed tensor.</description>

      <title>Phase transition properties via partition function zeros: The Blume-Capel ferromagnet revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the landmark work of Lee and Yang, locating the zeros of the partition function in the complex magnetic-field plane has become a powerful method for studying phase transitions. Fisher later extended this approach to complex temperatures, and subsequent generalizations introduced other control parameters, such as the crystal field. In previous works [Moueddene et al, J. Stat. Mech. (2024) 023206; Phys. Rev. E 110, 064144 (2024)] we applied this framework to the two- and three-dimensional Blume-Capel model -- a system with a rich phase structure where a second-order critical line meets a first-order line at a tricritical point. We showed that the scaling of Lee-Yang, Fisher, and crystal-field zeros yields accurate critical exponents even for modest lattice sizes. In the present study, we extend this analysis and demonstrate that simulations need not be performed exactly at the nominal transition point to obtain reliable exponent estimates. Strikingly, small system sizes are sufficient, which not only improves methodological efficiency but also advances the broader goal of reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale computational studies.</description>

      <title>Spin current compensation from competing magnon modes in ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22315v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate thermal spin pumping in gadolinium iron garnet (GdIG), focusing on the mode-resolved dynamics of antiferromagnetic magnons and their impact on spin and heat transport. Antiferromagnets support both right-handed and left-handed magnon modes, which we treat as positive and negative frequency branches, analogous to electrons and holes in semiconductors. Using a two-sublattice model with a minimal exchange interaction scheme, we derive the temperature-dependent spin-wave spectrum and evaluate the associated thermal spin pumping coefficients. Our analysis reveals that the competition between left- and right-handed modes gives rise to a compensation temperature, where the net thermally generated spin current vanishes. Importantly, we show that this compensation point does not necessarily coincide with the crossing of magnon dispersion branches. While previous research considers a detailed microscopic model including all magnetic sublattices and exchange couplings, our approach demonstrates that key features of mode-resolved spin transport can be captured by a simplified and analytically transparent model. These findings advance the understanding of spin-caloritronic phenomena in ferrimagnets and offer new perspectives for the design of chiral magnon-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Optimal Finite-Time Thermodynamics of Effective Two-Level Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization of the conversion of thermal energy into work and the minimization of dissipation for nano- and mesoscopic systems is a complex challenge because of the important role fluctuations play on the dynamics of small systems. We generalize the work of Esposito et al. EPL 89, 20003 (2010) to optimize at all driving speeds the control needed to extract the maximum amount of work from any effective two-level systems. These emerge when one coarse-grains degrees of freedom, which is often unavoidable to obtain "real-world" two-level systems. In particular, we allow even for the system to have underlying quantum dynamics, as long as these allow for a coarse-graining that leads to a Markovian master equation. We analyze the finite-time thermodynamics of these systems and find the thermodynamically optimal protocols, which depend on the size of the coarse-graining needed to obtain a two-level system. Furthermore, we use these results to derive speed-limits for any transformation performed on an effective two-level system.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonian after a local quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the entanglement Hamiltonian in a system of one-dimensional free fermions, following a local joining quench of two initially disconnected half-chains in their ground states. Applying techniques of conformal field theory, we obtain a local expression where the left- and right-moving components of the energy density are associated with different weight functions. The results are then compared to numerical calculations for the hopping chain, which requires to consider a proper continuum limit of the lattice entanglement Hamiltonian, obtaining a good agreement with the field-theory prediction.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos, Thermalization, and Non-locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we numerically investigate whether quantum thermalization occurs during the time evolution induced by a non-local Hamiltonian whose spectra exhibit integrability. This non-local and integrable Hamiltonian is constructed by combining two types of integrable Hamiltonians. From the time dependence of entanglement entropy and mutual information, we find that non-locality can evolve the system into the typical state. On the other hand, the time dependence of logarithmic negativity shows that the non-locality can destroy the quantum correlation. These findings suggest that the quantum thermalization induced by the non-local Hamiltonian does not require the quantum chaoticity of the system.</description>

      <title>One Rudolf Peierls' surprise: the quantum-to-classical transition in the context of solid-state physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In solid state physics, it is an unsaid (tacit) assumption that the Bloch theorem is applicable to a crystal lattice even if it is of the macroscopic dimensions, provided periodicity is maintained. However, in a realistic situation, electrons in a periodic potential of ions constitute an open quantum system and are subjected to decoherence and dissipation. A natural question arises: up to what distances electrons in a periodic potential can be considered as constituting an effective closed quantum system? And what is the cause of decoherence? To answer some of these questions, the seminal theory of Ovchinnikov and Erikhman of decoherence due to ionic motion is revisited and an oversight of the authors is corrected. Correct conditions for decoherence to occur are worked out. Length scale up to which the motion of ions remains coherent is also calculated. Finally, a realistic physical picture is discussed.</description>

      <title>Kinetic pathways of coesite densification from metadynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study compression of coesite to pressures above 35 GPa, substantially beyond the equilibrium transition pressure to octahedral phases (8 GPa to stishovite). Experiments at room temperature showed that up to 30 GPa the metastable coesite structure develops only minor displacive changes (coesite-II and coesite-III) while the Si atoms remain 4-coordinated. Beyond 30 GPa, reconstructive transformations start, following different pathways from the complex structure of coesite. Besides amorphization, two different crystalline outcomes were observed. One is formation of defective high-pressure octahedral phases (Hu et al., 2015) and another one is formation of unusual and complex dense phases coesite-IV and coesite-V with Si atoms in 4-fold, 5-fold and 6-fold coordination (Bykova et al., 2018). Capturing these structural transformations computationally represents a challenge. Here we show that employing metadynamics with Si-O coordination number and volume as generic collective variables in combination with a machine-learning based ACE potential (Erhard et al., 2024), one naturally observes all three mentioned pathways, resulting in the phases observed experimentally. We describe the atomistic mechanisms along the transformation pathways. While the pathway to coesite-IV is simpler, the transformation to octahedral phases involves two steps: first, a hcp sublattice of O atoms is formed where Si atoms occupy octahedral positions but the octahedra chains do not form a regular pattern. In the second step, the Si atoms order and the chains develop a more regular arrangement. We predict that the pathway to coesite-IV is preferred at room temperature, while at 600 K the formation of octahedral phases is more likely.</description>

      <title>A Field-Theoretical Paradigm via Hierarchical Coarse-Graining: I. Generalized Mode Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiscale computer simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems. However, molecular simulations predominantly rely on particle-based representations, which become computationally prohibitive when applied beyond the molecular scale. Field-theoretical simulations have emerged as an alternative to overcome these limitations. Despite their applicability in mesoscopic simulations, these approaches are typically derived from top-down principles, leaving a gap in the bottom-up derivation of field-theoretical models for targeted molecular systems. This work presents a systematic strategy for constructing statistical field models for molecular liquids from the atomistic level, marking a critical step toward bridging particle-based and field-theoretical modeling techniques. By introducing molecular coarse-grained models as an intermediate step, this hierarchical approach reduces the complexity of the atomistic-to-field-theoretical transformation while preserving important microscopic structural correlations. We systematically derive field-theoretical models in reciprocal space for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. By incorporating additional fields for both positive and negative Fourier modes, our generalized mode theory extends the applicability of bottom-up field-theoretical models beyond the conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which can be limited to positive Fourier modes. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient perturbative approach for approximating Fourier modes of molecular interactions, reducing computational cost and allowing for integrating complex molecular interactions into the field-theoretic description.</description>

      <title>Correlated decoherence and thermometry with mobile impurities in a 1D Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the correlated decoherence dynamics of two mobile impurities trapped within a gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We use a mean-field approximation to self-consistently describe the effect of impurity-gas collisions on impurity motion, while decoherence of the impurities' internal state is computed exactly within a functional determinant approach. At equilibrium, we find that the impurities undergo bath-induced localisation as the impurity-gas interaction strength is increased. We then study the non-equilibrium dynamics induced by a sudden change of the impurities' internal state, which can be experimentally probed by Ramsey interferometry. Our theoretical approach allows us to investigate the effect of impurity motion on decoherence dynamics, finding strong deviations from the universal behaviour associated with Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe when the mass imbalance between impurity and gas atoms is small. Finally, we show that mobile impurities can be used as thermometers of their environment and that bath-mediated correlations can be beneficial for thermometric performance at low temperatures, even in the presence of non-trivial impurity motion. Our results showcase the interesting open quantum dynamics of mobile impurities dephasing in a common environment, and could help provide more precise temperature estimates of ultracold fermionic mixtures.</description>

      <title>Wave coarsening drives time crystallization in active solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When metals are magnetized, emulsions phase separate, or galaxies cluster, domain walls and patterns form and irremediably coarsen over time. Such coarsening is universally driven by diffusive relaxation toward equilibrium. Here, we discover an inertial counterpart - wave coarsening - in active elastic media, where vibrations emerge and spontaneously grow in wavelength, period, and amplitude, before a globally synchronized state called a time crystal forms. We observe wave coarsening in one- and two-dimensional solids and capture its dynamical scaling. We further arrest the process by breaking momentum conservation and reveal a far-from-equilibrium nonlinear analogue to chiral topological edge modes. Our work unveils the crucial role of symmetries in the formation of time crystals and opens avenues for the control of nonlinear vibrations in active materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate relaxation dynamics along the entire first-order phase transition line by analyzing the time evolution of the free energy landscape in the three-dimensional kinetic Ising model. Near the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$, the free energy structure is consistent with predictions from Landau-Ginzburg theory. At temperatures far below $T_{\rm c}$, however, fine structures in pre-equilibrium configurations trap random initial states, causing a pronounced delay in equilibration - an effect we identify as ultra-slow relaxation. This phenomenon is characterized by a self-divergence of the relative variance of equilibration times, which we propose as a previously unrecognized hallmark of first-order phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The focus is on understanding the quantum thermodynamics of strongly coupled non-Markovian quantum systems. To this end, a non-trivial, non-Markovian model of a central spin surrounded by a spin bath is taken up, and its exact evolution is derived for arbitrary system-bath couplings. The fundamental quantum thermodynamic quantities, such as system and bath internal energies, work, heat, entropy production, and ergotropy, are calculated using the dynamics and original system (bath) Hamiltonian. An explicit expression for the work, a mismatch between the system and bath internal energies, is derived. The thermodynamic entropy of the system at thermal equilibrium is studied using the Hamiltonian of mean force in the strong coupling regime. The role of a canonical Hamiltonian in calculating the above thermodynamic quantities, a recently developed technique, is also investigated. Further, an interesting observation relevant to the spin bath acting as a charger is made in a scenario where the central spin is envisaged as a quantum battery.</description>

      <title>Quantum Zeno Effect in Noisy Integrable Quantum Circuits for Impurity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the open quantum system dynamics (in the Trotterized limit) of integrable quantum circuits in the presence of onsite dephasing noise with a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity interacting at the edge. Using a combination of Bethe Ansatz (BA) and exact diagonalization (ED), we study the dynamics of both the bulk and the impurity for the XXX (Heisenberg) and the XX qubit chains in the presence and absence of bulk noise. In the absence of noise, we show that the impurity exhibits two distinct phases, the bound mode phase where the impurity keeps oscillating in time, and the Kondo phase where it decays with Kondo time $t_K$. Turning on the bulk dephasing noise, we find for the two models that in the long time limit in both regimes the quantum Zeno effect takes place where the dynamics of the impurity magnetization slows down as the noise strength $\gamma$ increases. The impurity magnetization in the bound mode regime shows the opposite effect, decaying faster as the noise strength increases for short times ($t \ll 1/\gamma$). We show that the bulk KPZ dynamics of the XXX model is converted to diffusive dynamics as in the XX case studied before by V. Alba, driving both systems to the Zeno effect for the impurity in the long time limit.</description>

      <title>Universal non-Hermitian transport in disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In disordered Hermitian systems, localization of energy eigenstates prohibits wave propagation. In non-Hermitian systems, however, wave propagation is possible even when the eigenstates of Hamiltonian are exponentially localized by disorders. We find in this regime that non-Hermitian wave propagation exhibits novel universal scaling behaviors without Hermitian counterpart. Furthermore, our theory demonstrates how the tail of imaginary-part density of states dictates wave propagation in the long-time limit. Specifically, for the three typical classes, namely the Gaussian, the uniform, and the linear imaginary-part density of states, we obtain logarithmically suppressed sub-ballistic transport, and two types of subdiffusion with exponents that depend only on spatial dimensions, respectively. Our work highlights the fundamental differences between Hermitian and non-Hermitian Anderson localization, and uncovers unique universality in non-Hermitian wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Breaking coexistence: Zealotry vs. nonlinear social impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how zealotry and nonlinear social impact affect consensus formation in the nonlinear voter model, evolutionary games, and the partisan voter model. In all three models, consensus is an absorbing state in finite populations, while coexistence is a possible outcome of the deterministic dynamics. We show that sufficiently strong zealotry, i.e. the presence of agents who never change state, can drive infinite populations to consensus in all three models. However, while evolutionary games and the partisan voter model permit zealotry-induced consensus for all values of their model parameters, the nonlinear voter model does not. Central to this difference is the shape of the social impact function, which quantifies how the influence of a group scales with size, and is therefore a measure of majority and minority effects. We derive general conditions relating the slope of this function at small group sizes to the local stability of consensus. Sublinear impact favours minorities and can override zealotry to prevent consensus, whereas superlinear impact promotes majorities and therefore facilitates consensus. We extend the analysis to finite populations, exploring the time-to-consensus, and the shape of quasi-stationary distributions.</description>

      <title>Quantum i.i.d. Steady States in Open Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how a quantum many-body state is maintained stably as a nonequilibrium steady state is of fundamental and practical importance for exploration and exploitation of open quantum systems. We establish a general equivalent condition for an open quantum many-body system governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics under local drive and/or dissipation to have a quantum independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) steady state. We present a sufficient condition for a system to have a quantum i.i.d. steady state by identifying a set of operators that commute with arbitrary quantum i.i.d. states. In particular, a set of quantum i.i.d. states is found to be an invariant subset of time evolution superoperators for systems that satisfy the sufficient condition. These findings not only identify a class of models with exactly solvable steady states but also lead to a no-go theorem that precludes quantum entanglement and spatial correlations in a broad class of quantum many-body steady states in a dissipative environment.</description>

      <title>Competing color superconductivity and color Kondo effect in quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Long-Range Order in a Lattice Fermion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a lattice fermion model with antiferromagnetic interactions on the three-dimensional cubic lattice. The hopping term of the Hamiltonian has a Weyl-type dispersion. We prove that the model has reflection positivity. Moreover, by relying on the property, we prove the existence of the antiferromagnetic long-range order at low temperatures in a strong coupling regime.</description>
