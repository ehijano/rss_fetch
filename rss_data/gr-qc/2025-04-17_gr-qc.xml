      <title>Vaidya-Reissner-Nordstr\"om Extension On the White-hole Region and the White Hole Evaporation Dynamic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an analytic model that extends classical white hole geometry by incorporating both radiative dynamics and electric charge. Starting from a maximal analytic extension of the Schwarzschild white hole via Kruskal Szekeres coordinates, we introduce a time dependent mass function, representative of outgoing null dust to model evaporation. Building on this foundation, the study then integrates the Reissner-Nordstr\"om framework to obtain a dynamic, charged white hole solution in double null coordinates. In the resulting Vaidya Reissner Nordstr\"om metric, both the Bondi mass and the associated charge decrease monotonically with retarded time, capturing the interplay of radiation and electromagnetic effects. Detailed analysis of horizon behavior reveals how mass loss and charge shedding modify the causal structure, ensuring that energy conditions are preserved and cosmic censorship is maintained.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of non-singular matter bouncing cosmology in NANOGrav and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-singular matter bouncing cosmological setups are of particular interest since apart from adressing the initial singularity problem they can give rise as well to a nearly scale-invariant curvature power spectrum on scales $k&lt;10^{4}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, favored by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments. Interestingly enough, one can find that within such non-singular bouncing cosmological setups, curvature perturbations grow on super-horizon scales during the matter contracting phase. In this work, we account for the evolution of cosmological perturbations during the transition to the Hot Big Bang expanding Universe, finding at the end naturally enhanced curvature perturbations on very small scales at horizon-crossing time during the expanding phase. These enhanced cosmological perturbations can induce gravitational waves (GWs) due to second order gravitational interactions and collapse as well to form primordial black holes (PBHs), with the latter acting as one of the most viable dark matter candidates. Remarkably, we find an induced GW background with a universal infrared (IR) frequency scaling of $f^2$, in excellent agreement with the recently released $\mathrm{nHz}$ GW data by the NANOGrav collaboration, being potentially detectable as well by other GW observatories such as LISA and ET, depending on the values of the bouncing cosmological parameters at hand.</description>

      <title>Gravitational entropy in black hole transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several reasons to support the idea that entropy might be associated to gravity itself. In the absence of a quantum theory of gravity, classical estimators for the gravitational entropy have been proposed. Any viable description of the gravitational entropy should reproduce the Hawking-Bekenstein entropy at the event horizon of black holes. Furthermore, in any black hole transformation, these estimators must satisfy the second law of black hole thermodynamics. In this work, we analyze whether two entropy estimators, one based on the Weyl tensor and the other on the Bel-Robinson tensor, satisfy the second law in the transformation process from a Schwarzschild to a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole by the absorption of a charge test particle. We also address the inverse process. We show that depending whether the process is reversible or not, both estimators fulfill the second law.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical causal geodesics: Minkowski spacetime case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use an integral quantization model based on the Heisenberg-Weyl group to describe the motion of a spinless particle in the Minkowski background spacetime. This work is a sequel to a previous paper, devoted to mathematical aspects of our model: construction of the space of coherent states and properties of elementary observables. We compute transition amplitudes corresponding to a free motion of a particle between two coherent states. These amplitudes are then used to model quantum random walks of free relativistic particles. Our quantization scheme allows us to recover interference patterns occurring in a standard double-slit experiment, known from the classical approach. This result is obtained by modeling the slits in terms of eigenstates of the position operator and computing transition amplitudes between position and coherent states. We design our model in a way which allows for a future generalization to a semi-classical quantization of the geodesic motion in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Deflection of Light due to Kerr Sen Black Hole in Heterotic String Theory using Material Medium Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deflection of light in the gravitational field of a massive body can be analyzed through diverse theoretical approaches. The null geodesic approach is commonly employed to calculate light deflection within strong and weak field limits. Alternatively, several studies have explored the gravitational deflection of light using the material medium approach. For a static, non-rotating spherical mass, the deflection in a Schwarzschild field can be determined by expressing the metric in an isotropic form and evaluating the refractive index to trace the light ray's trajectory. In this study, we extend the above-mentioned approach to the Kerr-Sen black hole spacetime in heterotic string theory, a solution representing a rotating, charged solution in heterotic string theory. The frame-dragging effects inherent to the Kerr-Sen geometry are incorporated to compute the velocity of light rays, enabling the derivation of the refractive index in this field. Considering the far-field approximation, we calculate the deflection of light in the Kerr-Sen spacetime and compare our results with those obtained for the Kerr and Schwarzschild black hole solution in GR.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearly self-interacting extended bodies move as test bodies in effective external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In electromagnetism, linearized general relativity, and other contexts, previous work has shown that the laws of motion which govern compact, self-interacting bodies can be obtained by applying "Detweiler-Whiting prescriptions" to the laws of motion which govern test bodies. These prescriptions replace any field which appears in a test-body law of motion with a certain effective field which is a quasilocal functional of the physical variables -- a functional that can be interpreted as a regularization procedure in a point-particle limit. We generalize these results, presenting a formalism which allows Detweiler-Whiting prescriptions to be be directly derived for extended bodies, even in nonlinear field theories. If a generating functional with particular properties can be constructed, we find effective linear and angular momenta which evolve via Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations involving appropriate effective fields. These equations implicitly incorporate all self-force, self-torque, and extended-body effects. Although our main focus is on bodies coupled to nonlinear scalar fields, we also remark on the gravitational case.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Unimodular Quantum Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantization of unimodular gravity in minisuperspace leads to a time evolution of states generated by the Hamiltonian, as in usual quantum mechanics. We revisit the analysis made in Ref. \cite{unruh}, extending it to phantom scalar fields. It is argued that only in this case a non-trivial evolution for the scalar field can be obtained. The behavior of the scale factor presents a bounce followed by a de Sitter expansion, reproducing the quantum cosmological scenario in General Relativity when the source is given by a cosmological term described by the Schutz variable. The analysis is extended to the Brans-Dicke scalar tensor theory.</description>

      <title>The Conserved Effective Stress Tensor of Gravitational Wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the effective stress tensor of gravitational wave (GW) as the source for the background Einstein equation and examine three candidates in literature. The second order perturbed Einstein tensor $G^{(2)}_{\mu\nu}$, up to a coefficient, proposed by Brill, Hartle, and Isaacson, has long been known to be covariantly nonconserved with respect to the background spacetime. We observe that $G^{(2)}_{\mu\nu}$ is not a true tensor on the background spacetime. More importantly, we find that, by expressing $G^{(2)}_{\mu\nu}$ in terms of the perturbed Hilbert-Einstein actions,
  the nonconserved part of $G^{(2)}_{\mu\nu}$ is actually canceled out by the perturbed fluid stress tensors in the back-reaction equation, or is vanishing in absence of fluid. The remaining part of $G^{(2)}_{\mu\nu}$ is just the conserved effective stress tensor $\tau_{\mu\nu}$ proposed by Ford and Parker. As the main result, we derive $\tau_{\mu\nu}$ for a general curved spacetime by varying the GW action and show its conservation using the equation of GW. The stress tensor $T_{\text{MT}}^{\mu\nu}$ proposed by MacCallum and Taub was based on an action $J_2$. We derive $T_{\text{MT}}^{\mu\nu}$ and find that it is nonconserved, and that $J_2$ does not give the correct GW equation in presence of matter. The difficulty with $J_2$ is due to a background Ricci tensor term, which should be also canceled out by the fluid term or vanishing in absence of fluid. We also demonstrate these three candidates in a flat Robertson-Walker spacetime. The conserved $\tau_{\mu\nu}$ has a positive energy density spectrum, and is adequate for the back-reaction in a perturbation scheme, while the two nonconserved stress tensors have a negative spectrum at long wavelengths and are unphysical.</description>

      <title>Spinorial quasilocal mass for spacetimes with negative cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new notion of quasilocal mass is defined for generic, compact, two dimensional, spacelike surfaces in four dimensional spacetimes with negative cosmological constant. The definition is spinorial and based on work for vanishing cosmological constant by Penrose and Dougan &amp; Mason. Furthermore, this mass is non-negative, equal to the Misner-Sharp mass in spherical symmetry, equal to zero for every generic surface in AdS, has an appropriate form for gravity linearised about AdS and has an appropriate limit for large spheres in asymptotically AdS spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Quantum Master and Fokker-Planck Equation for Gravitational Systems and Gravitational Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum master equation describing the stochastic dynamics of a quantum massive system interacting with a quantum gravitational field is useful for the investigation of quantum gravitational and quantum informational issues such as the quantum nature of gravity, gravity-induced entanglement and gravitational decoherence. Studies of the decoherence of quantum systems by an electromagnetic field shows that a lower temperature environment is more conducive to successful quantum information processing experiments. Likewise, the quantum nature of (perturbative) gravity is far better revealed at lower temperatures than high, minimizing the corruptive effects of thermal noise. In this work, generalizing earlier results of the Markovian ABH master equation [1,2] which is valid only for high temperatures, we derive a non-Markovian quantum master equation for the reduced density matrix, and the associated Fokker-Planck equation for the Wigner distribution function, for the stochastic dynamics of two masses following quantum trajectories, interacting with a graviton field, including the effects of graviton noise, valid for all temperatures. We follow the influence functional approach exemplified in the derivation of the non-Markovian Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation [62,64] for quantum Brownian motion. We find that in the low temperature limit, the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix decrease in time logarithmically for the zero temperature part and quadratically in time for the temperature-dependent part, which is distinctly different from the Markovian case. We end with a summary of our findings and a discussion on how this problem studied here is related to the quantum stochastic equation derived in [77] for gravitational self force studies, and to quantum optomechanics where experimental observation of gravitational decoherence and entanglement may be implemented.</description>

      <title>Hawking evaporation and the fate of black holes in loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent covariant formulation, that includes non-perturbative effects from loop quantum gravity (LQG) as self-consistent effective models, has revealed the possibility of non-singular black hole solutions. The new framework makes it possible to couple scalar matter to such LQG black holes and derive Hawking radiation in the presence of quantum space-time effects while respecting general covariance. Standard methods to derive particle production both within the geometric optics approximation and the Parikh-Wilczek tunneling approach are therefore available and confirm the thermal nature of Hawking radiation. The covariant description of scale-dependent decreasing holonomy corrections maintains Hawking temperature as well as universality of the low-energy transmission coefficients, stating that the absorption rates are proportional to the horizon area at leading order. Quantum-geometry effects enter the thermal distribution only through sub-leading corrections in the greybody factors. Nevertheless, they do impact energy emission of the black hole and its final state in a crucial way regarding one of the main questions of black-hole evaporation: whether a black-to-white-hole transition, or a stable remnant, is preferred. For the first time, a first-principles derivation, based on a discussion of backreaction, finds evidence that points to the former outcome.</description>

      <title>Area spectrum and black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of horizon area quantization on black hole thermodynamics is investigated in this article. The coefficient appearing in the quantization of area is fixed by an appeal to the saturated form of the Landauer's principle. Then by considering transition between discrete states of the event horizon area which in turn is equivalent to transitions between discrete mass states of the black hole, the change in the mass can be obtained. The change in mass is then equated to the product of the Hawking temperature and change in entropy of the black hole between two consecutive discrete states applying the first law of black hole thermodynamics. This gives the corrected Hawking temperature. In particular, we apply this technique to the Schwarzschild black hole, the quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole, the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole which is a charged black hole, and the rotating Kerr black hole geometry, and obtain the corrected Hawking temperature in each of these cases. We then take a step forward by inserting this corrected Hawking temperature in the first law of black hole thermodynamics once again to calculate the entropy of the black hole in terms of the horizon area of the black hole. This leads to logarithmic and inverse corrections to the entropy of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Diverse regular spacetimes using a parametrised density profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the construction of diverse regular spacetimes (black holes and defects) in General Relativity (GR) using a generic parametrised density profile (the Dekel-Zhao profile), which includes, for specific parameter choices, various well-known examples usually studied in the context of dark matter halos. Our solutions, in the Schwarzschild gauge, include new regular black holes as well as non-singular solutions representing spacetime defects. For a sub-class of metrics, a TOV equation approach with a chosen equation of state works. The status of the energy conditions and the issue of geodesic completeness are explored in detail. We also provide possible Lagrangian density constructions for the matter energy-momentum tensors. Further, we study the shadow radius of the new regular black holes, and compare our findings with available observational results from the EHT collaboration. Finally, for the defect solution, we present a model for a stable star (a gravastar) by explicit use of the junction conditions and obtain relevant consequences highlighting its characteristic features.</description>

      <title>Observational properties of regular black holes in Asymptotic Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the observational properties of a spherically symmetric, static regular black hole within the framework of asymptotic safety (AS) as proposed by Bonanno et al. The metric resembles the Schwarzschild solution in the classical limit. The departure from Schwarzschild at small scales is controlled by a single free parameter related to the ultraviolet (UV) cutoff of the theory. We investigated null and time-like geodesics around the AS metric, including circular orbits, photon rings and lensing effects. In particular we focused on the optical properties of thin accretion disks in the equatorial plane of the object and compared them with those of accretion disks in the Schwarzschild metric. We found that the radiation flux, luminosity, and efficiency of the accretion disk increase with the value of the free parameter. Using a spacetime generic open-source relativistic ray-tracing code, we simulate the K$\alpha$ iron line profiles emitted by the disk and analyze their deviation from that of the Schwarzschild geometry.</description>

      <title>Barrow and Tsallis entropies after the DESI DR2 BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified cosmology based on Barrow entropy arises from the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, in which the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is replaced by the Barrow entropy of quantum-gravitational origin, characterized by the Barrow parameter $\Delta$. Interestingly, this framework exhibits similarities with cosmology based on Tsallis $\delta$-entropy, which, although rooted in a non-extensive generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, features the same power-law deformation of the holographic scaling present in the Barrow case. We use observational data from Supernova Type Ia (SNIa), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), and Baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), including the recently released DESI DR2 data, in order to extract constraints on such scenarios. As we show, the best-fit value for the Barrow exponent $\Delta$ is found to be negative, while the zero value, which corresponds to $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, is allowed only in the range of $2\sigma $ for three out of four datasets. Additionally, for the case of the SN$_{0}$+OHD+BAO dataset, for the current Hubble function we obtain a value of $H_0= 72.2_{-0.9}^{+0.9}$, which offers an alleviation for the $H_0$ tension. Finally, by applying information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayes evidence, we compare the fitting efficiency of the scenario at hand with $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, showing that the latter is slightly favoured.</description>

      <title>Sound waves from primordial black hole formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical investigation of primordial black hole (PBH) formation from super-horizon curvature perturbations and the subsequent generation and propagation of sound waves, which can serve as a new source of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds presented in a companion letter. Using the Misner-Sharp formalism with an excision technique, our simulations extend to significantly later times than previous work and indicate that the near-critical perturbations produce a distinct compression wave featuring both overdense and underdense shells, while significantly supercritical perturbations yield only an underdense shell. We also show that a softer equation of state suppresses the formation of compression waves. Furthermore, the comoving thickness of sound shells remains nearly constant during propagation and scales with the Hubble radius at horizon re-entry, thereby serving as a key link between the gravitational-wave peak frequency and PBH mass in the companion letter. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of PBH formation and suggest potential observational signatures of PBHs in the gravitational wave spectrum from associated sound waves.</description>

      <title>3D full-GR simulations of magnetorotational core-collapse supernovae on GPUs: A systematic study of rotation rates and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a series of fully three-dimensional, dynamical-spacetime general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) for a progenitor of zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS) mass $25\, M_\odot$. We simulate a total of 12 models for simulation times in the range $190-260\, \mathrm{ms}$ to systematically study the effect of rotation rates and magnetic fields on jet formation via the magnetorotational mechanism. We have performed simulations on OLCF's Frontier using the new GPU-accelerated dynamical-spacetime GRMHD code \theCode for magnetic fields $B_0 = (10^{11}, 10^{12})\, \mathrm{G}$ and rotation rates $\Omega_0 = (0.14, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5)\, \mathrm{rad/s}$. We always resolve the entire region containing the shock with a resolution of at least $1.48\, \mathrm{km}$. We find that models with $B_0=10^{11}\, \mathrm{G}$ fail to explode, while those with $B_0=10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$ show a wide range of jet morphologies and explosive outcomes depending on the rotation rate. Models with $B_0=10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$ and $\Omega_0=(1.0,1.5)\, \mathrm{rad/s}$ form jets that bend sideways, giving the ejecta a more spherical character, and possibly representing explosions that \textit{appear} neutrino-driven even though they are magnetorotationally-driven. Models with $B_0=10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$ and $\Omega_0\geq2.0\, \mathrm{rad/s}$ show ejecta velocities $\gtrsim15000\, \mathrm{km/s}$, making them suitable candidates for broad-lined type Ic supernova progenitors. This work represents the largest set of 3D general-relativistic GRMHD simulations studying magnetorotational supernovae in full GR and demonstrates the potential of systematic studies with GPU-accelerated 3D simulations of CCSNe.</description>

      <title>Gaussian states in quantum field theory: Exact representations of relative phase in superpositions of Gaussian states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian quantum mechanics is a powerful tool regularly used in quantum optics to model linear and quadratic Hamiltonians efficiently. Recent interest in qubit-CV hybrid models has revealed a simple, yet important gap in our knowledge, namely, how to fully manipulate superpositions of Gaussian states. In this paper, we show how to faithfully represent a quadratic Gaussian state in the Fock basis. Specifically, we evaluate the phase necessary to equate the unitary representation of a zero-mean Gaussian state with its Fock representation. This allows for the coherent manipulation of superpositions of Gaussian states, especially the evaluation of expectation values from these superposed states. We then use this method to model a simple quantum field theory communication protocol using quadratic detectors in a regime that has previously been impossible to solve. The result presented in this paper is expected to become increasingly relevant with hybrid-CV systems, especially in the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Entropy bounds from quantum thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within an inherently classical perspective, there is always an unavoidable energy cost associated with the information deletion and this common lore is at the heart of the Landauer's conjecture that does not impose, per se, any relevant limit on the information acquisition. Although such a mindset should generally apply to systems of any size, its quantum mechanical implications are particularly intriguing and, for this reason, we examine here a minimal physical structure where the system and the environment are described, respectively, by a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by an appropriate Hermitian interaction able to amplify the entropy of the initial state. Since at the onset of the dynamical evolution the system is originally in a pure state, its entropy variation is always positive semidefinite and the Landauer's conjecture should not impose any constraint. Nonetheless, provided the quantum amplification is effective, it turns out that the entropy variation of the system always undershoots the heat transferred to the environment. When the initial thermal state of the environment is characterized by a chemical potential, the entropy growth is bounded both by the particles and by the heat flowing to the environment. The limits deduced in the quantum thermodynamical framework are also scrutinized from a field theory standpoint where species of different spins are copiously produced (especially in a cosmological context) thanks to the rapid variation of the space-time curvature.</description>

      <title>Separate universe in multifield inflation: a phase-space approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we extend a study of the validity conditions of the separate-universe approach of cosmological perturbations to models of inflation with multiple fields. The separate-universe approach consists in describing the universe as a collection of homogeneous and isotropic patches, giving us an effective description of perturbation theory at large scales through phase-space reduction. This approximation is a necessary step in stochastic inflation, an effective theory of coarse-grained, super-Hubble, scalar fields fluctuations. One needs a stochastic inflation description in the context of primordial black hole productions since it needs enhancements of the curvature power spectrum. It easily achievable in multifield inflation models but necessarily comes with strong diffusive effects. We study and compare cosmological perturbation theory and the separate-universe approach in said non-linear sigma models as a typical framework of multifield inflation and employing the Hamiltonian formalism to keep track of the complete phase space (or the reduced isotropic phase space in the separate-universe approach). We find that the separate-universe approach adequately describes the cosmological perturbation theory provided the wavelength of the modes considered is greater that several lower bounds that depend on the cosmological horizon and the inverse of the effective Hamiltonian masses of the fields; the latter being fixed by the coupling potential and the field-space geometry. We also compare gauge-invariant variables and several gauge fixing procedures in both approaches. For instance, we showed that the uniform-expansion gauge is nicely described by the separate-universe picture, hence qualifying its use in stochastic inflation as commonly done.</description>

      <title>Assessing WGC Compatibility in ModMax Black Holes via Photon Spheres Analysis and WCCC Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It seems that the regime of Hawking radiation and evaporation ultimately drives charged black holes toward super-extremality of the charge parameter and the dominance of extremal conditions. This progression, in turn, lays the groundwork for satisfying the necessary conditions for the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC). Preliminary studies indicate that black holes such as the Reissner-Nordstr$\"o$m (RN) model, in their initial form, lack the capacity to sustain super-extremality of the charge parameter. If such conditions arise, these black holes transition into naked singularities-a scenario that is highly undesirable due to the loss of causality and the breakdown of space-time geometry. This raises whether the inability to sustain super-extremality is an inherent property of the model or a consequence of the approximations and precision limitations employed in its construction. To address this, we turned to the ModMax model, which represents an extension of the RN model. Our analysis revealed that the ModMax model not only accommodates super-extremality of the charge parameter but also, under certain conditions, emerges as a promising candidate for investigating the WGC. Furthermore, we independently observed how the inclusion of the de Sitter radius ($\ell$) in the AdS model and $f(R)$ gravitational corrections-both of which enhance and complicate the model-can have a direct impact on the range of super-extremal charge tolerance which, in turn, provides the realization of the conditions necessary for the WGC.</description>

      <title>Probing the cold nature of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A pressureless dark matter component fits well with several cosmological observations. However, there are indications that cold dark matter may encounter challenges in explaining observations at small scales, particularly at galactic scales. Observational data suggest that dark matter models incorporating a pressure component could provide solutions to these small-scale problems. In this work, we investigate the possibility that present-day dark matter may result from a decaying non-cold dark matter sector transitioning into the dark energy sector. As the sensitivity of astronomical surveys rapidly increases, we explore an interacting scenario between dark energy and non-cold dark matter, where dark energy has a constant equation of state ($w_{\rm de}$), and dark matter, being non-cold, also has a constant (non-zero) equation of state ($w_{\rm dm}$). Considering the phantom and quintessence nature of dark energy, characterized by its equation of state, we separately analyze interacting phantom and interacting quintessence scenarios. We constrain these scenarios using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements and their combination with external probes, such as DESI-BAO and PantheonPlus. From our analyses, we find that a very mild preference for non-cold dark matter cannot be excluded based on the employed datasets. Additionally, for some datasets, there is a pronounced preference for the presence of an interaction at more than 95\% confidence level (CL). Moreover, when the dark energy equation of state lies in the phantom regime, the $S_8$ tension can be alleviated. This study suggests that cosmological models incorporating a non-cold dark matter component should be considered as viable scenarios with novel phenomenological implications, as reflected in the present work.</description>

      <title>Can asteroid-mass PBHDM be compatible with catalyzed phase transition interpretation of PTA?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) can catalyze first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in their vicinity, potentially modifying the gravitational wave (GW) signals from PTs. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of this catalytic effect during supercooled PTs within the high PBH number density regime. Applying the analytical model with envelope approximation, we derive the general expressions of GW spectrum in the presence of PBHs. We find that at relatively small PBH number densities, the GW signals are amplified due to the large-size bubbles. While higher PBH number densities suppress GW signals, since the accelerated PT progresses too rapidly. We further extend our findings to the bulk flow model and to scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs) generated during PTs. By conducting data fitting with the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we find that the PBH catalytic effect significantly alters the estimation of PT parameters. Notably, our analysis of the bubble collision GWs reveals that, the asteroid-mass PBHs ($10^{-16} - 10^{-12} M_\odot$) as the whole dark matter is incompatible with the PT interpretation of pulsar timing array signals. However, incorporating SIGWs can reduce this incompatibility for PBHs in the mass range $10^{-14} - 10^{-12} M_\odot$.</description>

Abstract: The study of the gravitational wave signatures of neutron star oscillations may provide important information of their interior structure and Equation of State (EoS) at high densities. We present a novel technique based on physically informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve the eigenvalue problem associated with normal oscillation modes of neutron stars. The procedure is tested in a simplified scenario, with an analytical solution, that can be used to test the performance and the accuracy of the method. We show that it is possible to get accurate results of both the eigenfrequencies and the eigenfunctions with this scheme. The flexibility of the method and its capability of adapting to complex scenarios may serve in the future as a path to include more physics into these systems.</description>

      <title>Suppression of composition g-modes in chemically-equilibrating warm neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of chemical equilibration and the resulting bulk viscosity on non-radial oscillation modes of warm neutron stars at temperatures up to T~5 MeV, relevant for protoneutron stars and neutron-star post-merger remnants. In this regime, the relaxation rate of weak interactions becomes comparable to the characteristic frequencies of composition g-modes in the core, resulting in resonant damping. To capture this effect, we introduce the dynamic sound speed, a complex, frequency-dependent generalization of the adiabatic sound speed that encodes both the restoring force and the dissipative effects of bulk compression. Using realistic weak reaction rates and three representative equations of state, we compute the complex frequencies of composition g-modes with finite-temperature profiles. We find that bulk viscous damping becomes increasingly significant with temperature and can completely suppress composition g-modes. In contrast, the f-mode remains largely unaffected by bulk viscosity due to its nearly divergence-free character. Our results highlight the sensitivity of g-mode behavior to thermal structure, weak reaction rates, and the equation of state, and establish the dynamic sound speed as a valuable descriptor characterizing oscillation properties in dissipative neutron star matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study classical wormhole solutions in 3D gravity with end-of-the-world (EOW) branes, conical defects, kinks, and punctures. These solutions compute statistical averages of an ensemble of boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) related to universal asymptotics of OPE data extracted from 2D conformal bootstrap. Conical defects connect BCFT bulk operators; branes join BCFT boundary intervals with identical boundary conditions; kinks (1D defects along branes) link BCFT boundary operators; and punctures (0D defects) are endpoints where conical defects terminate on branes. We provide evidence for a correspondence between the gravity theory and the ensemble. In particular, the agreement of $g$-function dependence results from an underlying topological aspect of the on-shell EOW brane action, from which a BCFT analogue of the Schlenker-Witten theorem also follows.</description>

Abstract: We study the gravitational phase space associated to a stretched horizon within a finite-sized causal diamond in $(d+2)$-dimensional spacetimes. By imposing the Raychaudhuri equation, we obtain its constrained symplectic form using the covariant phase space formalism and derive the relevant quantum commutators by inverting the symplectic form and quantizing. Finally, we compute the area fluctuations of the causal diamond by taking a Carrollian limit of the stretched horizon in pure Minkowski spacetime, and derive the relationship $\langle (\Delta A)^2 \rangle \geq \frac{2\pi G}{d}\langle A \rangle$, showing that the variance of the area fluctuations is proportional to the area itself.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in Lorentzian quantum cosmology: No-boundary saddles and resummation of quantum gravity corrections around tunneling saddle points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the path-integral approach to the wave function of the Universe by utilizing Lefschetz thimble analyses and resurgence theory. The traditional Euclidean path-integral of gravity has the notorious ambiguity of the direction of Wick rotation. In contrast, the Lorentzian method can be formulated concretely with the Picard-Lefschetz theory. Yet, a challenge remains: the physical parameter space lies on a Stokes line, meaning that the Lefschetz-thimble structure is still unclear. Through complex deformations, we resolve this issue by uniquely identifying the thimble structure. This leads to the tunneling wave function, as opposed to the no-boundary wave function, offering a more rigorous proof of the previous results. Further exploring the parameter space, we discover rich structures: the ambiguity of the Borel resummation of perturbative series around the tunneling saddle points is exactly canceled by the ambiguity of the contributions from no-boundary saddle points. This indicates that resurgence also works in quantum cosmology, particularly in the minisuperspace model.</description>

Abstract: Most approaches towards a quantum theory of gravitation indicate the existence of a minimal length scale of the order of the Planck length. Quantum mechanical models incorporating such an intrinsic length scale call for a deformation of Heisenberg's algebra resulting in a generalized uncertainty principle and constitute what is called gravitational quantum mechanics. Utilizing the position representation of this deformed algebra, we study various models of gravitational quantum mechanics. The free time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet is investigated as well as the spectral properties of a particle bound by an external attractive potential. Here the cases of a box with infinite walls and an attractive potential well of finite depth are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit and extend the study of null geodesics around a slowly rotating black hole in Chern-Simons modified gravity. We employ the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism to derive the equations for the shadow profile and determine its shape. We compare our results with numerical ray tracing, finding good agreement within the validity of our approximations for slow rotation and small Chern-Simons coupling. We forecast constraints on the model parameters using the uncertainty in EHT data for the observed shadow of SgrA* as a reference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01402v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations of the Schwarzschild metric in the context of noncommutative gravity. $r-\varphi$ and $r-t$ noncommutativity are introduced through a Moyal twist of the Hopf algebra of diffeomorphisms. Differential geometric structures such as curvature tensors are also twisted. Noncommutative equations of motion are derived from the recently proposed NC vacuum Einstein equation. Here, in addition to previously calculated axial NC potential, we present the polar solution which generalizes the work done by Zerilli. Quasinormal mode frequencies of the two potentials are calculated using three methods: WKB, P\"oschl-Teller and Rosen-Morse. Notably, we apply the WKB method up to the 13th order and determine the optimal order for each noncommutative parameter value individually. Additionally, we provide comprehensive error estimations for the higher-order WKB calculations, offering insights into the accuracy of our results. By comparing the spectra, we conclude that the classical isospectrality of axial and polar modes is broken upon spacetime quantization. Isospectrality is restored in the eikonal limit.</description>

      <title>n-dimensional Weyl conformal tensor in a 4-index gravitational field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Weyl conformal tensor is the traceless component of the Riemann tensor and therefore, as is known, the information it contains does not appear explicitly in Einstein's equation. Following a rigorous mathematical treatment based on the variational principle, we will suggest that there exists a four-index gravitational field equation linearly containing the Weyl tensor closely related to a tidal gravitational field tensor whose components will be calculated. The new degrees of freedom, introduced via the n-dimensional Weyl tensor, will therefore clearly appear as additional constraints on the metric and we will demonstrate, among other things, that the cosmological constant appears as a natural solution of the four-index theory in the form of an integration constant which therefore does not need to be introduced ad hoc into a Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Modified $f(R,T)$ theory in light of gravitational wave standard sirens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we ponder observational constraints
  on the modified $f(R,T)$ gravity, where the gravitational action is
  a function of Ricci scalar $R$ plus the trace of the energy-momentum
  tensor $T$, regarding the functional form
  $f(R,T)=R+2f(T)$ with $f(T)=8\pi G\lambda T$.
  For this purpose, we utilize recently available data,
  including cosmic microwave background, weak lensing, supernovae,
  baryon acoustic oscillations, and redshift-space distortions
  measurements, together with forcasted gravitational wave
  (GW) data from Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).
  Notably, we examine the potentiality of simulated GW data
  from LISA standard sirens (SS) sources to enhance
  cosmological constraints on the $f(R,T)$ model parameters.
  In this regard, we create three LISA mock catalogs,
  namely Pop III, Delay, and No Delay, to improve the
  obtained constraints on cosmological parameters of $f(R,T)$
  gravity from current observations. Numerical analysis
  reveals that mock GW data from LISA SS sources
  make marginal improvements on constraining the $f(R,T)$
  model cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Frame-dragging effects in a gravitational quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analogous to magnetism in electrodynamics, it is gravitomagnetism in relativistic gravity. Since gravity determines locally inertial frames, in general relativity (GR) and other relativistic theories of gravity, frame-dragging with source motion plays a key role in gravitomagnetism. Recently, Wu has put forward a gauge theory of gravity, called the gravitational quantum field theory (GQFT), with the gravitational force and the spin gauge force described by the gauge fields. Gao {\it et al.} ({\it Phy. Rev. D 109, 064072}) have derived the Shapiro time delay in the GQFT and given an empirical constraint from the Cassini experimental result on the dimensionless GQFT parameter $\gamma_W$ to be $(2.1\pm 2.3)\times 10^{-5}$. In this work, we derive the frame-dragging Lense-Thirring effects in the GQFT. The current precision of LARES-LAGEOS Lense-Thirring measurement gives a constraint on $|\gamma_W|$ to be less than $2\times 10^{-2}$. This constraint is consistent with, but subdominant to, the Cassini experimental constraint. As a candidate of quantum gravity, we do not expect that the deviation from the GR value ($\gamma_W=0$) is large, classically. With the launch of LARES 2, the precision of the Lense-Thirring measurement is expected to increase by one order of magnitude in a couple of years. As to the Shapiro effect, current technologies have the capability to measure the $\gamma_W$ parameter to a precision of $10^{-9}$.</description>

      <title>(2+1) Lorentzian quantum cosmology from spin-foams: opportunities and obstacles for semi-classicality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an effective cosmological spin-foam model for a (2+1) dimensional spatially flat universe, discretized on a hypercubical lattice, containing both space- and time-like regions. Our starting point is the recently proposed coherent state spin-foam model for (2+1) Lorentzian quantum gravity. The full amplitude is assumed to factorize into single vertex amplitudes with boundary data corresponding to Lorentzian 3-frusta. A stationary phase approximation is performed at each vertex individually, where the inverse square root of the Hessian determinant serves as a measure for the effective path integral. Additionally, a massive scalar field is coupled to the geometry, and we show that its mass renders the partition function convergent. For a single 3-frustum with time-like struts, we compute the expectation value of the bulk strut length and show that it generically agrees with the classical solutions and that it is a discontinuous function of the scalar field mass. Allowing the struts to be space-like introduces causality violations, which drive the expectation values away from the classical solutions due to the lack of an exponential suppression of these configurations. This is a direct consequence of the semi-classical amplitude only containing the real part of deficit angles, in contrast with the Lorentzian Regge action used in effective spin-foams. We give an outlook on how to evaluate the partition function on an extended discretization including a bulk spatial slice. This serves as a foundation for future investigations of physically interesting scenarios such as a quantum bounce or the viability of massive scalar field clocks. Our results demonstrate that the effective path integral in the causally regular sector serves as a viable quantum cosmology model, but that the agreement of expectation values with classical solutions is tightly bound to the path integral measure.</description>

      <title>Singularity resolution in spherically reduced 2D semiclassical gravity with negative central charge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the semiclassical Schwarzschild geometry in the Boulware quantum state in the framework of two-dimensional (2D) dilaton gravity. The classical model is defined by the spherical reduction of Einstein's gravity sourced with conformal scalar fields. The expectation value of the stress-energy tensor in the Boulware state is singular at the classical horizon of the Schwarzschild spacetime, but when backreaction effects are considered, previous results have shown that the 2D geometry is horizonless and described by a non-symmetric wormhole with a curvature singularity on the other side of the throat. In this work we show that reversing the sign of the central charge of the conformal matter removes the curvature singularity of the 2D backreacted geometry, which happens to be horizonless and asymptotically flat. This result is consistent with a similar analysis recently performed for the CGHS model. We also argue the physical significance of negative central charges in conformal anomalies from a four-dimensional perspective.</description>

      <title>Dark Universe inspired by the Kaluza-Klein gravity and impact on Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential implications of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravity in unifying the dark sector of the Universe. Through dimensional reduction in KK gravity, the 5D spacetime framework can be reformulated in terms of a 4D spacetime metric, along with additional scalar and vector fields. From the 4D perspective, this suggests the existence of a tower of particle states, including KK gravitons with spin-0 and spin-1 states, in addition to the massless spin-2 gravitons of general relativity (GR). The key idea in the present paper is the analogy with superconductivity theory. By assuming a minimal coupling between an additional complex scalar field and the gauge field, a "mass" term emerges for the spin-1 gravitons. This, in turn, leads to long-range gravitational effects that could modify Newton's law of gravity through Yukawa-type corrections. Assuming an environment-dependent mass for the spin-1 graviton, near the galactic center the repulsive force from this spin-1 graviton is suppressed by an additional attractive component from Newton's constant corrections, resulting in a Newtonian-like, attraction-dominated effect. In the galaxy's outer regions, the repulsive force fades due to its short range, making dark matter appear only as an effective outcome of the dominant attractive corrections. This approach also explains dark matter's emergence as an apparent effects on cosmological scales while our model is equivalent to the scalar-vector-tensor gravity theory. Finally, we examine the impact of dark matter on the primordial gravitational wave (PGW) spectrum and show that it is sensitive to dark matter effects, providing an opportunity to test this theory through future GW observatories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In scalar-tensor theories beyond Horndeski, the Vainshtein screening mechanism is only partially effective inside astrophysical bodies. We investigate the potential to detect this partial breaking of Vainshtein screening through the tidal response of fluid bodies. We calculate the gravitomagnetic tidal Love numbers in a specific model of degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor gravity and analyze how deviations from general relativity depend on parameters governing the breaking of Vainshtein screening in the weak-gravity regime. For fixed parameter values, the relative deviations increase with higher multipoles and larger compactness. However, we demonstrate that these parameters alone are insufficient to fully characterize the tidal response of relativistic bodies in scalar-tensor theories beyond Horndeski.</description>

      <title>The effects of asymptotically flat $R^2$ spacetime on black hole image of Sagittarius A*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new class of analytically expressible vacuum solutions has recently been discovered for pure ${R}^2$ gravity, building upon Buchdahl's seminal work from 1962. These solutions, inspired by Buchdahl's framework, offer a promising avenue for testing ${R}^2$ gravity against astrophysical observations. Within a subset of asymptotically flat Buchdahl-inspired vacuum spacetimes, we introduce a free parameter $\epsilon$ to characterize deviations from the Schwarzschild metric, which is recovered in the limit $\epsilon = 0$. In this study, we employ the publicly available code \textit{ipole} to simulate black hole images under the Buchdahl-inspired metric, with a focus on the black hole at the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Our simulations show that both the shadow size and photon ring diameter decrease monotonically with increasing $\epsilon$. By exploring a range of observational inclination angles, we find that the photon ring diameter being a direct observable is only weakly sensitive to the inclination angle. We further constrain the parameter $\epsilon$ by comparing our simulation results with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A*. The obtained bounds are consistent with those previously derived from the orbital motion of the S2 star, but provide tighter constraints. In addition, we analyze the influence of the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime on the polarization patterns near the black hole and find its impact to be minimal. In contrast, the observational inclination angle has a substantial effect on the observed polarization structure, highlighting the dominant role of viewing geometry in shaping polarization features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.03859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove integrated energy and pointwise decay estimates for solutions of the vacuum linearized Einstein equation on the domain of outer communication of the Kerr black hole spacetime. The estimates are valid for the full subextreme range of Kerr black holes, provided integrated energy estimates for the Teukolsky equation hold. For slowly rotating Kerr backgrounds, such estimates are known to hold, due to the work of one of the authors. The results in this paper thus provide the first stability results for linearized gravity on the Kerr background, in the slowly rotating case, and reduce the linearized stability problem for the full subextreme range to proving integrated energy estimates for the Teukolsky equation. This constitutes an essential step towards a proof of the black hole stability conjecture, i.e. the statement that the Kerr family is dynamically stable, one of the central open problems in general relativity.</description>

      <title>General relativistic magnetized Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion with a spin-field misalignment: Jet nutation, polarity reversals, and Magnus drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of a black hole traveling through a plasma--a general relativistic extension of the classic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion problem--can be related to a variety of astrophysical contexts, including the aftermath of binary black hole mergers in gaseous environments. We perform three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of BHL accretion onto a spinning black hole when magnetic field of the incoming wind is inclined to the spin axis of the black hole. Irrespective of inclination but dependent on the wind speed, we find that the accretion flow onto the black hole can become magnetically arrested, launching an intermittent jet whose formation is assisted by a turbulent dynamo-like process in the inner disk. The upstream ram pressure of the wind bends the jet, and confines the angular extent into which the magnetic flux tubes ejected from quasiperiodic eruptions are released. Recoil from magnetic flux eruptions drives strong oscillations in the inner accretion disk, resulting in jet nutation at the outer radii and occasionally ripping off the inner part of the accretion disk. When the incoming magnetic field is perpendicular to the spin axis of the black hole, we find that the magnetic polarity of the jets can undergo a stochastic reversal. In addition to dynamical friction, the black hole experiences a perpendicular drag force analogous to the Magnus effect. Qualitative effects of the incoming magnetic field orientation, the strength of the magnetization, and the incoming wind speed are investigated as well.</description>

Abstract: Field theories exhibit dramatic changes in the structure of their operator algebras in the limit where the number of local degrees of freedom ($N$) becomes infinite. An important example of this is that the algebras associated to local subregions may not be additively generated in the limit. We investigate examples and explore the consequences of this ``superadditivity'' phenomenon in large $N$ field theories and holographic systems. In holographic examples we find cases in which superadditive algebras can probe the black hole interior, while the additive algebra cannot. We also discuss how superaddivity explains the sucess of quantum error correction models of holography. Finally we demonstrate how superadditivity is intimately related to the ability of holographic field theories to perform quantum tasks that would naievely be impossible. We argue that the connected wedge theorems (CWTs) of May, Penington, Sorce, and Yoshida, which characterize holographic protocols for quantum tasks, can be re-phrased in terms of superadditive algebras and use this re-phrasing to conjecture a generalization of the CWTs that is an equivalence statement.</description>

      <title>Discriminating between different modified dispersion relations from gamma-ray observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16048</link>

Abstract: The fact that the standard dispersion relation for photons in vacuum could be modified because of their interaction with the quantum nature of spacetime has been proposed more than two decades ago. A quantitative model [Jacob \&amp; Piran, JCAP 01, 031 (2008)], has been tested extensively using distant highly energetic astrophysical sources, searching for energy-dependent time delays in photon arrival times. Since no delay was firmly measured, lower limits were set on the energy scale $\Lambda$ related to these effects. In recent years, however, different but equally well-grounded expressions beyond the Jacob \&amp; Piran model were obtained for the photon dispersion relation, leading to different expressions for the dependence of lag versus redshift. This article introduces a general parameterization of modified dispersion relations in cosmological symmetry, which directly leads to a general parameterized lag versus redshift dependence encompassing both existing and new models. This parameterization could be used in the future to compare the predicted time lags of the different models and test them against observations. To investigate this possibility, realistic data sets are simulated, mimicking different types of extragalactic sources as detected by current and future instruments. When no lag is injected in the simulated data, each lag-redshift model leads, as expected, to a different value for the limit on $\Lambda$, and the Jacob \&amp; Piran model gives the most stringent bound. When a lag at $\Lambda \sim E_P$ in the Jacob \&amp; Piran model is injected, it is detected for all the other lag-redshift relations considered, although leading to different values. Finally, the possibility to discriminate between several lag-redshift models is investigated, emphasizing the importance of an evenly distributed sample of sources across a wide range of redshifts.</description>

      <title>Implications for the non-Gaussianity of primordial gravitational waves from pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of a stochastic signal by recent pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations, including NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA+InPTA, CPTA and MPTA, has opened a new window to explore gravitational waves (GWs) at nanohertz frequencies. Motivated by the possibility that such a signal could arise from primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), we investigate the implications of tensor non-Gaussianity for the PGW power spectrum. Utilizing PTA data sets, we provide constraints on local-type tensor non-Gaussianity parameter ${F}_{\mathrm{NL}}$. We find $|{F}_{\mathrm{NL}}|\lesssim 7.97$ for a log-normal PGW power spectrum. Our analysis reveals that even moderate tensor non-Gaussianity can lead to significant deviations from standard predictions, thereby offering a novel means to test inflationary scenarios and probe the underlying dynamics of the early Universe. Future multi-band GW observatories, such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, will be instrumental in complementing these efforts and further refining our understanding of tensor non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly probe gravity for Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$. Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have been performed only with sky-projected relative velocities $v_p$ in the pairs. A new method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial (line-of-sight) component $v_r$ is developed to measure a gravitational anomaly parameter $\Gamma\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma_g}\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}}$ where $G_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective gravitational constant for pseudo-Newtonian elliptical orbits, while $G_{\rm{N}}$ is Newton's constant. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$ with $v_r$ uncertainties in the range $168&lt;\sigma_{v_r}&lt;380$ m s$^{-1}$ selected from the Gaia DR3 database. The following results are obtained: $\Gamma = 0.000\pm 0.011$ ($N_{\rm{binary}}=125$) for a high acceleration regime ($10^{-7.9} \lesssim g_{\rm{N}} \lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$) agreeing well with Newton, but $\Gamma = 0.085\pm 0.040$ or $\gamma_g=1.48_{-0.23}^{+0.33}$ (35) for a MOND regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) and $\Gamma = 0.063\pm 0.015$ or $\gamma_g=1.34_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$ (111) for a MOND+transition regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-8.5}$ m s$^{-2}$). These results show that gravitational anomaly is evident for $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma$ in the MOND regime ($\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) agrees with the prediction ($\approx 0.07$) of MOND gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Equation of State from Neutron Star Observables via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have conducted an extensive study using a diverse set of equations of state (EoSs) to uncover strong relationships between neutron star (NS) observables and the underlying EoS parameters using symbolic regression method. These EoS models, derived from a mix of agnostic and physics-based approaches, considered neutron stars composed of nucleons, hyperons, and other exotic degrees of freedom in beta equilibrium. The maximum mass of a NS is found to be strongly correlated with the pressure and baryon density at an energy density of approximately 800 MeV.fm$^{-3}$. We have also demonstrated that the EoS can be expressed as a function of radius and tidal deformability within the NS mass range 1-2$M_\odot$. These insights offer a promising and efficient framework to decode the dense matter EoS directly from the accurate knowledge of NS observables.</description>

      <title>The stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic superstrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic gravitational wave background sourced by a network of cosmic superstrings and demonstrate that incorporating higher-mass string species, beyond the fundamental string, is crucial for accurately modelling the resulting gravitational wave spectrum across frequencies ranging from nanohertz to kilohertz. Using the multi-tension velocity-dependent one-scale model to evolve the cosmic superstring network, we perform several fits to the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension, string coupling and effective size of compact extra dimensions. We find that the cosmic superstring best-fits are comparable in likelihood to Supermassive Black Hole models, thought by many to be the leading candidate explanation of the signal. The implications of the best-fit spectra are discussed within the context of future gravitational wave experiments. We obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension of $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-11.4^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$($-11.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$) for gravitational waves originating from large cuspy (kinky) cosmic superstring loops and $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-9.7^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$($-9.9^{+1.0}_{-0.5}$) for small cuspy (kinky) loops. We also place $2\sigma$ upper bounds on the string coupling, finding $g_s&lt;0.7$ in all cases, and comment on the implication of our results for the effective size of the compact extra dimensions.</description>

      <title>A new approach for simulating PBH formation from generic curvature fluctuations with the Misner-Sharp formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe due to the collapse of super-horizon curvature fluctuations. Simulations of PBH formation have been essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to black hole formation and for studying their properties and impact on our Universe. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used as a standard approach for these simulations. Recently, type-II fluctuations, characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius, have gained interest. In the standard Misner-Sharp approach for simulating PBH formation with these fluctuations, the evolution equations exhibit divergent terms ($0/0$), which complicate and prevent the simulations. We formulate a new approach to overcome this issue in a simple manner by using the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an auxiliary variable, allowing simulations of type-II fluctuations within the Misner-Sharp formalism. Using a set of standard exponential-shaped curvature profiles, we apply our new approach and numerical code based on pseudospectral methods to study the time evolution of the gravitational collapse, threshold values of type A/B PBHs and PBH mass. Interestingly, we identify cases of type-II fluctuations that do not necessarily result in PBH formation.</description>

      <title>The threshold for PBH formation in the type-II region and its analytical estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically simulate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) in a radiation-dominated Universe under the assumption of spherical symmetry, driven by the collapse of adiabatic fluctuations, for different curvature profiles $\zeta$. Our results show that the threshold for PBH formation, defined as the peak value of the critical compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ (where $r_m$ is the scale at which the peak occurs), does not asymptotically saturate to its maximum possible value in the type-I region for sufficiently sharp profiles. Instead, the threshold is found in the type-II region with $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ being a minimum. We find, for the cases tested, that this is a general trend associated with profiles that exhibit extremely large curvatures in the linear component of the compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{l}(r) \equiv -4r \zeta'(r)/3$ shape around its peak $r_m$ (spiky shapes). To measure this curvature at $r_m$, we define a dimensionless parameter: $\kappa \equiv -r^{2}_m \mathcal{C}_l''(r_m)$, and we find that the thresholds observed in the type-II region occur for $\kappa \gtrsim 30$ for the profiles we have used. By defining the threshold in terms of $\mathcal{C}_{l,c}(r_m)$, we extend previous analytical estimations to the type-II region, which is shown to be accurate within a few percent when compared to the numerical simulations for the tested profiles. Our results suggest that current PBH abundance calculations for models where the threshold lies in the type-II region may have been overestimated due to the general assumption that it should saturate at the boundary between the type-I and type-II regions.</description>

      <title>Hidden Twin Star Solutions from an Agnostic Speed-of-Sound Model: Confronting XTE J1814--338's Extreme Compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The twin star configuration, where two neutron stars share the same mass but exhibit different radii, arises from a strong first-order phase transition within the stellar interior. In widely used equation of state (EoS) meta-models, such as the Polytrope (PP) and Speed-of-Sound (CS) models, this first-order phase transition behavior can be naturally mimicked by tuning some model parameters. Here, we systematically explore the under-explored parameter space within one of a widely adopted CS model that leads to twin stars via a strong first-order phase transition. Within this twin-star subspace, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis that integrates mass--radius (MR) constraints from X-ray observations of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. The resultant twin star branch, situated within the 1--1.2 $M_{\odot}$ mass range and approximately 7 km in radius, surprisingly coincides with the MR ranges proposed for the recent anomaly in the Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars XTE J1814--338 (J1814), suggesting a hybrid twin star configuration. Moreover, incorporating the J1814 observation as an additional constraint yields an extreme phase transition pressure $P_{\text{trans}} = 108.9_{-4.85}^{+6.46}$ MeV/fm$^3$, a transition density of $\varepsilon_{\text{trans}}/\varepsilon_0 = 4.847_{-0.134}^{+0.271}$(where $\varepsilon_0$ is the nuclear saturation energy density) and an energy density jump $\Delta \varepsilon = 558.7_{-278.7}^{+303.6}$ MeV/fm$^3$, corresponding to $\Delta \varepsilon/\varepsilon_0 = 3.716_{-1.854}^{+2.020}$. Notably, to satisfy all astrophysical constraints, the speed of sound inside of the hybrid twin star core is driven toward the speed of light ($c_s^2/c^2 &gt; 0.9$), indicating the potential presence of strongly interacting, exotic matter in this core region.</description>

      <title>A Prototype Atom Interferometer to Detect Dark Matter and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The AION project has built a tabletop prototype of a single-photon long-baseline atom interferometer using the 87Sr clock transition - a type of quantum sensor designed to search for dark matter and gravitational waves. Our prototype detector operates at the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), producing a signal with no unexpected noise beyond atom shot noise. Importantly, the detector remains at the SQL even when additional laser phase noise is introduced, emulating conditions in a long-baseline detector such as AION or AEDGE where significant laser phase deviations will accumulate during long atom interrogation times. Our results mark a key milestone in extending atom interferometers to long baselines. Such interferometers can complement laser-interferometer gravitational wave detectors by accessing the mid-frequency gravitational wave band around 1 Hz, and can search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>
