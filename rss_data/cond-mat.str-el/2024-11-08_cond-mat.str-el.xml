      <title>Fractionally Quantized Electric Polarization and Discrete Shift of Crystalline Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCI) with crystalline symmetry possess topological invariants that fundamentally have no analog in continuum fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states. Here we demonstrate through numerical calculations on model wave functions that FCIs possess a fractionally quantized electric polarization, $\vec{\mathscr{P}}_{\text{o}}$, where $\text{o}$ is a high symmetry point. $\vec{\mathscr{P}}_{\text{o}}$ takes fractional values as compared to the allowed values for integer Chern insulators because of the possibility that anyons carry fractional quantum numbers under lattice translation symmetries. $\vec{\mathscr{P}}_{\text{o}}$, together with the discrete shift $\mathscr{S}_{\text{o}}$, determine fractionally quantized universal contributions to electric charge in regions containing lattice disclinations, dislocations, boundaries, and/or corners, and which are fractions of the minimal anyon charge. We demonstrate how these invariants can be extracted using Monte Carlo computations on model wave functions with lattice defects for 1/2-Laughlin and 1/3-Laughlin FCIs on the square and honeycomb lattice, respectively, obtained using the parton construction. These results comprise a class of fractionally quantized response properties of topologically ordered states that go beyond the known ones discovered over thirty years ago.</description>

      <title>New classes of quantum anomalous Hall crystals in multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent experimental observation of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effects in the rhombohedrally stacked pentalayer graphene has motivated theoretical discussions on the possibility of quantum anomalous Hall crystal (QAHC), a topological version of Wigner crystal. Conventionally Wigner crystal was assumed to have a period $a_{\text{crystal}}=1/\sqrt{n}$ locked to the density $n$. In this work we propose new types of topological Wigner crystals labeled as QAHC-$z$ with period $a_{\text{crystal}}=\sqrt{z/n}$. In rhombohedrally stacked graphene aligned with hexagon boron nitride~(hBN), we find parameter regimes where QAHC-2 and QAHC-3 have lower energy than the conventional QAHC-1 at total filling $\nu=1$ per moir\'e unit cell. These states all have total Chern number $C_\mathrm{tot}=1$ and are consistent with the QAH effect observed in the experiments. The larger period QAHC states have better kinetic energy due to the unique Mexican-hat dispersion of the pentalayer graphene, which can compensate for the loss in the interaction energy. Unlike QAHC-1, QAHC-2 and QAHC-3 also break the moir\'e translation symmetry and are sharply distinct from a moir\'e band insulator. We also briefly discuss the competition between integer QAHC and fractional QAHC states at filling $\nu=2/3$. Besides, we notice the importance of the moir\'e potential. A larger moir\'e potential can greatly change the phase diagram and even favors a QAHC-1 ansatz with $C=2$ Chern band.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible duality and symmetry topological order of one-dimensional lattice models with spatially modulated symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between self-duality and spatially modulated symmetry of generalized $N$-state clock models, which include the transverse-field Ising model and ordinary $N$-state clock models as special cases. The spatially modulated symmetry of the model becomes trivial when the model's parameters satisfy a specific number-theoretic relation. We find that the duality is non-invertible when the spatially modulated symmetry remains nontrivial, and show that this non-invertibility is resolved by introducing a generalized $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, which manifests ultraviolet/infrared mixing, as the bulk topological order. In this framework, the boundary duality transformation corresponds to the boundary action of a bulk symmetry transformation, with the endpoint of the bulk symmetry defect realizing the boundary duality defect. Our results illuminate not only a holographic perspective on dualities but also a relationship between spatially modulated symmetry and ultraviolet/infrared mixing in one higher dimension.</description>

      <title>Gauge theory and mixed state criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mixed quantum states, the notion of symmetry is divided into two types: strong and weak symmetry. While spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) for a weak symmetry is detected by two-point correlation functions, SSB for a strong symmetry is characterized by the Renyi-2 correlators. In this work, we present a way to construct various SSB phases for strong symmetries, starting from the ground state phase diagram of lattice gauge theory models. In addition to introducing a new type of mixed-state topological phases, we provide models of the criticalities between them, including those with gapless symmetry-protected topological order. We clarify that the ground states of lattice gauge theories are purified states of the corresponding mixed SSB states. Our construction can be applied to any finite gauge theory and offers a framework to study quantum operations between mixed quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Spin-1/2 XX chains with modulated Gamma interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spin-1/2 XX chain with a modulated Gamma interaction (GI), which results from the superposition of uniform and staggered Gamma terms. We diagonalize the Hamiltonian of the model exactly using the Fermionization technique. We then probe the energy gap and identify the gapped and gapless regions. We also examine the staggered chiral, staggered nematic and dimer order parameters to determine the different phases of the ground state phase diagram with their respective long-range orders. Our findings indicate that the model undergoes first-order, second-order, gapless-gapless, and gapped-gapped phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Field tunable BKT and quantum phase transitions in spin-1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum magnetism is one of the most active fields for exploring exotic phases and phase transitions. The recently synthesized Na2BaCo(PO4)2 (NBCP) is an ideal material incarnation of the spin-1/2 easy axis triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF). Experimental evidence shows that NBCP hosts the spin supersolid state with a giant magnetocaloric effect. It was also proposed that the applied magnetic field B can drive the system through Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) and other richer quantum phase transitions. However, the detection of these transitions is challenging because they onset at extremely low temperature T at around 60 mK, and the measurement of the magnetic susceptibility of these transitions requires high sensitivity. With the help of our newly developed gradient force magnetometer in a dilution refrigerator, we constructed the contour diagram of the magnetic susceptibility in the B-T phase diagram in T as cold as 30 mK. These results provide a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the several field-tunable quantum phase transitions and BKT melting of the spin supersolidity, which are especially significant when their giant magnetocaloric effects highlight potential applications for sub-Kelvin refrigeration under concerns about global helium shortages.</description>

      <title>Adibatic demagnetization refrigeration with antiferromagnetically ordered NaGdP$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the structural, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties, as well as the adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR) performance of NaGdP$_2$O$_7$. Although NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at a N\'eel temperature of $T_{\rm N} = 570$ mK in zero field, ADR experiments achieved a minimum temperature of 220 mK starting from $T = 2$ K under an applied magnetic field of $\mu_0H = 5$ T. The warm-up time back to $T = 2$ K exceeds 60 hours, which is roughly 50 times longer than that of its Yb-based analogue, underscoring the potential of NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ as an efficient precooling stage in double-stage ADR systems. We show that NaGdP$_2$O$_7$ can be seen as a network of ferromagnetic spin chains with antiferromagnetic interchain couplings and also investigate the influence of antiferromagnetic ordering on the magnetic entropy. We find that the temperature dependence of the entropy plays a more dominant role than its magnetic field dependence in the magnetically ordered state.</description>

      <title>Non-destructive imaging of bulk electrical 'hidden' state switching in a 1T-TaS2 cryo-memory device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In transition metal dichalcogenides a plethora of emergent states arise from competing electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions. Among these, the non-volatile metallic 'hidden' state of 1T-TaS2 can be induced from its insulating equilibrium charge-density wave ground state using either optical or electrical pulses. Here we report in-operando micro-beam X-ray diffraction, fluorescence, and concurrent transport measurements, allowing us to spatially image the non-thermal hidden state induced by electrical switching of a 1T-TaS2 device. Our findings reveal that the electrically and optically switched hidden states are structurally equivalent. Additionally, we observe a bulk switching channel extending beyond the intergap space to partially underneath the electrodes, suggesting that the non-equilibrium phase is caused by a combination of charge flow and lattice response. Besides identifying strain propagation as an important factor for non-thermal switching of layered materials, our results illustrate the power of non-destructive, three-dimensional X-ray imaging for studying phase-change materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of electronic transitions in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ with Avoided Level Crossing $\mu$SR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome superconductors AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ provide a unique platform for studying the interplay between a variety of electronic orders, including superconductivity, charge density waves, nematic phases and more. Understanding the evolution of the electronic state from the charge density wave to the superconducting transition is essential for unraveling the interplay of charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom giving rise to the unusual magnetic properties of these nonmagnetic metals. Previous zero-field and high-field $\mu$SR studies revealed two anomalies in the muon spin relaxation rate, a first change at $T_{CDW} \sim 100$ K and a second steep increase at $T^{*}\sim 40$ K, further enhanced by an applied magnetic field, thus suggesting a contribution of magnetic origin. In this study, we use the avoided level crossing $\mu$SR technique to investigate charge order in near-zero applied field. By tracking the temperature dependence of quadrupolar level-crossing resonances, we examined the evolution of the electric field gradient at V nuclei in the kagome plane. Our results show a significant rearrangement of the charge density starting at $T^{*}$ indicating a transition in the charge distribution, likely electronic in origin, well below $T_{CDW}$. These findings, combined with previous $\mu$SR, STM, and NMR studies, emphasize the intertwined nature of proximate phases in these systems, with the charge rearrangement dominating the additional increase in $\mu$SR relaxation rate below $T^{*}$.</description>

      <title>Fermionic transport through a driven quantum point contact: breakdown of Floquet thermalization beyond a critical driving frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a quantum system that consists of two fermionic chains coupled by a driven quantum point contact (QPC). The QPC contains a bond with a periodically varying tunneling amplitude. Initially the left chain is packed with fermions while the right one is empty. We numerically track the evolution of the system and demonstrate that, at frequencies above a critical one, the current through the QPC halts, and the particle imbalance between the chains remains forever. This implies a spectacular breakdown of the Floquet version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis which predicts a homogeneous particle density profile at large times. We confirm the effect for various driving protocols and interparticle interactions.</description>

      <title>Long-range entanglement from spontaneous non-onsite symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the states of matter arising from the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ non-onsite symmetries. In one spatial dimension, we construct a frustration-free lattice model exhibiting SSB of a non-onsite symmetry, which features the coexistence of two ground states with distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders. We analytically prove the two-fold ground-state degeneracy and the existence of a finite energy gap. Fixing the symmetry sector yields a long-range entangled ground state that features long-range correlations among non-invertible charged operators. We also present a constant-depth measurement-feedback protocol to prepare such a state with a constant success probability in the thermodynamic limit, which may be of independent interest. Under a symmetric deformation, the SSB persists up to a critical point, beyond which a gapless phase characterized by a conformal field theory emerges. In two spatial dimensions, the SSB of 1-form non-onsite symmetries leads to a long-range entangled state (SPT soup) - a condensate of 1d SPT along any closed loops. On a torus, there are four such locally indistinguishable states that exhibit algebraic correlations between local operators, which we derived via a mapping to the critical $O(2)$ loop model. This provides an intriguing example of `topological quantum criticality'. Our work reveals the exotic features of SSB of non-onsite symmetries, which may lie beyond the framework of topological holography (SymTFT).</description>

      <title>Protocols for Creating Anyons and Defects via Gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating and manipulating anyons and symmetry defects in topological phases, especially those with a non-Abelian character, constitutes a primitive for topological quantum computation. We provide a physical protocol for implementing the ribbon operators of non-Abelian anyons and symmetry defects. We utilize dualities, in particular the Kramers-Wannier or gauging map, which have previously been used to construct topologically ordered ground states by relating them to simpler states. In this work, ribbon operators are implemented by applying a gauging procedure to a lower-dimensional region of such states. This protocol uses sequential unitary circuits or, in certain cases, constant-depth adaptive circuits. We showcase this for anyons and defects in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ toric code and $S_3$ quantum double. The general applicability of our method is demonstrated by deriving unitary expressions for ribbon operators of various (twisted) quantum doubles.</description>

      <title>Qutrit Toric Code and Parafermions in Trapped Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of programmable quantum devices can be measured by the complexity of manybody states that they are able to prepare. Among the most significant are topologically ordered states of matter, which enable robust quantum information storage and processing. While topological orders are more readily accessible with qudits, experimental realisations have thus far been limited to lattice models of qubits. Here, we prepare a ground state of the Z3 toric code state on 24 qutrits in a trapped ion quantum processor with fidelity per qutrit exceeding 96.5(3)%. We manipulate two types of defects which go beyond the conventional qubit toric code: a parafermion, and its bound state which is related to charge conjugation symmetry. We further demonstrate defect fusion and the transfer of entanglement between anyons and defects, which we use to control topological qutrits. Our work opens up the space of long-range entangled states with qudit degrees of freedom for use in quantum simulation and universal error-correcting codes.</description>

      <title>Topological Modes in Monitored Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum systems both driven by unitary evolutions and monitored through measurements have proved to be fertile ground for exploring new dynamical quantum matters. While the entanglement structure and symmetry properties of monitored systems have been intensively studied, the role of topology in monitored dynamics is much less explored. In this work, we investigate novel topological phenomena in the monitored dynamics through the lens of free-fermion systems. Free-fermion monitored dynamics were previously shown to be unified with the Anderson localization problem under the Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classification. Guided by this unification, we identify the topological area-law-entangled phases in the former setting through the topological classification of disordered insulators and superconductors in the latter. As examples, we focus on 1+1D free-fermion monitored dynamics in two symmetry classes, DIII and A. We construct quantum circuit models to study different topological area-law phases and their domain walls in the respective symmetry classes. We find that the domain wall between topologically distinct area-law phases hosts dynamical topological modes whose entanglement is protected from being quenched by the measurements in the monitored dynamics. We demonstrate how to manipulate these topological modes by programming the domain-wall dynamics. In particular, for topological modes in class DIII, which behave as unmeasured Majorana modes, we devise a protocol to braid them and study the entanglement generated in the braiding process.</description>

      <title>On fault tolerant single-shot logical state preparation and robust long-range entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing encoded logical states is the first step in a fault-tolerant quantum computation. Standard approaches based on concatenation or repeated measurement incur a significant time overhead. The Raussendorf-Bravyi-Harrington cluster state offers an alternative: a single-shot preparation of encoded states of the surface code, by means of a constant depth quantum circuit, followed by a single round of measurement and classical feedforward. In this work we generalize this approach and prove that single-shot logical state preparation can be achieved for arbitrary quantum LDPC codes. Our proof relies on a minimum-weight decoder and is based on a generalization of Gottesman's clustering-of-errors argument. As an application, we also prove single-shot preparation of the encoded GHZ state in arbitrary quantum LDPC codes. This shows that adaptive noisy constant depth quantum circuits are capable of generating generic robust long-range entanglement.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric behavior of breathing kagom\'{e} monolayers of $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{(Cl, Br, I)}_8$ from first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply density functional theory to explore the magnetoelectric (ME) properties of two-dimensional $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{(Cl,Br,I)}_8$. These compounds have recently been proposed to exhibit coupled ferroelectric and ferromagnetic order leading to a switchable anomalous valley Hall effect (AVHE). Using both spin-spiral and self-consistent spin-orbit coupled calculations, we predict an in-plane $120^\circ$ cycloid of trimerized spins as the ground state for $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{Cl}_8$. For $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{Br}_8$ and $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{I}_8$ we find long period incommensurate helical order. We calculate a number of magnetic properties such as the exchange constants, orbital magnetization, and Curie-Weiss transition temperatures, which are in good agreement with experimental values for the bulk compounds. It is then shown that, despite having both broken inversion and time-reversal symmetry, the proposed AVHE and linear ME response are forbidden by the presence of helical order in the ground state. In addition, the computed switching trajectory demonstrates that it is unlikely that the polar state of the monolayers can be switched with a homogeneous electric field due to an unusual equation of state of the out-of-plane dipole moment. Nevertheless, we highlight that in the presence of a strong electric field, the trimerized spins in $\mathrm{Nb}_3\mathrm{Cl}_8$ will exhibit a magnetic phase transition from the $120^\circ$ cycloid to out-of-plane ferromagnetic order, which restores the symmetry required for both AVHE and linear ME effects.</description>

      <title>Convergence efficiency of quantum gates and circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum circuit models where the gates are drawn from arbitrary gate ensembles given by probabilistic distributions over certain gate sets and circuit architectures, which we call stochastic quantum circuits. Of main interest in this work is the speed of convergence of stochastic circuits with different gate ensembles and circuit architectures to unitary t-designs. A key motivation for this theory is the varying preference for different gates and circuit architectures in different practical scenarios. In particular, it provides a versatile framework for devising efficient circuits for implementing $t$-designs and relevant applications including random circuit and scrambling experiments, as well as benchmarking the performance of gates and circuit architectures. We examine various important settings in depth. A key aspect of our study is an "ironed gadget" model, which allows us to systematically evaluate and compare the convergence efficiency of entangling gates and circuit architectures. Particularly notable results include i) gadgets of two-qubit gates with KAK coefficients $\left(\frac{\pi}{4}-\frac{1}{8}\arccos(\frac{1}{5}),\frac{\pi}{8},\frac{1}{8}\arccos(\frac{1}{5})\right)$ (which we call $\chi$ gates) directly form exact 2- and 3-designs; ii) the iSWAP gate family achieves the best efficiency for convergence to 2-designs under mild conjectures with numerical evidence, even outperforming the Haar-random gate, for generic many-body circuits; iii) iSWAP + complete graph achieve the best efficiency for convergence to 2-designs among all graph circuits. A variety of numerical results are provided to complement our analysis. We also derive robustness guarantees for our analysis against gate perturbations. Additionally, we provide cursory analysis on gates with higher locality and found that the Margolus gate outperforms various other well-known gates.</description>

      <title>Efficient Preparation of Solvable Anyons with Adaptive Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of topological phases of matter is a fundamental challenge in quantum many-body physics, with applications to quantum technology. Recently, this classification has been extended to the setting of Adaptive Finite-Depth Local Unitary (AFDLU) circuits which allow global classical communication. In this setting, the trivial phase is the collection of all topological states that can be prepared via AFDLU. Here, we propose a complete classification of the trivial phase by showing how to prepare all solvable anyon theories that admit a gapped boundary via AFDLU, extending recent results on solvable groups. Our construction includes non-Abelian anyons with irrational quantum dimensions, such as Ising anyons, and more general acyclic anyons. Specifically, we introduce a sequential gauging procedure, with an AFDLU implementation, to produce a string-net ground state in any topological phase described by a solvable anyon theory with gapped boundary. In addition, we introduce a sequential ungauging and regauging procedure, with an AFDLU implementation, to apply string operators of arbitrary length for anyons and symmetry twist defects in solvable anyon theories. We apply our procedure to the quantum double of the group $S_3$ and to several examples that are beyond solvable groups, including the doubled Ising theory, the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Tambara-Yamagami string-net, and doubled $SU(2)_4$ anyons.</description>

      <title>Topological stabilizer models on continuous variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of two-dimensional topological stabilizer codes on continuous variable (CV) degrees of freedom, which generalize homological rotor codes and the toric-GKP code. Our topological codes are built using the concept of boson condensation -- we start from a parent stabilizer code based on an $\mathbb{R}$ gauge theory and condense various bosonic excitations. This produces a large class of topological CV stabilizer codes, including ones that are characterized by the anyon theories of $U(1)_{2n}\times U(1)_{-2m}$ Chern-Simons theories, for arbitrary pairs of positive integers $(n,m)$. Most notably, this includes anyon theories that are non-chiral and nevertheless do not admit a gapped boundary. It is widely believed that such anyon theories cannot be realized by any stabilizer model on finite-dimensional systems. We conjecture that these CV codes go beyond codes obtained from concatenating a topological qudit code with a local encoding into CVs, and thus, constitute the first example of topological codes that are intrinsic to CV systems. Moreover, we study the Hamiltonians associated to the topological CV stabilizer codes and show that, although they have a gapless spectrum, they can become gapped with the addition of a quadratic perturbation. We show that similar methods can be used to construct a gapped Hamiltonian whose anyon theory agrees with a $U(1)_2$ Chern-Simons theory. Our work initiates the study of scalable stabilizer codes that are intrinsic to CV systems and highlights how error-correcting codes can be used to design and analyze many-body systems of CVs that model lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Pressure tuning of intrinsic and extrinsic sources to the anomalous Hall effect in CrGeTe$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integrated Berry curvature is a geometric property that has dramatic implications for material properties. This study investigates the integrated Berry curvature and other contributions to the anomalous Hall effect in CrGeTe$_3$ as a function of pressure. The anomalous Hall effect is absent in the insulating phase of CrGeTe$_3$ and evolves with pressure in a dome-like fashion as pressure is applied. The dome's edges are characterized by Fermi surface deformations, manifested as mixed electron and hole transport. We corroborate the presence of bipolar transport by ab-initio calculations which also predict a nonmonotonic behavior of the Berry curvature as a function of pressure. Quantitative discrepancies between our calculations and experimental results indicate that additional scattering mechanisms, which are also strongly tuned by pressure, contribute to the anomalous Hall effect in CrGeTe$_3$.</description>

      <title>Topological singularity-induced Mott-like self-energy and its impact on Kondo cloud formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11382v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discovered that abnormal Mott physics can emerge even in weakly correlated 4f fermions through their interplay with topological singularity. Employing ab initio many-body perturbation theory combined with dynamical mean field theory, we show that 4f electrons near the topological singular point experience strong effective Coulomb repulsion, as the hybridization channels are blocked near the singularity. As a result, Mott-like self-energy emerges, forbidding the coexistence of 4f quasiparticles and the topological singularity at the same energy level in HoPtBi, PrPtBi, and PrAlGe. The formation of 4f quasiparticles is highly dependent on the energy of topological singularity relative to the Fermi level. This effect is suggested to be responsible for the selective quantum phenomena observed between heavy fermion behavior from Kondo resonance and anomalous transport from nontrivial topological states.</description>

      <title>Interplay between the charge density wave phase and a pseudogap under antiferromagnetic correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the impact of short-range antiferromagnetic correlations on the charge density wave (CDW) phase in strongly correlated electron systems exhibiting the pseudogap phenomenon. Our investigation employs a n-pole approximation to consider the repulsive Coulomb interaction $(U)$ and antiferromagnetic correlations. Utilizing a two-dimensional Hubbard model for the Coulomb interaction and a BCS-like model for the CDW order parameter, we observe that an increase in $U$ enhances antiferromagnetic fluctuations, resulting in a flattened re-normalized band around the anti-nodal point $(\pi,0)$. The pseudogap manifests in the band structure and density of states, prompting an exploration across various $U$ and occupation number values. Our findings indicate that antiferromagnetic correlations significantly influence the CDW state, as the Fermi surface is reconstructed within the ordered phase. Furthermore, we find a Lifhsitz transition inside both the CDW phase and the normal state, with the latter preceding the onset of the pseudogap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional mirror symmetry enriched topological (SET) orders can be studied using the folding approach: it can be folded along the mirror axis and turned into a bilayer system on which the mirror symmetry acts as a $\mathbb Z_2$ layer-exchange symmetry. How mirror symmetry enriches the topological order is then encoded at the mirror axis, which is a gapped boundary of the folded bilayer system. Based on anyon-condensation theory, we classify possible $\mathbb Z_2$-symmetric gapped boundaries of the folded system. In particular, we derive an $H^2$ obstruction function, which corresponds to an $H^3$ obstruction for topological orders enriched by the time-reversal symmetry instead of mirror symmetry. We demonstrate that states with a nontrivial $H^2$ obstruction function can be constructed on the surface of a three-dimensional mirror SET order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Waterfalls are anomalies in the angle-resolved photoemission spectrum where the energy-momentum dispersion is almost vertical, and the spectrum strongly smeared out. These anomalies are observed at relatively high energies, among others, in superconducting cuprates and nickelates. The prevalent understanding is that they originate from the coupling to some boson, with spin fluctuations and phonons being the usual suspects. Here, we show that waterfalls occur naturally in the process where a Hubbard band develops and splits off from the quasiparticle band. Our results for the Hubbard model with $\textit{ab initio}$ determined parameters well agree with waterfalls in cuprates and nickelates, providing a natural explanation for these spectral anomalies observed in correlated materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared to the intensive investigation on the 3d transition-metal (TM)-based spin ladder compounds, less attention has been paid to the ones constructed by the rare-earth (RE) ions. Herein, we report a family of RE-based spin ladder compounds Ba2RE2Ge4O13 (RE = Pr, Nd, Gd-Ho) crystallized into the monoclinic structure with the space group C2/c. The RE ions are arranged on a two-leg spin ladder motif along the b-axis, where the rung and leg exchange interactions are bridged via the RE-O-RE pathways and RE-O-Ge-O-RE routes, respectively. Moreover, the much shorter rung distance in the RE2O12 dimer units than the leg distance suggests Ba2RE2Ge4O13 to be a strong-rung spin ladder system. All the synthesized Ba2RE2Ge4O13 (RE = Pr, Nd, Gd-Ho) compounds exhibit the dominant antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions and absence of magnetic order down to 1.8 K. Among the family members, Ba2Dy2Ge4O13 can be described by Jeff = 1/2 Kramers doublet states, the low temperature specific heat indicates the coexistence of spin dimerized state with broad maximum at ~ 2.4 K and long-range AFM order with TN = 0.81 K. This family of Ba2RE2Ge4O13 compounds thereby provides a rare platform to investigate the novel spin ladder physics constructed by 4f electrons.</description>

      <title>Strange metals and planckian transport in a gapless phase from spatially random interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 'Strange' metals that do not follow the predictions of Fermi liquid theory are prevalent in materials that feature superconductivity arising from electron interactions. In recent years, it has been hypothesized that spatial randomness in electron interactions must play a crucial role in strange metals for their hallmark linear-in-temperature ($T$) resistivity to survive down to low temperatures where phonon and Umklapp processes are ineffective, as is observed in experiments. However, a clear picture of how this happens has not yet been provided in a realistic model free from artificial constructions such as large-$N$ limits and replica tricks. We study a realistic model of two-dimensional metals with spatially random antiferromagnetic interactions in a non-perturbative regime, using numerically exact high-performance large-scale hybrid Monte Carlo and exact averages over the quenched spatial randomness. Our simulations reproduce strange metals' key experimental signature of linear-in-$T$ resistivity with a 'planckian' transport scattering rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{tr} \sim k_B T/\hbar$ that is independent of coupling constants. We further find that strange metallicity in these systems is not associated with a quantum critical point, and instead arises from a phase of matter with gapless order parameter fluctuations that lacks long-range correlations and spans an extended region of parameter space: a feature that is also observed in several experiments. Our work paves the way for an eventual microscopic understanding of the role of spatial disorder in determining important properties of correlated electron materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible symmetries of quantum field theories and many-body systems generalize the concept of symmetries by allowing non-invertible operations in addition to more ordinary invertible ones described by groups. The aim of this paper is to point out that these non-invertible symmetries act on local operators by quantum operations, i.e. completely positive maps between density matrices, which form a natural class of operations containing both unitary evolutions and measurements and play an important role in quantum information theory. This observation will be illustrated by the Kramers--Wannier duality of the one-dimensional quantum Ising chain, which is a prototypical example of non-invertible symmetry operations.</description>

      <title>Achieving the volume-law entropy regime with random-sign Dicke states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manipulating entanglement, which reflects non-local correlations in a quantum system and defines the complexity of describing its wave function, represents the extremely tough challenge in the fields of quantum computing, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. In this work, by the example of the well-structured Dicke states we demonstrate that the complexity of these real-valued wave functions can be accurately tuned by introducing a random-sign structure, which allows us to explore the regime of the volume-law entanglement. Importantly, setting nontrivial sign structure one can increase the entanglement entropy of the Dicke state to the values that are close to Page's estimates for Haar-random states. The practical realization of these random-sign Dicke states is possible on different physical platforms with shallow quantum circuits. On the level of the measurements the change in the quantum state complexity due to sign structure can be traced out with the dissimilarity measure that estimates multi-scale variety of patterns in bit-string arrays.</description>

      <title>Dual-isometric Projected Entangled Pair States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16783v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient characterization of higher dimensional many-body physical states presents significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a new class of Project Entangled Pair State (PEPS) that incorporates two isometric conditions. This new class facilitates the efficient calculation of general local observables and certain two-point correlation functions, which have been previously shown to be intractable for general PEPS, or PEPS with only a single isometric constraint. Despite incorporating two isometric conditions, our class preserves the rich physical structure while enhancing the analytical capabilities. It features a large set of tunable parameters, with only a subleading correction compared to that of general PEPS. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate that this class can encode universal quantum computations and can represent a transition from topological to trivial order.</description>
