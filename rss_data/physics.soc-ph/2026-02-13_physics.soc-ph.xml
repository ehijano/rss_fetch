      <title>Collaboration drives phase transitions towards cooperation in prisoner's dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a collaboration ring model -- a network of players playing the prisoner's dilemma game and collaborating among the nearest neighbours by forming coalitions. The microscopic stochastic updating of the players' strategies are driven by their innate nature of seeking selfish gains and shared intentionality. Cooperation emerges in such a structured population through non-equilibrium phase transitions driven by propensity of the players to collaborate and by the benefit that a cooperator generates. The robust results are qualitatively independent of number of neighbours and collaborators.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Function Diversity and Specialization Across Socioeconomic and Biological Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Function diversity, the range of tasks individuals perform, and specialization, the distribution of function abundances, are fundamental to complex adaptive systems. In the absence of overarching principles, these properties have appeared domain-specific. Here, we introduce an empirical framework and a mathematical model for the diversification and specialization of functions across disparate systems, including bacteria, federal agencies, universities, corporations, and cities. We find that the number of functions grows sublinearly with system size, with exponents from 0.35 to 0.57, consistent with Heaps' Law. In contrast, cities exhibit logarithmic scaling. To explain these empirical findings, we generalize the Yule-Simon model by introducing two key parameters: a diversification parameter that characterizes how existing functions inhibit the creation of new ones, and a specialization parameter that describes how a function's attractiveness depends on its abundance. Our model enables cross-system comparisons, from microorganisms to metropolitan areas. The analysis suggests that what drives the creation of new functions depends on the system's goals and structure: federal agencies tend to ensure comprehensive coverage of necessary functions; cities tend to slow the creation of new occupations as existing ones expand; and cells occupy an intermediate position. Once functions are introduced, their growth follows a remarkably universal pattern across all systems.</description>

      <title>Modified Axelrod Model Showing Opinion Convergence And Polarization In Realistic Scale-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axelrod model is an opinion dynamics model such that each agent on a square lattice has a finite number of possible nominal opinions on a finite number of issues that are usually called features in the field. Moreover, its dynamics between two agents is assimilative in the sense that the number of agreeing features between them never decreases upon interaction. Here we modify this model to study opinion convergence, polarization and more importantly to find ways to reduce opinion polarization in an already polarized population. We do so by changing or adding several elements from complex network and continuous opinion dynamics research.
  First, we put agents in a scale-free network. Second, we adopt the bounded confidence model by representing our agent's opinions by numbers in $[-1,1]$ those distances follow the standard Euclidean metric. Third, our rules allow both convergence and divergence of their resultant opinions after a pair of agents interacts. As a result, our modified model offers a more comprehensive exploration of opinion dynamics.
  Computer simulation results of our model show scaling behavior and a notable trend in opinion polarization on all features in the majority of reasonable simulation parameters. To mitigate this polarization, we introduce empathetic agents that work actively to reduce opinion differences. However, our findings indicate limited success in the approach for the most effective way is to change the behavior of a significant portion of highly connected agents. This research contributes to the understanding of opinion dynamics within society and highlights the nuanced complexities that arise when considering factors such as network structure and continuous opinion values. Our results prompt further exploration and open avenues for future investigations into effective methods of reducing opinion polarization.</description>

      <title>Fiscal Dynamics in Japan under Demographic Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Japan's population is shrinking, the share of working-age people is falling, and the number of elderly is growing fast. These trends squeeze public finances from both sides--fewer people paying taxes and more people drawing on pensions and healthcare. Policy discussions often focus on one fix at a time, such as raising taxes, reforming pensions, or boosting productivity. However, these levers interact with each other through feedback loops and time delays that are not yet well understood. This study builds and calibrates an integrated system dynamics model that connects demographics, labor supply, economic output, and public finance to explore two questions: (RQ1) What feedback structure links demographic change to fiscal outcomes, and how do different policy levers work through that structure? (RQ2) Which combinations of policies can stabilize key fiscal indicators within a meaningful timeframe? The model, grounded in official statistics, tracks historical trends reasonably well. Policy experiments show that productivity improvements and controlling per-person costs offer the most effective near-term relief, because they act quickly through revenue and spending channels. In contrast, raising fertility actually worsens the fiscal picture in the medium term, since it takes decades for newborns to grow up and join the workforce. A combined scenario pairing moderate productivity gains with moderate cost control nearly eliminates the deficit by 2050. These findings underscore the importance of timing when evaluating demographic policy. Stabilizing finances within a practical timeframe requires levers that improve the budget directly, rather than those that work through slow demographic channels. The model serves as a transparent testing ground for designing time-aware fiscal policy packages in aging, high-debt economies.</description>
