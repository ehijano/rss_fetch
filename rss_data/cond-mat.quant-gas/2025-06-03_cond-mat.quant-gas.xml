      <title>Creation of a degenerate Bose-Bose mixture of erbium and lithium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the realization of a degenerate mixture of $^{166}$Er and $^{7}$Li atoms in their lowest spin state. The two species are sequentially laser-cooled and loaded into an optical dipole trap, then transported to a glass cell in which further cooling to degeneracy occurs. Since Er is more weakly trapped, it serves as a coolant for Li, and we observe efficient sympathetic cooling facilitated by a large interspecies elastic scattering cross section. Three-body losses are found to be small at the magnetic fields explored, making this platform promising for the study of interacting mixtures with large mass imbalance.</description>

      <title>Ballistic particle transport and Drude weight in mono-atomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to the fact that, in the particular case of non-relativistic mono-atomic gases, the particle current operator is proportional to the operator of the total momentum, the particle transport in such systems is always ballistic and fully characterized by a Drude weight $\Delta$. The Drude weight can be calculated as a generalized susceptibility from a generalized Gibbs ensemble. For the case of the integrable one dimensional Bose gas with contact interactions this susceptibility can be obtained exactly and explicitly from a generalized Yang-Yang thermodynamic formalism. The result is temperature independent and given by $\Delta = 2 \pi D = 2 k_F$, where $D$ is the density of the gas and $k_F$ its Fermi momentum. Our expression, derived by first principle calculations, confirms a more involved formula obtained heuristically by means of generalized hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Hyperspherical Analysis of Dimer-Dimer Scattering in One-Dimensional Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of four-body scattering in one-dimensional (1D) quantum systems using the adiabatic hyperspherical representation (AHR). Focusing on dimer-dimer collisions between two species of fermions interacting via the sinh-cosh potential, we implement the slow variable discretization (SVD) method to overcome numerical challenges posed by sharp avoided crossings in the potential curves. Our numerical approach is benchmarked against exact analytical results available in integrable regimes, demonstrating excellent agreement. We further explore non-integrable regimes where no analytical solutions exist, revealing novel features such as resonant enhancement of the scattering length associated with tetramer formation. These results highlight the power and flexibility of the AHR+SVD framework for accurate few-body scattering calculations in low-dimensional quantum systems, and establish a foundation for future investigations of universal few-body physics in ultracold gases.</description>

      <title>Reply to the Comment on "Shell-Shaped Quantum Droplet in a Three-Component Ultracold Bose Gas"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our work (Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 043402 (2025)), we have proposed to realize a shell-shaped BEC with self-bound character in a three-component ($1,2,3$) Bose gas, where $(2,3)$ and $(1,2)$ both form quantum droplets and meanwhile are linked as core-shell structure. It was then commented in 2505.16554 that such structure is unstable against decaying to a ``dimer" configuration with lower energy, and moreover, it is ``most likely" impossible to be realized after releasing from the trap. In contrast to these claims, our reply shows that the core-shell and dimer states are energetically degenerate in the thermodynamic limit, and more importantly, the core-shell structure is robustly stable against external perturbations and can be realized practically following the trap-release scheme.</description>

      <title>Anomalous non-thermal fixed point in a quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of distinctly sub-diffusive scaling in the vicinity of an anomalous non-thermal fixed point is discussed in a quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gas in the superfluid phase, carrying ensembles of vortices and antivortices with zero net angular momentum. The observed scaling behavior reflects coarsening dynamics driven by the mutual annihilation of vortices and antivortices, with the mean inter-defect distance growing algebraically over time as $\ell_\text{v}(t)\sim t^{\,\beta}$. A sub-diffusive ($\beta&lt;1/2$) exponent $\beta\approx0.2$ is extracted for various parameter regimes, initial conditions, and dipolar configurations from both scaling occupation-number spectra and the evolution of inter-defect distances as well as the corresponding total vortex densities. As vortex-antivortex annihilation progresses, excitations of the background condensate increase. This gives rise to a transition in the scaling behavior at late times, toward a non-thermal fixed point governed by diffusion-type scaling with $\beta\approx1/2$ as expected for the mutual annihilation of well-separated vortex-antivortex dipoles. While the temporal scaling with $\beta$ does not depend significantly on the strength and anisotropy of the dipolar interactions and thus underlines the universality of the anomalous as well as diffusion-type non-thermal fixed points, we find distinctly different vortex patterns resulting in the dipolar case. While in the superfluid with contact interactions only, same-sign vortices tend to cluster and form large-scale eddies, in the dipolar and tilted cases, roton excitations appear to prevent such motion, giving rather rise to a maximisation of distances between vortices of either sign.</description>

      <title>Magnetic correlations in the $SU(3)$ triangular-lattice $t$-$J$ model at finite doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation platforms have become powerful tools for investigating strongly correlated systems beyond the capabilities of classical computation. Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms and molecules now enable experimental realizations of SU(N)-symmetric Fermi-Hubbard models, yet theoretical understanding of these systems, particularly at finite doping remains limited. Here we investigate the strong-coupling limit of the $SU(3)$ symmetric Fermi-Hubbard model on the triangular lattice with dimensions up to $9\times9$ lattice sites across the full doping range. Using a three-flavor extension of Gutzwiller-projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS), a neural network based variational ansatz, we analyze two- and three-point spin-spin and spin-spin-hole correlations of the $SU(3)$ Cartan generators. We further study binding energies for large periodic systems, and compare our results to the paradigmatic $SU(2)$ square lattice equivalent, finding strikingly similar magnetic correlations, but enhanced binding energies. Our results provide a foundation for future exploration of doped SU(N) Mott insulators, providing valuable insights for both theoretical developments and quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode NOON states generation with ultracold atoms via geodesic counterdiabatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01948v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a protocol for the generation of NOON states with ultracold atoms, leveraging the Bose-Hubbard model in the self-trapping regime. By the means of an optimized adiabatic protocol, we achieve a significant reduction in the time required for the preparation of highly entangled NOON states, involving two or more modes. Our method saturates the quantum speed limit, ensuring both efficiency and high fidelity in state preparation. A detailed analysis of the geodesic counterdiabatic driving protocol and its application to the Bose-Hubbard system highlights its ability to expand the energy gap, facilitating faster adiabatic evolution. Through perturbation theory, we derive effective parameters that emulate the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, enabling experimentally viable implementations with constant physical parameters. This approach is demonstrated to yield exponential time savings compared to standard geodesic driving, making it a powerful tool for creating complex entangled states for applications in quantum metrology and quantum information. Our findings pave the way for scalable and precise quantum state control in ultracold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Chaotic dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates in a tilted optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the emergence of chaotic dynamics in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) subjected to both alternating (AC) and constant (DC) components of the interaction strength, modeled through the scattering length. We systematically explore how the interplay of AC and DC nonlinearities affect the dynamical evolution of the condensate under a tilted optical lattice potential. Various types of chaos are identified across different parametric regimes, with numerical simulations revealing a clear distinction between regular and chaotic domains. The width of the regular domains is quantified, and the influence of AC and DC components in promoting stochastic behavior is highlighted. Lyapunov exponents, Poincar\'e sections, and other chaos indicators then confirm the transition to chaotic dynamics, in agreement with analytical expectations. A qualitative conjecture is proposed for the role of these interactions in BEC stabilization. Our findings offer insights into the dynamic control of BECs, with potential applications in quantum simulation and coherent matter-wave engineering, in line with entanglement and quantum transport, that are crucial for developing robust and reliable quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A large magneto-optical trap of cadmium atoms loaded from a cryogenic buffer gas beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate rapid loading of a magneto-optical trap (MOT) of cadmium atoms from a pulsed cryogenic helium buffer gas beam, overcoming strong photoionization losses. Using the $ ^1S_0 \rightarrow{} ^1P_1 $ transition at 229 nm, we capture up to $ 1.1(2) \times 10^7$ $^{112}$Cd atoms in 10 ms, achieving a peak density of $2.5 \times 10^{11}$cm$^{-3}$ and a phase-space density of $ 2 \times 10^{-9} $. The large scattering force in the deep ultraviolet enables Zeeman slowing within 5 cm of the trap, yielding a capture velocity exceeding 200 m/s. We measure the MOT trap frequency and damping constant, and determine the absolute photoionization cross section of the $^1P_1 $ state. Photoionization losses are mitigated via dynamic detuning of the trapping light's frequency, allowing efficient accumulation of multiple atomic pulses. Our results demonstrate the benefits of deep-UV (DUV) transitions and cryogenic beams for loading high-density MOTs, especially for species with significant loss channels in their main cooling cycle. The cadmium MOT provides a robust testbed that benchmarks our DUV laser cooling system and establishes the foundation for trapping and cooling polar AlF molecules, which share many optical and structural properties with Cd.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions IV: Coulomb corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formalism developed in Refs.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal,Guo:2024pvt} that relates the integrated correlation functions for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral is further extended to include Coulomb interaction between charged particles. The original formalism cannot be applied due to different divergent asymptotic behavior resulting from the long-range nature of the Coulomb force. We show that a modified formula in which the difference of integrated correlation functions between particles interacting with Coulomb plus short-range interaction and with Coulomb interaction alone is free of divergence, and has rapid approach to its infinite volume limit. Using an exactly solvable model, we demonstrate that the short-range potential scattering phase shifts can be reliably extracted from the formula in the presence of Coulomb interaction.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the classic Joule-expansion experiments, now with a quantum-degenerate atomic Bose gas. In contrast to the classical-gas experiments, where no temperature change was measured, here we observe and quantitatively explain both cooling and heating effects, which arise, respectively, due to quantum statistics and inter-particle interactions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement as a topological marker in harmonically confined attractive Fermi-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the single-site von Neumann entropy along a harmonically confined superfluid chain, as described by the one-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model with strongly attractive interactions. We find that by increasing the confinement (or equivalently the particle filling) the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from a superfluid (SF) to a non-trivial topological insulator (TI) phase, which is characterized by an insulating bulk surrounded by highly entangled superfluid edges. These highly entangled states are found to be robust against perturbations and topologically protected by the particle-hole symmetry, which is locally preserved. We also find a semi-quantitative agreement between entanglement and superconducting order parameter profiles, confirming then that entanglement can be used as a topological marker and an order parameter in these systems. The charge gap not only confirms the SF-TI transition, but also shows that this transition is mediated by a metallic intermediate regime within the bulk. Using the gap we could depict a phase diagram for which the non-trivial topological insulator can be found in such harmonically confined attractive systems.</description>

      <title>Measuring topological invariants of even-dimensional non-Hermitian systems through quench dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Spectral Multifractality and Emergent Energyscales Across the Many-Body Localisation Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a scaling theory of the many-body localisation transition in terms of emergent, characteristic energyscales. The analysis is based on the decomposition of the eigenstates in the basis of trivially localised states, resolved in the energies of the latter, which we refer to as the spectral decomposition of the eigenstates. The characteristic energyscales emerge when the multifractal properties, or lack thereof, of the spectral decomposition are studied at different scales. These characteristic scales correspond to the ones, above which the spectral decompositions exhibit their global behaviour, namely full ergodicity in the ergodic phase and multifractality in the many-body localised phase. On the other hand, at scales below the characteristic ones, the decomposition in the ergodic phase shows finer (multi)fractal structures whereas in the localised phase, the decomposition picks out well-separated, localised resonant peaks. The scaling of these characteristic energyscales across the many-body localisation transition admits a scaling theory consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless type scenario and bears striking resemblances to that of inverse participation ratios of eigenstates.</description>

Abstract: For quantum spin systems in equilibrium, the dynamic structure factor (DSF) is among the most feature-packed experimental observables. However, from a theory perspective it is often hard to simulate in an unbiased and accurate way, especially for frustrated and high-dimensional models at intermediate temperature. We address this challenge by introducing a dynamic extension of the high-temperature expansion as an efficient numerical approach to the DSF for arbitrary lattices. We focus on the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model and spin-lengths S=1/2 and 1. We present a user-friendly numerical implementation and provide comprehensive benchmarks on spin chains. As applications we treat a variety of frustrated two- and three dimensional antiferromagnets. In particular we shed new light on the anomalous intermediate temperature regime of the S=1/2 triangular lattice model and reproduce the DSF measured recently for a S=1 pyrochlore material.</description>
