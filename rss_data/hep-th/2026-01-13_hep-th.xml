      <title>$T\bar T$ Deformations through BRST Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $T\bar T$ deformation using its formulation as a CFT coupled to two-dimensional dynamical gravity. Working within the BRST formalism, we apply the intertwiner construction of arXiv:2411.08865 to obtain a unitary "dressing" map between undeformed CFT operators and elements of the BRST cohomology of the deformed theory. We identify the resulting "dressed" operators corresponding to CFT primaries as the physical observables of the deformed theory and show that they arise from a field-dependent change of coordinates, in agreement with what is expected for the $T\bar T$ deformation. We then give a non-perturbative definition of deformed correlation functions as BRST-invariant expectation values of dressed operators in the gauge theory. Finally, we verify that our construction reproduces known structural and perturbative results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize bosonic string theory with ensembles of infinite width neural networks. The string tension is tuned by the variance of the output weights. The construction provides a new computation of the foundational Virasoro-Shapiro and Veneziano amplitudes as neural network correlators.</description>

      <title>Holographic Krylov complexity for Yang-Baxter deformed supergravity backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the holographic Krylov complexity for a class of strongly coupled QFTs in a top down approach, where the dual gravitational counterpart corresponds to Yang-Baxter (YB) deformed supergravity solutions in a type IIB set up. The full 10d solution contains the $AdS_n (n=2,3)$ as the subspace, along with the dilaton and the background RR and NS fluxes. The Krylov complexity in the dual operator picture is obtained by computing the proper momentum of the massive particle along its geodesic in the bulk spacetime. We explore the effects of YB deformation on the bulk momentum of the particle, which in turn affects the rate of growth of complexity in the dual QFTs. Our results boil down into the undeformed case in the appropriate limit of the YB parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes, based on the course given at IPhT in November/December 2023, provide a pedagogical introduction to the study of strings in AdS$_3$ backgrounds supported by NSNS flux from the worldsheet perspective, including a number of updates incorporating recent results. We attempt to give a self-contained overview of the state-of-the-art understanding of this topic, describing key aspects of its 25-year-long rich history alongside some important recent developments, with an emphasis on the computation of worldsheet correlation functions involving spectrally flowed insertions.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Evaporation and Absorption Cross-Section of Near-Extremal Rotating Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Hawking evaporation history of low-temperature rotating black holes by taking into consideration the strong quantum fluctuations known to be present in the near-horizon, near-$\mathrm{AdS_2}$ throat region governed by an effective action that includes Schwarzian and two gauge modes. Imposing compatibility of this quantum framework with the semiclassical results creates a novel link between the particle angular momentum and the black hole electric charge before and after emission, leading to a nontrivial interplay between the superradiance effect and other channels. We evaluate single scalar (neutral and charged) emission of Kerr-Newman and single and di-particle emission of photons, gravitons and spinors in the Kerr spacetime. We uncover that quantum corrections may affect late time evaporation rates, which further slows down the whole evaporation process because of the near-balance between the $s$-wave channel and the superradiance channel. Specifically, we find energy decay of the form $E(t)\sim t^{-8/21}$ for scalar emission of a small, slowly rotating and charged black hole which differs from the analogous spherically symmetric quantum correction of $E(t)\sim t^{-2/5}$ already suppressed with respect to the semiclassical rate of $E(t)\sim t^{-1}$. We also discuss the quantum cross section for rotating black holes and point out various new features.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to Unitary Hamiltonians in Non-Unitary String-Net Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Levin-Wen string-net formalism provides a canonical mapping from spherical fusion categories to local Hamiltonians defining Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\text{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations.</description>

      <title>$E$ and $J$ type $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ disordered models and higher-spin symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the emergence of higher-spin structure in 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ disordered models. While previous studies focused on the $J$-type model where the $E$-term in the Fermi multiplet was discarded. We extend the discussion to $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ disordered models with $E$-type potential. In terms of (disordered) $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ Landau-Ginzburg theory, we establish a duality between two models. By solving the Schwinger-Dyson equations and the ladder kernel matrix for 4-point functions, we verify that the $E$-type model is dynamically equivalent to the $J$-type model in the IR regime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the $E$-type model also exhibits emergent higher-spin symmetry in certain limits. Our results reveal a larger region of the moduli space of 2D $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ disordered theories and provides insights into the holographic transition from finite to tensionless strings that can be diagnosed by the emergence of higher-spin symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider application of the analytic functional approach to the conformal field theories associated with mean field theory and Wilson-Fisher fixed point. We study the constraints imposed by the crossing symmetry on the coefficients of the operator product expansion. Making use of these constraints along with a few other additional inputs, we obtain expressions of the coefficients of the operator product expansion up to first order of $\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Classical Unattainability of Extremality in non-BPS D-brane Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the worldline theory of an extremal black hole, extremality amounts to vanishing ground state energy. In light of recent gravity results one would expect much like the ground state degeneracy this fine tuned condition too will not be met. It is unclear though whether this should be a quantum artefact or classical. In this paper we consider a non-BPS extremal four-charge Reissner Nordstrom black hole in N = 8 String theory. It is shown that the microscopic D-brane description fails to admit any extremal state, even classically. This positive energy is expected to destabilize the near horizon AdS2. The positive minimum energy is a direct consequence of the pattern of supersymmetry breaking by the D-branes. The black hole entropy is found to be the logarithm of the number of isolated minima and hence is related to the configurational entropy of the microscopic potential. We also find multiple continua of local minima corresponding to marginally bound states of the constituent D-branes.</description>

      <title>Boundary flow and geometric realization in holographic $T\bar T$-deformed BCFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $T\bar T$ deformation of boundary conformal field theories (BCFTs) from an intrinsic field-theoretic perspective. Formulating the deformation as a modification of the asymptotic variational principle in AdS$_3$, we obtain the exact quadratic trace relation for the stress tensor without introducing a finite radial cutoff, which we take as the fundamental definition of the deformed theory. When restricted to a BCFT without independent boundary degrees of freedom, the intrinsic $T\bar T$ deformation becomes genuinely boundary-localized. Imposing reflective boundary conditions collapses the bulk composite operator to a universal one-dimensional irrelevant flow governed entirely by the displacement operator. We integrate this flow in closed form and derive an induced boundary action, showing that the deformation reorganizes existing boundary data without introducing new boundary degrees of freedom. We further establish a precise equivalence between a fixed-boundary description and a moving-boundary description, interpreted as a reparametrization of the variational problem rather than physical boundary dynamics.
  On the holographic side, we analyze two inequivalent realizations in AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$, referred to as Type~A and Type~B. In Type~A, a rigid cutoff surface intersects the end-of-the-world brane at finite position, leading to an apparent boundary displacement. In Type~B, the cutoff surface is asymptotically AdS$_2$, so that the BCFT boundary is geometrically pinned and the displacement operator vanishes identically. Using entanglement entropy at zero and finite temperature, we disentangle universal consequences of the intrinsic boundary-localized flow from features that depend on the holographic implementation.</description>

      <title>IIB an equivariantly localized puncture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use equivariant localization to compute various observables for $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ preserving AdS$_3$ solutions in type IIB supergravity. Our method for localizing the odd-dimensional internal space is to perform a dimensional reduction along a shrinking circle which introduces a boundary in the remaining even-dimensional spacetime. Canonical even-dimensional localization can then be performed on this space after taking into account contributions from the boundary. We illustrate with a number of supersymmetric solutions. One of the novel aspects of this work is applying these techniques to study punctures and defects using localization. We obtain new results for the central charge of 2d SCFTs arising from compactifying $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM on a punctured Riemann surface.</description>

      <title>Quantization-scheme-Independent Energy and Its Implications for Holographic Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In holographic duality, the total energy of the dual field theory is obtained from the holographic renormalization, which depends not only on the bulk geometry but also on the choice of quantization schemes. We point out that the validity of several widely studied holographic inequalities -- including the AdS Penrose inequality, the late-time bound on entanglement entropy growth, and the growth-rate limits of CV and CA complexities -- depends on the choice of quantization schemes. Motivated by this issue, we introduce a modified total energy, which is still computed via holographic renormalization but the final value is independent of the choice of quantization schemes. We verify that this new ``total energy'' restores all these bounds to universal validity in the model of generalized free scalar field theory. Our results suggest that our modified total energy provides a more robust notion of energy when we talk about above inequalities in holographic settings.</description>

      <title>Refined Invariants and Quantum Curves from Supersymmetric Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an Aganagic-Vafa brane supported on a special Lagrangian submanifold $\mathcal{L}$ in a non-compact toric Calabi-Yau threefold $\mathcal{X}$. From the perspective of geometric engineering, the Aganagic-Vafa branes give rise to a special class of half-BPS codimension-two defects in 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric field theories in the presence of $\Omega$-background. We propose that the defect partition functions give generating functions of refined, non-negative, integral open BPS invariants of the pair $(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{L})$, across different K\"{a}hler moduli chambers they are expanded in. In the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit, the partition function provides a partially resummed solution to a $q$-difference equation that quantizes the mirror curve of $\mathcal{X}$ in an unambiguous fashion, in a polarization determined by the discrete labels of the Aganagic-Vafa brane. We demonstrate our method at examples of $\mathbb{C}^3$, resolved conifold, resolved $A_1$-singularity, local $F_0$, and local $F_1$.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-similar quasicrystals (like the famous Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings) are exceptional geometric structures in which long-range order, quasiperiodicity, non-crystallographic orientational symmetry, and discrete scale invariance are tightly interwoven in a beautiful way. In this paper, we show how such structures may be generalized from Euclidean space to Minkowski spacetime. We construct the first examples of such Lorentzian quasicrystals (the spacetime analogues of the Penrose or Ammann-Beenker tilings), and point out key novel features of these structures (compared to their Euclidean cousins). We end with some (speculative) ideas about how such spacetime quasicrystals might relate to reality. This includes an intriguing scenario in which our infinite $(3+1)$D universe is embedded (like one of our spacetime quasicrystal examples) in a particularly symmetric $(9+1)$D torus $T^{9,1}$ (which was previously found to yield the most symmetric toroidal compactification of the superstring). We suggest how this picture might help explain the mysterious seesaw relationship $M_{\rm Pl}M_{\rm vac}\approx M_{\rm EW}^{2}$ between the Planck, vacuum energy, and electroweak scales ($M_{\rm Pl}$, $M_{\rm vac}$, $M_{\rm EW}$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For generic theories of nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) we investigate the restrictions imposed by causality on spherically-symmetric charged black-hole solutions of the Einstein-NLED equations. For a large class of (acausal) Born-type NLED theories, we find that the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) metric is an exact, but unstable, solution for some dyonic black holes. For all causal NLED we show that there are no regular black holes, and that the entropy of extremal black holes is less than the RN entropy for fixed charge. We also find the conditions for a parameter-space transition between RN-type and Schwarzschild-type global structure. For the transition from Schwarzschild-type to naked singularity, which occurs at finite mass, we show that the metric at the transition point is a Barriola-Vilenkin global monopole.</description>

      <title>On Causality and Predictivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain approaches to quantum gravity, such as the one based on the concept of purely virtual particles (fakeons), sacrifice the cause-effect relation at very small scales to reconcile renormalizability with unitarity. Other developments have also urged caution regarding the idea of causality as a fundamental principle. In this paper, we examine the problem from multiple perspectives, including locality and predictivity, and extend the existing skepticism in several directions. Emphasizing the impact of unruly "disruptors", we point out that the illusory arrow of time associated with causality and predictivity is inherently statistical. This renders the cause-effect relation strained at the microscopic level. We also show that causation is a borderline concept that demands belief in entities which can act on nature without being part of it. Ultimately, not only is renouncing microcausality a reasonable price to pay for a consistent and predictive theory of quantum gravity (as is the one based on the fakeon idea), but the very notion of causality is misleading. Resting as it does on metaphysical assumptions, it should therefore be abandoned in fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Distribution Functions of Radially Excited Pion using the Light-Front Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the internal structure of the ground ($1S$) and the first two radially excited ($2S,3S$) states of the pion within the light-front quark model. The valence Fock sector is described using pure harmonic-oscillator eigenstates and mixed states formed as orthogonal linear combinations of these eigenfunctions. The optimal wavefunction parameters are determined through a variational procedure based on a QCD-motivated effective Hamiltonian. Using the resulting light-front wavefunctions, we study the pion distribution amplitude, parton distribution function, and electromagnetic form factor. After QCD evolution, the ground state distribution amplitude and parton distribution function are found to be in good agreement with available experimental data. At the model scale, the parton distribution functions of the $1S$ and $2S$ states show clear sensitivity to state mixing, while the distribution amplitudes and electromagnetic form factors are weakly sensitive. In contrast, for the $3S$ state, all three observables exhibit a pronounced sensitivity to mixing. The decay constants of the mixed states are also found to decrease sequentially with increasing radial excitation.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black holes in $f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature: horizon structure and extremality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of $f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature (i.e. constant scalar curvature) admits rotating and charged black hole solutions obtained from the Kerr-Newman-(A)dS metrics of general relativity through appropriate rescalings of the metric parameters. In this paper, we focus on the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter case and present a unified analytic treatment of the horizon structure and its physical properties, allowing for a transparent comparison between general relativity and $ f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature. We solve the quartic equation determining the horizon locations and derive closed analytic expressions for the horizon radii. Focusing on extremal configurations, we obtain analytic formulas for the squared rotation parameter $ a^2 $ and the inverse square of the curvature radius $ l^{-2} $ as functions of the horizon location and the electric charge. For generic values of these parameters, the extremality conditions are non-universal, reducing to the familiar Kerr-Newman bound only in the limit of vanishing background curvature. We identify an ultra-extremal configuration in which $ a^2 $ attains its maximal value at zero charge and decreases monotonically to zero as the charge approaches its limiting value, while $ l^{-2 }$ increases correspondingly. As an illustrative example, we show that black holes with charge $ q=M/2 $ necessarily possess a minimum rotation, which emerges naturally as an intersection point in our analytic description of $ a^2 $ and $ l^{-2 }$, when embedded in a universe characterized by a critical value of $ l^{-2} $ (equivalently, the scalar curvature or the cosmological constant). Finally, we demonstrate that when the mass satisfies $ M^2= (a^2+q^2)(1-a^2/l^2)$, the quartic horizon equation factorizes, leading in the extremal regime to a chiral-like horizon structure that allows only the outer-cosmological horizon merger.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a description of colour triplets of quarks by entangled Z3-graded Lee-Wick type fields, one with real mass and the two remaining ones with mutually conjugate complex masses. This is obtained by attributing colour degrees of freedom to six Pauli spinors, three endowed with colours and three with anti-colours, which are unitrd into one 12-component generalized "coloured Dirac spinor". The so entangled triplet of quark fields satisfies a generalized Dirac equation, with generalized 12x1\'e gamma-matrices acting on 12-component coloured spinors. The sixth order dispersion relations lead to solutions suitably vanishing in asymptotic region, exhibiting the well established confinement property of coloured quarks' degrees of freedom. We show how one can construct certain cubic combinations of those solutions in a way that cansels the damping factors, producing freely propagating functions.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian qLDPC: TQFT Formalism, Addressable Gauging Measurement and Application to Magic State Fountain on 2D Product Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental problem of fault-tolerant quantum computation with quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes is the tradeoff between connectivity and universality. It is widely believed that in order to perform native logical non-Clifford gates, one needs to resort to 3D product-code constructions. In this work, we extend Kitaev's framework of non-Abelian topological codes on manifolds to non-Abelian qLDPC codes (realized as Clifford-stabilizer codes) and the corresponding combinatorial topological quantum field theories (TQFT) defined on Poincar\'e CW complexes and certain types of general chain complexes. We also construct the spacetime path integrals as topological invariants on these complexes. Remarkably, we show that native non-Clifford logical gates can be realized using constant-rate 2D hypergraph-product codes and their Clifford-stabilizer variants. This is achieved by a spacetime path integral effectively implementing the addressable gauging measurement of a new type of 0-form subcomplex symmetries, which correspond to addressable transversal Clifford gates and become higher-form symmetries when lifted to higher-dimensional CW complexes or manifolds. Building on this structure, we apply the gauging protocol to the magic state fountain scheme for parallel preparation of $O(\sqrt{n})$ disjoint CZ magic states with code distance of $O(\sqrt{n})$, using a total number of $n$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Classical elliptic ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model: relation to Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostat and 1-site classical XYZ model with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a description of the classical elliptic ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model with 8 independent coupling constants through a pair of ${\rm BC}_1$ type classical Sklyanin algebras generated by the (classical) quadratic reflection equation with non-dynamical XYZ $r$-matrix. For this purpose, we consider the classical version of the $L$-operator for the Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model proposed by O. Chalykh. In ${\rm BC}_1$ case it is factorized to the product of two Lax matrices depending on 4 constants. Then we apply an IRF-Vertex type gauge transformation and obtain a product of the Lax matrices for the Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostats. Each of them is described by the ${\rm BC}_1$ version of the classical Sklyanin algebra. In particular case, when 4 pairs of constants coincide, the ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model exactly coincides with the relativistic Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostat. Explicit change of variables is obtained. We also consider another special case of the ${\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model with 7 independent constants. We show that it can be reproduced by considering the transfer matrix of the classical 1-site XYZ chain with boundaries. In the end of the paper, using another gauge transformation we represent the Chalykh's Lax matrix in a form depending on the Sklyanin's generators.</description>

      <title>Probing the microscopic origin of prompt and non-prompt $D^{0}$ production through event-shape engineering in proton-proton collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy-flavour hadrons are produced in the early stages of ultra-relativistic collisions at the LHC via hard partonic interactions and experience the whole system evolution. The study of prompt and non-prompt $D^{0}$ mesons provides an independent avenue to test the theories of quantum chromodynamics and to investigate beauty hadron production. Moreover, the production of both prompt and non-prompt $D^{0}$ is influenced by microscopic processes such as multi-partonic interactions (MPI) and hadronisation through fragmentation. In this study, an attempt is made to understand the production of prompt and non-prompt $D^{0}$ mesons in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV using the PYTHIA8 event generator, which offers a qualitative description of charm production. The role of the transverse momentum transfer in the hardest partonic scattering ($\hat{p}_{\rm T}$), MPI, and color reconnection is systematically explored. In addition, the charged particle production in different topological regions with respect to the leading $D^{0}$ meson is studied to assess the influence of the $D^{0}$ meson on the event topology and to examine the selection biases arising from the use of charged particle multiplicity as an event classifier.</description>

      <title>Boundary-only weak deflection angles from isothermal optical geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a boundary only method for computing weak gravitational deflection angles at finite source and receiver distances within the Gauss-Bonnet theorem formulation of optical geometry. Exploiting the fact that the relevant equatorial optical manifold is two dimensional, we introduce isothermal (conformal) coordinates in which the optical metric is locally conformal to a flat reference metric and the Gaussian curvature reduces to a Laplacian of the conformal factor. Such an identity converts the curvature area term in the Gauss-Bonnet theorem into a pure boundary contribution via Green/Stokes-type relations, yielding a deflection formula that depends only on boundary data and controlled closure terms. The residual normalization freedom of the isothermal radius is isolated as an additive freedom in the conformal factor and is shown to leave physical observables invariant, eliminating the need for orbit dependent calibration prescriptions. We explicitly implement the boundary only formalism in weak deflection, where the leading bending reduces to elementary one-dimensional integrals evaluated on a flat reference ray in the conformal plane, with finite distance dependence entering solely through endpoint data. We validate the construction by reproducing finite distance weak deflection for Schwarzschild, deriving the leading finite distance charge correction for Reissner-Nordstr\"om, and applying the same boundary only framework to the Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) geometry as a representative non-asymptotically flat test case, recovering the standard finite distance expansion including the explicit $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda)$ and mixed $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda M)$ contributions to the total deflection angle.</description>

      <title>Note on the matter coupling in Exotic General Massive 3D Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, within exterior algebra formalism, we revisit and study the matter coupling in Exotic General Massive 3D Gravity (EGMG), previously introduced in \cite{ozkan_1}. Considering that the matter Lagrangian is both metric co-frame and connection dependent in general, we explicitly construct associated source 2-form by algebraically solving auxiliary 1-form fields in terms of gravitational field variables, energy-momentum and hyper-momentum 2-forms. It is seen that that the source 2-form involves terms that are quadratic in energy-momentum and hyper-momentum 2-forms as well as terms that depend on covariant derivatives of them. In addition, we derive the consistency relation in order that matter-coupled EGMG field equation be third-way consistent. In general, the consistency requires a particular relation that should be satisfied by energy-momentum and hyper-momentum 2-forms. We note that our construction and formalism allows to investigate non-minimal matter couplings with gravitational fields. It also enables to construct the higher order curvature extensions of EGMG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study rescaled effective single scalar field theories, and we confront these with the ACT constraint on the spectral index of the scalar primordial perturbations and the updated BICEP/Planck constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Rescaled scalar theories of gravity may be the result of an effective $f(R,\phi)$ gravity at strong curvature regimes, which may result on a rescaling of the Einstein-Hilbert term of the form $\sim \alpha R$. It turns out that canonical scalar field theories with stronger gravity compared to standard Einstein-Hilbert gravity can be compatible with the ACT and updated Planck/BICEP constraints, with stronger gravity meaning that the rescaling parameter $\alpha$ takes values smaller than unity.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory Freeze from Inertial Holographic Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalized holographic dark energy model in which the infrared cutoff depends on the Hubble parameter and its first two time derivatives. The inclusion of the $\ddot H$ term introduces a finite relaxation timescale for the horizon degrees of freedom, which can be interpreted as an effective entropic inertia of the holographic vacuum energy. The resulting background dynamics admit late--time solutions in which the cosmic expansion gradually halts.
  In the underdamped regime, the Hubble parameter undergoes exponentially damped oscillations and asymptotically approaches $H\to0$. The scale factor grows monotonically but by a finite amount, while curvature invariants decay exponentially, leading to an asymptotically Minkowski spacetime without future singularities. We confront the full nonlinear background evolution with cosmic chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter and find good agreement with current late--time expansion data, with a reduced chi--squared $\chi^2/\nu\simeq0.52$. At observable redshifts, oscillatory features are strongly suppressed and remain consistent with existing constraints.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-violating modifications to particle dynamics, thermodynamics and vacuum energy in bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking in bumblebee gravity modifies particle dynamics, thermodynamics, and vacuum energy around a static black hole background. Starting from the optical-mechanical correspondence, we derive a modified dispersion relation that encodes the influence of the Lorentz-violating parameter $\lambda$ on the propagation of massive and massless modes. We analyze the resulting optical properties, including the effective refractive index, group velocity, and energy-dependent time delay, and show how the non-asymptotically flat geometry reshapes signal propagation. From the same dispersion relation, we construct the interparticle potential for massive and massless excitations and evaluate the electron scattering cross section within the Born approximation, identifying characteristic Lorentz-violating corrections. We then develop a statistical-ensemble description based on the deformed energy-momentum relation and obtain analytic expressions for the thermodynamic observables of a massless bosonic gas. The pressure, mean energy, entropy, and heat capacity are examined in three representative regimes--extremely close to the horizon, near the photon sphere, and in the asymptotic region -- where Lorentz violation systematically increase the magnitude of these quantities and leads to finite asymptotic plateaus. Finally, we analyze the vacuum state in the curved background and compute the regularized Casimir energy at zero and finite temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum structure of spacetime at fundamental scales via a novel, Lorentz-invariant noncommutative coordinate framework. Building on insights from noncommutative geometry, spectral theory, and algebraic quantum field theory, we systematically construct a quantum spacetime algebra whose geometric and causal properties are derived from first principles. Using the Weyl algebra formalism and the Gelfand--Naimark--Segal (GNS) construction, we rigorously define operator-valued coordinates that respect Lorentz symmetry and encode quantum gravitational effects through nontrivial commutation relations. We show how the emergent quantum spacetime exhibits minimal length effects, which deliver both classical Minkowski distances and quantum corrections proportional to the Planck length squared. Furthermore, we establish that noncommutativity respects a fuzzy form of causality, where the quantum causal structure gives back the light cone in the classical limit, vanishing for spacelike separations and encoding a time orientation for timelike intervals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data reveal deviations from $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, conventionally attributed to dynamical dark energy (DE). We demonstrate that these deviations are equally, if not better, explained by interactions between dark matter and dark energy (IDE), without requiring a time-varying DE equation of state. Using a unified framework, we analyze two IDE models--coupled quintessence and coupled fluid--against the latest CMB (Planck, ACT, SPT), DESI BAO, and SN (including DES-Dovekie recalibrated) data. Both IDE scenarios show robust evidence for non-vanishing interactions at the 3-5$\sigma$ level, with marginalized constraints significantly deviating from the $\Lambda$CDM limit. This preference persists even under DES-Dovekie SN recalibration, which weakens dynamical DE evidence. Crucially, for the same number of free parameters, IDE models provide fits to low- and high-redshift data that match or exceed the performance of the CPL dynamical DE parametrization. Our results establish IDE as a physically motivated alternative to dynamical DE, highlighting the necessity of future cosmological perturbation measurements (e.g., weak lensing, galaxy clustering) to distinguish between these paradigms.</description>

Abstract: Using the ADM formalism, we demonstrate that the Hamiltonian formulation of Quantum Gravity is exactly in the form of a worldline (WL) formalism in the superspace. We then show that the Keldysh partition function reduces to the partition function of Euclidean 3D gravity. After discussing the meaning of the time parameter, we show that in the gauge fields formalism, our Keldysh partition function reduces to a generating functional of a 2D Conformal Field Theory (CFT). This functional exhibits a minimal time-lapse proportional to the square root of the cosmological constant. From the viewpoint of the Chern-Simons/Liouville correspondence, we calculate the exchange of virtual gravitons between two massive probes from the cosmological boundary.</description>

      <title>Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations with a $\xi R \phi^4$ non-minimal coupling term</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In scenarios where the Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaks after inflation, small-scale axion inhomogeneities may gravitationally collapse into bound structures. The evolution of these systems is typically modeled through cosmological perturbation theory applied to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations. In the non-relativistic regime, this framework reduces to the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson or Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations, depending on whether axion self-interactions are taken into account. In this work, a non-minimal gravitational coupling term $\xi R \phi^4$ is included into the axion's relativistic action as a way to introduce a gravitationally mediated pairwise interaction. By performing a perturbative expansion and subsequently taking the non-relativistic limit, an alternative set of equations that govern the early stages of structure formation is obtained.</description>

      <title>Quantum model for black holes and clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a stationary quantum system consisting of two non-interacting yet entangled subsystems, $\Xi$ and $\Gamma$. We identify a quantum theory characterizing $\Xi$ such that, in the quantum-to-classical crossover of the composite system, $\Gamma$ behaves as a test particle within the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild Black Hole (SBH) near its event horizon. We then show that this same quantum theory naturally provides a representation of $\Xi$ in terms of bosonic modes, whose features match those of the Hawking radiation; this facilitates the establishment of precise relations between the phenomenological parameters of the SBH and the microscopic details of the quantum model for $\Xi$. Finally, we recognize that the conditions used to characterize $\Gamma$ and $\Xi$ coincide with those required by the Page and Wootters mechanism for identifying an evolving system and an associated clock. This leads us to discuss how the quantum model for $\Xi$ endows the SBH with all the characteristics of a "perfect" clock.</description>

      <title>Dynamical gluon effects in twist-3 generalized parton distributions of the proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the Basis Light-Front Quantization framework, we systematically investigate the subleading-twist (twist-3) generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the proton's valence quarks beyond the Wandzura--Wilczek (WW) approximation. The twist-3 GPDs are not independent; through the equations of motion they decompose into a non-genuine contribution and a genuine twist-3 term. The latter encodes quark--quark--gluon correlations and involves interference between the light-front Fock sectors |qqq&gt; and |qqqg&gt;, which are typically neglected in the WW approximation. Using light-front wave functions obtained from diagonalizing the proton light-front Hamiltonian for its |qqq&gt; and |qqqg&gt; Fock components, we compute these GPDs via their overlap representations. To further explore their physical implications, we also evaluate several twist-3--related quantities, including the quark orbital angular momentum, the total quark spin contribution, and the quark spin--orbit correlation. Our results provide new nonperturbative input on higher-twist dynamics particularly multi-parton interference effects relevant for future measurements at the EicC and the EIC.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Pad\'e Predictions up to Six Loops in QCD and Eight Loops in $\lambda\phi^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the accuracy of our previous Asymptotic Pad\'e predictions of the five-loop QCD $\beta$-function and quark mass anomalous dimension in the light of subsequent exact results. We find the low-order coefficients in an expansion in powers of $N_F$ (the number of flavours) were correct to within $1\%$. Furthermore an examination of recent results in $\lambda\phi^4$ theory indicates that the Asymptotic Pad\'e methods deliver predictions which increase in accuracy with loop order. Encouraged by this, we present six-loop Asymptotic Pad\'e predictions for the QCD $\beta$-function and quark mass anomalous dimension, and also for the eight-loop $\beta$-function in $O(N)$ $\lambda\phi^4$ theory.</description>

      <title>Interface roughening in the 3-D Ising model with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfaces in three-dimensional many-body systems can exhibit rich phenomena beyond the corresponding bulk properties. In particular, they can fluctuate and give rise to massless low energy degrees of freedom even in the presence of a gapped bulk. In this work, we present the first tensor-network study of the paradigmatic interface roughening transition of the 3-D Ising model using highly asymmetric lattices that are infinite in the $(xy)$ direction and finite in $z$. By reducing the problem to an effective 2-D tensor network, we study how truncating the $z$ direction reshapes the physics of the interface. For a truncation based on open boundary conditions, we demonstrate that varying the interface width gives rise to either a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking transition (for odd $L_z$) or a smooth crossover(for even $L_z$). For antiperiodic boundary conditions, we obtain an effective $\mathbb{Z}_q$ clock model description with $q=2L_z$ that exhibits an intermediate Luttinger liquid phase with an emergent $\U(1)$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Axion misalignment as a synchronization phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a dynamical reinterpretation of axion misalignment as an emergent collective phenomenon. Drawing an explicit parallel between axion field dynamics and synchronization in coupled oscillator systems, we show that a macroscopic axion phase can arise dynamically from initially incoherent configurations through gradient-driven ordering in an expanding Universe. In this framework, the misalignment angle is not a fundamental initial condition but a collective variable that becomes well defined only once phase coherence develops. Using a simple lattice model, we illustrate how the collective phase is selected prior to the onset of axion oscillations, providing a dynamical basis for the standard misalignment picture. This perspective offers a new way of organizing axion initial-condition sensitivity, reframes anthropic small-angle arguments in terms of phase-ordering efficiency, and suggests a broader connection between fine-tuning and emergent collective dynamics in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Field Theory Equivalences as Spans of $L_\infty$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-classically equivalent field theories are related by a quasi-isomorphism between their underlying $L_\infty$-algebras, but such a quasi-isomorphism is not necessarily a homotopy transfer. We demonstrate that all quasi-isomorphisms can be lifted to spans of $L_\infty$-algebras in which the quasi-isomorphic $L_\infty$-algebras are obtained from a correspondence $L_\infty$-algebra by a homotopy transfer. Our construction is very useful: homotopy transfer is computationally tractable, and physically, it amounts to integrating out fields in a Feynman diagram expansion. Spans of $L_\infty$-algebras allow for a clean definition of quasi-isomorphisms of cyclic $L_\infty$-algebras. Furthermore, they appear naturally in many contexts within physics. As examples, we first consider scalar field theory with interaction vertices blown up in different ways. We then show that (non-Abelian) T-duality can be seen as a span of $L_\infty$-algebras, and we provide full details in the case of the principal chiral model. We also present the relevant span of $L_\infty$-algebras for the Penrose-Ward transform in the context of self-dual Yang-Mills theory and Bogomolny monopoles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum system that interacts with an environment generally undergoes nonunitary evolution described by a non-Markovian or Markovian master equation. In this paper, we construct the non-Markovian Redfield master equation for a quantum scalar field that interacts with a second field through a bilinear or nonlinear interaction on a Minkowski background. We use the resulting master equation to set up coupled differential equations that can be solved to obtain the equal-time two-point function of the system field. We show how the equations simplify under various approximations including the Markovian limit and argue that the Redfield equation-based solution provides a perturbative resummation to the standard second-order Dyson series result. For the bilinear interaction, we explicitly show that the Redfield solution is closer to the exact solution compared to the perturbation theory-based one. Further, the environment correlation function is oscillatory and nondecaying in this case, making the Markovian master equation a poor approximation. For the nonlinear interaction, on the other hand, the environment correlation function is sharply peaked and the Redfield solution matches that obtained using a Markovian master equation in the late-time limit.</description>

It extends previous analyses of this relationship in IIB string theory to other string theories and also to 11d M-theory, while also providing extensive detail on the relationship between perturbations of the 10d Kasner metric and the presence of radiation and matter backgrounds in the dimensionally reduced 4d kination theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the defect CFT associated with the half-BPS Wilson line in $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. Using a perturbative bootstrap approach, we derive new analytical results for multipoint correlators of protected defect operators at large $N$ and weak coupling. At next-to-next-to-leading order, we demonstrate that the simplest five- and six-point functions are fully determined by non-perturbative constraints -- which include superconformal symmetry, crossing symmetry, and the pinching of operators to lower-point functions -- as well as by a single integral, known as the train track integral. Additionally, we present new analytical results for the four-point functions $\langle 1122 \rangle$ and $\langle 1212 \rangle$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain logarithmic corrections to the black hole entropy. Motivated by our recent proposal concerning the nature of the degrees of freedom leading to the black hole entropy in terms of a Bose Einstein (BEC) condensate of gravitons, we study how to introduce logarithmic corrections. In fact we show that, after modifying the internal energy by means of simple by physically sound arguments dictated by ordinary quantum mechanics and possible non-commutative effects at Planckian scales, a logarithmic term does appear in the Bekenstein Hawking entropy law. We also obtain that the entropy $S_{BH}$ of a ball of Planckian areal radius is $2\pi K_B$, i.e. $S_{BH}(R=L_P)=2\pi K_B$. Our approach show that the possibility that the interior of a black hole is composed with a BEC of gravitons is a viable physically motivated possibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement islands are subregions in a gravitational universe whose information is fully encoded in a disconnected non-gravitational system away from it. In the context of the black hole information paradox, entanglement islands state that the information about the black hole interior is encoded in the early-time Hawking radiation. Nevertheless, it was unclear how this seemingly nonlocal information encoding emerges from a manifestly local theory. In this paper, we provide an answer to this question by uncovering the mechanism behind this information encoding scheme. As we will see, the early understanding that graviton is massive in island models plays an essential role in this mechanism. As an example, we will discuss how this mechanism works in detail in the Karch-Randall braneworld. This study also suggests the potential importance of this mechanism to the ER=EPR conjecture.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we will continue our analysis of some general probe M5 brane solutions from our previous work in $AdS_7 \times S^4$ spacetime (appeared in arxiv:2109.08551). These are codimension-2 in $AdS_7$ and preserve at least 2 supercharges when the worldvolume 3-form flux field strength is zero. We will turn on the field strength and find that the embedding conditions are modified, excluding certain branes contained in the previous result. The new main result here is very general, so we pick simpler embedding conditions that describe highly symmetric examples that preserve half of the supersymmetry of the 11 dimensions. When the flux field is zero, worldvolumes have $AdS_5 \times S^1$ topology. We turn the flux field value non-zero in these examples and analyze how the shape of the worldvolume deforms as supersymmetry is broken by some additional fractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23720v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present generic expressions for the integrands of canonical bases under maximal cut in elliptic Feynman integral families with multiple kinematic scales. Such integrals frequently arise in phenomenologically relevant scattering processes. The derivation of our results starts from the Legendre normal form of elliptic curves, where the geometric properties of the curves are simple and explicit, and further kinematic singularities are presented as marked points. The simplicity of the normal form allows a straightforward construction of canonical bases with an arbitrary number of marked points. They can then be mapped into any univariate elliptic integral families via an appropriate M\"obius transformation, leading to universal expressions for the integrands. As a demonstration, we discuss the application of our method to several concrete examples, including two new integral families whose canonical bases were not available in the literature. In several examples, we derive canonical bases for the full integral families without any cuts, demonstrating the simplicity of the sub-sector dependence of our canonical bases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate the finite-temperature perturbation theory of interacting scalar fields under external rotation. Because of the translational non-invariance in the radial direction, Green's functions are described using the Fourier-Bessel basis, instead of the conventional Fourier basis. We derive the leading-order correction to the partition function and the one-loop self-energy. The Feynman rules obtained in our perturbation theory shows that due to the finite-size effect required by the causality constraint, the zero-temperature thermodynamics in the perturbation theory is unaffected by rotation, similarly to that in the noninteracting theory.</description>

      <title>The Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-quantum electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lee-Wick pseudo-quantum electrodynamics in the presence of a Chern-Simons term is studied in this paper. The paper starts with a non-local lagrangian density that sets the pseudo-Lee-Wick electrodynamics defined on a $1+2$ space-time added to a non-local Chern-Simons topological term. Thus, we obtain the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics as a most complete gauge invariant model that provides a light mass associated with the Chern-Simons parameter, and also includes a Lee-Wick heavy mass. We investigate classical aspects as the potential energy for the interaction of static charges through the gauge propagator. The causality of theory is discussed through the retarded Green function in the coordinate space. The gauge field of the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics is minimally coupled to the fermions sector that includes new degree of freedoms, as a Lee-Wick heavy fermion partner of the electron. The perturbative approach for the theory is presented via effective action in which we obtain the Ward identities. We study the quantum corrections at one loop, as the electron self-energy, the vacuum polarization, and the $3$-vertex. We show that the Lee-Wick mass has a fundamental role in these results, where it works like a natural regulator of the ultraviolet divergences. The $g-2$ factor for the electron is obtained as function of the LW mass, and of the CS parameter. Through the optical theorem, the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics is unitary at the tree level.</description>

      <title>Constrained Hamiltonian dynamics of 3D gravity coupled to topological matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Dirac Hamiltonian formalism for a pair of $1$-form fields with a topological-like potential coupled to first-order gravity in three-dimensional spacetime. By considering the complete phase space, we derive the full structure of the physical constraints, including both primary and secondary ones; analyze their consistency conditions; classify them into first- and second-class; and compute their Poisson-bracket algebra. Our analysis confirms the absence of local degrees of freedom, consistent with the topological nature of the model's action. Furthermore, we construct the canonical generator for gauge transformations and demonstrate that, through appropriate gauge parameter mappings, these transformations recover the full diffeomorphism and Poincar\'e symmetries of the Lagrangian formulation. Finally, we explicitly compute the Dirac brackets, establishing the symplectic structure of the reduced phase space.</description>

      <title>The Algebraic Structure Underlying Pole-Skipping Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The holographic Green's function becomes ambiguous, taking the indeterminate form `$0/0$', at an infinite set of special frequencies and momenta known as ``pole-skipping points''. In this work, we propose that these pole-skipping points can be used to reconstruct both the interior and exterior geometry of a static, planar-symmetric black hole in the bulk. The entire reconstruction procedure is fully analytical and only involves solving a system of linear equations. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various backgrounds, including the BTZ black hole, its $T\bar{T}$-deformed counterparts, as well as geometries with Lifshitz scaling and hyperscaling-violation. Within this framework, other geometric quantities, such as the vacuum Einstein equations, can also be reinterpreted directly in terms of pole-skipping data. Moreover, our approach reveals a hidden algebraic structure governing the pole-skipping points of Klein-Gordon equations of the form $(\nabla^{2} + V(r))\phi(r) = 0$: only a subset of these points is independent, while the remainder is constrained by an equal number of homogeneous polynomial identities in the pole-skipping momenta. These identities are universal, as confirmed by their validity across a broad class of bulk geometries with varying dimensionality, boundary asymptotics, and perturbation modes.</description>

      <title>Irrational CFTs from coupled anyon chains with non-invertible symmetries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Irrational CFTs in 1+1d with a discrete spectrum and no conserved currents other than the stress-tensor are expected to be generic, unsolvable by standard methods, and hard to construct explicitly. We introduce a lattice model that realizes a candidate for such a CFT as a conformal phase of matter without fine-tuning. The model is constructed by coupling $N\geq3$ golden anyon chains together, preserving $N$ copies of the Fibonacci non-invertible symmetry. We use the MPS/DMRG approach to study this model numerically, which allows us to calculate the corresponding conformal data, obtaining hints of its irrationality. Along the way, we characterize the phase diagram for $N=2$ coupled chains where we identify a weakly first-order phase transition as well as critical points that we are able to identify with known rational CFTs, except for one case. We also provide an extensive list of rational CFTs with $1&lt;c&lt;2.1$.</description>

      <title>GSO Defects: IIA/IIB Walls and the Surprisingly Stable $\mathrm{R}7$-Brane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently proposed Swampland Cobordism Conjecture predicts the existence of new non-supersymmetric objects which supplement the spectrum of low-energy gravitational effective field theories. In this paper, we study a subset of these defects related to the GSO projection on the string worldsheet. These include the predicted domain wall between Type IIA and IIB superstring theories and the newly-discovered $\mathrm{R}7$-brane. We study these defects in two different ways: via long-string probes and target-space effective field theory. We find that the $\mathrm{R}7$-brane can be identified with a collapsed cylindrical configuration of the IIA/IIB wall, and further, that the $\mathrm{R}7$-brane is stable, in contrast to previous expectations. Moreover, we argue that BPS D-branes pulled across the IIA/IIB wall become non-BPS D-branes, which we identify with fluxbrane configurations. We show that the non-BPS D-branes of either Type II theory are charged under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ remnant of the Ramond-Ramond potentials of the other, which we identify with the mod 2 reduction of the Ramond-Ramond fluxes. Similar considerations provide a complementary perspective on the Heterotic ${\mathfrak{so}(32)}$ S-duals of known non-BPS 7- and 8-branes in Type I string theory.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Normal Modes and Nonlinear Electrodynamics in Black Hole Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00404v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between thermodynamic phase transitions and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in charged black holes with a positive curvature constant, within the framework of $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity. Nonlinear electromagnetic fields lead to rich thermodynamic phase structures and significantly affect the QNMs of massless scalar fields. By analyzing the QNMs spectrum, we find that the transition point marking the disappearance of the divergence in the QNMs slope parameter $K$ aligns with the change of the thermodynamic phase structure described by the heat capacity, within the bounds of computational uncertainty. This precise matching holds under variations of the curvature parameter and charge. Furthermore, we show that larger angular quantum number $l$ diminishes this correspondence, while higher overtone number $n$ restores it beyond a threshold. These findings demonstrate that thermodynamic phase transitions of black holes carry embedded dynamical information, uncovering a fundamental link between black hole thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

      <title>Two types of boson stars in $U(1)$ gauged $3+1$-dimensional $O(3)$ sigma-model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate boson stars in an $O(3)$ scalar field theory with a symmetry-breaking potential. By constructing numerically spherically symmetric solutions, we demonstrate that the model gives rise to a rich set of field configurations. The negative coupling constant of the scalar self-interactions allows for two types of boson stars: Type I solutions represent the usual boson stars, that emerge from the vacuum as the boson frequency is decreased below the boson mass, whereas type II boson stars emerge from a set of static soliton solutions. Depending on the strengths of the gravitational and the electric coupling constants, both types or only one type is present. At a critical set of coupling constants, both types undergo a bifurcation. There the spirals of both types disconnect from their branches and reconnect with each other, while the remaining branches of both types also reconnect with each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a contour integral formalism for computing the K-theoretic equivariant 3-vertex. Within the Jeffrey--Kirwan (JK) residue framework, we show that, by an appropriate choice of the reference vector, both the equivariant Donaldson--Thomas (DT) and Pandharipande--Thomas (PT) 3-vertices can be extracted from the same integrand. We analyze three distinct limits of the PT 3-vertex, recovering the unrefined topological vertex, the refined topological vertex, and the Macdonald refined topological vertex. Higher-rank extensions of PT counting and the DT/PT correspondence are also explored. From a quantum algebraic perspective, we construct an operator version of the equivariant PT 3-vertex and term it the Pandharipande--Thomas $qq$-character. We then discuss its connection with the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the large $N$ limit of spectral duality between rational Gaudin models introduced by Adams, Harnad and Hurtubise. The limit of the ${\rm gl}_N$ model is performed by means of a noncommutative torus algebra represented by the fields on a torus with the Moyal-Weyl star product. We apply the approach developed by Hoppe, Olshanetsky and Theisen to the Gaudin-type models and describe the corresponding integrable field theory (2d hydrodynamics) on a torus. The dual model is the large $N$ limit of the ${\rm gl}_M$ Gaudin model with $N$ marked points written in the form of the Gaudin model with irregular singularities.</description>

      <title>Emergent higher-form symmetry from type IIB superstring theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a higher-form symmetry in type IIB superstring theory, which possesses an ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry. From the point of view of the low-energy effective field theory, the ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ symmetry is treated as a gauge symmetry. Hence, an $8$-form global symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_{12}^{[8]}$ emerges as a quantum symmetry. In this paper, we present an explicit construction of the topological operator associated with the $\mathbb{Z}_{12}^{[8]}$ symmetry. In this construction, the discriminant $\Delta(\tau)$ plays a central role. As a result, it becomes manifest that $\mathbb{Z}_{12}^{[8]}$ is the solitonic symmetry of $7$-branes. Furthermore, taking into account the extensions of the duality group, we also discuss what global symmetries emerge when considering not ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ but ${\rm Mp}(2,\mathbb{Z})$, ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$, and ${\rm Pin}^+({\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{Z}))={\rm GL}^+(2,\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

Abstract: We apply generative models to a key problem in the string compactification program, namely construction of type IIB string vacua. To this end, we make use of a Bayesian Flow Network, a generative model capable of handling discrete data, to generate flux vectors that give rise to type IIB vacua. Furthermore, we sample flux vacua that have certain desirable properties by employing a Transformer as a conditional generative model. Both models demonstrate good performance in finding flux vacua and thus prove to be powerful tools in the exploration of the string landscape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fate of global symmetries at the late-time boundary of de Sitter space. In anti-de Sitter space, bulk gauge symmetries generally correspond to conserved global currents on the boundary. We show that in de Sitter space such currents tend to acquire anomalous dimensions due to multiplet recombination with composite operators, which is a consequence of the shadow structure of the boundary operator spectrum. As a result, global symmetries are generically (weakly) broken. This mechanism is transparent in the EAdS reformulation of dS late-time correlators given in arXiv:2007.09993 and arXiv:2109.02725, where Dirichlet modes mix with composites and acquire small masses, while Neumann modes remain protected by gauge invariance. We demonstrate this mechanism explicitly in scalar QED, scalar minimally coupled to Gravity, Yang-Mills theory, and pure Einstein gravity, extracting the corresponding anomalous dimensions. We argue that it extends to higher-spin and partially massless fields.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the short-interval expansion of the subsystem fidelity in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2D CFTs) using the operator product expansion (OPE) of twist operators. We obtain universal contributions from general quasiprimary operators valid for arbitrary 2D CFTs, along with specific results in free massless boson and fermion theories. The analytical predictions demonstrate excellent agreement with established analytical results in field theories and numerical calculations in integrable models. Furthermore, we extend the method to holographic CFTs, where subsystem fidelity serves to analyze the distinguishability of black hole microstates through the AdS/CFT correspondence. This work establishes a unified framework for quantifying quantum state distinguishability across various 2D CFTs, bridging quantum information techniques with applications in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Infrared Quantum Electrodynamics and the Rayleigh-Jeans Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared quantum electrodynamics (IR-QED) acquires a natural geometric interpretation once soft photons are described as adiabatically transported electron-photon clouds. Within this framework, the relevant infrared structure is encoded in a functional Berry phase associated with the space of gauge connections, and the corresponding Berry corrections modify the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. The infrared scaling symmetry of the Rayleigh-Jeans law leads to a simple renormalization-group equation whose solution determines the frequency dependence of an effective factor $F_{\rm eff}(\omega)$ controlling the strength of the electron-photon cloud dressing. As a result, the energy density of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) receives a Berry-induced correction that scales as a power law and produces a frequency-dependent temperature excess in the radio domain. Although the exponent $\gamma$ governing this scaling behaviour is not fixed internally by the present formulation of IR-QED and must instead be determined phenomenologically, the existence and structure of the excess are genuine predictions of the theory. Remarkably, the resulting expression is extremely simple and naturally aligns with the deviations suggested by the ARCADE 2 data. Taken together, these results indicate that Berry phases in IR-QED may lead to observable consequences in the low-frequency tail of the CMB spectrum.</description>

      <title>Gauge theories from scattering amplitudes with minimal assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the emergence of a Yang-Mills symmetry in theories with massless spin 1 particles from fundamental physical properties of scattering amplitudes. In the standard proofs, some symmetry and reality properties of the coupling constants in three-point amplitudes are assumed. These properties cannot be justified using only three-point amplitudes but we show that they arise as consequences of the consistent factorization of four-particle amplitudes, for particular choices of the particle basis. This applies to self-interactions of massless spin 1 particles and also to their interactions with spin 0 and 1/2 particles. CP invariance is a derived property, not an additional assumption. The situation for gravity interactions is analogous and it is dealt with in the same fashion.</description>

      <title>2-loop free energy of M2 brane in AdS$_7 \times$ S$^4$ and surface defect anomaly in (2,0) theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS surface operator viewed as a conformal defect in rank $N$ 6d (2,0) theory is expected to have a holographic description in terms of a probe M2 brane wrapped on AdS$_3$ in the AdS$_7\times S^4$ M-theory background. The M2 brane has an effective tension T$_2= \frac{2}{ \pi} N$ so that the large tension expansion corresponds to the $1/N$ expansion. The value of the defect conformal anomaly coefficient in $SU(N)$ (2,0) theory was previously argued to be b$=12N- 9 - 3N^{-1}$. Semiclassically quantizing M2 brane it was found in arXiv:2004.04562 that the first two terms in b are indeed reproduced by the classical and 1-loop corrections to the M2 free energy. Here we address the question if the 2-loop term in the M2 brane free energy reproduces the $N^{-1}$ term in b. Despite the general non-renormalizability of the standard BST supermembrane brane action we find that, remarkably, the 2-loop correction to the free energy of the AdS$_3$ M2 brane in AdS$_7\times S^4$ is UV finite (modulo power divergences that can be removed by an analytic regularization). Moreover, the 2-loop correction vanishes in the dimensional and $\zeta$-function regularizations. This result appears to be in disagreement with the non-vanishing of the coefficient of the $N^{-1}$ term in the expected expression for the anomaly coefficient b. We discuss possible resolutions of this puzzle, including the one that the M2 brane probe computation may be capturing the surface defect anomaly in the $U(N)$ rather than the $SU(N)$ boundary 6d CFT.</description>

      <title>Energy Reflection and Transmission of Interfaces in $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal interfaces gluing a pair of two-dimensional conformal field theories enjoy a large degree of universality in terms of the coefficients of reflection and transmission of energy, that describe the scattering of conformal matter at the interface. In this article, we study these coefficients beyond conformality, by gluing a pair of $T\bar T$-deformed 2D CFTs across an interface, which requires the condition $c_L \mu_L = c_R \mu_R $ to be obeyed. We show that, at least when the interface admits a holographic description, the $T\bar T$ deformation of the CFTs can be extended to the interface. We propose a generalization of the linear matching condition in the universal sector of the undeformed ICFT to a non-linear one, which is captured by a universal antisymmetric \emph{transmission function} of the incoming fluxes. We employ the flow equations of the $T\bar T$-deformed CFTs to compute this function in two special classes of states, namely the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) and scattering state. We show that the results can also be reproduced using holographic techniques in the bulk dual of these states.</description>

      <title>From AdS correlators to Carrollian amplitudes with the scattering equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scattering equations relate massless scattering kinematics to marked points on a Riemann sphere, and underpin remarkable formulae for the full tree-level S-matrices of many interesting QFTs, including cubic biadjoint scalars, Yang-Mills theory and general relativity. The scattering equations arise from worldsheet correlators of ambitwistor string theories, which has enabled their generalisation to anti-de Sitter (AdS) space in certain cases. In this paper, we use the scattering equations and ambitwistor strings to prove the correspondence between an appropriate flat limit of boundary correlators in AdS and Carrollian scattering amplitudes -- massless amplitudes written in position space on the null conformal boundary -- for any number of external states and spacetime dimensions in tree-level, cubic scalar theories. We first derive the Carrollian version of the scattering equations in Minkowski space and their associated Carrollian amplitude formulae, by direct Fourier transform from momentum space and from ambitwistor strings with a Carrollian basis of vertex operators. We then take the flat limit of known formulae for all tree-level boundary correlators of cubic scalar theories in AdS, recovering the Carrollian amplitudes in flat space. In the special case of AdS$_3$, we also make some comments on the flat space limit of spinning boundary correlators.</description>

      <title>Wet Hair: Global Symmetries in Entanglement Islands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central conjecture in quantum gravity is the non-existence of global symmetries. As a fully unitary theory, there is no information loss in a UV complete quantum gravity theory. We see both these concepts reflected in the AdS/CFT correspondence, which tells us that dynamical processes in AdS are fully captured by a manifestly unitary CFT with no information loss. Furthermore, global symmetries of the CFT are dual to gauge symmetries in the AdS, which implies no global symmetry in the AdS. In this work, we provide concrete evidence for the connection between the non-existence of global symmetries and the absence of information loss in quantum gravity. We study the $\textit{island setups}$ in which a gravitational AdS is coupled with a nongravitational bath on its boundary. In such theories, the information in the AdS can be lost to the bath. We provide concrete examples with global symmetries in the island setup, from both the bottom-up and the top-down perspectives. We argue that these global symmetries are consistent due to $\textit{entanglement islands}$, in which holography is realized in a novel fashion. The global symmetries we construct are all mixed with spontaneously broken gauge symmetries. We will show that this fact has two implications: $\textbf{1)}$ The black hole hair is detectable in the bath (``wet hair"); $\textbf{2)}$ a resolution of a puzzle proposed by Harlow and Shaghoulian.</description>

Abstract: Does a conformal manifold imply the existence of exactly marginal operators? We answer this question affirmatively under the assumption that there exists a conformal interface with certain properties connecting nearby CFTs. We show that the exactly marginal operator that connects the CFTs can be reconstructed from the interface displacement operator. Our construction is model-independent and based on the general principles of conformal symmetry.</description>

      <title>On the gravitational partition function under volume constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Euclidean action serves as a bridge between gravitational thermodynamics and the partition function. In this work, we further examine the gravitational partition function under a fixed volume constraint, extending the fixed volume on-shell geometry in the massless case. Moving beyond this massless configuration, we construct solutions with nonzero mass functions, leading to a new class of volume-constrained Euclidean geometries (VCEGs). The VCEG contains both a boundary and a horizon, and its Euclidean action is determined solely by the contribution from the horizon. However, further investigation suggests that this boundary appears to be artificially constructed and can be extended, giving rise to the extended VCEGs. These geometries feature two horizons, each with a conical singularity, and their action is given by one-quarter of the sum of the areas of the two horizons. In general, the conical singularities on both horizons cannot be simultaneously removed, except at a critical mass $m = m^*$, which defines the critical extended VCEG. Configurations with conical singularities are interpreted as constrained gravitational instantons. An analysis of their contributions to the partition function and topology reveals a close analogy between the extended VCEGs and the Euclidean Schwarzschild-de Sitter static patch, suggesting that the volume constraint effectively plays a role akin to that of a cosmological constant in semiclassical quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Novel Phenomena in Noncommutative Field Theory: Emergent Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noncommutative field theory (NCFT) is an extension of quantum field theory (QFT) that redefines spacetime, replacing commuting coordinates with a noncommutative structure. This shift fundamentally alters the way fields, interactions, and symmetries are understood. NCFT uniquely integrates with supersymmetry, making it a natural framework for unifying quantum mechanics and gravity. It also provides a consistent mechanism for spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. Unlike conventional QFT, which quantizes fields on a fixed spacetime, NCFT begins by quantizing spacetime itself. This perspective reveals novel phenomena, such as ultraviolet-infrared mixing and a natural transition from discrete to continuous geometries. It offers insights into quantum gravity at the Planck scale. Mathematically, NCFT bridges quantum mechanics and geometry through operator algebras, enabling the exploration of new theories unattainable in traditional frameworks. This dual role cements NCFT as a cornerstone of modern theoretical physics.
  The presentation is comprehensive and pedagogical in nature, and may contain textual overlap with earlier preprints by the author; its aim is to provide a unified and hopefully more fundamental treatment connecting results and viewpoints not previously treated together.</description>

      <title>Virasoro Symmetry in Neural Network Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Network Field Theories (NN-FTs) can realize global conformal symmetries via embedding space architectures. These models describe Generalized Free Fields (GFFs) in the infinite width limit. However, they typically lack a local stress-energy tensor satisfying conformal Ward identities. This presents an obstruction to realizing infinite-dimensional, local conformal symmetry typifying 2d Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). We present the first construction of an NN-FT that encodes the full Virasoro symmetry of a 2d CFT. We formulate a neural free boson theory with a local stress tensor $T(z)$ by properly choosing the architecture and prior distribution of network parameters. We verify the analytical results through numerical simulation; computing the central charge and the scaling dimensions of vertex operators. We then construct an NN realization of a Majorana Fermion and an $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ scalar multiplet, which then enables an extension of the formalism to include super-Virasoro symmetry. Finally, we extend the framework by constructing boundary NN-FTs that preserve (super-)conformal symmetry via the method of images.</description>

Abstract: We show that every holographic entropy inequality can be recast in the form: "some entanglement wedges reach deeper in the bulk than some other entanglement wedges." When the inequality is saturated, the two sets of wedges reach equally deep. Because bulk depth geometrizes CFT scales, the inequalities enforce and protect the holographic Renormalization Group.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we scrutinize local gauge-invariant vector operators of dimension four in the adjoint $SU(2)$ Higgs model, which are candidates for interpolating fields of the fundamental excitations of the model due to the so-called FMS mechanism. We use the equations of motion and the properties of the BRST operator to derive a Ward identity that allows us to determine whether a given operator can propagate. To corroborate this analysis, we explicitly compute the two-point function of the non-propagating operator at the one-loop level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14811v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a fundamental relation between the structures of physical space and of quantum theory: the set of quantum correlations in a rotational prepare-and-measure scenario can be derived from covariance alone, without assuming quantum physics. To show this, we consider a semi-device-independent randomness generation scheme where one of two spatial rotations is performed on an otherwise uncharacterized preparation device, and one of two possible measurement outcomes is subsequently obtained. An upper bound on a theory-independent notion of spin is assumed for the transmitted physical system. It turns out that this determines the set of quantum correlations and the amount of certifiable randomness in this setup exactly. Interestingly, this yields the basis of a theory-independent protocol for the secure generation of random numbers. Our results support the conjecture that the symmetries of space and time determine at least part of the probabilistic structure of quantum theory.</description>

Abstract: The Weyl double copy builds the relation between gauge theory and gravity theory, especially the correspondence between gauge solutions and gravity solutions. In this paper, we obtain the slowly rotating charge solutions from Weyl double copy for the Kerr black hole with small Chern-Simons correction. Based on the Weyl double copy relation, for the Petrov type D solution, we find the additional correction to the electromagnetic field strength tensor of rotating charge. For the Petrov type I solution, we find that the additional electromagnetic field strength tensors have the exogenous properties, while the total sources vanish at the leading order.</description>

Abstract: We examine the two-party perfect quantum teleportation of an unknown 1-qubit state in the case of sharing various 3-qubit entangled states between a sender and a receiver: GHZ state, W state and W-like state. We give an impossibility proof that the W state cannot be used as the sharing state to realize the perfect quantum teleportation for transmitting an arbitrary 1-qubit state, in sharp contrast with the GHZ state which is well known to realize the perfect quantum transportation. Moreover, we give a procedure of obtaining a modified entangled state which we call the W-like state to achieve the perfect quantum transportation under a prescribed measurement basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a family of charged, traversable wormhole solutions in the presence of a cosmological constant. In de Sitter spacetime, two types of wormhole throats can exist--referred to as typical and cosmological throat--located at small and large radial values, respectively. In anti-de Sitter spacetime, the throat geometry allows for positive, zero, or negative curvature, enabling the possibility of an infinite throat area. We analyze the flare-out condition, a key requirement for the existence of traversable wormholes, which imposes constraints on the equation of state parameters governing the supporting matter. These solutions are shown to be of Petrov type D. Furthermore, we examine radial geodesics of null and timelike particles. In the de Sitter case, particles traverse the wormhole, passing from one throat to the other. In contrast, in the anti-de Sitter case, particles exhibit recurrent oscillatory motion between two asymptotic regions, cyclically disappearing and reappearing across the throats.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the symmetric mass generation (SMG) approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories, one attempts to use interactions to render mirror fermions massive without symmetry breaking, thus obtaining the desired chiral massless spectrum. If successful, the gauge field can be turned on, and thus a chiral gauge theory can be constructed in the phase in which SMG takes place. In this paper we argue that the zeros that often replace the mirror poles of fermion two-point functions in an SMG phase should be ``kinematical'' singularities. We conjecture that the SMG interactions generate opposite-chirality bound states, which combine with the gapped elementary mirror states to form massive Dirac fermions. The propagator zeros can then be avoided by choosing an appropriate set of interpolating fields that contains both elementary and composite fields. This allows us to apply general constraints on the existence of a chiral fermion spectrum which are valid in the presence of (non-gauge) interactions of arbitrary strength, including in any SMG phase. Using a suitably constructed one-particle lattice hamiltonian describing the fermion spectrum, we formulate a generalized no-go theorem which establishes the conditions for the applicability of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to this hamiltonian. If these conditions are satisfied, the massless fermion spectrum must be vector-like. We add some general observations on the strong coupling limit of SMG models. We also elaborate on the qualitative differences between four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories that limit the lessons that can be drawn from two-dimensional models. Finally, we compile a list of open questions which must be addressed in any SMG model in order to determine whether or not it is subject to the generalized no-go theorem.</description>

      <title>DSR-relativistic spacetime picture and the phenomenology of Planck-scale-modified time dilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most active area of research in quantum-gravity phenomenology investigates the possibility of Planck-scale-modified dispersion relations, focusing mainly on two alternative scenarios: the "LIV" scenario, characterized by a specific mechanism of breakdown of relativistic symmetries, and the "DSR" scenario, which preserves overall relativistic invariance but with deformed laws of relativistic transformation. Two recent studies of modified dispersion relations, one relying on Finsler geometry and one based on heuristic reasoning, raised the possibility of potentially observable effects for time dilation and argued that this might apply also to the LIV and DSR scenarios. We observe that the description of Lorentz transformations in the LIV scenario is such that time dilation cannot be modified. The DSR scenario allows for modifications of time dilation, and establishing their magnitude required us to obtain novel results on the effects of finite DSR boosts in the spacetime sector, with results showing in particular that the modification of time dilation is too small for experimental testing.</description>

      <title>Do mixed states exhibit deep thermalisation?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep thermalisation -- where ensembles of pure states on a local subsystem, conditioned on measurement outcomes on its complement, approach universal maximum-entropy ensembles -- represents a stronger form of ergodicity than conventional thermalisation. We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed initial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed states, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our formulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees of freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with the ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial state. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic, locally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain, which we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we find exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at finite times. Our results therefore lead to fundamental insights into how maximum entropy principles and deep thermalisation manifest themselves in unitary dynamics of states with finite entropy.</description>

      <title>Variations of the crossover and first-order phase transition curve in modeling the QCD equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice QCD calculations have shown that the transition from hadrons to quarks and gluons is a rapid crossover at $T = 155-160$ MeV at vanishing chemical potential. Many model calculations show that the transition is first-order at sufficiently high baryon chemical potential. It is then natural to expect the existence of a critical point where the crossover and first-order phase transition lines meet. We show how to embed a phase boundary that terminates at the critical point in a smooth background equation of state, using several different but closely related criteria, so as to yield the critical exponents and critical amplitude ratios expected of a transition in the 3D Ising and liquid-gas universality class. The crossover curves can be tuned to pass through experimental freeze-out data from heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC. The resulting equations of state can be used in hydrodynamic simulations of these collisions to probe the existence of a critical point and corresponding first-order phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a general version of the crystalline equivalence principle which gives an equivalence of categories between a category of TQFTs defined on a generic space with $G$-symmetry, and a category of TQFTs with internal symmetry. We give a definition and classification of anomalies associated to TQFTs in the presence of spatial symmetry, which we then generalize to a definition of an anomaly for a categorical symmetry.</description>

      <title>Scalable hybrid quantum Monte Carlo simulation of U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions on GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16298v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the QED$_3$. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.</description>

      <title>Stable black holes in lower dimensional $f(\mathbb{Q})$ non-metric gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16679v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate exact charged and uncharged black hole solutions in a (2+1)-dimensional spacetime within the framework of quadratic form of $f(\mathbb{Q})$ symmetric teleparallel gravity, where $\mathbb{Q}$ is the non-metricity scalar. By adopting spherical symmetry and considering both vanishing and non-vanishing electromagnetic fields, we derive new classes of black hole solutions and analyze their geometric and physical properties. The study demonstrates that the inclusion of quadratic corrections in the gravitational Lagrangian significantly modifies the structure of solutions, producing deviations from the standard BTZ geometry. Invariants such as curvature and non-metricity scalars are calculated to classify the singularity structure and spacetime behavior. Thermodynamic quantities, including Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity, are computed, showing consistency with the first law of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we examine the geodesic motion of test particles and derive the effective potential to explore the stability of photon orbits. A notable outcome is the identification of weaker black hole singularities in comparison to General Relativity, attributed to the non-metricity corrections. The possibility of multi-horizon configurations is also explored. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the gravitational, thermodynamic, and dynamical features of lower-dimensional black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity and highlights their distinct characteristics with respect to General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Fermi sea topology and boundary geometry for free particles in one- and two-dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free gasses of spinless fermions moving on a lattice-symmetric geometric background are considered. Their topological properties at zero temperature can be used to classify their Fermi seas and associated boundaries. The flat orbifolds ${\Rb}^{d}/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is the crystallographic group of symmetry in $d$-dimensional momentum space, are used to accomplish this task. Two topological classes exist for $d=1$: an interval, which is identified as a conductor, and a circumference, which corresponds to an insulator. The number of topological classes increases to 17 for $d=2$: 8 have the topology of a disk, that are generally recognized as conductors, and 4 correspond to a 2-sphere, matching insulators. Both sets eventually contain a finite number of conical singularities and reflection corners at the boundaries. The remaining cases in the listing relate to conductors (annulus, M\"obius strip) and insulators (2-torus, real projective plane, Klein bottle). Examples that fall under this list are given, along with physical interpretations of the singularities. It is anticipated that the findings of this classification will be robust under perturbative interactions due to its topological character.</description>

      <title>Overcharging Extremal Rotating Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we use the weak cosmic censorship conjecture(WCC) to constrain black hole solutions in modified gravity theories. While Wald showed that extremal Kerr-Newman black holes in general relativity cannot be overcharged by test charged particles, this protection may fail in theories beyond general relativity. We have considered generic rotating black hole solutions beyond the Kerr-Newman family and examined particle absorption processes that could lead to overcharging and the emergence of naked singularities. Identifying regions of parameter space where WCC is violated allows us to place direct, physically motivated bounds on deviations from general relativity.</description>

      <title>Unitary equivalence in Generalized Uncertainty Principle theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the issue of unitary equivalence within Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) theories in the one-dimensional case. For a deformed Heisenberg algebra, its representation in terms of Hilbert space and conjugate operators is not uniquely determined, raising the question of whether different realizations of the same algebra are equivalent and describe the same physics. After proposing a definition of a quantum GUP theory, we establish conditions for unitary equivalence. Using this framework, we rigorously prove that two commonly used representations are unitarily equivalent, specifying the conditions under which this equivalence holds. We demonstrate this equivalence explicitly by providing a unitary map and showing how both GUP formulations yield the same physical results in two examples: the quantum harmonic oscillator and a free-falling particle. Finally, we discuss a case in which equivalence fails, suggesting that a generalization of the Stone-von Neumann theorem may not be possible within the GUP framework under our definition of unitary equivalence.</description>

      <title>Velocity effects slightly mitigating the quantumness degradation of an Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the velocity effects on information degradation due to the Unruh effect in accelerated quantum systems (with finite interaction time). We consider a detector moving along a spatial trajectory within a two-dimensional plane. The quantum systems studied were: accelerated single-qubit, quantum interferometric circuit, and which-path distinguishability circuit. Thus, for non-relativistic velocity regime, we obtained analytical expressions such as transition rates, quantum coherence, visibility, distinguishability, and the complementarity relation. On the other hand, for the ultra-relativistic velocity regime, we saw that the Unruh effect is suppressed and therefore the detector does not respond in this case. Our findings revealed that velocity effects imply mitigation of information degradation, this interesting behaviors happen because of the composite effect of both velocity and acceleration. The results obtained show that the addition of the non-relativistic, transverse and constant motion of an accelerated detector can play a protective role in quantumness in systems at high accelerations, although the effects are very small.</description>

Abstract: We argue that a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory on a plaquette chain serves as a pseudo-one-dimensional toy model for Yang-Mills theory in three spatial dimensions. We map the chain Hamiltonian to the Transverse Field Ising Model in a uniform magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be tuned to a continuum limit in which the short-distance physics is governed by the asymptotically free Ising conformal field theory describing free Majorana fermions, while the long-distance regime contains massive excitations of the $E_8$ quantum field theory that can be interpreted as one-dimensional analogues of glueballs. Furthermore, we find $\sqrt{\sigma}/m_1 = 0.249(1)$ where $\sigma$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.</description>

      <title>A Circular Disformal Kerr Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kerr solution is the cornerstone of General Relativity (GR) for modelling astrophysical rotating black holes and for testing GR through gravitational-wave observations and black hole imaging. Understanding how the Kerr geometry is modified in alternative theories of gravity is therefore a crucial step toward constraining possible deviations from GR. Despite their importance, exact analytical solutions describing rotating black holes in modified gravity are rare, limiting our ability to explore novel phenomenology and to design robust observational tests of new physics. In this work, we present a new exact rotating black hole solution within a specific scalar-tensor theory belonging to the Horndeski class. The solution is obtained via a disformal transformation acting on a Kerr stealth black hole. Crucially, unlike previous constructions, the disformal transformation of our chosen seed configuration preserves circularity, ensuring that many of the geometrical and physical properties that make the Kerr spacetime so compelling are retained. We refer to the resulting geometry as the Circular Disformal Kerr solution. Remarkably, key features such as the structure of Killing horizons, the ergosphere, and the absence of causality violations closely mirror those of the Kerr metric. The spacetime is algebraically general, corresponding to Petrov type I. This new exact solution therefore provides a rare example of a rotating black hole beyond GR that closely mimics the Kerr geometry, offering a valuable theoretical laboratory to investigate the phenomenology of Kerr-like black holes in modified gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reheating is essential for transforming the cold, vacuum dominated Universe at the end of inflation into the hot thermal bath required by the Standard Model. In many well motivated inflationary models, however, the inflaton has no direct couplings to other fields, raising the question of how the Universe becomes repopulated with particles. We address this question within the framework of geometric reheating, where energy transfer occurs purely through gravitational effects. Focusing on a Higgs inflationary scenario with a non-minimal curvature coupling $\xi \phi^2 R$, we derive the post-inflationary dynamics and compute particle production using the Bogoliubov formalism. We show that the rapid, oscillatory evolution of the curvature scalar after inflaton acts as a time dependent gravitational pump, creating scalar spectator particles even in the absence of explicit interactions. This curvature driven production mechanism provides a natural and efficient route to reheating, demonstrating that gravity alone can initiate the standard thermal history and bridge inflation with radiation domination in minimal, coupling free models of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (deBroglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf{1}^2[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schr\"odinger, Pauli, and Dirac equations coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique.</description>
