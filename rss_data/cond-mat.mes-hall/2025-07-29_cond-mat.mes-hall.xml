      <title>Accelerating magnonic simulations with the pseudospectral Landau-Lifshitz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pseudospectral Landau-Lifshitz (PS-LL) model can describe atomic-scale magnetic exchange interactions within a continuum framework. This is achieved by employing a convolution kernel that models the nonlocal interaction in a grid-independent manner. Even though the PS-LL was originally introduced to address atomic exchange, any nonlocal kernel can be modeled. In the field of magnonics, the dipole field is fundamental to describe the dispersion relation of magnons, the quasiparticle representation of angular momentum. Because dipole-dipole interactions are long-range, numerical approaches typically rely on convolutions. Here, we demonstrate that the PS-LL model can be used to perform magnonic simulations with a single convolution kernel derived from analytical solutions. We demonstrate a twofold increase in computational speed compared with the full dipole calculation. This approach is valid insofar as the excitations are linear, which is typically the case for magnons. Our results have the potential to accelerate magnonic research, particularly for the inverse design method, where several simulations must be performed to achieve the desired outcome.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of current-induced switching in the quantum anomalous Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic topological insulators in the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) regime host chiral, dissipationless edge states whose propagation direction is determined by the internal magnetization. Under suitable conditions, a strong electrical bias can induce magnetization reversal, and thus flip the propagation direction. In this work, we perform time-resolved measurements to investigate the switching dynamics. Our results reveal characteristics consistent with a disordered magnetic landscape and demonstrate that the reversal process is thermally activated, driven by Joule heating during the current pulse. The understanding of the magnetization dynamics in QAH systems opens pathways for local, controlled manipulation of chiral edge states via thermal effects.</description>

      <title>Current-induced Magnetoexcitons in Mesoscopic Electron-hole Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A radical restructuring of the optical response of highly excited electron-hole plasma formed in a mesoscopic GaAs/AlGaAs channel in a quantizing magnetic field when an electric current flows in the channel has been discovered. In the absence of current, the emission spectra are caused by transitions between Landau levels formed in the conduction band and in the valence band of heavy holes. A critical electric current leads to a drastic change in the emission spectra with a predominant contribution from light holes. It is shown that the current causes local accumulation of light holes due to Coulomb drag, which leads to strong electron-hole coupling and, as a consequence, the formation of excitons and trions.</description>

      <title>Towards Environmentally Responsive Hypersound Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The engineering of acoustic phonons in the gigahertz (GHz) range holds significant potential for technological breakthroughs in areas such as data processing, sensing and quantum communication. Novel approaches for nanophononic resonators responsive to external stimuli provide additional control and functionality for these devices. Mesoporous thin films (MTFs) for example, featuring nanoscale ordered pores, support GHz-range acoustic resonances. These materials are sensitive to environmental changes, such as liquid and vapor infiltration, modifying their effective optical and elastic properties. Here, a SiO$_{2}$ MTF-based open-cavity nanoacoustic resonator is presented, in which the MTF forms the topmost layer and is exposed to the environment. Using a transient reflectivity setup, acoustic responses under varying humidity conditions are investigated. A pronounced shift in acoustic resonance frequency with changes in relative humidity is observed for the first time, demonstrating a simple way to tune hypersound confinement. In addition, resonators with varying pore sizes and thicknesses are compared, revealing that resonance frequencies are primarily influenced by material properties and film thickness, rather than pore size. The proposed open-cavity resonator design provides a versatile platform for future studies on the mechanical response of MTFs to liquid and vapor infiltration, opening the gate to environment-responsive hypersound devices.</description>

      <title>Excitation of vortex core gyration in nanopillars through driven Floquet magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of vortex states in confined geometries like thin-film disks are characterized by a sub-GHz gyration, representing the damped oscillatory motion of the vortex core about the disk center. It has recently been shown that interactions between the core and azimuthal spin waves, lying in the GHz range and driven by magnetic fields, can result in steady-state core gyration. The gyration in turn provides a time-periodic modulation for the spin waves, resulting in the emergence of Floquet states. Here, we present results of a theoretical and computational study in which we examine how Floquet modes sustain this core gyration. In particular, we find that multiple steady-state gyration radii are possible under certain field conditions, resulting from the nonlinear interactions between the core and Floquet modes. Different gyration radii result in distinct Floquet frequency comb spectra and allow for hysteretic effects, as reported in recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Spin-Type Photonic Topological Insulators on a Rhombic Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simplified model of a metallic spin-type photonic topological insulator on a rhombic lattice is presented and analyzed. Instead of the more commonly used hexagonal unit cells, a reduced symmetry rhombus is employed, which is both simpler and allows for easier integration into more traditional microwave systems. The non-trivial nature of the transport is shown via direct calculation of the structure's spin-projected Berry curvature and Wilson loop spectra, as well as by a systematic investigation of a reduced symmetry tight-binding model based off the Kane-Mele Hamiltonian. Device implementations are shown for a range of non-trivial configurations.</description>

      <title>Time-bin qubit architecture using quantum Hall edge channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the basic elements for a modular architecture for time-bin encoded qubits based on quantum Hall edge channels, forming the foundation of a scalable electronic quantum information platform named TEMPO (Time-binned Electronic Modular Platform for Qubits). Quantum states are encoded in temporally separated edge magnetoplasmon (EMP) wave packets propagating along a single chiral edge, eliminating the need for spatial path separation and enhancing coherence. The platform supports full qubit operations$\unicode{x2013}$including initialization, phase modulation, readout, and two-qubit entangling gates$\unicode{x2013}$by leveraging dynamically tunable quantum point contacts and electrostatic control of interferometric loops. We consider the linear dispersion and gate-induced velocity control on EMP propagation and describe strategies for maintaining waveform integrity. Various single-electron sources, including ohmic injection and capacitive excitation, are discussed in the context of coherence. Multi-qubit operations are enabled through synchronized injection and engineered Coulomb interactions between adjacent channels, while single-qubit readout is addressed via spin-based or capacitive charge sensors. Our approach integrates gate-tunable coherent control of chiral edge states, offering a comprehensive pathway toward scalable electron quantum optics in solid-state platforms.</description>

      <title>Electron transport through mesoscopic junctions revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical foundations of electron transport in mesoscopic systems, based on Landauer theory, Master equations or Onsager linear thermodynamics, are revisited to show that the noniteracting electrons model is insufficient to describe neither passive transport, nor generation of electromotive force (active transport). It is argued that 2-body electrostatic interactions creating double layers and surface charge distributions are crucial for the electron transport through a junction. Phenomenological modifications of the passive transport formulas based on the carefull analysis of the fundamental notions of chemical, electrostatic, electrochemical, build-in potentials, band bending and bias voltage, are proposed. On the other hand active transport can be generated by a self-oscillating double layer (a pump ) driven by an external heat, light or chemical energy source.</description>

      <title>Spectral shadows of a single GaAs quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots are a promising platform for generating single and entangled photons.Still, their use is limited even in the most advanced structures by changes in the charge state of the quantum dot and its environment. Here, we present detailed time-resolved resonance fluorescence measurements on a single charge-tunable GaAs quantum dot, shedding new light on the spectral shadows invoked by the complex impurity environment. Detuning-dependent measurements reveal the existence of multiple Stark-shifted resonances, which are associated with rare spectral jumps smaller than the homogeneous linewidth and, therefore, typically concealed in the measurement noise. We observe similar environmentally induced Stark shifts for both the neutral exciton and negatively charged trion transitions, while the positively and doubly negatively charged trions exhibit significant differences. Our investigation quantifies the underlying impurity charge dynamics over a range from well below milliseconds to seconds, revealing that the hole occupation of the positively charged trion transition is constrained by rapid hole loss and slow hole recapture dynamics. Utilizing a second non-resonant laser, we increase the hole occupancy by over an order of magnitude and identify both a prolonged hole residence time and an enhanced hole tunneling rate into the quantum dot. These findings are supported by complementary spin noise spectroscopy measurements, which offer a significantly higher bandwidth compared to the time-resolved resonance fluorescence measurements.</description>

      <title>Angle-dependent chiral tunneling in biased twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG), chiral tunneling can be tuned by parameters such as the twist angle, barrier height, and Fermi energy. This differs from the tunneling behavior observed in monolayer and Bernal bilayer graphene, where electrons either pass completely through or are fully blocked due to the Klein paradox. Here we investigate the effect of a perpendicular interlayer bias on electron tunneling through electrostatic barriers in TBLG. Using a dual-gated model, which controls the carrier density and interlayer potential difference independently, we compute the transmission and reflection probabilities of electrons at different angles and energies for representative twist angles of $\theta = 1.8^{\circ}$, $3.89^{\circ}$, and $9.43^{\circ}$. We find that a moderate bias suppresses normal-incidence transmission by opening a band gap in the low-energy spectrum. Our results show this leads to near-total reflection at low energy, with transmission starting to increase just above the gap due to twist-dependent conducting channels. The applied bias breaks the system's effective inversion symmetry, resulting in pronounced direction-dependent and valley-specific asymmetries in the angular distribution of transmitted electrons. We show that electrons incident at different angles show notable variations in transmission under bias. Furthermore, interlayer bias modulates Fabry--P\'{e}rot--like resonances in the TBLG barrier, shifting the energies of transmission peaks and altering their intensity.</description>

      <title>Characterizing local Majorana properties using Andreev states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose using Andreev bound states (ABS) as spectroscopic probes to characterize Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in quantum-dot based minimal Kitaev chains. Specifically, we show that tunneling conductance measurements with a superconducting probe hosting an ABS reveal four subgap peaks whose voltage positions and relative heights enable extraction of the MZM energy splitting and Bogoliubov-de Gennes coherence factors. This provides direct access to zero-splitting regimes and to the local Majorana polarization - a measure of the Majorana character. The method is compatible with existing experimental architectures and remains robust in extended chains.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast transition from coherent to incoherent polariton nonlinearities in a hybrid 1L-WS2/plasmon structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton polaritons based on atomically thin semiconductors are essential building blocks of quantum optoelectronic devices. Their properties are governed by an ultrafast and oscillatory energy transfer between their excitonic and photonic constituents, resulting in the formation of polaritonic quasiparticles with pronounced nonlinearities induced by the excitonic component. In metallic nanoresonators, dissipation phenomena limit the polariton lifetime to a few ten femtoseconds, so short that the role of these polaritons for the nonlinearities of such hybrids is yet unexplored. Here, we use ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) to uncover coherent polariton dynamics in a hybrid monolayer (1L) WS2/plasmonic nanostructure. With respect to an uncoupled WS2 flake, we observe an over 20-fold, polarization-dependent enhancement of the optical nonlinearity and a rapid evolution of the 2DES spectra within ~70 fs. We relate these dynamics to a transition from coherent polaritons to incoherent excitations, unravel the microscopic optical nonlinearities, and show the potential of coherent polaritons for ultrafast all-optical switching.</description>

      <title>hBN alignment orientation controls moir\'e strength in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene hosts a rich landscape of correlated symmetry-broken phases, driven by strong interactions from its flat band edges. Aligning to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) creates a moir\'e pattern, leading to recent observations of exotic ground states such as integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects. Here, we show that the moir\'e effects and resulting correlated phase diagrams are critically influenced by a previously underestimated structural choice: the hBN alignment orientation. This binary parameter distinguishes between configurations where the rhombohedral graphene and hBN lattices are aligned near 0{\deg} or 180{\deg}, a distinction that arises only because both materials break inversion symmetry. Although the two orientations produce the same moir\'e wavelength, we find their distinct local stacking configurations result in markedly different moir\'e potential strengths. Using low-temperature transport and scanning SQUID-on-tip magnetometry, we compare nearly identical devices that differ only in alignment orientation and observe sharply contrasting sequences of symmetry-broken states. Theoretical analysis reveals a simple mechanism based on lattice relaxation and the atomic-scale electronic structure of rhombohedral graphene, supported by detailed modeling. These findings establish hBN alignment orientation as a key control parameter in moir\'e-engineered graphene systems and provide a framework for interpreting both prior and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Tunneling Dynamics and Time Delay in Electron Transport through Time-Dependent Barriers with Finite-Bandwidth Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a transparent and analytically tractable approach to the problem of time-dependent electron transport through tunneling barriers. Using the Single-Electron Approach, we study a model system composed of a time-dependent tunneling barrier coupled to two reservoirs of finite bandwidth. Avoiding Floquet expansions, we derive simple expressions for the time-dependent tunneling current in both adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes. Our formulation, based on the tunneling Hamiltonian framework, relates barrier modulation to measurable phase shifts in the steady-state current, offering a physically intuitive definition of the tunneling (or traversal) time. Remarkably, in the Markovian limit (wide-band reservoirs), we recover the well-known result of vanishing tunneling time. In contrast, for finite-bandwidth leads, we predict a finite time delay given by the inverse bandwidth. Our findings provide a robust foundation for understanding tunneling dynamics in non-Markovian environments and may serve as a benchmark for experimental investigations involving tunable band structures.</description>

      <title>Flat-band projected versus fully atomistic twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We benchmark the recently proposed projection method [Phys. Rev. B 111, 205133 (2025)] for magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) across various symmetry-breaking phases at charge neutrality. The flat-band projected solutions agree well with the full tight-binding, with band structures and total energies differing by only a few meV. The projection to the flat bands is justified, owing to the increased gap to the remote bands in the normal state. Moreover, we employ a novel set of order parameters that allow us to visualize the wave functions locally in real space and quantify the breaking of various symmetries in the correlated phases. These order parameters are suitable to characterize MATBG and generic honeycomb systems.</description>

      <title>Cascade of Even-Denominator Fractional Quantum Hall States in Mixed-Stacked Multilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), particularly at half-filling of Landau levels, provides a unique window into topological phases hosting non-Abelian excitations. However, experimental platforms simultaneously offering large energy gaps, delicate tunability, and robust non-Abelian signatures remain scarce. Here, we report the observation of a cascade of even-denominator FQH states at filling factors ${\nu}$ = ${-5/2}$, ${-7/2}$, ${-9/2}$, ${-11/2}$, and ${-13/2}$, alongside numerous odd-denominator states in mixed-stacked pentalayer graphene, a previously unexplored system characterized by intertwined quadratic and cubic band dispersions. These even-denominator states, representing the highest filling half-filled states reported so far in the zeroth Landau level (ZLL), emerge from two distinct intra-ZLL and exhibit unprecedented displacement field tunability driven by LL crossings in the hybridized multiband structure. At half fillings, continuous quasiparticle phase transitions between paired FQH states, magnetic Bloch states, and composite Fermi liquids are clearly identified upon tuning external fields. Numerical calculations, revealing characteristic sixfold ground-state degeneracy and chiral graviton spectral analysis, suggest the observed even-denominator FQH states belong to the non-Abelian Moore-Read type. These results establish mixed-stacked multilayer graphene as a rich and versatile crystalline platform for exploring tunable correlated topological phases.</description>

      <title>Measuring coherence factors of states in superconductors through local current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherence factors of quasiparticles in a superconductor determine their properties, including transport and susceptibility to electric fields. In this work, we propose a way to infer the local coherence factors using local transport to normal leads. Our method is based on measuring the local current through a lead as the coupling to a second one is varied: the shape of the current is determined by the ratio between the local coherence factors, becoming independent of the coupling to the second lead in the presence of local electron-hole symmetry, {\it i.e.} coherence factors $|u|=|v|$. We apply our method to minimal Kitaev chains: arrays of quantum dots coupled via narrow superconducting segments. These chains feature Majorana-like quasiparticles (zero-energy states with $|u|=|v|$) at discrete points in parameter space. We demonstrate that the local current allows us to estimate the local Majorana polarization (MP)--a measurement of the local Majorana properties of the state. We derive an analytical expression for the MP in terms of local currents and benchmark it against numerical calculations for 2- and 3-sites chains that include a finite Zeeman field and electron-electron interactions. These results provide a way to quantitatively assess the quality of Majorana states in short Kitaev chains.</description>

      <title>Theory of off-diagonal disorder in multilayer topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multilayer topological insulators with random interlayer tunnelling, known as off-diagonal disorder. Within the Burkov-Balents model a single Hermitian defect creates a bound state whose energy crosses the middle of the gap in the trivial phase but never in the topological phase; a non-Hermitian defect splits this level yet preserves the same crossing rule, so the effect serves as a local marker of topology. However, the key distinction persists: the bound state crosses zero in the trivial phase but not in the topological phase. Two complementary diagrammatic approaches give matching densities of states for the normal, topological, Weyl and anomalous quantum Hall regimes. Off diagonal disorder inserts bulk states into the gap and can close it: the Weyl phase remains robust under strong disorder, whereas the anomalous quantum Hall phase survives only for weak fluctuations, and the added bulk states shrink the Hall plateau, clarifying experimental deviations. Finally, we analyse edge modes. Uniform disorder shortens their localization length slightly, while Gaussian and Lorentzian disorder enlarge it and in the Gaussian case can even delocalize the edges. Although chirality is maintained, the enhanced overlap permits tunnelling between opposite edges and pulls the longitudinal conductance away from its quantized value.</description>

      <title>Electric-field control of two-dimensional ferromagnetic properties by chiral ionic gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral molecular systems offer unique pathways to control spin and magnetism beyond conventional symmetry operations. Here, we demonstrate that chiral ionic liquids enable electric-field modulation of two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetism in FeSi(111) thin films via electric double-layer transistor (EDLT) gating. FeSi hosts chemically-stable, surface-confined ferromagnetism without bulk moments, making the interfacial spins highly responsive to chiral-ion adsorption. Using both achiral and chiral ionic liquids, we systematically compare electrochemical and electrostatic gating effects. While both gating modes modulate magnetic properties such as anomalous Hall conductivity and coercive field, only chiral ionic gating biases the ratio of up- and down-magnetized domains in a handedness-dependent manner, evidencing chirality-induced symmetry breaking. This work establishes chiral ion gating as a novel strategy for controlling magnetic order and opens new directions for chiral spintronics.</description>

      <title>Near-field focusing and amplification of tip-substrate radiative heat transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatially resolved near-field radiative heat transfer between a nanoscale probe and a substrate is studied in the fluctuational electrodynamics framework within the dipolar approximation. It is shown that the introduction of a thin polar film atop a non-dispersive substrate can lead to both an enhancement and a lateral focusing of the heat exchange. The influence of the probe--substrate separation, film thickness and substrate permittivity is analyzed, revealing that the effect originates from near-field interactions governed by the interplay between film-induced modifications of electromagnetic mode dispersion and the distance-dependent coupling strength. The results highlight a viable route toward the active control of local radiative heat transfer at the nanoscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay between strong correlations and Markovian dephasing, resulting from monitoring the charge or spin degrees of freedom of a quantum dot described by a dissipative Anderson impurity model. Using the Auxiliary master equation approach we compute the steady-state spectral function and occupation of the dot and discuss the role of dephasing on Kondo physics. Furthermore, we consider a two-lead setup which allows to compute the steady-state current and conductance. We show that the Kondo steady-state is robust to moderate charge dephasing but not to spin dephasing, which we interpret in terms of dephasing-induced heating of low-energy excitations. Finally, we show universal scaling collapse of the non-linear conductance with a dephasing-dependent Kondo scale.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Scaling Behaviors of the Green's Function in Critical Skin Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Green's functions in non-Hermitian systems exhibiting the critical non-Hermitian skin effect (critical NHSE) using a double-chain Hatano-Nelson model with inter-chain coupling $\Delta$. For $\Delta=0$, the system decouples into two independent chains, and the Green's functions follow predictable patterns based on the GBZ theory. For small $\Delta$ ($\Delta=1/10000$), in conventional regions with trivial OBC spectral winding numbers, inter-chain coupling induces a zigzag scaling structure in Green's functions due to competition between the two chains, explainable by first-order perturbation theory. In anomalous regions with non-trivial winding numbers, Green's functions match GBZ predictions in the bulk but diverge near boundaries, with residual contributions from the $\Delta=0$ GBZ accounting for the deviations. These results reveal the unique non-perturbative features of critical NHSE and highlight the limitations of GBZ theory in capturing finite-size and boundary effects, emphasizing the need to consider both bulk and boundary dynamics in such systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a Hall effect driven by effective gravitational fields arising from quantum geometry. We develop four mechanisms for this ''emergent-gravity Hall effect" : real-space gravity, momentum-space gravity, gravitional anomalous velocity, and gravitational Lorentz force which are described by the Christoffel symbols in real, momentum, and time spaces. We construct a unified theoretical framework to systematically investigate the effects of emergent gravity in these spaces on transport phenomena based on the semiclassical theory. We demonstrate these effects by model calculations and clarify the conditions under which a finite Hall response can arise. Our findings open a new avenue for exploring gravitational effects in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons-matter conformal field theory on fuzzy sphere: Confinement transition of Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories compose a large class of interacting conformal field theories in 3d, among which an outstanding category is critical Chern-Simons-matter theories. In this paper, we focus on one of the simplest instances: one complex critical scalar coupled to $\mathrm{U}(1)_2$ Chern-Simons gauge field. It is theoretically interesting as it is conjectured to exhibit dualities between four simple Lagrangian descriptions, but also practically important as it describes the transition between Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (or $\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin state) and trivially gapped phase. Using the fuzzy sphere regularisation, we realise this theory as a transition on the spherical lowest Landau level between a $\nu_f=2$ fermionic integer quantum Hall state and a $\nu_b=1/2$ bosonic fractional quantum Hall state. We show that this transition is continuous and has emergent conformal symmetry. By studying the operator spectrum, we show that there exists only one relevant singlet with scaling dimension $\Delta_S=1.52(18)$. We also discuss other higher operators and the consequences of our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shaping low-dimensional crystals into precise geometries with low disorder is an outstanding challenge. Here, we present a method to grow single crystals of arbitrary geometry within van der Waals (vdW) materials. By injecting molten material between atomically-flat vdW layers within an SiO2 mold, we produce ultraflat and thin crystals of bismuth, tin, and indium that are shaped as hallbars, rings, and nanowires. The crystals are grown fully encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride, a vdW material, providing protection from oxidation. Varying the depth of the mold allows us to control the crystal thickness from ten to a hundred nanometers. Structural measurements demonstrate large single-crystals encompassing the entire mold geometry, while transport measurements show reduced disorder scattering. This approach offers a means to produce complex single-crystal nanostructures without the disorder introduced by post-growth nanofabrication.</description>

Abstract: Recent work (Nathan et al, arXiv:2405.05671) proposed an architecture for a dissipatively stabilized GKP qubit, and protocols for protected Clifford gates. Here we propose a protocol for a protected non-Clifford $\sqrt{T}$ gate at the physical qubit level, based on the inclusion of a quartic flux potential generated by ancillary Josephson junctions. We show that such a gate is topologically robust with exponentially suppressed infidelity from control or device imperfections, and operates on microsecond timescales for GHz resonators. We analyze the resilience of the protocol to noise, imperfect control, and imperfect targeting of circuit parameters.</description>

      <title>Dielectric environment engineering via 2D material heterostructure formation on hybrid photonic crystal nanocavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid integration of two-dimensional (2D) materials with nanophotonic platforms has enabled compact optoelectronic devices by leveraging the unique optical and electronic properties of atomically thin layers. While most efforts have focused on coupling 2D materials to pre-defined photonic structures, the broader potential of 2D heterostructures for actively engineering the photonic environment remains largely unexplored. In our previous work, we employed single types of 2D material and showed that even monolayer flakes can locally induce high-$Q$ nanocavities in photonic crystal (PhC) waveguides through effective refractive index modulation. Here, we extend this concept by demonstrating that further transferring of 2D material flakes onto the induced hybrid nanocavity to form heterostructures enable more flexibility for post-fabrication dielectric environment engineering of the cavity. We show that the high-$Q$ hybrid nanocavities remain robust under sequential flake stacking. Coupling optically active MoTe$_{2}$ flake to these cavities yields enhanced photoluminescence and reduced emission lifetimes, consistent with Purcell-enhanced light-matter interactions. Additionally, encapsulation with a top hBN layer leads to a significant increase in the cavity $Q$ factor, in agreement with numerical simulations. Our results show that these heterostructure stacks not only preserve the cavity quality but also introduce an additional degrees of control -- via flake thickness, refractive indices, size and interface design -- offering a richer dielectric environment modulation landscape than what is achievable with monolayers alone, providing a versatile method toward scalable and reconfigurable hybrid nanophotonic systems.</description>

      <title>Unraveling a chemical-bond-driven root of topology in three-dimensional chiral crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality manifests across multiple scales, yielding unique phenomena that break mirror symmetry. In chiral materials, unexpectedly large spin-filtering or photogalvanic effects have been observed even in materials composed of light elements, implying crucial influence of their topological electronic states. However, an underlying framework that links chemical bonding and electronic topology remains elusive, preventing the rational design of quantum chiral properties. Here we identify the chiral bonding network responsible for multifold topological fermions by combining synchrotron X-ray diffraction and first-principles calculations on cubic chiral crystals, CoSi and FeSi. Based on the observations of asymmetric valence electron distributions around the transition metals, together with analyses of their bonding to sevenfold-coordinated silicon atoms, we develop a three-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, showing that inter-site hopping on this chiral network creates multifold fermions with doubled topological invariants. Topological features can be switched by reversing the crystalline chirality or tuning electron filling. Our results highlight that implementing strong spin-orbit coupling is not the sole route to realize robust topological phases at elevated temperatures and offer a practical design principle for exploiting chiral topology. Moreover, this real-space framework naturally extends to other elementary excitations or artificial metamaterials, enabling various quantum functionalities through an intuitive approach to chirality engineering.</description>

      <title>Finite-Size Effects in Quantum Metrology at Strong Coupling: Microscopic vs Phenomenological Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ultimate precision limits of a spin chain, strongly coupled to a heat bath, for measuring a general parameter and report the results for specific cases of magnetometry and thermometry. Employing a full polaron transform, we derive the effective Hamiltonian and obtain analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of equilibrium states in both weak coupling (WC) and strong coupling (SC) regimes for a general parameter, explicitly accounting for finite-size (FS) effects. Furthermore, we utilize Hill's nanothermodynamics to calculate an effective QFI expression at SC. Our results reveal a potential advantage of SC for thermometry at low temperatures and demonstrate enhanced magnetometric precision through control of the anisotropy parameter. Crucially, we show that neglecting FS effects leads to considerable errors in ultimate precision bounds for equilibrium thermometry. This work also highlights the inadequacy of phenomenological approaches in describing the metrological capability and thermodynamic behavior of systems at SC. Additionally, we demonstrate the effect of bath on system's phase transition at SC.</description>

      <title>Specifics of ITO properties deposited on cerium-doped glass for space-grade solar cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ce-doped glass is a well-established solution for ultraviolet and ionizing radiation shielding of solar cells in space. Traditionally, Ce-glass protected Si or III-V based devices as an overlaying cap. However, for emerging photovoltaics such as halide perovskites, thin Ce-glass coated with transparent conductive layers could serve as a lightweight carrier with an electrode. While indium-tin oxide (ITO) is widely used in solar cells for charge collection, its optical, structural, and electrical properties depend on the substrate quality. In this work, we demonstrated significant differences in properties of ITO deposited on Ce-glass (100 micron thick) compared to standard soda lime glass. ITO on Ce-glass exhibited pronounced compressive strain because of higher oxygen vacancy concentrations, reduced transparency and charge carrier concentration (10^19 cm-3) resulting from altered stoichiometry. Electrical analysis showed increased Hall mobility (66 cm2V-1s-1) but decreased conductivity due to excess tin incorporation. These specific ITO features originated from inelastic collisions with the substrate during deposition. Variations in wettability and surface potential underscore substrate-induced differences critical for developing optimized ITO coatings for space-grade photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>On-chip Single-crystal Plasmonic Optoelectronics for Efficient Hot Carrier Collection and Photovoltage Detection</title>

Abstract: Large-area chemically synthesized single-crystal metals with nanometer-scale thickness have emerged as promising materials for on-chip nanophotonic applications, owing to their superior plasmonic properties compared to nanofabricated polycrystalline counterparts. While much recent attention has focused on their optical properties, the combined optimal electrical and optical characteristics, which hold great potential for high-performance optoelectronic functionalities, remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a single-crystal plasmonic optoelectronic platform based on nanowires fabricated from synthesized gold flakes and demonstrate its capabilities for highly enhanced hot carrier collection, electroluminescence, and photovoltage detection. Notably, single-crystal gold nanogap devices exhibit an order of magnitude higher open-circuit photovoltage compared to polycrystalline devices, representing one of the highest reported photovoltage sensing performances in terms of on-chip device density and responsivity per area. Our analysis revealed that this enhancement is attributed mostly to the suppression of electron-phonon scattering and improved hot carrier tunneling efficiency in single-crystal devices. These results highlight the potential of large-scale single-crystal nanostructures for both fundamental studies of nanoscale hot carrier transport and scalable electrically driven nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Emission enhanced exciton-polariton condensates with optical feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical feedback is a well-known method of controlling laser dynamics, which has been widely studied in photonic systems to induce complex behaviors such as chaos or enhanced coherence. However, its application to systems in the strong light-matter coupling regime remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce a delayed optical feedback loop into a nonresonantly pumped polariton condensate. By feeding part of the emission back into the cavity to seed the next condensate, we observe a strong increase in the output intensity, up to 110%. We explain this effect using a classical rate equation model for the condensate coupled to excitonic reservoirs. Our results evidence that polariton condensates can respond strongly to optical feedback, congruent with well known polariton amplification techniques using resonant pump-probe setups. Our method opens new possibilities for using polariton feedback to connect multiple condensates and can be an essential step toward neuromorphic computing based on recurrent signaling in photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Imaging of Ferromagnetic van der Waals Magnetic Domain Structures at Ambient Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently discovered 2D van der Waals magnetic materials, and specifically Iron-Germanium-Telluride ($\rm Fe_{5}GeTe_{2}$), have attracted significant attention both from a fundamental perspective and for potential applications. Key open questions concern their domain structure and magnetic phase transition temperature as a function of sample thickness and external field, as well as implications for integration into devices such as magnetic memories and logic. Here we address key questions using a nitrogen-vacancy center based quantum magnetic microscope, enabling direct imaging of the magnetization of $\rm Fe_{5}GeTe_{2}$ at sub-micron spatial resolution as a function of temperature, magnetic field, and thickness. We employ spatially resolved measures, including magnetization variance and cross-correlation, and find a significant spread in transition temperature yet with no clear dependence on thickness down to 15 nm. We also identify previously unknown stripe features in the optical as well as magnetic images, which we attribute to modulations of the constituting elements during crystal synthesis and subsequent oxidation. Our results suggest that the magnetic anisotropy in this material does not play a crucial role in their magnetic properties, leading to a magnetic phase transition of $\rm Fe_{5}GeTe_{2}$ which is largely thickness-independent down to 15 nm. Our findings could be significant in designing future spintronic devices, magnetic memories and logic with 2D van der Waals magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Type-II Antiferroelectricity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferroelectricity (AFE) is a fundamental concept in physics and materials science. Conventional AFEs have the picture of alternating local electric dipoles defined in real space. Here, we discover a new class of AFEs, termed type-II AFEs, which possess opposite polarizations defined in momentum space across a pair of symmetry decoupled subspaces. Unlike conventional AFEs, the order parameter of type-II AFEs is rigorously formulated through Berry-phase theory and can be quantitatively extracted from the electronic band structure. Focusing on a subclass of type-II AFEs that preserve spin-rotation symmetry, we establish the relevant symmetry constraints and identify all compatible spin point groups. Remarkably, we find that type-II AFE order intrinsically coexists with antiferromagnetism, revealing a robust form of magnetoelectric coupling. We construct an altermagnetic model and identify several concrete antiferromagnetic/altermagnetic materials, such as FeS, Cr2O3, MgMnO3, monolayer MoICl2 and bilayer CrI3, that exhibit this novel ordering. Furthermore, we uncover unique physical phenomena associated with type-II spin-AFE systems, including spin current generation upon AFE switching and localized spin polarization at boundaries and domain walls. Our findings reveal a previously hidden class of quantum materials with intertwined ferroic orders, offering exciting opportunities for both fundamental exploration and technological applications.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Analysis of the Field-Free Josephson Diode Effect in a Multilayered Josephson Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect (JDE) is a novel phenomenon in which a superconducting junction exhibits asymmetric Josephson currents with respect to the superconducting phase difference. In this study, we theoretically investigate how the interplay between a static exchange field and Rashba spin-orbit interaction (RSOI) influences the JDE. By employing the quasiclassical Green's function method and perturbative calculations, we derive analytical expressions for the Josephson current in a junction composed of a ferromagnetic layer and a normal metal with RSOI. Remarkably, the JDE is found to emerge even in the absence of any external magnetic field. In this regime, the Josephson current is exclusively carried by spin-triplet Cooper pairs, as spin-singlet components are strongly suppressed by the ferromagnet. Furthermore, our results show that the efficiency of the JDE can be enhanced by tuning the thickness of the normal metal and the strength of the RSOI. These findings offer valuable theoretical guidelines for the design of superconducting devices exhibiting nonreciprocal transport effects.</description>

      <title>Localized Edge States in Stacked Al/Ni Multilayers: Possible Evidence of Chiral Hinge Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we report experimental evidence suggesting the emergence of robust, possibly chiral, edge states in artificially engineered multilayers composed of alternating nanometer-thick layers of nonmagnetic aluminum (Al) and ferromagnetic nickel (Ni). Using phase-sensitive Josephson interferometry, we observed distinct SQUID-like oscillations (instead of the conventional Fraunhofer patterns) in the maximum supercurrent versus in-plane probing magnetic field patterns, which can be associated with one-dimensional current-carrying modes localized at the sample boundaries. These results were obtained for multilayers consisting of up to ten Al/Ni bilayers sandwiched between superconducting Nb electrodes to form Josephson junctions. The spatially confined flow of supercurrent suggests the possible presence of chiral Andreev edge states reminiscent of those found in higher-order topological insulators, despite the absence of strong spin-orbit coupling or intrinsic topological band structure. The discovery of edge-localized charge transport in structures made of materials without intrinsic topological order challenges the prevailing understanding of topological phenomena and highlights the possibility of developing topological metamaterials as a tunable platform for exploring nontrivial edge physics.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Driven Moir\'e Potential Enhancement and Tertiary Gap Opening in Graphene/h-BN Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices enable engineering of correlated quantum states through tunable periodic potentials, where twist angle controls periodicity but dynamic potential strength modulation remains challenging. Here, we develop a high-pressure quantum transport technique for van der Waals heterostructures, achieving the ultimate pressure limit (~9 GPa) in encapsulated moir\'e devices. In aligned graphene/h-BN, we demonstrate that pressure induces a substantial enhancement of the moir\'e potential strength, evidenced by the suppression of the first valence bandwidth and the near-doubling of the primary band gap. Moreover, we report the first observation of a tertiary gap emerging above 6.4 GPa, verifying theoretical predictions. Our results establish hydrostatic pressure as a universal parameter to reshape moir\'e band structures. By enabling quantum transport studies at previously inaccessible pressure regimes, this Letter expands the accessible parameter space for exploring correlated phases in moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of Ill-Defined Domain of Definitions of the Parameter Operator on Berry Curvature and the Adiabatic Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analytical study that extends the conventional formulation of Berry curvature, highlighting its derivation in the context of problematic domains of definition of the operators. Our analysis reveals that handling these domains carefully can have a substantial impact on Berry curvature, demonstrating that even Hamiltonians without explicit parameter dependence may exhibit nonzero Berry curvature. This finding emphasizes that Berry curvature is intrinsically related to the eigenvectors rather than the Hamiltonian itself. Our approach utilizes the standard Bloch (k-space) framework for spatially periodic systems, illustrating these effects from first principles and discussing potential implications for solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Identification and Properties of Topological States in the Bulk of Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to the usual bulk-boundary correspondence, topological states localized within the bulk of the system have been numerically identified in quasicrystalline structures, termed bulk localized transport (BLT) states. These states exhibit properties different from edge states, one example being that the number of BLT states scales with system size, while the number of edge states scales with system perimeter. Here, we define an algorithm to identify BLT states, which is based on the physically motivated crosshair marker and robustness analyses. Applying the algorithm to the Hofstadter model on the Ammann-Beenker tiling, we find that the BLT states appear mainly for magnetic fluxes within a specific interval. While edge states appear at low densities of states, we find that BLT states can appear at many different densities of states. Many of the BLT states are found to have real-space localization that follows geometric patterns characteristic of the given quasicrystal. Furthermore, BLT states can appear both isolated and in groups within the energy spectrum which could imply greater robustness for the states within such groups. The spatial localization of the states within a certain group can change depending on the Fermi energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory is used to investigate the effect of biaxial strain on the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of [111]-oriented NdNiO$_3$, as a representative of the rare-earth perovskites that undergo metal-to-insulator transitions. We find that this constraint on the system induces unique structural phase transitions not previously observed under the well-studied bulk or [001]-oriented strained systems. We also report unique electronic behaviour, including amplification of the electronic band-gap with tensile strain, and insulating, charge-ordered phases with non-orthorhombic tilt patterns. To provide clarity to the trends we observe, we also investigate the coupling between the breathing mode and strain, where we observe certain strains to directly favour and disfavour the creation of the breathing mode (and thus the associated charge-ordering). The amplification of the band gap with strain is understood in terms of a cooperative coupling between the elastic constraint and octahedral breathing, which expands on the previously reported triggered mechanism mediated by octahedral tilting.</description>

Abstract: Levitated optomechanics, the interaction between light and small levitated objects, is a new macroscopic quantum system that is being used as a testing ground for fundamental physics and for the development of sensors with exquisite sensitivity. The utility of this system, when compared to other quantum optomechanical systems, is its extreme isolation from the environment and, by the relatively few degrees of freedom that a levitated object has. While work in the field has strongly focused on the three translational degrees of freedom of this system, it has become increasingly important to understand the induced rotational motion of levitated objects, particularly in optical trapping fields, but also in magnetic and electric traps. These additional three degrees of freedom, which are intrinsic to levitated systems, offer a new set of optomechanical nonlinear interactions that lead to a rich and yet largely unexplored roto-translational motion. The control and utilization of these interactions promise to extend the utility of levitated optomechanics in both fundamental studies and applications. In this review, we provide an overview of levitated optomechanics, before focusing on the roto-translational motion of optically levitated anisotropic objects. We first present a classical treatment of this induced motion, bridging the gap between classical and quantum formalisms. We describe the different types of roto-translational motion for different particle shapes via their interaction with polarized optical trapping fields. Subsequently, we provide an overview of the theoretical and experimental approaches as well as applications that have established this new field. The review concludes with an outlook of promising experiments and applications, including the creation of non-classical states of roto-translational motion, quantum-limited torque sensing and particle characterization methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PtPb$_4$ is a type II superconductor with a bulk critical temperature $T_{c}\approx 3 $K and an upper critical field of $H_{c2}=0.36 $T. PtPb$_4$ is related to non-superconducting PtSn$_4$, which presents nodal arc states at the surface. Here we measure the superconducting density of states of PtPb$_4$ using millikelvin Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). We observe a fully opened superconducting gap of $\Delta=0.48$\ meV similar to expectations from Bardeen Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS) theory ($\Delta_0=1.76k_BT_{c}=0.49 $meV). Measurements under magnetic fields applied perpendicular to the surface show a spatially inhomogeneous gap structure, presenting superconducting signatures at fields as high as 1.5 T, significantly above $H_{c2}=0.36 $T. On some locations we find that the superconducting density of states does not vanish above $T_{c}$. We can find signatures of a superconducting gap up to 5K. We discuss possible reasons for the observation of superconducting properties above $T_{c}$ and $H_{c2}$, emphasizing the role played by structural defects.</description>

Abstract: Frequency-based synthetic dimensions are a promising avenue for expanding the dimensionality of photonic systems. In this work, we show how a tilted synthetic lattice is naturally realised by periodically modulating a single-mode resonator under a coherent monochromatic drive. We theoretically study the Bloch wave dynamics in the tilted synthetic lattice, which gives rise to peculiar features in the spectral distribution of the cavity field. Our predictions are experimentally confirmed using a planar tunable superconducting microwave resonator.</description>

Abstract: The Fermi surface topology of a triple non-hermitian (NH) Weyl semimetal (WSM) driven by bi-circularly polarized light is presented in this study. A NH WSM in particular has remarkable outlines. Bi-circular light, however, modifies the symmetry features of non-hermitian triple Weyl and causes an unusual new kind of band swapping. We observe swapping between the imaginary bands (with or without exceptional degenaracies), which causes unique Fermi surfaces in the form of double rings and knots. This is something never discussed before phase transition between Weyl and knotted phases. We also discuss the corresponding changes in the Berry curvature as well.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomalous Hall crystals in moir\'e bands with higher Chern number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of fractional Chern insulators in moir\'e materials has sparked the search for further novel phases of matter in this platform. In particular, recent works have demonstrated the possibility of realizing quantum anomalous Hall crystals (QAHCs), which combine the zero-field quantum Hall effect with spontaneously broken discrete translation symmetry. Here, we employ exact diagonalization to demonstrate the existence of stable QAHCs arising from $\frac{2}{3}$-filled moir\'e bands with Chern number $C=2$. Our calculations show that these topological crystals, which are characterized by a quantized Hall conductivity of $1$ (in units of $e^2/h$) and a tripled unit cell, are robust in an ideal model of twisted bilayer-trilayer graphene -- providing a novel explanation for experimental observations in this heterostructure. Furthermore, we predict that the QAHC remains robust in a realistic model of twisted double bilayer graphene and, in addition, we provide a range of optimal tuning parameters, namely twist angle and electric field, for experimentally realizing this phase. Overall, our work demonstrates the stability of QAHCs at odd-denominator filling of $C=2$ bands, provides specific guidelines for future experiments, and establishes chiral multilayer graphene as a theoretical platform for studying topological phases beyond the Landau-level paradigm.</description>

      <title>Monolithic 4H-SiC nanomechanical resonators with high intrinsic quality factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extensive study of 4H-SiC nanomechanical resonators electrochemically etched out of a monocrystalline wafer. Combining piezo-driven interferometric determination of the mechanical spectra with scanning-laser-Doppler vibrometry, an unambiguous assignment of resonance peaks to flexural and torsional modes is achieved. The investigation of multiple harmonic eigenmodes of singly and doubly clamped resonators with varying geometry allows for a comprehensive characterization. Excellent intrinsic mechanical quality factors up to $2\times10^5$ are found at room temperature, approaching the thermoelastic limit at eigenfrquencies exceeding 10 MHz. Mechanical stress is essentially absent. Young's modulus in agreement with literature. These findings are robust under post-processing treatments, in particular atomic layer etching and high-temperature thermal annealing. The resulting on-chip high-quality mechanical resonators represent a valuable technological element for a broad range of applications. In particular, the monolithic architecture meets the requirements of spin-based photonic quantum technologies on the upcoming SiC platform.</description>

Abstract: Orbitronics explores the control and manipulation of electronic orbital angular momentum in solid-state systems, opening new pathways for information processing and storage. One significant advantage of orbitronics over spintronics is that it does not rely on spin-orbit coupling, thereby broadening the range of non-magnetic materials that can be utilized for these applications. It also introduces new topological features related to electronic orbital angular momentum, and clarifies some long-standing challenges in understanding experiments that rely on the conventional concept of valley transport. This review highlights recent advances in orbitronics, particularly in relation to two-dimensional materials. We examine the fundamental principles underlying the generation, transport, and dynamics of orbital angular momentum to illustrate how the unique properties of two-dimensional materials can promote orbitronic phenomena. We also outline potential future research directions and address some outstanding questions in this field.</description>

      <title>Evanescent Orbital Pumping by Magnetization Dynamics Without Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Converting magnetization spin to orbital current often relies on strong spin-orbit interaction that may cause additional angular momentum dissipation. We report that coherent magnetization dynamics in magnetic nanostructures can evanescently pump an orbital current into adjacent semiconductors due to the coupling between its stray electromagnetic field and electron orbitals without relying on spin-orbit coupling. The underlying photonic spin of the electromagnetic field governs the orbital polarization that flows along the gradient of the driven field. Due to the orbital texture, the orbital Hall current that flows perpendicularly to the gradient of the AC field is also generated and does not suffer from the orbital torque. These findings extend the paradigm of orbital pumping to include photonic spin and pave the way for developing low-dissipation orbitronic devices.</description>

      <title>Crossover in Electronic Specific Heat near Narrow-Sense Type-III Dirac Cones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions exhibit Dirac cones, which are classified into three types: type-I, type-II, and type-III. In both type-I and type-II cones, the energy dispersion is linear in all momentum directions. Type-I cones are characterized by a non-overtilted structure, where the Dirac point serves as a local minimum (maximum) for the upper (lower) band. In contrast, type-II cones exhibit overtilted dispersions, leading to the coexistence of electron and hole pockets. At the critical tilt, the linear energy dispersion vanishes in one momentum direction, corresponding to a type-III Dirac cone. We further define a special case, termed the "narrow-sense" type-III cone, where not only the linear term but also quadratic and higher-order terms vanish, resulting in a completely flat dispersion along one direction. In this work, we numerically investigate the temperature ($T$) -dependence of the electronic specific heat ($C$), as the Dirac cone is continuously tilted from type-I to narrow-sense type-III. A model with particle-hole symmetry is employed to ensure that the chemical potential ($\mu$) remains temperature independent. Our results reveal a notable crossover in $C$ near narrow-sense type-III, where $C$ changes from $C \propto T^{2}$ below the crossover temperature ($T_{\rm co}$) to $C \propto T^{\frac{1}{2}}$ above $T_{\rm co}$. This crossover is attributed to the energy-dependent structure of the density of states. The present findings suggest a feasible approach for experimentally probing the degree of Dirac cone tilting near the narrow-sense type-III limit.</description>

      <title>Chiral Locking of Magnon Flow and Electron Spin Accumulation in Their Near-Field Radiative Spin Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a non-contact mechanism for directional injection of magnons in magnetic films when driven by a spin accumulation $\pmb{\mu}_s$ of electrons of a nearby metallic layer, governed by the long-range dipolar coupling between magnons and electron spins, which spontaneously generates a magnon current ${\bf J}_m$ flowing in the film plane. Crucially, in such near-field radiative spin transfer, the magnon flow ${\bf J}_m$ is always perpendicular to the spin accumulation $\pmb{\mu}_s$, showing a universal chiral locking relation. The spin injection is efficient even when $\pmb{\mu}_s$ is parallel to the magnetization, a feature breaking the limitation of the spin transfer by contact exchange interaction. Our findings reveal the critical role of dipolar chirality in driving the magnon thermal current and paving the way for the functional design of magnonic devices based on near-field radiative spin transfer.</description>

      <title>Super Moir\'e Domain Tessellations, Sliding Ferroelectricity and Reconfigurable Quantum Dot Arrays in Twisted Trilayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At very small twist angles, bilayer moir\'e systems exhibit characteristic stacking domain patterns, where the moir\'e length scale is determined solely by the twist angle. In contrast, the additional stacking and twisting degrees of freedom in twisted trilayer systems give rise to richer and more intricate domain tessellations. In twisted trilayer hexagonal boron nitride (TTBN), the interplay between polar and nonpolar domains and their domain walls is shown to result in unconventional responses to external electric fields, including electric-field tunability of the moir\'e-of-moir\'e or super moir\'e pattern - features absent in bilayer counterparts. We demonstrate that at the vertices of super moir\'e domains, TTBN can support arrays of quantum dots hosting localized quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) states with diverse spatial symmetries. Futhermore, we show that the shape of the array and the spacing between the localized QHO states can be dynamically reconfigured by electric fields, enabling facile switching between fully isolated and strongly coupled regimes. The local potentials for the quantum dot state are predicted to be sufficiently deep to support a series of QHO states with nonzero angular momentum. This tunability enables control over the transport of quantum dot states and their inter-dot coupling, facillitating long-range quantum state transfer. Combined with the feasibility of large-scale fabrication of homogeneous twisted trilayer materials, these properties position TTBN as a promising platform for a wide range of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-Vacancy Magnetometry of Edge Magnetism in WS2 Flakes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnets are of significant interest both as a platform for exploring novel fundamental physics and for their potential in spintronic and optoelectronic devices. Recent bulk magnetometry studies have indicated a weak ferromagnetic response in WS2, and theoretical predictions suggest edge-localized magnetization in flakes with partial hydrogenation. Here, we use room-temperature wide-field quantum diamond magnetometry to image pristine and Fe-implanted WS2 flakes of varying thicknesses (45-160 nm), exfoliated from bulk crystals and transferred to NV-doped diamond substrates. We observe direct evidence of edge-localized stray magnetic fields, which scale linearly with applied external magnetic field (4.4-220 mT), reaching up to 4.7 uT. The edge signal shows a limited dependence on the flake thickness, consistent with dipolar field decay and sensing geometry. Magnetic simulations using five alternative models favor the presence of edge magnetization aligned along an axis slightly tilted from the normal to the WS2 flake plane, consistent with spin canting in antiferromagnetically coupled edge states. Our findings establish WS2 as a promising platform for edge-controlled 2D spintronics.</description>

      <title>Hetero-Orbital Two-Component Fractional Quantum Hall States in Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A two-dimensional electron system exposed to a strong magnetic field produces a plethora of strongly interacting fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, the complex topological orders of which are revealed through exotic emergent particles, such as composite fermions, fractionally charged Abelian and non-Abelian anyons. Much insight has been gained by the study of multi-component FQH states, where spin and pseudospin indices of the electron contribute additional correlation. Traditional multi-component FQH states develop in situations where the components share the same orbital states and the resulting interactions are pseudospin independent; this homo-orbital nature was also crucial to their theoretical understanding. Here, we study "hetero-orbital" two-component FQH states, in which the orbital index is part of the pseudospin, rendering the multi-component interactions strongly SU(2) anisotropic in the pseudospin space. Such states, obtained in bilayer graphene at the isospin transition between N = 0 and N = 1 electron Landau levels, are markedly different from previous homo-orbital two-component FQH states. In particular, we observe strikingly different behaviors for the parallel-flux and reverse-flux composite fermion states, and an anomalously strong two-component 2/5 state over a wide range of magnetic field before it abruptly disappears at a high field. Our findings, combined with detailed theoretical calculations, reveal the surprising robustness of the hetero-orbital FQH effects, significantly enriching our understanding of FQH physics in this novel regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anyonic interferometry is a direct probe of fractional statistics. We propose an interferometry geometry that parallels an optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer and offers several advantages over existing interferometry schemes. In contrast to the currently studied electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer, our setup has no drain inside the device so that the trapped topological charge is time-independent. In contrast to electronic Fabry-P\'erot interferometry, anyons cannot go around the device more than once. Thus, the interference signal has a straightforward interpretation in terms of anyonic statistical phases. The proposed geometry suppresses the undesirable effects of bulk-edge coupling. Moreover, the setup allows for simple exact solutions for the electric current and noise for an arbitrary quasiparticle tunneling strength in a broad range of conditions. The structure of the solutions is similar to that for non-interacting electrons but reflects fractional charge and statistics. We present results for electric current and noise in Jain states and address thermal interferometry at zero voltage bias.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-induced Hall-like lateral forces in a chiral-gain environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag linked to the nonlinear Hall current. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.</description>

Abstract: Trions, charged quasiparticles formed by binding an exciton to an excess charge carrier, dominate the optical response of doped transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and the study of the transport properties of trions in TMDs may have application in developing high-speed excitonic and optoelectronic devices. However, an important building block for low-dissipation optoelectronic devices that provides dissipationless transport channels for trions has remained elusive. Here, we propose the concept of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological trion insulator that features helical dissipationless edge states for trions. This is realized for intralayer trions, which inherit the valley-orbit coupling of intralayer excitons in TMDs subject to a moir\'e periodic potential. We find that under certain circumstances, the moir\'e trion band becomes topological, characterized by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological number. We further provide two specific material realizations of this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator: a doped monolayer TMD placed on top of a twisted hBN substrate, and a generic twisted TMD heterobilayer. We also examine the effect of charge screening and find that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological trion insulator remains robust. Our work paves the way toward realizing dissipationless excitonic devices.</description>

Abstract: Disorder and non-Hermitian effects together can upend how waves localize. In a 1D disordered chain, the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) can induce Anderson delocalization, defying the usual rule that disorder in low dimensions always localizes states. While weak disorder leaves the NHSE intact, strong disorder restores Anderson localization. Here, we study a surprising twist: coupling a strongly disordered Hatano-Nelson chain to a disordered Hermitian chain with their disorder anti-symmetrically correlated. Strikingly, once the inter-chain coupling exceeds a threshold, the system undergoes Anderson delocalization irrespective of disorder strength, reinstating the NHSE with no Hermitian counterpart. This transition arises from the interplay of non-reciprocal hopping, inter-chain coupling, and engineered disorder correlations, and is captured by a real-space winding number. To confirm this, we build an electrical-circuit analog and directly observe the re-emergent NHSE via voltage measurements. Our work uncovers unexplored and experimentally accessible physics at the crossroads of non-Hermiticity and disorder.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently been shown to demonstrate non-volatile resistive switching (NVRS), offering significant advantages such as high-density integration and low energy consumption due to their atomic-scale thinness. In this study, we focus on the adsorption and desorption of metal adatoms, which can modulate the electrical resistivity by several orders of magnitude. We develop material-based relationships of the adsorption energy with electronic and atomic structure descriptors by examining the effects of various transition-metal adsorbates on the surface of TMDs. Our results reveal that adsorption energies of transition metals exhibit consistent trends across different TMDs (MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, WSe$_2$) and can be explained using simple descriptors of the atomic and electronic structure. We propose several models to describe this adsorption process, providing a deeper understanding of a crucial step in the resistive switching mechanism based on formation and dissolution of point defects. Finally, we connect our computed adsorption energies to the switching energy. These findings will help guide rational materials selection for the development of NVRS devices using 2D TMDs.</description>

Abstract: Spin and orbital are two basic degrees of freedom that play significant roles in exploring exotic quantum phases in optical lattices with synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and high orbital bands, respectively. Here, we combine these two crucial ingredients for the first time by proposing a completely new orbital optical Raman lattice scheme to explore exotic high-orbital Bose condensates with Raman-induced SOC in a square lattice. We find that both the SOC and p-orbital interactions influence the condensed state of bosons. Their interplay results in two novel high-orbital many-body quantum phases: the uniform angular momentum superfluid phase, which exhibits a global topological chiral orbital current characterized by a uniform Chern number, and the two-dimensional topological spin-orbital supersolid phase, which is characterized by the spin and orbital angular momentum density wave patterns and topological excitations with opposite Chern numbers, respectively protecting the chiral and antichiral edge modes in the neighboring supersolid clusters. Our scheme may open a new avenue for exploring exotic SOC and high-orbital physics in optical lattices, and is expected to advance the experimental realization of novel supersolids in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations for Coherent Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a universal thermodynamic uncertainty relation for Fermionic coherent transport, which bounds the total rate of entropy production in terms of the mean and fluctuations of a single particle current. This bound holds for any multi-terminal geometry and arbitrary chemical and thermal biases, as long as no external magnetic fields are applied. It can further be saturated in two-terminal settings with boxcar-shaped transmission functions and reduces to its classical counterpart in linear response. Upon insertion of a numerical factor, our bound also extends to systems with broken time-reversal symmetry. As an application, we derive trade-off relations between the figures of merit of coherent thermoelectric heat engines and refrigerators, which show that such devices can attain ideal efficiency only at vanishing mean power or diverging power fluctuations. To illustrate our results, we work out a model of a coherent conductor consisting of a chain of quantum dots.</description>

Abstract: These notes review a description of quantum mechanics in terms of the topology of spaces, basing on the axioms of Topological Quantum Field Theory and path integral formalism. In this description quantum states and operators are encoded by the topology of spaces that are used as modules to build the quantum mechanical model, while expectation values and probabilities are given by topological invariants of spaces, knots and links. The notes focus on the specific way the topology encodes quantum mechanical features, or, equivalently, on how these features can be controlled through the topology. A topological classification of entanglement is discussed, as well as properties of entanglement entropy and basic quantum protocols. The primary aim is to build a less conventional diagrammatic intuition about quantum mechanics, expanding the paradigm of ``Quantum Picturalism".</description>

      <title>Restoring the second law to classical-quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: All physical theories should obey the second law of thermodynamics. However, existing proposals to describe the dynamics of hybrid classical-quantum systems either violate the second law or lack a proof of its existence. Here we rectify this by studying classical-quantum dynamics that are (1) linear and completely-positive and (2) preserve the thermal state of the classical-quantum system. We first prove that such dynamics necessarily satisfy the second law. We then show how these dynamics may be constructed, proposing dynamics that generalise the standard Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations for classical systems in thermal environments to include back-reaction from a quantum degree of freedom. Deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for completely-positive, linear and continuous classical-quantum dynamics to satisfy detailed balance, we find this property satisfied by our dynamics. To illustrate the formalism and its applications we introduce two models. The first is an analytically solvable model of an overdamped classical system coupled to a quantum two-level system, which we use to study the total entropy production in both quantum system and classical measurement apparatus during a quantum measurement. The second describes an underdamped classical-quantum oscillator system subject to friction, which we numerically demonstrate exhibits thermalisation in the adiabatic basis, showing the relevance of our dynamics for the mixed classical-quantum simulation of molecules.</description>

      <title>Probing plexciton dynamics with higher-order spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coupling molecular transition dipole moments to surface-plasmon polaritons (SPPs) results in the formation of new optical quasiparticles, i.e., plexcitons. Mixing the specific properties of matter excitations and light modes has proven to be an efficient strategy to alter a variety of molecular processes ranging from chemical reactions to exciton transport. Here, we investigate energy transfer in a plexcitonic system of zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) molecules aggregated in the crystalline {\alpha}-phase and an SPP on a planar gold surface. By tuning the angle of incidence, we vary the degree of mixing between excitonic and SPP character of the excited state. We apply our recently developed higher-order pump-probe spectroscopy to separate the system's fifth-order signal describing the dynamics of two-particle interactions. The time it takes for two quasiparticles to meet and annihilate is a measure of their movement and thus the transport of excitation energy in the system. We find that the transport extracted from the fifth-order signal is surprisingly unaffected by the mixing ratio of exciton and SPP contributions of the plexciton. Using a rate equation model, we explain this behavior by fast transition from the plexcitonic states to many localized excitonic dark states that do not have an SPP contribution. Our results give an indication of how hybrid exciton-plasmon systems should be designed to exploit the delocalization of the involved plasmon modes for improved transport.</description>

      <title>Effect of Magnetic Anisotropy and Gradient-Induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction on the Formation of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological spin textures (e.g. skyrmions) can be stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in the magnetic multilayer, which has been intensively studied. Recently, Bloch-type magnetic skyrmions stabilized by composition gradient-induced DMI (g-DMI) have been observed in 10-nm thick CoPt single layer. However, magnetic anisotropy in gradient-composition engineered CoPt (g-CoPt) films is highly sensitive to both the relative Co/Pt composition and the film thickness, leading to a complex interplay with g-DMI. The stability of skyrmions under the combined influence of magnetic anisotropy and g-DMI is crucial yet remains poorly understood. Here, we conduct a systematic study on the characteristics of magnetic skyrmions as a function of gradient polarity and effective gradient (defined as gradient/thickness) in g-CoPt single layers (thickness of 10-30 nm) using magnetic force microscopy (MFM), bulk magnetometry, and topological Hall effect measurements. Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy confirms that both the sign and magnitude of g-DMI depend on the polarity and amplitude of the composition gradient in g-CoPt films. MFM reveals that skyrmion size and density vary with g-CoPt film thickness, gradient polarity, and applied magnetic field. An increased skyrmion density is observed in samples exhibiting higher magnetic anisotropy, in agreement with micromagnetic simulations and energy barrier calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-flip inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy allows magnetic materials to be probed at the single-atom level via scanning tunneling microscopy. Previously, the local spectral weight of spin excitations of small systems has been deduced from discrete steps in the differential conductance. However, this is not viable for large systems. We show that the local spin density of states can be measured via the double differential conductance. This contrasts with elastic measurements where the local density of electronic states is deduced from the differential conductance. We study the tunneling currents of the spin-1/2 and -1 Heisenberg chains and propose a method to probe zero-frequency modes.</description>
