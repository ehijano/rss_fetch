      <title>Synchronized Video Storytelling: Generating Video Narrations with Structured Storyline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video storytelling is engaging multimedia content that utilizes video and its accompanying narration to attract the audience, where a key challenge is creating narrations for recorded visual scenes. Previous studies on dense video captioning and video story generation have made some progress. However, in practical applications, we typically require synchronized narrations for ongoing visual scenes. In this work, we introduce a new task of Synchronized Video Storytelling, which aims to generate synchronous and informative narrations for videos. These narrations, associated with each video clip, should relate to the visual content, integrate relevant knowledge, and have an appropriate word count corresponding to the clip's duration. Specifically, a structured storyline is beneficial to guide the generation process, ensuring coherence and integrity. To support the exploration of this task, we introduce a new benchmark dataset E-SyncVidStory with rich annotations. Since existing Multimodal LLMs are not effective in addressing this task in one-shot or few-shot settings, we propose a framework named VideoNarrator that can generate a storyline for input videos and simultaneously generate narrations with the guidance of the generated or predefined storyline. We further introduce a set of evaluation metrics to thoroughly assess the generation. Both automatic and human evaluations validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our dataset, codes, and evaluations will be released.</description>

      <title>SemEval-2024 Task 3: Multimodal Emotion Cause Analysis in Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to understand emotions is an essential component of human-like artificial intelligence, as emotions greatly influence human cognition, decision making, and social interactions. In addition to emotion recognition in conversations, the task of identifying the potential causes behind an individual's emotional state in conversations, is of great importance in many application scenarios. We organize SemEval-2024 Task 3, named Multimodal Emotion Cause Analysis in Conversations, which aims at extracting all pairs of emotions and their corresponding causes from conversations. Under different modality settings, it consists of two subtasks: Textual Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations (TECPE) and Multimodal Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations (MECPE). The shared task has attracted 143 registrations and 216 successful submissions. In this paper, we introduce the task, dataset and evaluation settings, summarize the systems of the top teams, and discuss the findings of the participants.</description>

      <title>Towards Retrieval-Augmented Architectures for Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of image captioning models is to bridge the gap between the visual and linguistic modalities by generating natural language descriptions that accurately reflect the content of input images. In recent years, researchers have leveraged deep learning-based models and made advances in the extraction of visual features and the design of multimodal connections to tackle this task. This work presents a novel approach towards developing image captioning models that utilize an external kNN memory to improve the generation process. Specifically, we propose two model variants that incorporate a knowledge retriever component that is based on visual similarities, a differentiable encoder to represent input images, and a kNN-augmented language model to predict tokens based on contextual cues and text retrieved from the external memory. We experimentally validate our approach on COCO and nocaps datasets and demonstrate that incorporating an explicit external memory can significantly enhance the quality of captions, especially with a larger retrieval corpus. This work provides valuable insights into retrieval-augmented captioning models and opens up new avenues for improving image captioning at a larger scale.</description>

      <title>HR-INR: Continuous Space-Time Video Super-Resolution via Event Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous space-time video super-resolution (C-STVSR) aims to simultaneously enhance video resolution and frame rate at an arbitrary scale. Recently, implicit neural representation (INR) has been applied to video restoration, representing videos as implicit fields that can be decoded at an arbitrary scale. However, the highly ill-posed nature of C-STVSR limits the effectiveness of current INR-based methods: they assume linear motion between frames and use interpolation or feature warping to generate features at arbitrary spatiotemporal positions with two consecutive frames. This restrains C-STVSR from capturing rapid and nonlinear motion and long-term dependencies (involving more than two frames) in complex dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel C-STVSR framework, called HR-INR, which captures both holistic dependencies and regional motions based on INR. It is assisted by an event camera, a novel sensor renowned for its high temporal resolution and low latency. To fully utilize the rich temporal information from events, we design a feature extraction consisting of (1) a regional event feature extractor - taking events as inputs via the proposed event temporal pyramid representation to capture the regional nonlinear motion and (2) a holistic event-frame feature extractor for long-term dependence and continuity motion. We then propose a novel INR-based decoder with spatiotemporal embeddings to capture long-term dependencies with a larger temporal perception field. We validate the effectiveness and generalization of our method on four datasets (both simulated and real data), showing the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>Feedback-aligned Mixed LLMs for Machine Language-Molecule Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intersection of chemistry and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an active area of research focused on accelerating scientific discovery. While using large language models (LLMs) with scientific modalities has shown potential, there are significant challenges to address, such as improving training efficiency and dealing with the out-of-distribution problem. Focussing on the task of automated language-molecule translation, we are the first to use state-of-the art (SOTA) human-centric optimisation algorithms in the cross-modal setting, successfully aligning cross-language-molecule modals. We empirically show that we can augment the capabilities of scientific LLMs without the need for extensive data or large models. We conduct experiments using only 10% of the available data to mitigate memorisation effects associated with training large models on extensive datasets. We achieve significant performance gains, surpassing the best benchmark model trained on extensive in-distribution data by a large margin and reach new SOTA levels. Additionally we are the first to propose employing non-linear fusion for mixing cross-modal LLMs which further boosts performance gains without increasing training costs or data needs. Finally, we introduce a fine-grained, domain-agnostic evaluation method to assess hallucination in LLMs and promote responsible use.</description>

      <title>ReactXT: Understanding Molecular "Reaction-ship" via Reaction-Contextualized Molecule-Text Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecule-text modeling, which aims to facilitate molecule-relevant tasks with a textual interface and textual knowledge, is an emerging research direction. Beyond single molecules, studying reaction-text modeling holds promise for helping the synthesis of new materials and drugs. However, previous works mostly neglect reaction-text modeling: they primarily focus on modeling individual molecule-text pairs or learning chemical reactions without texts in context. Additionally, one key task of reaction-text modeling -- experimental procedure prediction -- is less explored due to the absence of an open-source dataset. The task is to predict step-by-step actions of conducting chemical experiments and is crucial to automating chemical synthesis. To resolve the challenges above, we propose a new pretraining method, ReactXT, for reaction-text modeling, and a new dataset, OpenExp, for experimental procedure prediction. Specifically, ReactXT features three types of input contexts to incrementally pretrain LMs. Each of the three input contexts corresponds to a pretraining task to improve the text-based understanding of either reactions or single molecules. ReactXT demonstrates consistent improvements in experimental procedure prediction and molecule captioning and offers competitive results in retrosynthesis. Our code is available at https://github.com/syr-cn/ReactXT.</description>

      <title>Improving Gloss-free Sign Language Translation by Reducing Representation Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gloss-free sign language translation (SLT) aims to develop well-performing SLT systems with no requirement for the costly gloss annotations, but currently still lags behind gloss-based approaches significantly. In this paper, we identify a representation density problem that could be a bottleneck in restricting the performance of gloss-free SLT. Specifically, the representation density problem describes that the visual representations of semantically distinct sign gestures tend to be closely packed together in feature space, which makes gloss-free methods struggle with distinguishing different sign gestures and suffer from a sharp performance drop. To address the representation density problem, we introduce a simple but effective contrastive learning strategy, namely SignCL, which encourages gloss-free models to learn more discriminative feature representation in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed SignCL can significantly reduce the representation density and improve performance across various translation frameworks. Specifically, SignCL achieves a significant improvement in BLEU score for the Sign Language Transformer and GFSLT-VLP on the CSL-Daily dataset by 39% and 46%, respectively, without any increase of model parameters. Compared to Sign2GPT, a state-of-the-art method based on large-scale pre-trained vision and language models, SignCL achieves better performance with only 35% of its parameters. Implementation and Checkpoints are available at https://github.com/JinhuiYE/SignCL.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Classification of Photoplethysmogram Signal for Hypertension Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous photoplethysmography (PPG)-based blood pressure monitoring is necessary for healthcare and fitness applications. In Artificial Intelligence (AI), signal classification levels with the machine and deep learning arrangements need to be explored further. Techniques based on time-frequency spectra, such as Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT), have been used to address the challenges of motion artifact correction. Therefore, the proposed study works with PPG signals of more than 200 patients (650+ signal samples) with hypertension, using STFT with various Neural Networks (Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), followed by machine learning classifiers, such as, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). The classification has been done for two categories: Prehypertension (normal levels) and Hypertension (includes Stage I and Stage II). Various performance metrics have been obtained with two batch sizes of 3 and 16 for the fusion of the neural networks. With precision and specificity of 100% and recall of 82.1%, the LSTM model provides the best results among all combinations of Neural Networks. However, the maximum accuracy of 71.9% is achieved by the LSTM-CNN model. Further stacked Ensemble method has been used to achieve 100% accuracy for Meta-LSTM-RF, Meta- LSTM-CNN-RF and Meta- STFT-CNN-SVM.</description>

      <title>Visual Echoes: A Simple Unified Transformer for Audio-Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, with the realistic generation results and a wide range of personalized applications, diffusion-based generative models gain huge attention in both visual and audio generation areas. Compared to the considerable advancements of text2image or text2audio generation, research in audio2visual or visual2audio generation has been relatively slow. The recent audio-visual generation methods usually resort to huge large language model or composable diffusion models. Instead of designing another giant model for audio-visual generation, in this paper we take a step back showing a simple and lightweight generative transformer, which is not fully investigated in multi-modal generation, can achieve excellent results on image2audio generation. The transformer operates in the discrete audio and visual Vector-Quantized GAN space, and is trained in the mask denoising manner. After training, the classifier-free guidance could be deployed off-the-shelf achieving better performance, without any extra training or modification. Since the transformer model is modality symmetrical, it could also be directly deployed for audio2image generation and co-generation. In the experiments, we show that our simple method surpasses recent image2audio generation methods.

      <title>OpFlowTalker: Realistic and Natural Talking Face Generation via Optical Flow Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating realistic, natural, and lip-readable talking face videos remains a formidable challenge. Previous research primarily concentrated on generating and aligning single-frame images while overlooking the smoothness of frame-to-frame transitions and temporal dependencies. This often compromised visual quality and effects in practical settings, particularly when handling complex facial data and audio content, which frequently led to semantically incongruent visual illusions. Specifically, synthesized videos commonly featured disorganized lip movements, making them difficult to understand and recognize. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces the application of optical flow to guide facial image generation, enhancing inter-frame continuity and semantic consistency. We propose "OpFlowTalker", a novel approach that utilizes predicted optical flow changes from audio inputs rather than direct image predictions. This method smooths image transitions and aligns changes with semantic content. Moreover, it employs a sequence fusion technique to replace the independent generation of single frames, thus preserving contextual information and maintaining temporal coherence. We also developed an optical flow synchronization module that regulates both full-face and lip movements, optimizing visual synthesis by balancing regional dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a Visual Text Consistency Score (VTCS) that accurately measures lip-readability in synthesized videos. Extensive empirical evidence validates the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Automatic Camera Trajectory Control with Enhanced Immersion for Virtual Cinematography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User-generated cinematic creations are gaining popularity as our daily entertainment, yet it is a challenge to master cinematography for producing immersive contents. Many existing automatic methods focus on roughly controlling predefined shot types or movement patterns, which struggle to engage viewers with the circumstances of the actor. Real-world cinematographic rules show that directors can create immersion by comprehensively synchronizing the camera with the actor. Inspired by this strategy, we propose a deep camera control framework that enables actor-camera synchronization in three aspects, considering frame aesthetics, spatial action, and emotional status in the 3D virtual stage. Following rule-of-thirds, our framework first modifies the initial camera placement to position the actor aesthetically. This adjustment is facilitated by a self-supervised adjustor that analyzes frame composition via camera projection. We then design a GAN model that can adversarially synthesize fine-grained camera movement based on the physical action and psychological state of the actor, using an encoder-decoder generator to map kinematics and emotional variables into camera trajectories. Moreover, we incorporate a regularizer to align the generated stylistic variances with specific emotional categories and intensities. The experimental results show that our proposed method yields immersive cinematic videos of high quality, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Live examples can be found in the supplementary video.</description>

      <title>SpikeMba: Multi-Modal Spiking Saliency Mamba for Temporal Video Grounding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal video grounding (TVG) is a critical task in video content understanding, requiring precise alignment between video content and natural language instructions. Despite significant advancements, existing methods face challenges in managing confidence bias towards salient objects and capturing long-term dependencies in video sequences. To address these issues, we introduce SpikeMba: a multi-modal spiking saliency mamba for temporal video grounding. Our approach integrates Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with state space models (SSMs) to leverage their unique advantages in handling different aspects of the task. Specifically, we use SNNs to develop a spiking saliency detector that generates the proposal set. The detector emits spike signals when the input signal exceeds a predefined threshold, resulting in a dynamic and binary saliency proposal set. To enhance the model's capability to retain and infer contextual information, we introduce relevant slots which learnable tensors that encode prior knowledge. These slots work with the contextual moment reasoner to maintain a balance between preserving contextual information and exploring semantic relevance dynamically. The SSMs facilitate selective information propagation, addressing the challenge of long-term dependency in video content. By combining SNNs for proposal generation and SSMs for effective contextual reasoning, SpikeMba addresses confidence bias and long-term dependencies, thereby significantly enhancing fine-grained multimodal relationship capture. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SpikeMba, which consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across mainstream benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal LLMs are the natural evolution of LLMs, and enlarge their capabilities so as to work beyond the pure textual modality. As research is being carried out to design novel architectures and vision-and-language adapters, in this paper we concentrate on endowing such models with the capability of answering questions that require external knowledge. Our approach, termed Wiki-LLaVA, aims at integrating an external knowledge source of multimodal documents, which is accessed through a hierarchical retrieval pipeline. Relevant passages, using this approach, are retrieved from the external knowledge source and employed as additional context for the LLM, augmenting the effectiveness and precision of generated dialogues. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets tailored for visual question answering with external data and demonstrate the appropriateness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Detecting Multimodal Situations with Insufficient Context and Abstaining from Baseless Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of Vision-Language Understanding (VLU) benchmarks such as VQA v2, OKVQA, A-OKVQA, GQA, VCR, SWAG, and VisualCOMET, our analysis reveals a pervasive issue affecting their integrity: these benchmarks contain samples where answers rely on assumptions unsupported by the provided context. Training models on such data foster biased learning and hallucinations as models tend to make similar unwarranted assumptions. To address this issue, we collect contextual data for each sample whenever available and train a context selection module to facilitate evidence-based model predictions. Strong improvements across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Further, we develop a general-purpose Context-AwaRe Abstention (CARA) detector to identify samples lacking sufficient context and enhance model accuracy by abstaining from responding if the required context is absent. CARA exhibits generalization to new benchmarks it wasn't trained on, underscoring its utility for future VLU benchmarks in detecting or cleaning samples with inadequate context. Finally, we curate a Context Ambiguity and Sufficiency Evaluation (CASE) set to benchmark the performance of insufficient context detectors. Overall, our work represents a significant advancement in ensuring that vision-language models generate trustworthy and evidence-based outputs in complex real-world scenarios.</description>
