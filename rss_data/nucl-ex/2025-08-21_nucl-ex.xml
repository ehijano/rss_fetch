      <title>New Upper Bounds on Exotic Neutron Spin-Electron Spin Interactions via Neutron Spin Rotation Measurements in a Compensated Ferrimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a search for exotic spin-spin interactions between neutrons and electrons which could signal new physics beyond the Standard Model using slow neutron polarimetric imaging through a dense medium of polarized electrons. Our dense polarized electron target is a ferrimagnet held at its magnetic compensation temperature, which realizes a polarized electron ensemble with zero net magnetization. We sought the spin rotation of transversely polarized neutrons from a neutron spin-electron spin interaction of the form $V_2=-g_A^eg_A^n\frac{\hbar c}{4\pi}\vec\sigma_e\cdot\vec\sigma_n\frac{e^{-r/\lambda_c}}{r}$, where $g_{A}^{e}$ and $g_{A}^{n}$ are the electron and neutron axial couplings, $\vec{\sigma_e}$ and $\vec{\sigma_n}$ are the electron and neutron spin, and $\lambda_c$ is the interaction range for an exotic axial vector interaction from massive spin-1 boson exchange of mass $\hbar c/\lambda_c$. The resulting average neutron spin rotation angle per unit length, $\frac{d\bar{\phi}_{F5}}{dz}=[0.41\pm6.30\ (stat.)\pm4.4\ (sys.)]\times10^{-3}$ rad/m, is consistent with zero. Our novel approach improves the previous upper limits on the coupling constant product $g_A^eg_A^n$ by several orders of magnitude in the poorly explored $10^{-8}\leq\lambda_c\leq10^{-2}$ range.</description>

      <title>Probing hadronization with the charge correlator ratio in $p$+$p$, $Ru$+$Ru$ and $Zr$+$Zr$ collisions at STAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parton-to-hadron transition, known as hadronization, is dominated by non-perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) effects and thus challenging to study from first-principle calculations. On the other hand, experimental studies of observables sensitive to hadronization could provide valuable input. The charge correlator ratio $r_c$ studies the charge correlation between the leading two hadrons in jets and is sensitive to hadronization effects. With data taken at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=200$ GeV at STAR, we measure $r_c$ in $p$+$p$ collisions to probe for string-like fragmentation, and in $Ru$+$Ru$ and $Zr$+$Zr$ collisions to probe for potential modification to hadronization in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). These measurements, compared with various model predictions, are expected to distinguish between phenomenological model descriptions for hadronization in vacuum, and provide insight into jet-medium interaction in the QGP.</description>

      <title>Tagging Efficiency Study of Incoherent Diffractive Vector Meson Production at the Second Interaction Region at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is an upcoming accelerator facility aimed at exploring the properties of quarks and gluons in nucleons and nuclei, shedding light on their structure and dynamics. The inaugural experimental apparatus, ePIC (electron-Proton and Ion Collider), is designed as a general purpose detector to address the NAS/NSAC physics program at the EIC. The wider EIC community is strongly supporting a second interaction region and associated second detector to enhance the full science program. In this study, we evaluate how the second interaction region and detector can be complementary to ePIC. The pre-conceptual layout of an interaction region for the second detector offers a secondary focus that provides better forward detector acceptance at scattering angles near $\theta \sim 0$~mrad, which can specifically enhance the exclusive, tagging, and diffractive physics program. This article presents an analysis of a tagging program using the second interaction region layout with incoherent diffractive vector meson production. The potential for the second interaction region to provide improved vetoing capabilities for incoherent events to elucidate the coherent diffractive cross-section is evaluated. The capability to access the coherent diffractive cross-section is of prime importance for studying the spatial imaging of nucleons and nuclei.</description>

      <title>Annihilation Vertex Reconstruction Algorithm with Single-Layer Timepix4 Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A study of antiproton-nucleus annihilations at rest on a variety of thin solid targets using slow extracted antiprotons is being prepared. To detect the charged annihilation products, the experiment will employ seven Timepix4 ASICs coupled to 500 um thick silicon sensors. These will be arranged in a cuboid geometry that covers the majority of the full solid angle around the target, enabling precise tracking of outgoing particles using only one layer of detectors. With these novel chips, the annihilation will be studied by measuring the total multiplicity, energy, and angular distribution of various prongs produced in a number of targets. A 3D reconstruction algorithm for determining the annihilation vertex from particle tracks in the single-plane detectors has been developed using Monte Carlo simulations. This allows for event-by-event reconstruction, making it possible to distinguish antiproton annihilations on the target from those occurring elsewhere. The measurements will also enable a study of possible final state interactions triggered by the primary annihilation mesons, their evolution with the nuclear mass and their branching ratios.</description>

      <title>Structure of the doubly magic nuclei $^{208}$Pb and $^{266}$Pb from ab initio computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14217v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical studies indicate that the superheavy neutron-rich nucleus $^{266}_{\ 82}$Pb$_{184}$ is doubly magic and at the neutron drip line. While its density distributions and single-particle energies have been computed, the structure of this nucleus is yet unknown. We perform ab initio computations of $^{266}$Pb using an interaction from an effective field theory of quantum chromodynamics tuned only on properties of nuclei with $A \leq 4$. We validate our theoretical framework by computing the first $2^+$ and $3^-$ excited states of $^{208}$Pb, finding agreement with experimental data. We confirm that $^{266}$Pb is doubly magic and show that its $3^-$ state, located below the $2^+$ state, exhibits an excitation gap of 2.6 MeV with respect to the ground state. Our calculations also suggest that this nucleus is at the neutron drip line.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Neutron Measurement Accuracy with Bubble Detectors at Laser-Driven Neutron Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bubble detectors are widely used to measure neutron flux from laser-driven sources employing a pitcher-catcher setup, due to their insensitivity to intense $\gamma$-ray backgrounds and strong electromagnetic pulses (EMP).\\ This paper presents a method to account for the neutron energy-dependent response of bubble detectors, enabling accurate conversion of bubble counts into neutron flux at the detector location. The proposed method is based on the accurate reconstruction of the response function using a surrogate model. The resulting model is convoluted with the (normalized) expected/measured neutron spectrum to obtain an effective measure of the bubble detector's response, herein referred to as effective $c$ or $c_\text{eff}$. This effective value for the response is energy-independent after the convolution. In this way, our approach includes the spectral distribution of neutrons arriving at the detector to determine the integral neutron flux. Analyzing our experimental results obtained at the DRACO PW laser and comparing the results to previously used methods to obtain neutron fluxes from bubble detectors returns a reduction in neutron flux of up to \SI{31}{\%}. Results from the method detailed in this paper agree with in-depth experimental setup Monte Carlo simulations, with deviations of less than \SI{10}{\%}. We furthermore discuss the inherent limitations of our method with regard to its uncertainty and highlight the influence of neutron scattering in bubble detector measurements. For our experimental setup at the DRACO laser, up to \SI{47}{\%} of the detected neutrons arrive at the detector after undergoing at least one scattering event.</description>

      <title>Perspectives for hyperon and hypernuclei physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypernuclei, nuclei containing one or more hyperons, serve as unique laboratories for probing the non-perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Recent progress in hypernuclear physics, driven by advanced experimental techniques and theoretical innovations, is briefly reviewed with a focus on key findings and unresolved challenges, such as the precise determination of the hypertriton binding energy, investigations of charge symmetry breaking in mirror hypernuclei, and the search for exotic systems, including the neutral nn$\Lambda$ state. Experimental breakthroughs, including invariant-mass analyses and femtoscopy studies in heavy-ion collisions, as well as high-resolution $\gamma$-spectroscopy, have enabled precise studies of light hypernuclei and offered critical insights into the hyperon-nucleon interaction. Theoretical progress, including ab initio calculations based on chiral effective field theory and lattice QCD, has further enhanced our understanding of hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions.</description>
