      <title>Nonreciprocal spin waves in out-of-plane magnetized waveguides reconfigured by domain wall displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave-based platforms for novel unconventional computing approaches like neuromorphic computing require a well-defined, but adjustable flow of wave information combined with non-volatile data storage elements to implement weights which allow for training and learning. Due to their inherent nonreciprocal properties and their direct physical interaction with magnetic data storage, spin waves are ideal candidates to realize such platforms. In the present study, we show how spin-wave nonreciprocity induced by dipolar interactions of nanowaveguides with antiparallel, out-of-plane magnetization orientations can be used to create a spin-wave circulator allowing for unidirectional information transport and complex signal routing. In addition, the device can be reconfigured by a magnetic domain wall with adjustable position, which allows for a non-volatile tuning of the nonreciprocity and signal propagation. These properties are demonstrated for a spin-wave directional coupler through a combination of micromagnetic simulations and analytical modeling also showing that it functions as a waveguide crossing element, tunable power splitter, isolator, and frequency multiplexer. As magnetic material, out-of-plane magnetized Bismuth-doped Yttrium Iron Garnet has been considered. For this material, the motion of domain walls by magnonic spin transfer torque has been recently experimentally demonstrated which enables to store results from spin-wave computation. In combination with the presented concept of domain wall based reconfiguration and nonlinear spin-wave dynamics, this enables for the creation of a nano-scaled nonlinear wave computing platform with the capability for self-learning.</description>

      <title>An infinite grid of mesoscopic resistors: investigation and visualization of ballistic conduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A square lattice of mesoscopic resistors is considered. Each bond is modeled as a narrow waveguide, while junctions are sources of elastic scattering given by a scattering matrix \mathbf{S}. Symmetry and unitarity constraints are used in a detailed way to simplify all possible matrices \mathbf{S}. Energetic band structure of the system is determined and visualized for exemplary parameters. Conductance between external electrodes attached to two arbitrary nodes is given by the Landauer formula. Thus the transmittance between the electrodes is calculated. The rest of the paper is devoted to studying wave function patterns arising from an electron injected through one electrode into the system. It is observed that depending on its energy both dull and localized or intricate and expansive patterns occur. It is justified mathematically that fitting electron energy into an energy band can be associated with emergence of complex patterns. Finally, possible experimental realizations of the considered model are briefly mentioned.</description>

      <title>Sequential topology: iterative topological phase transitions in finite chiral structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theoretical and experimental results probing the rich topological structure of arbitrarily disordered finite tight binding Hamiltonians with chiral symmetry. We extend the known classification by considering the topological properties of phase boundaries themselves. That is, can Hamiltonians that are confined to being topologically marginal, also have distinct topological phases? For chiral structures, we answer this in the affirmative, where we define topological phase boundaries as having an unavoidable increase in the degeneracy of real space zero modes. By iterating this question, and considering how to enforce a Hamiltonian to a phase boundary, we give a protocol to find the largest dimension subspace of a disordered parameter space that has a certain order degeneracy of zero energy states, which we call \textit{sequential topology}. We show such degeneracy alters localisation and transport properties of zero modes, allowing us to experimentally corroborate our theory using a state-of-the-art coaxial cable platform. Our theory applies to systems with an arbitrary underlying connectivity or disorder, and so can be calculated for any finite chiral structure. Technological and theoretical applications of our work are discussed.</description>

      <title>Effects of Coupling Between Chiral Vibrations and Spins in Molecular Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In single molecular magnets, chiral vibrations carrying vibrational angular momentum ($\hat{L}^{\text{vib}}$) emerge due to the splitting of a doubly degenerate vibrational mode. Here, we identify a new type of effective spin-vibrational coupling responsible for lifting this degeneracy, which can facilitate optically selective excitations. In the presence of an external Zeeman field, this coupling breaks both inversion (in-plane parity) $\mathcal{P}$ and time-reversal $\mathcal{T}$ symmetries, imparting distinct geometric phases to the resulting dressed spin-vibronic states. The wave function of the spin-vibronic state is characterized by a $\pi$-Berry phase, which results in magneto-optical circular dichroism. This framework is validated using density functional theory and multi-reference \emph{ab initio} calculations on the Ce(trenovan) molecular magnet.</description>

      <title>Inelastic tunneling into multipolaronic bound states in single-layer MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarons are quasiparticles that arise from the interaction of electrons or holes with lattice vibrations. Though polarons are well-studied across multiple disciplines, experimental observations of polarons in two-dimensional crystals are sparse. We use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to measure inelastic excitations of polaronic bound states emerging from coupling of non-polar zone-boundary phonons to Bloch electrons in n-doped metallic single-layer MoS$_2$. The latter is kept chemically pristine via contactless chemical doping. Tunneling into the vibrationally coupled polaronic states leads to a series of evenly spaced peaks in the differential conductance on either side of the Fermi level. Combining density functional (perturbation) theory with a recently developed ab initio electron-lattice downfolding technique, we show that the energy spacing stems from the longitudinal-acoustic phonon mode that flattens at the Brillouin zone edge and is responsible for the formation of stable multipolarons in metallic MoS$_2$.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport signatures of spin-orbit coupling in high-temperature cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin transport in superconductors offers a compelling platform to merge the dissipationless nature of superconductivity with the functional promise of spin-based electronics. A significant challenge in achieving spin polarisation in conventional superconductors stems from the singlet state of Cooper pairs, which exhibit no net spin. The generation of spin-polarised carriers, quasiparticles, or triplet pairs in superconductors has predominantly been realised in hybrid superconductor/ferromagnet systems through proximity-induced spin polarisation. Historically, cuprate superconductors have been characterised by strong electronic correlations but negligible spin-orbit coupling. Here, we report exceptionally large anisotropic magnetoresistance and a pronounced planar Hall effect arising near the superconducting phase transition in the prototypical high-temperature cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu3O7-x without using a proximity ferromagnet. These effects, unprecedented in centrosymmetric cuprates, emerge from spin-polarised quasiparticle transport mediated by strong spin-orbit coupling. By systematically tuning magnetic field strength, orientation, temperature, and doping, we show clear evidence of spin-orbit-driven transport phenomena in a material class long thought to lack such interactions. Our findings reveal an unexpected spin-orbit landscape in cuprates and open a route to engineer spintronic functionalities in high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Angle-dependent resonant tunneling and thermoelectric energy management in a hybrid 1D-2D-1D semiconductor nanostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional semiconductors have been widely exploited in thermoelectric energy conversion for high efficiencies due to their suppressed lattice thermal conduction, sharply defined electronic density of states, and tunable energy-selective electron transmission. However, the widespread challenge of Fermi-level pinning or doping constraints limit precise control over thermoelectric energy management via chemical potential modulation. Here, we proposed an alternative strategy: leveraging angle-dependent electron incidence to dynamically manipulate electron transmission and heat transport, which was implemented theoretically in a two-dimensional InP/InAs/InP double-barrier heterostructure integrated with laterally one-dimensional electrodes. By combining the transfer matrix method and Landauer formalism, we demonstrated the angle-dependent resonant tunneling dynamics, tunable negative differential resistance effect, and near-Carnot limits in thermoelectric energy conversions. Angular modulation enables precise control over transmission resonances, facilitating dynamic transitions among thermoelectric regimes (power generation, cooling, and hybrid heating) without requiring extreme chemical potential shifts. This work establishes angularly resolved electron transmission as a versatile mechanism for on-chip thermal management and cryogenic applications, offering a pathway to circumvent material limitations in next-generation nanoelectronics and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of the Fundamental Plasma Excitation in a Plasmonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the experimental study of the spectrum of plasma excitations in a plasmonic crystal fabricated from the two-dimensional electron system in an AlGaAs/GaAs semiconductor heterostructure. Our results reveal that the plasmonic crystal supports only a single fundamental plasma mode, challenging the current theoretical understanding that anticipates multiple modes. This unexpected finding is supported by comprehensive research on the mode frequency and relaxation as a function of the gate width across different plasmonic crystal periods. Furthermore, we develop an analytical approach that accurately describes the behavior of plasma excitations in plasmonic crystals, providing new insights into the fundamental physics of plasmonic systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Ohmic behavior in (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ by Joule heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A prerequisite to using the net spin polarization generated by a source-drain bias in three-dimensional topological insulators for spintronic applications, is understanding how such a bias alters the transport properties of these materials. At low temperatures, quantum corrections can dominate the temperature dependence of the resistance. Although a DC bias does not break time-reversal symmetry and is therefore not expected to suppress quantum corrections, an increase of the electron temperature due to Joule heating can cause a suppression. This suppression at finite bias can lead to a non-Ohmic differential resistance in the three-dimensional topological insulator (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$, consisting of a zero-bias resistance peak (from electron-electron interactions) and a high-bias background (from weak antilocalization). We show that the bias voltage dependence of quantum corrections can be mapped to the temperature dependence, while the heating effect on the lattice temperature remains small. When searching for non-Ohmic effects due to novel phenomena in three-dimensional topological insulators, Joule heating should not be overlooked.</description>

      <title>Resistivity of non-Galilean invariant two dimensional Dirac system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisited the influence of electron-electron scattering on the resistivity of a two-dimensional system with linear spectrum. In conventional systems with parabolic spectrum, where Umklapp scattering is either prohibited or ineffective due to small Fermi surface, particle-particle scattering does not contribute to conductivity because it does not change the total momentum. However, within the framework of Boltzmann kinetic model, we demonstrate that electron-electron scattering in Dirac systems can significantly contribute to conductivity, producing distinct temperature-dependent corrections: a T\textsuperscript{4} behavior at low temperatures and T\textsuperscript{2} dependence at moderate temperatures. While the predicted T\textsuperscript{4} scaling is not observed experimentally -- likely suppressed by dominant weak localization effects -- the T\textsuperscript{2} scaling is clearly confirmed in our measurements. Specifically, temperature-dependent resistivity data from gapless single-valley HgTe quantum well exhibit T\textsuperscript{2} corrections, which align well with theoretical predictions. Thus, we challenge the paradigm that T\textsuperscript{2} term in resistivity is absent in single-band 2D metals.</description>

Abstract: We show that Hamiltonian for mixed parity superconductivity can be recast into that for magnetism with spin-orbit coupling by the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, indicating that mixed parity superconductivity and magnetism with spin-orbit coupling can share the same physics. As demonstrations, we discuss the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type interactions, magnetoelectric effect, supercurrent-induced spin current, and altermagnetism in mixed parity superconductors. All these effects originate purely from mixed parity superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Flat band mediated photon-photon interactions in 2D waveguide QED networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a Lieb lattice of quantum emitters coupled to a two-dimensional waveguide network and demonstrate that this system supports an energetically isolated flat band, enabling localization despite the presence of long-range photon-mediated couplings. We then explore the two-excitation dynamics in both the softcore and hardcore interaction regimes, which arise from the nonlinearity of the emitters. In the softcore regime, we observe interaction-induced photon transport within the flat band, mediated by the formation of bound photon pairs. In the hardcore regime, corresponding to the two-level atom limit, we instead find the emergence of metastable exciton-like dressed states involving both flat and dispersive bands. Our findings highlight how the interplay between the collective behavior of emitters and effective photon-photon interactions can provide a platform for studying highly correlated photonic states in flat-band systems.</description>

      <title>Temporal coherence of single photons emitted by hexagonal Boron Nitride defects at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) emerge as promising quantum light sources at room temperature, with potential applications in quantum communications, among others. The temporal coherence of emitted photons (i.e. their capacity to interfere and distribute photonic entanglement) is essential for many of these applications. Hence, it is crucial to study and determine the temporal coherence of this emission under different experimental conditions. In this work, we report the coherence time of the single photons emitted by an hBN defect in a nanocrystal at room temperature, measured via Michelson interferometry. The visibility of this interference vanishes when the temporal delay between the interferometer arms is a few hundred femtoseconds, highlighting that the phonon dephasing processes are four orders of magnitude faster than the spontaneous decay time of the emitter. We also analyze the single photon characteristics of the emission via correlation measurements, defect blinking dynamics, and its Debye-Waller factor. Our room temperature results highlight the presence of a strong phonon-electron coupling, suggesting the need to work at cryogenic temperatures to enable quantum photonic applications based on photon interference.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Nanoparticle-in-nanoslit Antenna as Independently Tunable Dual-Resonant Systems for Efficient Frequency Upconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dual-band plasmonic nanoantennas, exhibiting two widely separated user-defined resonances, are fundamental building blocks for the investigation and optimization of plasmon-enhanced optical phenomena, including photoluminescence, Raman scattering, and various nonlinear effects such as harmonic generation or sum-frequency generation, parametric down-conversion, etc. The nanoparticle-in-slit (NPiS) or nanoparticle-in-groove (NPiG) is a recently proposed dual-band antenna with independently tunable resonances at mid-infrared and visible wavelengths. It was used to enhance the corresponding sum- and difference-frequency generation processes from optimally located molecules by an estimated $10^{13}$-fold. However, the theoretical understanding of such structures and their eigenmodes remains poor, hindering further optimization and limiting broader applications. Here, we explore a diverse range of nanocavity-like quasi-normal modes (QNMs) supported by NPiS structures, examining the contributions of both their near-field (i.e., giant photonic density of states) and far-field (i.e., spatial radiation patterns) characteristics to frequency upconversion. We identify methods for independently tuning the visible and mid-infrared resonances while conserving a good mode overlap in the near field, which is essential for efficient nonlinear processes. Moreover, through mode analysis, we unveil an experimentally unexplored fundamental resonance with greater field enhancement and much-improved mode overlap with the mid-infrared field, which could, in principle, further boost the mid-infrared upconversion efficiency by 5-fold compared to existing results. This work helps to rationalize and optimize the enhancement of nonlinear effects across a wide spectral range using a flexible and experimentally attractive nanoplasmonic platform.</description>

      <title>Crescent domain-wall pairs in anisotropic two-dimensional MnOI monolayer with fast dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The controllable and efficient manipulation is always a key challenge for the application of topological magnetic textures in spintronic devices. By first-principles calculations and atomistic simulations, the present work reveals an exotic domain-wall pair in crescent shape, which possesses topology in one dimension and particle-like robustness in two dimensions. Its antiferromagnetic version is observed in the two-dimensional MnOI monolayer with a strong anisotropy, and the ferromagnetic version exists under an appropriate strain. Both of them can be driven efficiently by current to move in a straight line along a certain direction. Hereby, another possible path is provided to realize the application of topological magnetic texture in the next-generation high-speed spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Topological surface states in {\gamma}-PtBi$_2$ evidenced by scanning tunneling microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the application of topological materials, the specific location of their topological surface states with respect to the Fermi level are important. {\gamma}-PtBi2 has been demonstrated to be a Weyl semimetal possessing superconducting Fermi arcs by photoemission spectroscopy. However, the evidence of its topological surface states is lacking by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), which should be rather sensitive to detect the surface states. Here, we show multiple STM evidences for the existence of topological surface states in {\gamma}-PtBi2. We observe not only the step-edge and screw dislocation induced quasiparticle interference fringes, originating from the electron scatterings between the Fermi arcs of {\gamma}-PtBi2, but also the back-scattering prohibition related to the spin-flip process, which is the direct evidence for the topological nature of the surface states. Moreover, we demonstrate that the topological surface states are precisely located over a narrow energy range near the Fermi level, within which sharply enhanced intensity and slow spatial decay of quasiparticle interference are observed.</description>

      <title>Effect of crystallinity on spin-orbit torque in 5$\textit{d}$ iridium oxide IrO$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 5$\textit{d}$ transition-metal oxides provide an intriguing platform for generating an efficient spin current due to a unique electronic structure dominated by 5d electrons with strong spin-orbit coupling. Here, we report on the effect of crystallinity on current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT) in binary 5$\textit{d}$ iridium oxide IrO$_{2}$ thin films by controlling amorphous, polycrystalline, and epitaxial states. By conducting harmonic Hall measurement in bilayers composed of ferromagnetic Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ and IrO$_{2}$, we find that dampinglike (DL) SOT is larger than fieldlike SOT for all the samples. We also demonstrate that both electrical resistivity and the DL SOT efficiency increase in order of epitaxial, polycrystalline, and amorphous IrO$_{2}$. Despite their different electrical conductivities, spin Hall conductivities of the three states of the IrO$_{2}$ layer are found to be nearly constant, which is consistent with the intrinsic regime of the spin Hall effect scaling relation. Our results highlight the important role that crystallinity plays in the spin-current generation, leading to the potential technological development of spintronic devices based on the 5$\textit{d}$ transition-metal oxides.</description>

      <title>Theory of Quasi-Statically Screened Electron-Polar Optical Phonon Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scattering of electrons with polar optical phonons (POP) is an important mechanism that limits electronic transport and determines electron mobility in polar materials. This is typically a stronger mechanism compared to non-polar acoustic and optical phonon scattering, and of similar strength to the Coulomb ionized impurity scattering. At high densities, on the other hand, the cloud of charge carriers screens the dipoles that are responsible for POP scattering, and weakens the electron-POP scattering strength. However, in contrast to ionized impurity scattering, for which the well-known Brooks-Herring equation provides the scattering rates with the effect of screening included, for scattering with POP there is no such closed-form mathematical expression. In this work, we derive such an expression based on Fermi's Golden Rule, which would prove particularly useful in understanding electronic transport in complex crystal and complex band structure materials, in which electron-POP scattering could dominate electronic transport.</description>

      <title>Coherent Spectroscopic Probes of Topology: A Velocity-Gauge Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a velocity-gauge formalism for computing nonlinear current response functions in periodic systems and apply it to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as a minimal topological testbed. By retaining the full minimal coupling Hamiltonian and avoiding the rotating wave approximation, we construct gauge-consistent expressions for the linear and third-order current susceptibilities using retarded Green's functions. Our results reveal how nonlinear optical spectra encode not only energy-level transitions but also interband phase coherence and topological winding. In the topological phase, the third-order response exhibits characteristic phase inversions and spectral asymmetries that are absent in the trivial phase. These features reflect geometric changes in the Bloch eigenstates and highlight the role of virtual pathways in shaping the nonlinear signal. Our framework offers a robust and extensible platform for modeling nonlinear light-matter interactions in topological materials beyond the dipole approximation and the standard Coulomb-gauge formulation in molecular spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high precision measurements of the radiative heat transfer of a glass microsphere immersed in a thermal bath in vacuum facing three different planar substrates (SiO2, SiC and Au), which exhibit very different optical behaviors in the infrared region. Using a thermoresistive probe on a cantilever, we show the nonmonotonic behavior of the radiative flux between the microsphere and its environment when the microsphere is brought closer to the substrate in the far-field to near-field transition regime. We demonstrate that this unexpected behavior is related to the singularities of dressed emission mechanisms in this three-body system sphere-substrate-bath with respect to the separation distance.</description>

      <title>Robust Wave Splitters Based on Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent perfect absorption (CPA) is well-known as a phenomenon where all the energy of a specific injected wavefront is completely absorbed by losses in a system, independent of details. This has applications in wavefront shaping, communication, filtering, wireless power transfer, etc. We have discovered an application of coherent perfect absorption enabling conditions as a tunable splitter that is robust to any change in relative amplitude or phase of an arbitrary injected waveform. We show experimentally that the fixed splitting ratios and output phases at CPA enabling conditions are robust to 100 dB of relative power and 2$\pi$ phase changes of the input waves to a complex non-Hermitian two-port system. We also demonstrate that the splitting power ratio can be tuned by multiple orders of magnitude and the CPA enabling conditions can be tuned to any desired frequency with suitable tunable perturbations embedded in the system. Although this phenomenon is realized in two-port systems, tunable robust splitting can be achieved between any two ports of multiport systems. These results are general to all wave scattering phenomena and hold in generic complex scattering systems.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Rashba and Dirac dispersions on the surface of centrosymmetric topological insulator decorated with transition metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dirac cone originates from the bulk topology, yet its primary contribution comes from the surface since spatially, the Dirac state emerges at the boundary between the trivial and topological phases. At the same time, the Rashba states emerge in regions where inversion symmetry is broken. On the surface of the centrosymmetric topological insulators, both Rashba and Dirac bands are present and their hybridization produces the giant Rashba effect, modifying both Rashba's and Dirac's bands. Therefore, pure Rashba and Dirac fermions are inherently incompatible on the surface of centrosymmetric topological insulators if the material is homogeneous. Inspired by recent experiments, we focused on the (111) polar surface of PbSe, which becomes a topological crystalline insulator under compressive strain, and we established the conditions under which a topological system can simultaneously host pure Rashba and Dirac surface states close to the Fermi level. The coexistence of pure Dirac and Rashba dispersions is only possible in a non-homogeneous centrosymmetric topological insulator, where the spatial origins of the two bands are effectively separated. In the experimentally observed case of PbSe, we demonstrate that a metallic overlayer induces a strong electrostatic potential gradient in the subsurface region, which in turn generates the electric field responsible for Rashba splitting in the subsurface layers. Consequently, in PbSe(111), the Rashba states arise from subsurface layers, while the Dirac states live mainly on the surface layers. Finally, we compare the properties of the Rashba in the trivial and topological phases; the calculated Rashba coefficient agrees qualitatively with the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Ferromagnetism in Monolayer Cr2Te3 via Topological Insulator Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exchange-coupled interfaces are pivotal in exploiting two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetism. Due to the extraordinary correlations among charge, spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom, layered magnetic transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) bode well for exotic topological phenomena. Here we report the realization of wafer-scale Cr2Te3 down to monolayer (ML) on insulating SrTiO3(111) and/or Al2O3(001) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Robust ferromagnetism persists in the 2D limit. In particular, the Curie temperature TC of 2 ML Cr2Te3 increases from 100 K to ~ 120 K when proximitized to topological insulator (TI) (Bi,Sb)2Te3, with substantially boosted magnetization as observed via polarized neutron reflectometry. Our experiments and theory strongly indicate that the Bloembergen-Rowland interaction is likely universal underlying TC enhancement in TI-coupled magnetic heterostructures. The topological-surface-enhanced magnetism in 2D TMC enables further exchange coupling physics and quantum hybrid studies, including paving the way to realize interface-modulated topological electronics.</description>

Abstract: The identification of topological Weyl semimetals has recently gained considerable attention. Here, we report the results of density-functional theory calculations regarding the magnetic properties, the electronic structure, and the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of the title compound, which was synthesized already 50 years ago but received little attention, hitherto. We found Cs$_{2}$Co$_{3}$S$_4$ to be a ferrimagnetic half-metal with a total spin magnetic moment of about 3 $\mu_B$ per formula unit. It shows energy band gap of 0.36 eV in the majority-spin channel and a pseudo-gap at the Fermi level in the minority-spin channel. We identified several sets of low-energy Weyl points and traced their dependence on the direction of magnetization. The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity is predicted to reach a magnitude up to 500 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$, which is comparable to values obtained in other celebrated Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics to show that plastic slip is a crucial component of the transformation mechanism of a square-to-triangular structural transition. The latter is a stylized analog of many other reconstructive phase transitions. To justify our conclusions we use a novel atomistically-informed mesoscopic representation of the field of lattice distortions in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may be also interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.</description>

      <title>General recipe for immediate entanglement death-birth transitions via Bell states: environmental Heisenberg exchange as an example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environment is known to play a dual role in both extinguishing and establishing entanglement, leading to entanglement sudden death (ESD) and entanglement sudden birth (ESB). In this paper, we propose a recipe for the initial states of two qubits to undergo ESD, ESB, or transition of finite duration (TFD) between them. While this recipe is \emph{generally independent of the interaction}, a spin-star model with environmental Heisenberg exchange is chosen for illustration. Utilizing the Bell states, we introduce the entanglement switch parameter (ESP), whose sign indicates whether the qubit bipartite entanglement is switched on or off. The classical (quantum) weighting of the Bell states encodes the ESP for initial mixed (pure) states. When more than two Bell states are adopted, the ESP permits states to penetrate through the entanglement-unentanglement boundary. In this case, the penetrability of a small ESP ensures the immediate occurrence of ESD or ESB and indicates the TFD if the local time-even symmetry in the entanglement monotone is also satisfied. When no more than two Bell states are employed, the penetrability is lost, and TFD is only identified in some mixed states but not in pure states; here for pure states, the environmental quantum degrees of freedom are associated with the number of Bell states. Thanks to the simplicity of this model, analytic results are provided. We also analyze the symmetries that can convert or alter ESD into ESB, and vice versa. The recipe enhances the controllability of entanglement dynamics and facilitates entanglement engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a density-imbalanced bilayer Wigner crystal, where the ratio of electron densities in separate layers deviates slightly from unity, defects spontaneously form in one or both layers in the ground state of the system. Due to quantum tunneling, these defects become mobile and the system becomes a defect liquid. Motivated by this idea, we numerically study the semiclassical energetics of individual and paired point defects in the bilayer Wigner crystal system. We use these results in combination with a simple defect model to map the phase diagram of the defect liquid as a function of electron density and interlayer distance. Our results should be relevant for present experimental bilayer Wigner crystal systems.</description>

      <title>The Non-Local Dual Phase Lag Model of Heat Conduction in a Silicon Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the transistors and consequently the chips are getting smaller, the accurate investigation of heat transport at micro/nanoscale, becomes an important issue of concern. This is due to an increase in the energy consumption and the leakage currents as a result of the miniaturization which requires taking care of the thermal behavior to make sure that the device is working in the threshold temperature regime. The current work deals with a two-dimensional framework, incorporating the nonlocality in space, for more accurate investigation of the nanoscale heat transport using the lower computational cost phenomenological macroscopical Dual Phase Lag (DPL) method. The non dimensional non-locality parameter {\gamma}, which indicates the strength of the non-locality, is embedded through the modified DPL model named as nonlocal DPL. It is obtained that for the two-dimensional silicon transistor, the {\gamma} parameter in x and y direction has the same value and like its behavior at one-dimension, is linearly dependent on the Knudsen number, being 1.5 for Kn=10 and 0.015 for Kn=0.1. Also, the phase lagging ratio, B, is found to be 0.08. It should be mentioned that the non-locality effect is more pronounced for smaller systems with higher Knudsen number in which the non-Fourier behavior is more evident but contemplating the non-locality parameter in systems with lower Knudsen number, makes the results more precise. In brief, it is confirmed that taking into account the {\gamma} parameter is noteworthy for accurately predicting the thermal behavior in micro/nano scale systems using the classical macroscopical methods.</description>

Abstract: Ultrafast optical excitation provides a powerful route for accessing emergent quantum phases far from equilibrium, enabling transient light-induced phenomena such as magnetism, ferroelectricity, and superconductivity. However, extending this approach to induce topological phases, especially in conventional semiconductors, remains challenging. Here, we report the observation of a thermally inaccessible, transient topological crystalline order in the layered semiconductor SnSe, a trivial insulator with a sizable (~ 0.8 eV) band gap, induced by femtosecond above-gap excitation. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy directly reveals the sub-picosecond emergence of Dirac-like linear dispersions within the band gap. Their features, including a high Fermi velocity (~ 2.5x10^5 m/s), multiple Dirac points away from high-symmetry momenta, and independence from probe photon energy, are consistent with mirror-symmetry-protected surface states of a topological crystalline insulator. The observed spectral dynamics, combined with density functional theory calculations, indicate that the femtosecond excitation transiently increases lattice symmetry, enabling topological crystalline order to emerge. Our discovery opens new avenues for ultrafast optical control of topological quantum phases in semiconductors, with potential applications in quantum and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Dominant orbital magnetization in the prototypical altermagnet MnTe</title>

Abstract: Altermagnetism is an unconventional form of antiferromagnetism characterized by momentum-dependent spin polarization of electronic states and zero net magnetization, arising from specific crystalline symmetries. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and broken time-reversal symmetry, altermagnets can exhibit finite net magnetization and anomalous Hall effect (AHE), phenomena typically associated with ferromagnets. Due to the dependence of AHE on magnetization, understanding the interplay between spin and orbital contributions to magnetization is essential for interpreting experiments and designing altermagnetic devices. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the intrinsic spin and orbital magnetization of the magnetic ground state of the prototypical altermagnet {\alpha}-MnTe. We find that SOC induces weak ferromagnetism through spin canting, accompanied by a slight in-plane rotation of the N\'eel vector. Notably, we identify a significant net orbital magnetization of 0.176 {\mu}B per unit cell oriented along the z-axis, while the spin magnetization in the same direction is much smaller at 0.002 {\mu}B. By varying the chemical potential, we show that the spin magnetization is tunable through hole doping, whereas the orbital magnetization remains robust against carrier density changes. These results highlight the important role of orbital magnetization and establish its relevance for orbital-based phenomena in altermagnets.</description>
