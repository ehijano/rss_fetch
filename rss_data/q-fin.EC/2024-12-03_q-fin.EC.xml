      <title>Macroeconomics of Racial Disparities: Discrimination, Labor Market, and Wealth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of racial discrimination in hiring on employment, wage, and wealth disparities between black and white workers. Using a labor search-and-matching model with racially prejudiced and non-prejudiced firms, we show that labor market frictions sustain discriminatory practices as an equilibrium outcome. These practices account for 44% to 52% of the average wage gap and 16% of the median wealth gap. Discriminatory hiring also amplifies unemployment and wage volatility for black workers, increasing their labor market risks over business cycles. Eliminating prejudiced firms reduces these disparities and improves black workers' welfare, though it slightly decreases overall economic welfare.</description>

      <title>Effects of time aggregation, product aggregation, and seasonality in measuring bullwhip ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bullwhip study has received a lot of attention in the literature, but with conflicting results, especially in the context of data aggregation. In this paper, we investigate three widely studied factors in bullwhip measurement: time aggregation, product aggregation, and seasonality. In time aggregation, we decompose the variance into two components: the expectation of the subset variances and the variance of subset expectations, thus decomposing the bullwhip ratio into four components to explore the underlying mechanism of time aggregation. In product aggregation, the bullwhip ratio is analyzed in the context of products with either uncorrelated or correlated demands and orders. Seasonality is also examined to study its effect on the bullwhip ratio. Our key findings are: (a) Time aggregation can increase, decrease, or maintain the bullwhip ratio in different scenarios. (b) Aggregated bullwhip ratio of uncorrelated products is a weighted average of bullwhip ratios from individual products, with corresponding demand variance as the weights. However, aggregated bullwhip ratio of correlated products could break the boundaries. (c) Seasonality can be considered as a standalone product with a bullwhip ratio of one, which can drive the overall bullwhip ratio closer to one.</description>

      <title>Thermal Macroeconomics: An axiomatic theory of aggregate economic phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An axiomatic approach to macroeconomics based on the mathematical structure of thermodynamics is presented. It deduces relations between aggregate properties of an economy, concerning quantities and flows of goods and money, prices and the value of money, without any recourse to microeconomic foundations about the preferences and actions of individual economic agents. The approach has three important payoffs. 1) it provides a new and solid foundation for aspects of standard macroeconomic theory such as the existence of market prices, the value of money, the meaning of inflation, the symmetry and negative-definiteness of the macro-Slutsky matrix, and the Le Chatelier-Samuelson principle, without relying on implausibly strong rationality assumptions over individual microeconomic agents. 2) the approach generates new results, including implications for money flow and trade when two or more economies are put in contact, in terms of new concepts such as economic entropy, economic temperature, goods' values and money capacity. Some of these are related to standard economic concepts (eg marginal utility of money, market prices). Yet our approach derives them at a purely macroeconomic level and gives them a meaning independent of usual restrictions. Others of the concepts, such as economic entropy and temperature, have no direct counterparts in standard economics, but they have important economic interpretations and implications, as aggregate utility and the inverse marginal aggregate utility of money, respectively. 3) this analysis promises to open up new frontiers in macroeconomics by building a bridge to ideas from non-equilibrium thermodynamics. More broadly, we hope that the economic analogue of entropy (governing the possible transitions between states of economic systems) may prove to be as fruitful for the social sciences as entropy has been in the natural sciences.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Approach to Demand Estimation and Dynamic Pricing in Retail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper contributes to the literature on parametric demand estimation by using deep learning to model consumer preferences. Traditional econometric methods often struggle with limited within-product price variation, a challenge addressed by the proposed neural network approach. The proposed method estimates the functional form of the demand and demonstrates higher performance in both simulations and empirical applications. Notably, under low price variation, the machine learning model outperforms econometric approaches, reducing the mean squared error of initial price parameter estimates by nearly threefold. In empirical setting, the ML model consistently predicts a negative relationship between demand and price in 100% of cases, whereas the econometric approach fails to do so in 20% of cases. The suggested model incorporates a wide range of product characteristics, as well as prices of other products and competitors.</description>

      <title>Pollution and Mortality: Evidence from early 20th Century Sweden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01532v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economic growth in Sweden during the early 20th Century was largely driven by industry. A significant contributor to this growth was the installation of different kinds of engines used to power factories. We use newly digitized data on engines and their energy source by industry sector, and combine this with municipality-level data of workers per industry sector to construct a new variable reflecting economic output using dirty engines. In turn, we assess the average externality of dirty output on mortality in the short-run, as defined by deaths over the population in the baseline year. Our results show substantial increases of up to 17% higher mortality in cities where large increases to dirty engine installations occurred, which is largely driven by the elderly. We also run a placebo test using clean powered industry and find no effect on mortality.</description>

      <title>The Promise and Peril of Generative AI: Evidence from GPT-4 as Sell-Side Analysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how advanced large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, process corporate disclosures to forecast earnings. Using earnings press releases issued around GPT-4's knowledge cutoff date, we address two questions: (1) Do GPT-generated earnings forecasts outperform analysts in accuracy? (2) How is GPT's performance related to its processing of textual and quantitative information? Our findings suggest that GPT forecasts are significantly less accurate than those of analysts. This underperformance can be traced to GPT's distinct textual and quantitative approaches: its textual processing follows a consistent, generalized pattern across firms, highlighting its strengths in language tasks. In contrast, its quantitative processing capabilities vary significantly across firms, revealing limitations tied to the uneven availability of domain-specific training data. Additionally, there is some evidence that GPT's forecast accuracy diminishes beyond its knowledge cutoff, underscoring the need to evaluate LLMs under hindsight-free conditions. Overall, this study provides a novel exploration of the "black box" of GPT-4's information processing, offering insights into LLMs' potential and challenges in financial applications.</description>

      <title>The increasing share of low-value transactions in international trade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper documents a new feature of international trade: the increase in the share of low-value transactions in the total volume of transactions. Using Spanish data, we show that the share of low-value transactions in the total number of transactions increased from 9% to 61% in exports and from 14% to 54% in imports between 1997 and 2023. The increase in the number of low-value trade transactions is explained by the rise of e-commerce and direct-to-customer sales facilitated by online retail platforms, and the fast-fashion strategy followed by clothing firms.</description>

      <title>Note on solving one-to-one matching models with linear transferable utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a system of fixed-point equations for the equilibrium transfers in a class of one-to-one matching models with linear transferable utility. We then show that, when the degree of substitution between alternatives is bounded from above, the derived system of equations constitutes a contraction mapping. As a result, fixed-point iterations are guaranteed to converge to the unique distribution of equilibrium transfers.</description>

      <title>Enhancing supply chain security with automated machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of global supply chains have led to new challenges spanning various fields, such as supply chain disruptions due to long waiting lines at the ports, material shortages, and inflation. Coupled with the size of supply chains and the availability of vast amounts of data, efforts towards tackling such challenges have led to an increasing interest in applying machine learning methods in many aspects of supply chains. Unlike other solutions, ML techniques, including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Neural Networks, make predictions and approximate optimal solutions faster. This paper presents an automated ML framework to enhance supply chain security by detecting fraudulent activities, predicting maintenance needs, and forecasting material backorders. Using datasets of varying sizes, results show that fraud detection achieves an 88% accuracy rate using sampling methods, machine failure prediction reaches 93.4% accuracy, and material backorder prediction achieves 89.3% accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning significantly improved the performance of these models, with certain supervised techniques like XGBoost and LightGBM reaching up to 100% precision. This research contributes to supply chain security by streamlining data preprocessing, feature selection, model optimization, and inference deployment, addressing critical challenges and boosting operational efficiency.</description>

      <title>InvestESG: A multi-agent reinforcement learning benchmark for studying climate investment as a social dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: InvestESG is a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) benchmark designed to study the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosure mandates on corporate climate investments. Supported by both PyTorch and JAX implementation, the benchmark models an intertemporal social dilemma where companies balance short-term profit losses from climate mitigation efforts and long-term benefits from reducing climate risk, while ESG-conscious investors attempt to influence corporate behavior through their investment decisions, in a scalable and hardware-accelerated manner. Companies allocate capital across mitigation, greenwashing, and resilience, with varying strategies influencing climate outcomes and investor preferences. Our experiments show that without ESG-conscious investors with sufficient capital, corporate mitigation efforts remain limited under the disclosure mandate. However, when a critical mass of investors prioritizes ESG, corporate cooperation increases, which in turn reduces climate risks and enhances long-term financial stability. Additionally, providing more information about global climate risks encourages companies to invest more in mitigation, even without investor involvement. Our findings align with empirical research using real-world data, highlighting MARL's potential to inform policy by providing insights into large-scale socio-economic challenges through efficient testing of alternative policy and market designs.</description>
