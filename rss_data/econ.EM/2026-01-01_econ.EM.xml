      <title>Extrapolating LATE with Weak IVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To evaluate the effectiveness of a counterfactual policy, it is often necessary to extrapolate treatment effects on compliers to broader populations. This extrapolation relies on exogenous variation in instruments, which is often weak in practice. This limited variation leads to invalid confidence intervals that are typically too short and cannot be accurately detected by classical methods. For instance, the F-test may falsely conclude that the instruments are strong. Consequently, I develop inference results that are valid even with limited variation in the instruments. These results lead to asymptotically valid confidence sets for various linear functionals of marginal treatment effects, including LATE, ATE, ATT, and policy-relevant treatment effects, regardless of identification strength. This is the first paper to provide weak instrument robust inference results for this class of parameters. Finally, I illustrate my results using data from Agan, Doleac, and Harvey (2023) to analyze counterfactual policies of changing prosecutors' leniency and their effects on reducing recidivism.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Counterfactual Policies Using Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study settings in which a researcher has an instrumental variable (IV) and seeks to evaluate the effects of a counterfactual policy that alters treatment assignment, such as a directive encouraging randomly assigned judges to release more defendants. We develop a general and computationally tractable framework for computing sharp bounds on the effects of such policies. Our approach does not require the often tenuous IV monotonicity assumption. Moreover, for an important class of policy exercises, we show that IV monotonicity -- while crucial for a causal interpretation of two-stage least squares -- does not tighten the bounds on the counterfactual policy impact. We analyze the identifying power of alternative restrictions, including the policy invariance assumption used in the marginal treatment effect literature, and develop a relaxation of this assumption. We illustrate our framework using applications to quasi-random assignment of bail judges in New York City and prosecutors in Massachusetts.</description>

      <title>Testing Monotonicity in a Finite Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the extent to which we can learn from a completely randomized experiment whether everyone has treatment effects that are weakly of the same sign, a condition we call monotonicity. From a classical sampling perspective, it is well-known that monotonicity is untestable. By contrast, we show from the design-based perspective -- in which the units in the population are fixed and only treatment assignment is stochastic -- that the distribution of treatment effects in the finite population (and hence whether monotonicity holds) is formally identified. We argue, however, that the usual definition of identification is unnatural in the design-based setting because it imagines knowing the distribution of outcomes over different treatment assignments for the same units. We thus evaluate the informativeness of the data by the extent to which it enables frequentist testing and Bayesian updating. We show that frequentist tests can have nontrivial power against some alternatives, but power is generically limited. Likewise, we show that there exist (non-degenerate) Bayesian priors that never update about whether monotonicity holds. We conclude that, despite the formal identification result, the ability to learn about monotonicity from data in practice is severely limited.</description>

      <title>Compound Estimation for Binomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many applications involve estimating the mean of multiple binomial outcomes as a common problem -- assessing intergenerational mobility of census tracts, estimating prevalence of infectious diseases across countries, and measuring click-through rates for different demographic groups. The most standard approach is to report the plain average of each outcome. Despite simplicity, the estimates are noisy when the sample sizes or mean parameters are small. In contrast, the Empirical Bayes (EB) methods are able to boost the average accuracy by borrowing information across tasks. Nevertheless, the EB methods require a Bayesian model where the parameters are sampled from a prior distribution which, unlike the commonly-studied Gaussian case, is unidentified due to discreteness of binomial measurements. Even if the prior distribution is known, the computation is difficult when the sample sizes are heterogeneous as there is no simple joint conjugate prior for the sample size and mean parameter.
  In this paper, we consider the compound decision framework which treats the sample size and mean parameters as fixed quantities. We develop an approximate Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) for the average mean squared error given any class of estimators. For a class of machine learning-assisted linear shrinkage estimators, we establish asymptotic optimality, regret bounds, and valid inference. Unlike existing work, we work with the binomials directly without resorting to Gaussian approximations. This allows us to work with small sample sizes and/or mean parameters in both one-sample and two-sample settings. We demonstrate our approach using three datasets on firm discrimination, education outcomes, and innovation rates.</description>

      <title>Modewise Additive Factor Model for Matrix Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Modewise Additive Factor Model (MAFM) for matrix-valued time series that captures row-specific and column-specific latent effects through an additive structure, offering greater flexibility than multiplicative frameworks such as Tucker and CP factor models. In MAFM, each observation decomposes into a row-factor component, a column-factor component, and noise, allowing distinct sources of variation along different modes to be modeled separately. We develop a computationally efficient two-stage estimation procedure: Modewise Inner-product Eigendecomposition (MINE) for initialization, followed by Complement-Projected Alternating Subspace Estimation (COMPAS) for iterative refinement. The key methodological innovation is that orthogonal complement projections completely eliminate cross-modal interference when estimating each loading space. We establish convergence rates for the estimated factor loading matrices under proper conditions. We further derive asymptotic distributions for the loading matrix estimators and develop consistent covariance estimators, yielding a data-driven inference framework that enables confidence interval construction and hypothesis testing. As a technical contribution of independent interest, we establish matrix Bernstein inequalities for quadratic forms of dependent matrix time series. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Multivariate quantile regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new framework for multivariate quantile regression based on the multivariate distribution function, termed multivariate quantile regression (MQR). In contrast to existing approaches--such as directional quantiles, vector quantile regression, or copula-based methods--MQR defines quantiles through the conditional probability structure of the joint conditional distribution function. The method constructs multivariate quantile curves using sequential univariate quantile regressions derived from conditioning mechanisms, allowing for an intuitive interpretation and flexible estimation of marginal effects. The paper develops theoretical foundations of MQR, including asymptotic properties of the estimators. Through simulation exercises, the estimator demonstrates robust finite sample performance across different dependence structures. As an empirical application, the MQR framework is applied to the analysis of exchange rate pass-through in Argentina from 2004 to 2024.</description>

      <title>A further look at Modified ML estimation of the panel AR(1) model with fixed effects and arbitrary initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider two generalizations of Lancaster's (Review of Economic Studies, 2002) Modified ML estimator (MMLE) for the panel AR(1) model with fixed effects and arbitrary initial conditions and possibly covariates when the time dimension, T, is fixed. When the autoregressive parameter rho=1, the limiting modified profile log-likelihood function for this model has a stationary point of inflection and rho is first-order underidentified but second-order identified. We show that, unlike the Random Effects and Transformed MLEs for this type of model, the generalized MMLEs are uniquely defined in finite samples w.p.1. for any value of |rho| =&lt; 1. When rho=1, the rate of convergence of the MMLEs is N^{1/4}, where N is the cross-sectional dimension of the panel. We derive the limiting distributions of the MMLEs when rho=1. They are generally asymmetric. We also show that Quasi LM tests that are based on the modified profile log-likelihood function and use its expected rather than observed Hessian for hypotheses that include a restriction on rho, and confidence regions that are based on inverting these tests have correct asymptotic size in a uniform sense when |rho| =&lt; 1. Finally, we investigate the finite sample properties of the MMLEs and the QLM test in a Monte Carlo study.</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide to Estimating Conditional Marginal Effects: Modern Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This Element offers a practical guide to estimating conditional marginal effects-how treatment effects vary with a moderating variable-using modern statistical methods. Commonly used approaches, such as linear interaction models, often suffer from unclarified estimands, limited overlap, and restrictive functional forms. This guide begins by clearly defining the estimand and presenting the main identification results. It then reviews and improves upon existing solutions, such as the semiparametric kernel estimator, and introduces robust estimation strategies, including augmented inverse propensity score weighting with Lasso selection (AIPW-Lasso) and double machine learning (DML) with modern algorithms. Each method is evaluated through simulations and empirical examples, with practical recommendations tailored to sample size and research context. All tools are implemented in the accompanying \texttt{interflex} package for \texttt{R}.</description>
