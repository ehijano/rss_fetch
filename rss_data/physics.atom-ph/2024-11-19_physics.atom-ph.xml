      <title>Room-temperature amplified transduction of infrared to visible photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency transduction, which converts photons from one energy level to another, provides a way to bridge different quantum devices. The frequency transduction has been studied across various systems and frequency ranges, depending on the applications. In particular, infrared photons are ideal for long-distance communication, but their detection efficiency is often low. Converting infrared photons to visible light, where affordable detectors with high quantum efficiency are widely available, would offer significant advantages. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of transduction of 1500-nm photons to 553-nm photons at room temperature using barium atoms of a three-level $\Lambda$ system. In our experiment conducted in free space, we could amplify the visible photons, achieving an internal efficiency of 1.49, exceeding unity. We also observed that the minimum transduction bandwidth is determined by the total decay rate of the excited state in the $\Lambda$-type energy levels. Moreover, we propose ways to improve the internal efficiency by 200-fold and to implement polarization-sensitive transduction in our scheme to be applicable in quantum information. The present work is a step forward for the integration of quantum devices at different energy levels as well as for the development of efficient infrared-photon detectors.</description>

      <title>Non-classicality induces recombination in high-harmonic generation with circularly polarized fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a nonlinear process in which a strong driving field interacts with a material, resulting in the frequency up-conversion of the driver into its high-order harmonics. This process is highly sensitive to the field's polarization: circular polarization, for instance, inhibits HHG. In this work, we demonstrate that the use of non-classical structured light enables HHG in this otherwise prohibitive configuration for classical drivers. In particular, we consider circularly polarized light with non-classical fluctuations, introduced via squeezing along one polarization direction, and show that the spectral properties of the emitted harmonics vary depending on the type of squeezing applied. Additionally, we examine the electron dynamics during HHG, revealing that non-classical fluctuations act as an effective force that guides the electron trajectories toward recombination. This approach opens new pathways for integrating quantum optics in HHG, providing novel means of controlling the light-matter interaction dynamics.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Evaluation of the Caesium Fountain Primary Frequency Standard NIM6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new caesium (Cs) fountain clock NIM6 has been developed at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM) in China, for which a comprehensive uncertainty evaluation is presented. A three-dimensional magneto-optical trap (3D MOT) loading optical molasses is employed to obtain more cold atoms rapidly and efficiently with a tunable, uniform density distribution. A heat pipe surrounding the flight tube maintains a consistent and stable temperature within the interrogation region. Additionally, a Ramsey cavity with four azimuthally distribution feeds is utilized to mitigate distributed cavity phase shifts. The Cs fountain clock NIM6 achieves a short-term stability of 1.0x10-13 {\tau}-1/2 at high atomic density, and a typical overall fractional type-B uncertainty is estimated to be 2.3x10-16. Comparisons of frequency between the Cs fountain NIM6 and other Cs fountain Primary Frequency Standards (PFSs) through Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) have demonstrated an agreement within the stated uncertainties.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity universal gates in the $^{171}$Yb ground state nuclear spin qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arrays of optically trapped neutral atoms are a promising architecture for the realization of quantum computers. In order to run increasingly complex algorithms, it is advantageous to demonstrate high-fidelity and flexible gates between long-lived and highly coherent qubit states. In this work, we demonstrate a universal high-fidelity gate-set with individually controlled and parallel application of single-qubit gates and two-qubit gates operating on the ground-state nuclear spin qubit in arrays of tweezer-trapped $^{171}$Yb atoms. We utilize the long lifetime, flexible control, and high physical fidelity of our system to characterize native gates using single and two-qubit Clifford and symmetric subspace randomized benchmarking circuits with more than 200 CZ gates applied to one or two pairs of atoms. We measure our two-qubit entangling gate fidelity to be 99.72(3)% (99.40(3)%) with (without) post-selection. In addition, we introduce a simple and optimized method for calibration of multi-parameter quantum gates. These results represent important milestones towards executing complex and general quantum computation with neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Logical computation demonstrated with a neutral atom quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transitioning from quantum computation on physical qubits to quantum computation on encoded, logical qubits can improve the error rate of operations, and will be essential for realizing valuable quantum computational advantages. Using a neutral atom quantum processor with 256 qubits, each an individual Ytterbium atom, we demonstrate the entanglement of 24 logical qubits using the distance-two [[4,2,2]] code, simultaneously detecting errors and correcting for lost qubits. We also implement the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm with up to 28 logical qubits encoded in the [[4,1,2]] code, showing better-than-physical error rates. We demonstrate fault-tolerant quantum computation in our approach, guided by the proposal of Gottesman (2016), by performing repeated loss correction for both structured and random circuits encoded in the [[4,2,2]] code. Finally, since distance-two codes can correct qubit loss, but not other errors, we show repeated loss and error correction using the distance-three [[9,1,3]] Bacon-Shor code. These results begin to clear a path for achieving scientific quantum advantage with a programmable neutral atom quantum processor.</description>

      <title>Measuring a localization phase diagram controlled by the interplay of disorder and driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of various localizing mechanisms is a central topic of modern condensed matter physics. In this work we experimentally explore the interplay between quasiperiodic disorder and periodic driving, each of which in isolation is capable of driving a metal-insulator phase transition. Using a 1D quasiperiodic cold-atom chain we measure transport across the full phase diagram varying both drive strength and quasidisorder strength. We observe lobes of metallic phases bounded by quantum phase transitions which depend on both drive and disorder. While these observations are broadly consistent with expectations from a high-drive-frequency theoretical model, we also observe clear departures from the predictions of this model, including anomalous changes in localization behavior at lower drive frequency. We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that understanding the full measured phase diagram requires an extension to commonly-used approximate theories of Floquet matter.</description>

      <title>Slow molecular beams from a cryogenic buffer gas source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of a cryogenic buffer gas source that uses a low temperature two-stage buffer gas cell to produce very slow beams of ytterbium monofluoride molecules. The molecules are produced by laser ablation inside the cell and extracted into a beam by a flow of cold helium. We measure the flux and velocity distribution of the beam as a function of ablation energy, helium flow rate, cell temperature, and the size of the gap between the first and second stages of the cell. We also compare the velocity distributions from one-stage and two-stage cells. The one-stage cell emits a beam with a speed of about 82 m s$^{-1}$ and a translational temperature of 0.63 K. The slowest beams are obtained using the two-stage cell at the lowest achievable cell temperature of 1.8 K. This beam has a peak velocity of 56 m s$^{-1}$ and a flux of $9 \times 10^9$ ground state molecules per steradian per pulse, with a substantial fraction at speeds below 40 m s$^{-1}$. These slow molecules can be decelerated further by radiation pressure slowing and then captured in a magneto-optical trap.</description>

      <title>Trapped-ion laser cooling in structured light fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser cooling is fundamental to quantum computation and metrology with trapped ions, and can occupy a majority of runtime in current systems. A key limitation to cooling arises from unwanted carrier excitation, which in typically used running wave (RW) fields invariably accompanies the sideband transitions effecting cooling. We consider laser cooling in structured light profiles enabling selective sideband excitation with nulled carrier drive; motivated by integrated photonic approaches' passive phase and amplitude stability, we propose simple configurations realizable with waveguide addressing using either standing wave (SW) or first-order Hermite-Gauss (HG) modes. We quantify performance of Doppler cooling from beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime (LDR), and ground-state (GS) cooling using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) leveraging these field profiles. Carrier-free EIT offers significant benefits simultaneously in cooling rate, motional frequency bandwidth, and final phonon number. Carrier-free Doppler cooling's advantage is significantly compromised beyond the LDR but continues to hold, indicating such configurations are applicable for highly excited ions. Our simulations focus on level structure relevant to $^{40}$Ca$^+$, though the carrier-free configurations can be generally applied to other species. We also quantify performance limitations due to polarization and modal impurities relevant to experimental implementation. Our results indicate potential for simple structured light profiles to alleviate bottlenecks in laser cooling, and for scalable photonic devices to improve basic operation quality in trapped-ion systems.</description>

      <title>Electronic-vibrational dynamics and coherence in x-ray transient absorption of N2+ induced by strong-field ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) is becoming an indispensable and powerful tool in the emerging field of attochemistry, while the interpretation of measurements often requires full considerations of the coupling among various freedoms of motion. Here we develop the ionization-coupling model to incorporate the transient absorption and explore the coupled electronic-vibrational dynamics of nitrogen ions induced by strong-field ionization (SFI), which has been investigated in the recent transient x-ray K-edge absorption experiment [PRL 129, 123002 (2022)]. It is found the coherent vibrational wave packet on the involved electronic state is created with broad distribution of vibrational levels which leads to the spectral overlap on the K-edge absorption. By identifying the contributions of each electronic state, the study provides a different interpretation revealing the significant role of the excited state $A^2\Pi_u$ arising from the electronic-vibrational coupling in strong laser fields. We uncover new features of absorption from forbidden transitions during the laser pulse and confirm the vibronic coherence induced modulations of absorbance after SFI. A new scheme is proposed to avoid the spectral overlap and determine the population among the states which is crucial to resolve the debate on nitrogen air lasing. The work lays down the framework to research the ionic coherence in ATAS and offers valuable insights into the intricate interplay between electronic and vibrational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multispecies Ion Transport in a Grid-Based Surface-Electrode Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum processors based on linear arrays of trapped ions have achieved exceptional performance, but scaling to large qubit numbers requires realizing two-dimensional ion arrays as envisioned in the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture. Here we present a scalable method for the control of ion crystals in a grid-based surface-electrode Paul trap and characterize it in the context of transport operations that sort and reorder multispecies crystals. By combining cowiring of control electrodes at translationally symmetric locations in each grid site with the sitewise ability to exchange the voltages applied to two special electrodes gated by a binary input, site dependent operations can be achieved using only a fixed number of analog voltage signals and a single digital input per site. In two separate experimental systems containing nominally identical grid traps, one using $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^{+}$-$^{138}\mathrm{Ba}^{+}$ crystals and the other $^{137}\mathrm{Ba}^{+}$-$^{88}\mathrm{Sr}^{+}$, we demonstrate this method by characterizing the conditional intrasite crystal reorder and the conditional exchange of ions between adjacent sites on the grid. Averaged across a multisite region of interest, we measure subquanta motional excitation in the axial in-phase and out-of-phase modes of the crystals following these operations at exchange rates of 2.5 kHz. In this initial demonstration, the logic controlling the voltage exchange occurs in software, but the applied signals mimic a proposed hardware implementation using crossover switches. These techniques can be further extended to implement other conditional operations in the QCCD architecture such as gates, initialization and measurement.</description>
