      <title>Attosecond electron bunch generation by an intense high-order harmonic pulse interacting with a thin target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-accelerated electron bunches and the secondary radiation sources they produce exhibit unique temporal resolution for probing ultrafast physical processes due to their ultrashort pulse duration. The inherently short temporal profile of these pulses leads to extremely high peak bunch currents, thereby enabling a wide range of practical applications. In this study, we propose an innovative method for generating such bunch by utilizing high-harmonics generated through laser-plasma interaction as the driving pulse, which subsequently interacts with a thin target to produce an attosecond electron bunch. Using this method, we successfully generated an electron bunch characterized by excellent collimation and an ultra-short duration of approximately 100 attoseconds, representing a substantial reduction in bunch duration. The total bunch charge achieved was 0.38 nC, with an emittance of $4.5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{mm} \cdot \text{mrad}$ and a divergence angle of approximately $10^\circ$. Moreover, by systematically analyzing the effects of laser intensity and target positioning, we determined an optimized set of simulation parameters. This research establishes a robust foundation for the generation of ultrashort electron bunches and opens new prospects for their application in advanced high-energy and attosecond physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Programmable Focal Elongation and Shaping of High-Intensity Laser Pulses using Adaptive Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the intensity distribution of laser pulses in the focal region is essential for optimizing optically generated plasma waveguides and enabling advanced plasma acceleration techniques, including dephasingless wakefield acceleration. Here, we present a method for programmatic structuring of the high-intensity focal region of a standard off-axis parabolic mirror, extending the length of this region well beyond the Rayleigh length and enabling control over the longitudinal intensity distribution. The theoretical framework is validated through numerical simulations and experimental measurements. Further, we demonstrate the use of this technique in an existing plasma accelerator system using readily available hardware components. Finally, we illustrate the potential application of this method to multi-GeV laser plasma acceleration and the generation of flying foci, research areas which would significantly benefit from improved programmatic structuring of high-intensity laser pulses.</description>

      <title>Design of a High-Average-Power Ferroelectric Phase Shifter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes performance of a voltage controlled phase shifter designed for a high average power and a high figure of merit. The device is a reflection-type, resonant phase shifter that utilizes ferroelectric capacitors and impedance matching to the port impedance. With state-of-the-art ferroelectric materials, the device achieves a high Figure of Merit of nearly a thousand degrees phase shift per dB insertion loss at 800 MHz, along with sub-microsecond response. This phase shifter is capable of handling average power up to a megawatt. Its application is expected to enhance the electrical efficiency of particle accelerators, reducing both capital and operating costs.</description>
