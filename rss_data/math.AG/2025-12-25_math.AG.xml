      <title>Adjoint log canonical foliated singularities on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,\mathcal{F})$ be a foliated surface over $\mathbb{C}$. We study the singularities of the adjoint foliated divisor $K_{\mathcal{F}}+\epsilon K_X$. We provide a complete classification of $\epsilon$-adjoint log canonical singularities of foliated surfaces for $\epsilon\in(0,1/3)$. Moreover, we prove that for any $\epsilon\in(0,1/5)$, every $\epsilon$-adjoint log canonical singularity is log canonical for $\mathcal{F}$, and that for any $\epsilon\in(0,1/4)$, every $\epsilon$-adjoint canonical singularity is log canonical for $\mathcal{F}$. Finally, we present examples showing that both bounds are sharp.</description>

      <title>Virtual volumes of strata of meromorphic differentials with simple poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We work over strata of meromorphic differentials with poles of order 1, and on affine subspaces defined by linear conditions on the residues. We propose a definition of the volume of these objects as the integral of a tautological class on the projectivization of the stratum. By previous work with Chen-M\"oller-Zagier, this definition agrees with the Masur-Veech volumes in the holomorphic case. We show that these algebraic constants can be computed by induction on the genus and number of singularities. Besides, for strata with a single zero, we prove that the generating series of these volumes is a solution of an integrable system associated with the PDE: $u_tu_{xx}=u_tu_x+u_t - 1$.</description>

      <title>On the Euclidean Distance Degree of Quadratic Two-Neuron Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Euclidean Distance degree of algebraic neural network models from the perspective of algebraic geometry. Focusing on shallow networks with two neurons, quadratic activation, and scalar output, we identify the associated neurovariety with the second secant variety of a quadratic Veronese embedding. We introduce and analyze the virtual Euclidean Distance degree, a projective invariant defined as the sum of the polar degrees of the variety, which coincides with the usual Euclidean Distance degree for a generic choice of scalar product. Using intersection theory, Chern-Mather classes, and the Nash blow-up provided by Kempf's resolution, we reduce the computation of the virtual Euclidean Distance degree to explicit intersection numbers on a Grassmannian. Applying equivariant localization, we prove that this invariant depends stably polynomially on the input dimension. Numerical experiments based on homotopy continuation illustrate the dependence of the Euclidean Distance degree on the chosen metric and highlight the distinction between the generic and nongeneric cases, such as the Bombieri-Weyl metric.</description>

      <title>Critical Points of Degenerate Metrics on Algebraic Varieties: A Tale of Overparametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the critical points over an algebraic variety of an optimization problem defined by a quadratic objective that is degenerate. This scenario arises in machine learning when the dataset size is small with respect to the model, and is typically referred to as overparametrization. Our main result relates the degenerate optimization problem to a nondegenerate one via a projection. In the highly-degenerate regime, we find that a central role is played by the ramification locus of the projection. Additionally, we provide tools for counting the number of critical points over projective varieties, and discuss specific cases arising from deep learning. Our work bridges tools from algebraic geometry with ideas from machine learning, and it extends the line of literature around the Euclidean distance degree to the degenerate setting.</description>

      <title>From logarithmic Hilbert schemes to degenerations of hyperk\"ahler varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the first examples of good type III degenerations of hyperk\"ahler varieties in dimension greater than 2. These are presented as moduli of 0-dimensional subschemes on expansions of a degeneration of K3 surfaces. We prove projectivity for our expanded degenerations and compute the dual complexes of the special fibre for two specific degenerations of hyperkahler fourfolds. Moreover, we explain the correspondence between geometric strata of the special fibre and simplices in its dual complex.</description>

      <title>Pluricanonical Geometry of Varieties Isogenous to a Product: Chevalley-Weil Theory and Pluricanonical Decompositions of Abelian Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study canonical and pluricanonical maps of varieties isogenous to a product of curves, i.e., quotients of the form $ X = (C_1 \times \dots \times C_n)/G $ with $g(C_i)\ge 2$ and $G$ acting freely. We establish the Chevalley-Weil formula for pluricanonical representations of a curve with a finite group action and a decomposition theorem for pluricanonical systems of abelian covers. These tools allow an explicit study of geometric properties of $X$, such as base loci and the birationality of pluricanonical maps. For threefolds isogenous to a product, we prove that the 4-canonical map is birational for $p_g \ge 5$ and construct an example attaining the maximal canonical degree for this class of threefolds. In this example, the canonical map is the normalization of its image, which admits isolated non-normal singularities. Computational classifications also reveal threefolds where the bicanonical map fails to be birational, even in the absence of genus-2 fibrations. This illustrates an interesting phenomenon similar to the non-standard case for surfaces.</description>

      <title>Is there a smooth lattice polytope which does not have the integer decomposition property?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Tadao Oda's famous question on lattice polytopes which was originally posed at Oberwolfach in 1997 and, although simple to state, has remained unanswered. The question is motivated by a discussion of the two-dimensional case - including a proof of Pick's Theorem, which elegantly relates the area of a lattice polygon to the number of lattice points it contains in its interior and on its boundary.</description>

      <title>Limits of equi-affine equi-distant loci of planar convex domains with two non-parallel asymptotes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we discuss the novel approach to define equi-affine invariants starting from tropical geometry, where one averages over the space of tropical structures of fixed co-volume. Applied to the tropical distance series, this gives a family of equi-affine invariant functions associated with convex domains which are expected to satisfy a number of remarkable properties. The present note contains a conjecture about the limit structure of corresponding level sets in the compact case, as well as the proof of an analogue of this conjecture for unbounded domains with two non-parallel asymptotes. In addition, we carry out an explicit computation for the arithmetic mean value at center of the unit disk.</description>

Abstract: We study the Hodge filtration of the intersection cohomology Hodge module for toric varieties. More precisely, we study the cohomology sheaves of the graded de Rham complex of the intersection cohomology Hodge module and give a precise formula relating it with the stalks of the intersection cohomology as a constructible complex. The main idea is to use the Ishida complex in order to compute the higher direct images of the sheaf of reflexive differentials.</description>

      <title>Remodeling Conjecture with Descendants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate and prove the Remodeling Conjecture with descendants, which is a version of all-genus equivariant descendant mirror symmetry for semi-projective toric Calabi-Yau 3-orbifolds with integral structures. We construct an isomorphism between the $K$-group of equivariant coherent sheaves on the toric Calabi-Yau 3-orbifold with support bounded in a direction and a certain integral relative first homology group of the equivariant mirror curve. Under this isomorphism, we prove the equivariant mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture which equates quantum cohomology central charges of coherent sheaves and oscillatory integrals along corresponding relative 1-cycles. As a consequence in the non-equivariant setting, we prove a conjecture of Hosono which equates central charges of compactly supported coherent sheaves and period integrals of integral 3-cycles on the Hori-Vafa mirror 3-fold. Furthermore, we establish a correspondence between all-genus equivariant descendant Gromov-Witten invariants with $K$-theoretic framings and oscillatory integrals (Laplace transforms) of the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion invariants along relative 1-cycles on the equivariant mirror curve.</description>

      <title>A note on the Brill-Noether loci of small codimension in moduli space of stable bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$ over the field $\mathbb{C}$. Let $M_{X}(2,L)$ denote the moduli space of stable rank $2$ vector bundles on $X$ with fixed determinant $L$ of degree $2g-1$. Consider the Brill-Noether subvariety $W^{1}_{X}(2,L)$ of $M_{X}(2,L)$ which parametrises stable vector bundles having at least two linearly independent global sections. In this article, for generic $X$ and $L$, we show that $W^{1}_{X}(2,L)$ is stably-rational when $g=3$, unirational when $g=4$, and rationally chain connected by Hecke curves, when $g\geq 5$. We also show triviality of low dimensional rational Chow groups of an associated Brill-Noether hypersurface.</description>

Abstract: This paper classifies all 4d Nakajima quiver varieties through a combinatorial approach. For each such variety, we describe the symplectic leaves and minimal degenerations between them. Using the resulting Hasse diagrams and secondary hyperplane arrangements, we fully classify the quiver varieties up to isomorphism, a step in the problem of classifying all 4d conical symplectic singularities and the (2, 2) case of quiver varieties. As an application, we answer in the negative a question posed by Bellamy, Craw, Rayan, Schedler, and Weiss regarding whether the $G_4$ quotient singularity (or its projective crepant resolutions) can be realised as a quiver variety.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a derived Torelli Theorem for twisted abelian varieties. Starting from this, we explore the relation between derived isogenies and classical isogenies. We show that two abelian varieties of dimension $\geq 2$ are derived isogenous if and only if they are principally isogenous over fields of characteristic zero. This generalized the result for abelian surfaces and completely solves the question raised in [arXiv:2108.08710].</description>

      <title>Topological Gauge Theories with Sixteen Supercharges: Higher $A_\infty$-categorification of Floer Homologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20067v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to [arXiv:2410.18575], and a third and final installment of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We show how, via a 3d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of certain topologically-twisted 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ and 8d $\mathcal{N} = 1$ gauge theories, one can derive novel Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories that 2-categorify the 3d-Haydys-Witten, Haydys-Witten, and holomorphic Donaldson-Thomas Floer homology of two, four, and five-manifolds, respectively. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the aforementioned twisted gauge theories, these Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories can be shown to be equivalent to corresponding Fukaya-Seidel type $A_{\infty}$-categories. In the 8d case, one can also derive higher $A_{\infty}$-categories, such as a novel Cauchy-Riemann-Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-3-category that 3-categorifies the Haydys-Witten Floer homology of four-manifolds via a 4d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the theory. Together with previous results from [arXiv:2410.18575] and [arXiv:2311.18302], our work furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Bousseau [3], Doan-Rezchikov [4], and Cao [5].</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study MRC fibrations of compact K\"ahler manifolds with partially semi-positive curvature. We first prove that a compact K\"ahler manifold is rationally connected if its tangent bundle is BC-$p$ positive for all $1\leq p\leq \dim X$. As applications, we confirm a conjecture of Lei Ni that any compact K\"ahler manifold with positive orthogonal Ricci curvature must be rationally connected, and generalize a result of Heier-Wong and Yang to the conformally K\"ahler case. The second result concern structure theorems for two immediate curvature conditions. We prove that, a compact K\"ahler manifold with $k$-semi-positive Ricci curvature or semi-positive $k$-scalar curvature, either the rational dimension $\geq n-k+1$ or it admits a locally constant fibration $f: X\rightarrow Y$ such that the fibre is rationally connected and the image $Y$ is Ricci-flat.</description>

      <title>Shifted twisted Yangians and affine Grassmannian islices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10652</link>

Abstract: In a prequel we introduced the shifted iYangians ${}^\imath Y_\mu$ associated to quasi-split Satake diagrams of type ADE and even spherical coweights $\mu$, and constructed the iGKLO representations of ${}^\imath Y_\mu$, which factor through truncated shifted iYangians ${}^\imath Y_\mu^\lambda$. In this paper, we show that ${}^\imath Y_\mu$ quantizes the involutive fixed point locus ${}^\imath W_\mu$ arising from affine Grassmannians of type ADE, and supply strong evidence toward the expectation that ${}^\imath Y_\mu^\lambda$ quantizes a top-dimensional component of the affine Grassmannian islice ${}^\imath\overline{W}_\mu^\lambda$. We identify the islices ${}^\imath\overline{W}_\mu^\lambda$ in type AI with suitable nilpotent Slodowy slices of type BCD, building on the work of Lusztig and Mirkovi\'c-Vybornov in type A. We propose a framework for producing ortho-symplectic (and hybrid) Coulomb branches from split (and nonsplit) Satake framed double quivers, which are conjectured to relate closely to the islices ${}^\imath\overline{W}_\mu^\lambda$ and the algebras ${}^\imath Y_\mu^\lambda$.</description>
