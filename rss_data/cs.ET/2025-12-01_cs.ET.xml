      <title>Sneak Path Current Modeling in Memristor Crossbar Arrays for Analog In-Memory Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristor crossbar arrays have emerged as a key component for next-generation non-volatile memories, artificial neural networks, and analog in-memory computing (IMC) systems. By minimizing data transfer between the processor and memory, they offer substantial energy savings. However, a major design challenge in memristor crossbar arrays is the presence of sneak path currents, which degrade electrical performance, reduce noise margins, and limit reliable operations. This work presents a closed-form analytical framework based on IMEC A14 (1.4 nm) Technology for accurately estimating sneak path currents in memristor crossbar arrays. The proposed model captures the interdependence of key design parameters in memristor crossbar arrays, including array size, ON/OFF ratio of memristors, read voltage, and interconnect conditions, through mathematically derived relationships. It supports various practical configurations, such as different data patterns and connection strategies, enabling rapid and comprehensive sneak path current modeling. The sensitivity analysis includes how design parameters influence sneak path current and noise margin loss, underscoring the trade-offs involved in scaling crossbar arrays. Validation through SPICE simulations shows that the model achieves an error of less than 10.9% while being up to 4784 times faster than full circuit simulations. This analytical framework offers a powerful tool for quantitative assessment and pre-design/real-time optimization of memristor-based analog in-memory computing (IMC) architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Geometry Effects on Low-Cost Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) promise low-power coverage extension, yet practical deployments must curb hardware complexity and control overhead. This paper quantifies the performance impact of two cost-saving measures, column-wise element grouping and 1-bit (binary) phase quantization, relative to the ideal fully-controlled, continuous-phase baseline. A single-input single-output link is simulated at 26 GHz (mmWave) across three deployment geometries that vary the relative heights of access point, IRS and user equipment. Results show that switching from continuous to binary phase control reduces median SNR gain by approximately 4 dB, while adopting column-wise grouping introduces a similar penalty; combining both constraints incurs approximately 8 dB loss under height-offset deployments. When all nodes share the same height, the degradation from column-wise control becomes negligible, indicating deployment geometry can offset control-granularity limits. Despite the losses, a 32 x 32 column-wise binary IRS still delivers double-digit SNR gains over the no-IRS baseline in most positions, confirming its viability for cost-constrained scenarios. The study provides quantitative guidelines on when simplified IRS architectures can meet link-budget targets and where full element-wise control remains justified.</description>

      <title>Lattice Surgery Aware Resource Analysis for the Mapping and Scheduling of Quantum Circuits for Scalable Modular Architectures</title>

Abstract: Quantum computing platforms are evolving to a point where placing high numbers of qubits into a single core comes with certain difficulties such as fidelity, crosstalk, and high power consumption of dense classical electronics. Utilizing distributed cores, each hosting logical data qubits and logical ancillas connected via classical and quantum communication channels, offers a promising alternative. However, building such a system for logical qubits requires additional optimizations, such as minimizing the amount of state transfer between cores for inter-core two-qubit gates and optimizing the routing of magic states distilled in a magic state factory. In this work, we investigate such a system and its statistics in terms of classical and quantum resources. First, we restrict our quantum gate set to a universal gate set consisting of CNOT, H, T, S, and Pauli gates. We then developed a framework that can take any quantum circuit, transpile it to our gate set using Qiskit, and then partition the qubits using the KaHIP graph partitioner to balanced partitions. Afterwards, we built an algorithm to map these graphs onto the 2D mesh of quantum cores by converting the problem into a Quadratic Assignment Problem with Fixed Assignment (QAPFA) to minimize the routing of leftover two-qubit gates between cores and the total travel of magic states from the magic state factory. Following this stage, the gates are scheduled using an algorithm that takes care of the timing of the gate set. As a final stage, our framework reports detailed statistics such as the number of classical communications, the number of EPR pairs and magic states consumed, and timing overheads for pre- and post- processing for inter-core state transfers. These results help to quantify both classical and quantum resources that are used in distributed logical quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>3RSeT: Read Disturbance Rate Reduction in STT-MRAM Caches by Selective Tag Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent development in memory technologies has introduced Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) as the most promising replacement for SRAMs in on-chip cache memories. Besides its lower leakage power, higher density, immunity to radiation-induced particles, and non-volatility, an unintentional bit flip during read operation, referred to as read disturbance error, is a severe reliability challenge in STT-MRAM caches. One major source of read disturbance error in STT-MRAM caches is simultaneous accesses to all tags for parallel comparison operation in a cache set, which has not been addressed in previous work. This paper first demonstrates that high read accesses to tag array extremely increase the read disturbance rate and then proposes a low-cost scheme, so-called Read Disturbance Rate Reduction in STT-MRAM Caches by Selective Tag Comparison (3RSeT), to reduce the error rate by eliminating a significant portion of tag reads. 3RSeT proactively disables the tags that have no chance for hit, using low significant bits of the tags on each access request. Our evaluations using gem5 full-system cycle-accurate simulator show that 3RSeT reduces the read disturbance rate in the tag array by 71.8%, which results in 3.6x improvement in Mean Time To Failure (MTTF). In addition, the energy consumption is reduced by 62.1% without compromising performance and with less than 0.4% area overhead.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Ephemeral Traffic Waves in A Data-Driven Framework for Microsimulation in CARLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a data-driven traffic microsimulation framework in CARLA that reconstructs real-world wave dynamics using high-fidelity time-space data from the I-24 MOTION testbed. Calibration of road networks in microsimulators to reproduce ephemeral phenomena such as traffic waves for large-scale simulation is a process that is fraught with challenges. This work reconsiders the existence of the traffic state data as boundary conditions on an ego vehicle moving through previously recorded traffic data, rather than reproducing those traffic phenomena in a calibrated microsim. Our approach is to autogenerate a 1 mile highway segment corresponding to I-24, and use the I-24 data to power a cosimulation module that injects traffic information into the simulation. The CARLA and cosimulation simulations are centered around an ego vehicle sampled from the empirical data, with autogeneration of "visible" traffic within the longitudinal range of the ego vehicle. Boundary control beyond these visible ranges is achieved using ghost cells behind (upstream) and ahead (downstream) of the ego vehicle. Unlike prior simulation work that focuses on local car-following behavior or abstract geometries, our framework targets full time-space diagram fidelity as the validation objective. Leveraging CARLA's rich sensor suite and configurable vehicle dynamics, we simulate wave formation and dissipation in both low-congestion and high-congestion scenarios for qualitative analysis. The resulting emergent behavior closely mirrors that of real traffic, providing a novel cosimulation framework for evaluating traffic control strategies, perception-driven autonomy, and future deployment of wave mitigation solutions. Our work bridges microscopic modeling with physical experimental data, enabling the first perceptually realistic, boundary-driven simulation of empirical traffic wave phenomena in CARLA.</description>
