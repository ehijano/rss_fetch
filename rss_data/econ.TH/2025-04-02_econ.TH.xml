      <title>A Characterization of Nash Equilibrium in Behavioral Strategies through an Extra Strategy Profile, Local Sequential Rationality, and Self-Independent Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of Nash equilibrium in behavioral strategies (NashEBS) was formulated By Nash~\cite{Nash (1951)} for an extensive-form game through global rationality of nonconvex payoff functions. Kuhn's payoff equivalence theorem resolves the nonconvexity issue, but it overlooks that one Nash equilibrium of the associated normal-form game can correspond to infinitely many NashEBSs of an extensive-form game. To remedy this multiplicity, the traditional approach as documented in Myerson~\cite{Myerson (1991)} involves a two-step process: identifying a Nash equilibrium of the agent normal-form representation, followed by verifying whether the corresponding mixed strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium of the associated normal-form game, which often scales exponentially with the size of the extensive-form game tree. In response to these challenges, this paper develops a characterization of NashEBS through the incorporation of an extra behavioral strategy profile and beliefs, which meet local sequential rationality of linear payoff functions and self-independent consistency. This characterization allows one to analytically determine all NashEBSs for small extensive-form games. Building upon this characterization, we acquire a polynomial system serving as a necessary and sufficient condition for determining whether a behavioral strategy profile is a NashEBS. An application of the characterization yields differentiable path-following methods for computing such an equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Resolving Aaron's Social Insurance Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper resolves Aaron's social insurance paradox, which suggests that introducing a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pension system increases welfare when population growth plus average wage growth exceeds interest rates. Using a simplified overlapping generations model, we demonstrate this apparent advantage stems from asset reduction rather than inherent superiority. We analyze three pension systems - traditional PAYG, capital-funded, and capital-funded with bonus payments - and establish an equivalence between PAYG and the bonus-payment system. This equivalence reveals that systems with identical contributions and benefits differ only in accounting frameworks and asset positions, challenging the notion of PAYG superiority. Our analysis exposes a fundamental conceptual inconsistency in how sustainability is assessed across equivalent pension systems. As an alternative, we propose $\alpha$-stability, a framework using index shares to evaluate pension systems relative to economic indicators. These findings suggest that perceived advantages between pension systems often result from their formulation rather than substantive economic differences.</description>

      <title>Linear models of dynamic optimization with linear constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of infinite horizon linear dynamic optimization with linear constraints and obtain results concerning feasibility of trajectories and optimal solutions necessarily satisfying conditions that resemble the Euler condition and transversality condition. We prove results about optimal trajectories of strictly alternating problems, eventually conclusive problems, strongly eventually conclusive problems and two-phase problems.</description>

      <title>Battery Operations in Electricity Markets: Strategic Behavior and Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric power systems are undergoing a major transformation as they integrate intermittent renewable energy sources, and batteries to smooth out variations in renewable energy production. As privately-owned batteries grow from their role as marginal "price-takers" to significant players in the market, a natural question arises: How do batteries operate in electricity markets, and how does the strategic behavior of decentralized batteries distort decisions compared to centralized batteries? We propose an analytically tractable model that captures salient features of the highly complex electricity market. We derive in closed form the resulting battery behavior and generation cost in three operating regimes: (i) no battery, (ii) centralized battery, and (ii) decentralized profit-maximizing battery. We establish that a decentralized battery distorts its discharge decisions in three ways. First, there is quantity withholding, i.e., discharging less than centrally optimal. Second, there is a shift in participation from day-ahead to real-time, i.e., postponing some of its discharge from day-ahead to real-time. Third, there is reduction in real-time responsiveness, or discharging less in response to smoothing real-time demand than centrally optimal. We also quantify the impact of the battery market power on total system cost via the Price of Anarchy metric, and prove that the it is always between $9/8$ and $4/3$. That is, incentive misalignment always exists, but it is bounded even in the worst case. We calibrate our model to real data from Los Angeles and Houston. Lastly, we show that competition is very effective at reducing distortions, but many market power mitigation mechanisms backfire, and lead to higher total cost.</description>

      <title>Information About Other Players in Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the existence of mechanism design settings where the planner has an interest in agents receiving noisy signals about the types of other agents. When the planner is interested only in partial implementation, any social choice rule that is incentive-compatible after agents receive additional information about other agents is incentive-compatible without this information. However, additional information about other agents can eliminate undesired equilibria, making it helpful to a planner interested in full implementation. We provide a sufficient condition under which a social choice rule that is not fully implementable when agents have no information about types of other agents can become fully implementable if agents have additional information.</description>
