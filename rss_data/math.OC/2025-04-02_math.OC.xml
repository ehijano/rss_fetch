      <title>Robust Control of General Linear Delay Systems under Dissipativity Part I: A KSD based Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an effective framework for designing memoryless dissipative full-state feedbacks for general linear delay systems via the Krasovski\u{i} functional (KF) approach, where an unlimited number of pointwise and general distributed delays (DDs) exists in the state, input and output. To handle the infinite dimensionality of DDs, we employ the Kronecker-Seuret Decomposition (KSD) which we recently proposed for analyzing matrix-valued functions in the context of delay systems. The KSD enables factorization or least-squares approximation of any number of $\fL^2$ DD kernel from any number of DDs without introducing conservatism. This also facilitates the construction of a complete-type KF with flexible integral kernels, following from an application of a novel integral inequalities derived from the least-squares principle. Our solution includes two theorems and an iterative algorithm to compute controller gains without relying on nonlinear solvers. A challenging numerical example, intractable for existing methods, underscores the efficacy of this approach.</description>

      <title>A Time-Reversal Control Synthesis for Steering the State of Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for steering the state of a stochastic control-affine system to a desired target within a finite time horizon. Our method leverages the time-reversal of diffusion processes to construct the required feedback control law. Specifically, the control law is the so-called score function associated with the time-reversal of random state trajectories that are initialized at the target state and are simulated backwards in time. A neural network is trained to approximate the score function, enabling applicability to both linear and nonlinear stochastic systems. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method across several benchmark examples.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of wide spectrum forcing in transport-diffusion and Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article considers the problem of reconstructing unknown driving forces based on incomplete knowledge of the system and its state. This is studied in both a linear and nonlinear setting that is paradigmatic in geophysical fluid dynamics and various applications. Two algorithms are proposed to address this problem: one that iteratively reconstructs forcing and another that provides a continuous-time reconstruction. Convergence is shown to be guaranteed provided that observational resolution is sufficiently high and algorithmic parameters are properly tuned according to the prior information; these conditions are quantified precisely. The class of reconstructable forces identified here include those which are time-dependent and potentially inject energy at all length scales. This significantly expands upon the class of forces in previous studies, which could only accommodate those with band-limited spectra. The second algorithm moreover provides a conceptually streamlined approach that allows for a more straightforward analysis and simplified practical implementation.</description>

      <title>System Identification from Partial Observations under Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the partially observed linear system identification, where the goal is to obtain reasonably accurate estimation of the balanced truncation of the true system up to the order $k$ from output measurements. We consider the challenging case of system identification under adversarial attacks, where the probability of having an attack at each time is $\Theta(1/k)$ while the value of the attack is arbitrary. We first show that the $l_1$-norm estimator exactly identifies the true Markov parameter matrix for nilpotent systems under any type of attack. We then build on this result to extend it to general systems and show that the estimation error exponentially decays as $k$ grows. The estimated balanced truncation model accordingly shows an exponentially decaying error for the identification of the true system up to the similarity transformation. This work is the first to provide the input-output analysis of the system with partial observations under arbitrary attacks.</description>

      <title>Optimization over the weakly Pareto set and multi-task learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimization problem over the weakly Pareto set of a convex multiobjective optimization problem given by polynomial functions. Using Lagrange multiplier expressions and the weight vector, we give three types of representations for the weakly Pareto set. Using these representations, we reformulate the optimization problem over the weakly Pareto set as a polynomial optimization problem. We then apply the Moment--SOS hierarchy to solve it and analyze its convergence properties under certain conditions. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Applications in multi-task learning are also presented.</description>

      <title>A two-stage optimization algorithm for tensor decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical polyadic tensor decomposition has a long history. But it becomes challenging to find a tensor decomposition when the rank is between the largest and the second-largest dimension. In such cases, traditional optimization methods, such as nonlinear least squares or alternative least squares methods, often fail to find a tensor decomposition. There are also direct methods, such as the normal form algorithm and the method by Domanov and De Lathauwer, that solve tensor decompositions algebraically. However, these methods can be computationally expensive and require significant memory, especially when the rank is high. This paper proposes a novel two-stage algorithm for the order-3 nonsymmetric tensor decomposition problem when the rank is not greater than the largest dimension. It transforms the tensor decomposition problem into two optimization problems. When the first-stage optimization is not fully solved, the partial solution will also be leveraged in the second-stage optimization problem. We prove the equivalence between tensor decompositions and the global minimizers of the two-stage optimization problems. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the proposed two-stage optimization method is very efficient and robust, capable of finding tensor decompositions where other commonly used state-of-the-art methods fail.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximations for partially observed optimal control of stochastic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study numerical approximations for optimal control of a class of stochastic partial differential equations with partial observations. The system state evolves in a Hilbert space, whereas observations are given in finite-dimensional space $\rr^d$. We begin by establishing stochastic maximum principles (SMPs) for such problems, where the system state is driven by a cylindrical Wiener process. The corresponding adjoint equations are characterized by backward stochastic partial differential equations. We then develop numerical algorithms to solve the partially observed optimal control. Our approach combines the stochastic gradient descent method, guided by the SMP, with a particle filtering algorithm to estimate the conditional distributions of the state of the system. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Robust Continuous-Time Generation Scheduling under Power Demand Uncertainty: An Affine Decision Rule Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing generation scheduling models for power systems under demand uncertainty rely on energy-based formulations with a finite number of time periods, which may fail to ensure that power supply and demand are balanced continuously over time. To address this issue, we propose a robust generation scheduling model in a continuous-time framework, employing a decision rule approach. First, for a given set of demand trajectories, we formulate a general robust generation scheduling problem to determine a decision rule that maps these demand trajectories and time points to the power outputs of generators. Subsequently, we derive a surrogate of it as our model by carefully designing a class of decision rules that are affine in the current demand, with coefficients invariant over time and constant terms that are continuous piecewise affine functions of time. As a result, our model can be recast as a finite-dimensional linear program to determine the coefficients and the function values of the constant terms at each breakpoint, solvable via the cutting-plane method. Our model is non-anticipative unlike most existing continuous-time models, which use Bernstein polynomials, making it more practical. We also provide illustrative numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Robust Completion for Rank-1 Tensors with Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the rank-1 tensor completion problem for cubic tensors when there are noises for observed tensor entries. First, we propose a robust biquadratic optimization model for obtaining rank-1 completing tensors. When the observed tensor is sufficiently close to be rank-1, we show that this biquadratic optimization produces an accurate rank-1 tensor completion. Second, we give an efficient convex relaxation for solving the biquadratic optimization. When the optimizer matrix is separable, we show how to get optimizers for the biquadratic optimization and how to compute the rank-1 completing tensor. When that matrix is not separable, we apply its spectral decomposition to obtain an approximate rank-1 completing tensor. Numerical experiments are given to explore the efficiency of this biquadratic optimization model and the proposed convex relaxation.</description>

      <title>A Newton Interior-Point Method for $\ell_0$ Factor Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00531v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Factor Analysis is an effective way of dimensionality reduction achieved by revealing the low-rank plus sparse structure of the data covariance matrix. The corresponding model identification task is often formulated as an optimization problem with suitable regularizations. In particular, we use the nonconvex discontinuous $\ell_0$ norm in order to induce the sparsity of the covariance matrix of the idiosyncratic noise. This paper shows that such a challenging optimization problem can be approached via an interior-point method with inner-loop Newton iterations. To this end, we first characterize the solutions to the unconstrained $\ell_0$ regularized optimization problem through the $\ell_0$ proximal operator, and demonstrate that local optimality is equivalent to the solution of a stationary-point equation. The latter equation can then be solved using standard Newton's method, and the procedure is integrated into an interior-point algorithm so that inequality constraints of positive semidefiniteness can be handled. Finally, numerical examples validate the effectiveness of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Model Predictive Control for Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a nonlinear data-driven Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm for deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although DBS is typically implemented in open-loop, closed-loop DBS (CLDBS) uses the amplitude of neural oscillations in specific frequency bands (e.g. beta 13-30 Hz) as a feedback signal, resulting in improved treatment outcomes with reduced side effects and slower rates of patient habituation to stimulation. To date, CLDBS has only been implemented in vivo with simple control algorithms, such as proportional or proportional-integral control. Our approach employs a multi-step predictor based on differences of input-convex neural networks to model the future evolution of beta oscillations. The use of a multi-step predictor enhances prediction accuracy over the optimization horizon and simplifies online computation. In tests using a simulated model of beta-band activity response and data from PD patients, we achieve reductions of more than 20% in both tracking error and control activity in comparison with existing CLDBS algorithms. The proposed control strategy provides a generalizable data-driven technique that can be applied to the treatment of PD and other diseases targeted by CLDBS, as well as to other neuromodulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Hands-Off Covariance Steering: Inducing Feedback Sparsity via Iteratively Reweighted $\ell_{1,p}$ Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimally steering the state covariance matrix of a discrete-time linear stochastic system to a desired terminal covariance matrix, while inducing the control input to be zero over many time intervals. We propose to induce sparsity in the feedback gain matrices by using a sum-of-norms version of the iteratively reweighted $\ell_1$-norm minimization. We show that the lossless convexification property holds even with the regularization term. Numerical simulations show that the proposed method produces a Pareto front of transient cost and sparsity that is not achievable by a simple $\ell_1$-norm minimization and closely approximates the $\ell_0$-norm minimization obtained from brute-force search.</description>

      <title>Towards turnpike-based performance analysis of risk-averse stochastic predictive control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present performance estimates for stochastic economic MPC schemes with risk-averse cost formulations. For MPC algorithms with costs given by the expectation of stage cost evaluated in random variables, it was recently shown that the guaranteed near-optimal performance of abstract MPC in random variables coincides with its implementable variant coincide using measure path-wise feedback. In general, this property does not extend to costs formulated in terms of risk measures. However, through a turnpike-based analysis, this paper demonstrates that for a particular class of risk measures, this result can still be leveraged to formulate an implementable risk-averse MPC scheme, resulting in near-optimal averaged performance.</description>

      <title>Bounding Escape Rates and Approximating Quasi-Stationary Distributions of Brownian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throughout physics Brownian dynamics are used to describe the behaviour of molecular systems. When the Brownian particle is confined to a bounded domain, a particularly important question arises around determining how long it takes the particle to encounter certain regions of the boundary from which it can escape. Termed the first passage time, it sets the natural timescale of the chemical, biological, and physical processes that are described by the stochastic differential equation. Probabilistic information about the first passage time can be studied using spectral properties of the deterministic generator of the stochastic process. In this work we introduce a framework for bounding the leading eigenvalue of the generator which determines the exponential rate of escape of the particle from the domain. The method employs sum-of-squares programming to produce nearly sharp numerical upper and lower bounds on the leading eigenvalue, while also giving good numerical approximations of the associated leading eigenfunction, the quasi-stationary distribution of the process. To demonstrate utility, the method is applied to prototypical low-dimensional problems from the literature.</description>

      <title>A Unified Theoretic and Algorithmic Framework for Solving Multivariate Linear Model with $\ell^1$-norm Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a challenging problem that solving the \textit{multivariate linear model} (MLM) $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ with the $\ell_1 $-norm approximation method such that $||\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{b}||_1$, the $\ell_1$-norm of the \textit{residual error vector} (REV), is minimized. In this work, our contributions lie in two aspects: firstly, the equivalence theorem for the structure of the $\ell_1$-norm optimal solution to the MLM is proposed and proved; secondly, a unified algorithmic framework for solving the MLM with $\ell_1$-norm optimization is proposed and six novel algorithms (L1-GPRS, L1-TNIPM, L1-HP, L1-IST, L1-ADM, L1-POB) are designed. There are three significant characteristics in the algorithms discussed: they are implemented with simple matrix operations which do not depend on specific optimization solvers; they are described with algorithmic pseudo-codes and implemented with Python and Octave/MATLAB which means easy usage; and the high accuracy and efficiency of our six new algorithms can be achieved successfully in the scenarios with different levels of data redundancy. We hope that the unified theoretic and algorithmic framework with source code released on GitHub could motivate the applications of the $\ell_1$-norm optimization for parameter estimation of MLM arising in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, economics, and so on.</description>

      <title>Coordinate projected gradient descent minimization and its application to orthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider large-scale composite nonconvex optimization problems having the objective function formed as a sum of three terms, first has block coordinate-wise Lipschitz continuous gradient, second is twice differentiable but nonseparable and third is the indicator function of some separable closed convex set. Under these general settings we derive and analyze a new cyclic coordinate descent method, which uses the partial gradient of the differentiable part of the objective, yielding a coordinate gradient descent scheme with a novel adaptive stepsize rule. We prove that this stepsize rule makes the coordinate gradient scheme a descent method, provided that additional assumptions hold for the second term in the objective function. We also present a worst-case complexity analysis for this new method in the nonconvex settings. Numerical results on orthogonal nonnegative matrix factorization problem also confirm the efficiency of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Modified projected Gauss-Newton method for constrained nonlinear least-squares: application to power flow analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a modified projected Gauss-Newton method for solving constrained nonlinear least-squares problems. We assume that the functional constraints are smooth and the the other constraints are represented by a simple closed convex set. We formulate the nonlinear least-squares problem as an optimization problem using the Euclidean norm as a merit function. In our method, at each iteration we linearize the functional constraints inside the merit function at the current point and add a quadratic regularization, yielding a strongly convex subproblem that is easy to solve, whose solution is the next iterate. We present global convergence guarantees for the proposed method under mild assumptions. In particular, we prove stationary point convergence guarantees and under Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property for the objective function we derive convergence rates depending on the KL parameter. Finally, we show the efficiency of this method on the power flow analysis problem using several IEEE bus test cases.</description>

      <title>Feedback Optimization with State Constraints through Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of research on a class of methods called feedback optimization. These are methods to steer the state of a control system to an equilibrium that arises as the solution of an optimization problem. Despite the growing literature on the topic, the important problem of enforcing state constraints at all times remains unaddressed. In this work, we present the first feedback-optimization method that enforces state constraints. The method combines a class of dynamics called safe gradient flows with high-order control barrier functions. We provide a number of results on our proposed controller, including well-posedness guarantees, anytime constraint-satisfaction guarantees, equivalence between the closed-loop's equilibria and the optimization problem's critical points, and local asymptotic stability of optima.</description>

      <title>Spingarn's Method and Progressive Decoupling Beyond Elicitable Monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spingarn's method of partial inverses and the progressive decoupling algorithm address inclusion problems involving the sum of an operator and the normal cone of a linear subspace, known as linkage problems. Despite their success, existing convergence results are limited to the so-called elicitable monotone setting, where nonmonotonicity is allowed only on the orthogonal complement of the linkage subspace. In this paper, we introduce progressive decoupling+, a generalized version of standard progressive decoupling that incorporates separate relaxation parameters for the linkage subspace and its orthogonal complement. We prove convergence under conditions that link the relaxation parameters to the nonmonotonicity of their respective subspaces and show that the special cases of Spingarn's method and standard progressive decoupling also extend beyond the elicitable monotone setting. Our analysis hinges upon an equivalence between progressive decoupling+ and the preconditioned proximal point algorithm, for which we develop a general local convergence analysis in a certain nonmonotone setting.</description>

      <title>Solution of Robust Linear Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust optimization(RO) is an important tool for handling optimization problem with uncertainty. The main objective of RO is to solve optimization problems due to uncertainty associated with constraints satisfying all realizations of uncertain values within a given uncertainty set. The challenge of RO is to reformulate the constraints so that the uncertain optimization problem is transformed into a tractable deterministic form. In this paper, we have given more emphasis to study the robust counterpart(RC) of the RO problems and have developed a mathematical model on the solution strategy for robust linear optimization problems, where the constraints only are associated with uncertainties. The box and ellipsoidal uncertainty sets are considered and some illustrative numerical examples have been solved in each corresponding case for validating our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Set-based state estimation of nonlinear discrete-time systems using constrained zonotopes and polyhedral relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new algorithm for set-based state estimation of nonlinear discrete-time systems with bounded uncertainties. The novel method builds upon essential properties and computational advantages of constrained zonotopes (CZs) and polyhedral relaxations of factorable representations of nonlinear functions to propagate CZs through nonlinear functions, which is usually done using conservative linearization in the literature. The new method also refines the propagated enclosure using nonlinear measurements. To achieve this, a lifted polyhedral relaxation is computed for the composite nonlinear function of the system dynamics and measurement equations, in addition to incorporating the measured output through equality constraints. Polyhedral relaxations of trigonometric functions are enabled for the first time, allowing to address a broader class of nonlinear systems than our previous works. Additionally, an approach to obtain an equivalent enclosure with fewer generators and constraints is developed. Thanks to the advantages of the polyhedral enclosures based on factorable representations, the new state estimation method provides better approximations than those resulting from linearization procedures. This led to significant improvements in the computation of convex sets enclosing the system states consistent with measured outputs. Numerical examples highlight the advantages of the novel algorithm in comparison to existing CZ methods based on the Mean Value Theorem and DC programming principles.</description>

      <title>Output-feedback model predictive control under dynamic uncertainties using integral quadratic constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an output-feedback tube-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme for linear systems under dynamic uncertainties that are described via integral quadratic constraints (IQC). By leveraging IQCs, a large class of nonlinear and dynamic uncertainties can be addressed. We leverage recent IQC synthesis tools to design a dynamic controller and an observer that are robust to these uncertainties and minimize the size of the resulting constraint tightening in the MPC. Thereby, we show that the robust estimation problem using IQCs with peak-to-peak performance can be convexified. We guarantee recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction, and input-to-state stability of the resulting MPC scheme.</description>

      <title>Dynamics-aware Diffusion Models for Planning and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00236v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of generating dynamically admissible trajectories for control tasks using diffusion models, particularly in scenarios where the environment is complex and system dynamics are crucial for practical application. We propose a novel framework that integrates system dynamics directly into the diffusion model's denoising process through a sequential prediction and projection mechanism. This mechanism, aligned with the diffusion model's noising schedule, ensures generated trajectories are both consistent with expert demonstrations and adhere to underlying physical constraints. Notably, our approach can generate maximum likelihood trajectories and accurately recover trajectories generated by linear feedback controllers, even when explicit dynamics knowledge is unavailable. We validate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on standard control tasks and a complex non-convex optimal control problem involving waypoint tracking and collision avoidance, demonstrating its potential for efficient trajectory generation in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Rack Position Optimization in Large-Scale Heterogeneous Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As rapidly growing AI computational demands accelerate the need for new hardware installation and maintenance, this work explores optimal data center resource management by balancing operational efficiency with fault tolerance through strategic rack positioning considering diverse resources and locations. Traditional mixed-integer programming (MIP) approaches often struggle with scalability, while heuristic methods may result in significant sub-optimality. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel two-tier optimization framework using a high-level deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model to guide a low-level gradient-based heuristic for local search. The high-level DRL agent employs Leader Reward for optimal rack type ordering, and the low-level heuristic efficiently maps racks to positions, minimizing movement counts and ensuring fault-tolerant resource distribution. This approach allows scalability to over 100,000 positions and 100 rack types. Our method outperformed the gradient-based heuristic by 7\% on average and the MIP solver by over 30\% in objective value. It achieved a 100\% success rate versus MIP's 97.5\% (within a 20-minute limit), completing in just 2 minutes compared to MIP's 1630 minutes (i.e., almost 4 orders of magnitude improvement). Unlike the MIP solver, which showed performance variability under time constraints and high penalties, our algorithm consistently delivered stable, efficient results - an essential feature for large-scale data center management.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Functions via Minkowski Operations for Safe Navigation among Polytopic Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safely navigating around obstacles while respecting the dynamics, control, and geometry of the underlying system is a key challenge in robotics. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) generate safe control policies by considering system dynamics and geometry when calculating safe forward-invariant sets. Existing CBF-based methods often rely on conservative shape approximations, like spheres or ellipsoids, which have explicit and differentiable distance functions. In this paper, we propose an optimization-defined CBF that directly considers the exact Signed Distance Function (SDF) between a polytopic robot and polytopic obstacles. Inspired by the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) algorithm, we formulate both (i) minimum distance and (ii) penetration depth between polytopic sets as convex optimization problems in the space of Minkowski difference operations (the MD-space). Convenient geometric properties of the MD-space enable the derivatives of implicit SDF between two polytopes to be computed via differentiable optimization. We demonstrate the proposed framework in three scenarios including pure translation, initialization inside an unsafe set, and multi-obstacle avoidance. These three scenarios highlight the generation of a non-conservative maneuver, a recovery after starting in collision, and the consideration of multiple obstacles via pairwise CBF constraint, respectively.</description>

      <title>Interpreting and Improving Optimal Control Problems with Directional Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many robotics tasks, such as path planning or trajectory optimization, are formulated as optimal control problems (OCPs). The key to obtaining high performance lies in the design of the OCP's objective function. In practice, the objective function consists of a set of individual components that must be carefully modeled and traded off such that the OCP has the desired solution. It is often challenging to balance multiple components to achieve the desired solution and to understand, when the solution is undesired, the impact of individual cost components. In this paper, we present a framework addressing these challenges based on the concept of directional corrections. Specifically, given the solution to an OCP that is deemed undesirable, and access to an expert providing the direction of change that would increase the desirability of the solution, our method analyzes the individual cost components for their "consistency" with the provided directional correction. This information can be used to improve the OCP formulation, e.g., by increasing the weight of consistent cost components, or reducing the weight of - or even redesigning - inconsistent cost components. We also show that our framework can automatically tune parameters of the OCP to achieve consistency with a set of corrections.</description>

Abstract: Computational methods in drug repositioning can help to conserve resources. In particular, methods based on biological networks are showing promise. Considering only the network topology and knowledge on drug target genes is not sufficient for quantitative predictions or predictions involving drug combinations. We propose an iterative procedure alternating between system identification and drug response experiments. Data from experiments are used to improve the model and drug effect knowledge, which is then used to select drugs for the next experiments. Using simulated data, we show that the procedure can identify nearly optimal drug combinations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to develop a theory for linear-quadratic Nash systems and Master equations in possibly infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. As a first step and motivated by the recent results in [31], we study a more general model in the linear quadratic case where the dependence on the distribution enters just in the objective functional through the mean. This property enables the Nash systems and the Master equation to be reduced to two systems of coupled Riccati equations and backward abstract evolution equations. We show that solutions for such systems exist and are unique for all time horizons, a result that is completely new in the literature in our setting. Finally, we apply the results to a vintage capital model, where capital depends on time and age, and the production function depends on the mean of the vintage capital.</description>

Abstract: We consider the convected Helmholtz equation with a generalized Myers boundary condition (a boundary condition of the second-order) and characterize the set of physical parameters for which the problem is weakly well-posed. The model comes from industrial applications to absorb acoustic noise in jet engines filled with absorbing liners (porous material). The problem is set on a 3D cylinder filled with a d-upper regular boundary measure, with a real 1 &lt; d $\le$ 2. This setup leads to a parametric shape optimization problem, for which we prove the existence of at least one optimal distribution for any fixed volume fraction of the absorbing liner on the boundary that minimizes the total acoustic energy on any bounded wavenumber range.</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns the eigenvalues of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator, a boundary integral operator associated with the harmonic double-layer potential. Specifically, we examine how the eigenvalues depend on the support of integration and prove that the map associating the support's shape to the eigenvalues is real-analytic. We then compute its first derivative and present applications of the resulting formula. The proposed method allows for handling infinite-dimensional perturbation parameters for multiple eigenvalues and perturbations that are not necessarily in the normal direction.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compare the performance of different numerical schemes in approximating Pontryagin's Maximum Principle's necessary conditions for the optimal control of nonholonomic systems. Retraction maps are used as a seed to construct geometric integrators for the corresponding Hamilton equations. First, we obtain an intrinsic formulation of a discretization map on a distribution $\mathcal{D}$. Then, we illustrate this construction on a particular example for which the performance of different symplectic integrators is examined and compared with that of non-symplectic integrators.</description>

      <title>The effect of latency on optimal order execution policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Market participants regularly send bid and ask quotes to exchange-operated limit order books. This creates an optimization challenge where their potential profit is determined by their quoted price and how often their orders are successfully executed. The expected profit from successful execution at a favorable limit price needs to be balanced against two key risks: (1) the possibility that orders will remain unfilled, which hinders the trading agenda and leads to greater price uncertainty, and (2) the danger that limit orders will be executed as market orders, particularly in the presence of order submission latency, which in turn results in higher transaction costs. In this paper, we consider a stochastic optimal control problem where a risk-averse trader attempts to maximize profit while balancing risk. The market is modeled using Brownian motion to represent the price uncertainty. We analyze the relationship between fill probability, limit price, and order submission latency. We derive closed-form approximations of these quantities that perform well in the practical regime of interest. Then, we utilize a mean-variance method where our total reward function features a risk-tolerance parameter to quantify the combined risk and profit.</description>

      <title>Virtual nonlinear nonholonomic constraints from a symplectic point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a geometric characterization of virtual nonlinear nonholonomic constraints from a symplectic perspective. Under a transversality assumption, there is a unique control law making the trajectories of the associated closed-loop system satisfy the virtual nonlinear nonholonomic constraints. We characterize them in terms of the symplectic structure on $TQ$ induced by a Lagrangian function and the almost-tangent structure. In particular, we show that the closed-loop vector field satisfies a geometric equation of Chetaev type. Moreover, the closed-loop dynamics is obtained as the projection of the uncontrolled dynamics to the tangent bundle of the constraint submanifold defined by the virtual constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that mean field optimal controls satisfy a first order optimality condition (at a.e. time) without any a priori requirement on their spatial regularity. This principle is obtained by a careful limit procedure of the Pontryagin maximum principle for finite particle systems. In particular, our result applies to the case of mean field selective optimal control problems for multipopulation and replicator dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05422v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate different turnpike phenomena of generalized discrete-time stochastic linear-quadratic optimal control problems. Our analysis is based on a novel strict dissipativity notion for such problems, in which a stationary stochastic process replaces the optimal steady state of the deterministic setting. We show that from this time-varying dissipativity notion, we can conclude turnpike behaviors concerning different objects like distributions, moments, or sample paths of the stochastic system and that the distributions of the stationary pair can be characterized by a stationary optimization problem. The analytical findings are illustrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>One Benders cut to rule all schedules in the neighbourhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Logic-Based Benders Decomposition (LBBD) and its Branch-and-Cut variant, namely Branch-and-Check, enjoy an extensive applicability on a broad variety of problems, including scheduling. Although LBBD offers problem-specific cuts to impose tighter dual bounds, its application to resource-constrained scheduling remains less explored. Given a position-based Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for scheduling on unrelated parallel machines, we notice that certain $k-$OPT neighbourhoods could implicitly be explored by regular local search operators, thus allowing us to integrate Local Branching into Branch-and-Check schemes. After enumerating such neighbourhoods and obtaining their local optima - hence, proving that they are suboptimal - a local branching cut (applied as a Benders cut) eliminates all their solutions at once, thus avoiding an overload of the master problem with thousands of Benders cuts. However, to guarantee convergence to optimality, the constructed neighbourhood should be exhaustively explored, hence this time-consuming procedure must be accelerated by domination rules or selectively implemented on nodes which are more likely to reduce the optimality gap. In this study, the realisation of this idea is limited on the common 'internal (job) swaps' to construct formulation-specific $4$-OPT neighbourhoods. Nonetheless, the experimentation on two challenging scheduling problems (i.e., the minimisation of total completion times and the minimisation of total tardiness on unrelated machines with sequence-dependent and resource-constrained setups) shows that the proposed methodology offers considerable reductions of optimality gaps or faster convergence to optimality. The simplicity of our approach allows its transferability to other neighbourhoods and different sequencing optimisation problems, hence providing a promising prospect to improve Branch-and-Check methods.</description>

      <title>An Optimistic-Robust Approach for Dynamic Positioning of Omnichannel Inventories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of data-driven and distribution-free optimistic-robust bimodal inventory optimization (BIO) strategy to effectively allocate inventory across a retail chain to meet time-varying, uncertain omnichannel demand. The bimodal nature of BIO stems from its ability to balance downside risk, as in traditional Robust Optimization (RO), which focuses on worst-case adversarial demand, with upside potential to enhance average-case performance. This enables BIO to remain as resilient as RO while capturing benefits that would otherwise be lost due to endogenous outliers. Omnichannel inventory planning provides a suitable problem setting for analyzing the effectiveness of BIO's bimodal strategy in managing the tradeoff between lost sales at stores and cross-channel e-commerce fulfillment costs, factors that are inherently asymmetric due to channel-specific behaviors. We provide structural insights about the BIO solution and how it can be tuned to achieve a preferred tradeoff between robustness and the average-case performance. Using a real-world dataset from a large American omnichannel retail chain, a business value assessment during a peak period indicates that BIO outperforms pure RO by 27% in terms of realized average profitability and surpasses other competitive baselines under imperfect distributional information by over 10%. This demonstrates that BIO provides a novel, data-driven, and distribution-free alternative to traditional RO that achieves strong average performance while carefully balancing robustness.</description>

      <title>An $\alpha$-potential game framework for $N$-player dynamic games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16962v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes and studies a general form of dynamic $N$-player non-cooperative games called $\alpha$-potential games, where the change of a player's value function upon her unilateral deviation from her strategy is equal to the change of an $\alpha$-potential function up to an error $\alpha$. Analogous to the static potential game (which corresponds to $\alpha=0$), the $\alpha$-potential game framework is shown to reduce the challenging task of finding $\alpha$-Nash equilibria for a dynamic game to minimizing the $\alpha$-potential function. Moreover, an analytical characterization of $\alpha$-potential functions is established, with $\alpha$ represented in terms of the magnitude of the asymmetry of value functions' second-order derivatives. For stochastic differential games in which the state dynamic is a controlled diffusion, $\alpha$ is characterized in terms of the number of players, the choice of admissible strategies, and the intensity of interactions and the level of heterogeneity among players. Two classes of stochastic differential games, namely distributed games and games with mean field interactions, are analyzed to highlight the dependence of $\alpha$ on general game characteristics that are beyond the mean-field paradigm, which focuses on the limit of $N$ with homogeneous players. To analyze the $\alpha$-NE, the associated optimization problem is embedded into a conditional McKean-Vlasov control problem. A verification theorem is established to construct $\alpha$-NE based on solutions to an infinite-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, which is reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations for linear-quadratic games.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Relative Investment Games in a Jump Diffusion Market with Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on multi-agent stochastic differential games for jump-diffusion systems. On one hand, we study the multi-agent game for optimal investment in a jump-diffusion market. We derive constant Nash equilibria and provide sufficient conditions for their existence and uniqueness for exponential, power, and logarithmic utilities, respectively. On the other hand, we introduce a computational framework based on the actor-critic method in deep reinforcement learning to solve the stochastic control problem with jumps. We extend this algorithm to address the multi-agent game with jumps and utilize parallel computing to enhance computational efficiency. We present numerical examples of the Merton problem with jumps, linear quadratic regulators, and the optimal investment game under various settings to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed method. In particular, neural network solutions numerically converge to the derived constant Nash equilibrium for the multi-agent game.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent for Convex and Smooth Noisy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06539v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the use of gradient descent with backtracking line search (GD-BLS) to solve the noisy optimization problem $\theta_\star:=\mathrm{argmin}_{\theta\in\mathbb{R}^d} \mathbb{E}[f(\theta,Z)]$, imposing that the function $F(\theta):=\mathbb{E}[f(\theta,Z)]$ is strictly convex but not necessarily $L$-smooth. Assuming that $\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla_\theta f(\theta_\star,Z)\|^2]&lt;\infty$, we first prove that sample average approximation based on GD-BLS allows to estimate $\theta_\star$ with an error of size $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}}(B^{-0.25})$, where $B$ is the available computational budget. We then show that we can improve upon this rate by stopping the optimization process earlier when the gradient of the objective function is sufficiently close to zero, and use the residual computational budget to optimize, again with GD-BLS, a finer approximation of $F$. By iteratively applying this strategy $J$ times, we establish that we can estimate $\theta_\star$ with an error of size $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}}(B^{-\frac{1}{2}(1-\delta^{J})})$, where $\delta\in(1/2,1)$ is a user-specified parameter. More generally, we show that if $\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla_\theta f(\theta_\star,Z)\|^{1+\alpha}]&lt;\infty$ for some known $\alpha\in (0,1]$ then this approach, which can be seen as a retrospective approximation algorithm with a fixed computational budget, allows to learn $\theta_\star$ with an error of size $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}}(B^{-\frac{\alpha}{1+\alpha}(1-\delta^{J})})$, where $\delta\in(2\alpha/(1+3\alpha),1)$ is a tuning parameter. Beyond knowing $\alpha$, achieving the aforementioned convergence rates do not require to tune the algorithms parameters according to the specific functions $F$ and $f$ at hand, and we exhibit a simple noisy optimization problem for which stochastic gradient is not guaranteed to converge while the algorithms discussed in this work are.</description>

      <title>A general framework for inexact splitting algorithms with relative errors and applications to Chambolle-Pock and Davis-Yin methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we apply the recently introduced framework of degenerate preconditioned proximal point algorithms to the hybrid proximal extragradient (HPE) method for maximal monotone inclusions. The latter is a method that allows inexact proximal (or resolvent) steps where the error is controlled by a relative-error criterion. Recently the HPE framework has been extended to the Douglas-Rachford method by Eckstein and Yao. In this paper we further extend the applicability of the HPE framework to splitting methods. To this end we use the framework of degenerate preconditioners that allows to write a large class of splitting methods as preconditioned proximal point algorithms. In this way, we modify many splitting methods such that one or more of the resolvents can be computed inexactly with an error that is controlled by an adaptive criterion. Further, we illustrate the algorithmic framework in the case of Chambolle-Pock's primal dual hybrid gradient method and the Davis-Yin's forward Douglas-Rachford method. In both cases, the inexact computation of the resolvent shows clear advantages in computing time and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Cislunar Space Situational Awareness Constellation Design and Planning with Facility Location Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by the surmounting interest for dedicated infrastructure in cislunar space, this work considers the satellite constellation design for cislunar space situational awareness (CSSA). We propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)-based formulation that simultaneously tackles the constellation design and sensor-tasking subproblems surrounding CSSA. Our approach generates constellation designs that provide coverage with considerations for the field-of-view of observers. We propose a time-expanded p-Median problem (TE-p-MP) which considers the optimal placement of p space-based observers into discretized locations based on orbital slots along libration point orbits, simultaneously with observer pointing directions across discretized time. We further develop a Lagrangian method for the TE-p-MP, where a relaxed problem with an analytical solution is derived, and customized heuristics leveraging the orbital structure of candidate observer locations are devised. The performance of the proposed formulation is demonstrated with several case studies for CSSA constellations monitoring the cislunar Cone of Shame and a periodic time-varying transit window for low-energy transfers located in the Earth-Moon L2 neck region. The proposed problem formulation, along with the Lagrangian method, is demonstrated to enable a fast assessment of near-optimal CSSA constellations, equipping decision-makers with a critical technique for exploring the design trade space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bundle Adjustment (BA) model is commonly optimized using a nonlinear least squares method, with the Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) algorithm being a typical choice. However, despite the L-M algorithm's effectiveness, its sensitivity to initial conditions often results in slower convergence when applied to poorly conditioned datasets, motivating the exploration of alternative optimization strategies. This paper introduces a novel algorithm for optimizing the BA model in the context of image sequence alignment for cryo-electron tomography, utilizing optimal control theory to directly optimize general nonlinear functions. The proposed Optimal Control Algorithm (OCA) exhibits superior convergence rates and effectively mitigates the oscillatory behavior frequently observed in L-M algorithm. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets were conducted to evaluate the algorithm's performance. The results demonstrate that the OCA achieves faster convergence compared to the L-M algorithm. Moreover, the incorporation of a bisection-based update procedure significantly enhances the OCA's performance, particularly in poorly initialized datasets. These findings indicate that the OCA can substantially improve the efficiency of 3D reconstructions in cryo-electron tomography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precision of shape representation and the dimensionality of the design space significantly influence the cost and outcomes of aerodynamic optimization. The design space can be represented more compactly by maintaining geometric precision while reducing dimensions, hence enhancing the cost-effectiveness of the optimization process. This research presents a new point cloud autoencoder architecture, called AE-BUFE, designed to attain efficient and precise generalized representations of 3D aircraft through uncertainty analysis of the deformation relationships among surface grid points. The deep learning architecture consists of two components: the uncertainty index-based feature enhancement module and the point cloud autoencoder module. It learns the shape features of the point cloud geometric representation to establish a low-dimensional latent space. To assess and evaluate the efficiency of the method, a comparison was conducted with the prevailing point cloud autoencoder architecture and the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) linear dimensionality reduction method under conditions of complex shape deformation. The results showed that the new architecture significantly improved the extraction effect of the low-dimensional latent space. Then, we developed the SBO optimization framework based on the AE-BUFE parameterization method and completed a multi-objective aerodynamic optimization design for a wide-speed-range vehicle considering volume and moment constraints. While ensuring the take-off and landing performance, the aerodynamic performance is improved at transonic and hypersonic conditions, which verifies the efficiency and engineering practicability of this method.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel replenishment strategy that can jointly support multiple satellite constellations. In this approach, multiple constellations share launch opportunities and parking orbits to address the operational satellite failures and ensure the desired service level of the constellations. We develop an inventory management model based on parametric replenishment policies, considering the launch vehicle's capacity and the shipping size of satellites. Based on this model, we introduce two decision-making scenarios and propose their corresponding solution frameworks. We conduct two case studies to provide valuable insights into the proposed strategy and demonstrate its applicability to supply chain management for maintaining multiple satellite constellations.</description>

Abstract: Markov games provide a powerful framework for modeling strategic multi-agent interactions in dynamic environments. Traditionally, convergence properties of decentralized learning algorithms in these settings have been established only for special cases, such as Markov zero-sum and potential games, which do not fully capture real-world interactions. In this paper, we address this gap by studying the asymptotic properties of learning algorithms in general-sum Markov games. In particular, we focus on a decentralized algorithm where each agent adopts an actor-critic learning dynamic with asynchronous step sizes. This decentralized approach enables agents to operate independently, without requiring knowledge of others' strategies or payoffs. We introduce the concept of a Markov Near-Potential Function (MNPF) and demonstrate that it serves as an approximate Lyapunov function for the policy updates in the decentralized learning dynamics, which allows us to characterize the convergent set of strategies. We further strengthen our result under specific regularity conditions and with finite Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Non-overshooting output shaping for switched linear systems under arbitrary switching using eigenstructure assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the analytical control design for a pair of switched linear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems that are subject to arbitrary switching signals. A state feedback controller design method is proposed to obtain an eigenstructure assignment that ensures that the closed-loop switched system is globally asymptotically stable, and the outputs achieve the non-overshooting tracking of a step reference. Our analysis indicates whether non-overshooting or even monotonic tracking is achievable for the given system and considered outputs and provides a choice of possible eigenstructures to be assigned to the constituent subsystems. We derive a structural condition that verifies the feasibility of the chosen assignment. A constructive algorithm to obtain suitable feedback matrices is provided, and the method is illustrated with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Projection-based Reduced Order Modelling for Unsteady Parametrized Optimal Control Problems in 3D Cardiovascular Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a projection-based reduced order modelling (ROM) framework for unsteady parametrized optimal control problems (OCP$_{(\mu)}$s) arising from cardiovascular (CV) applications. In real-life scenarios, accurately defining outflow boundary conditions in patient-specific models poses significant challenges due to complex vascular morphologies, physiological conditions, and high computational demands. These challenges make it difficult to compute realistic and reliable CV hemodynamics by incorporating clinical data such as 4D magnetic resonance imaging. To address these challenges, we focus on controlling the outflow boundary conditions to optimize CV flow dynamics and minimize the discrepancy between target and computed flow velocity profiles. The fluid flow is governed by unsteady Navier--Stokes equations with physical parametric dependence, i.e. the Reynolds number. Numerical solutions of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s require substantial computational resources, highlighting the need for robust and efficient ROMs to perform real-time and many-query simulations. Here, we aim at investigating the performance of a projection-based reduction technique that relies on the offline-online paradigm, enabling significant computational cost savings. The Galerkin finite element method is used to compute the high-fidelity solutions in the offline phase. We implemented a nested-proper orthogonal decomposition (nested-POD) for fast simulation of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s that encompasses two stages: temporal compression for reducing dimensionality in time, followed by parametric-space compression on the precomputed POD modes. We tested the efficacy of the methodology on vascular models, namely an idealized bifurcation geometry and a patient-specific coronary artery bypass graft, incorporating stress control at the outflow boundary, observing consistent speed-up with respect to high-fidelity strategies.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Posterior Samples for Bayesian Optimization via Rootfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22322v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization devolves the global optimization of a costly objective function to the global optimization of a sequence of acquisition functions. This inner-loop optimization can be catastrophically difficult if it involves posterior sample paths, especially in higher dimensions. We introduce an efficient global optimization strategy for posterior samples based on global rootfinding. It provides gradient-based optimizers with two sets of judiciously selected starting points, designed to combine exploration and exploitation. The number of starting points can be kept small without sacrificing optimization quality. Remarkably, even with just one point from each set, the global optimum is discovered most of the time. The algorithm scales practically linearly to high dimensions, breaking the curse of dimensionality. For Gaussian process Thompson sampling (GP-TS), we demonstrate remarkable improvement in both inner- and outer-loop optimization, surprisingly outperforming alternatives like EI and GP-UCB in most cases. Our approach also improves the performance of other posterior sample-based acquisition functions, such as variants of entropy search. Furthermore, we propose a sample-average formulation of GP-TS, which has a parameter to explicitly control exploitation and can be computed at the cost of one posterior sample. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/UQUH/TSRoots .</description>

      <title>Optimization Insights into Deep Diagonal Linear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Overparameterized models trained with (stochastic) gradient descent are ubiquitous in modern machine learning. These large models achieve unprecedented performance on test data, but their theoretical understanding is still limited. In this paper, we take a step towards filling this gap by adopting an optimization perspective. More precisely, we study the implicit regularization properties of the gradient flow "algorithm" for estimating the parameters of a deep diagonal neural network. Our main contribution is showing that this gradient flow induces a mirror flow dynamic on the model, meaning that it is biased towards a specific solution of the problem depending on the initialization of the network. Along the way, we prove several properties of the trajectory.</description>

      <title>Set-point control and local stability for flat nonlinear systems using model-following control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the set-point control problem for nonlinear systems with flat output that are subject to perturbations. The nonlinear dynamics as well as the perturbations are locally Lipschitz. We apply the model-following control (MFC) approach which consists of a model control loop (MCL) for a feedforward generation and a process control loop (PCL) that compensates the perturbations using high-gain feedback. We analyse the resulting closed-loop system and discuss its relation to a standard flatness-based high-gain approach. In particular we analyse the estimated region of attraction provided by a quadratic Lyapunov function. A case study illustrates the approach and quantifies the region of attraction obtained for each control approach. Using the initial condition of the model control loop as tuning parameter for the MFC design, provides that a significantly larger region of attraction can be guaranteed compared to a conventional single-loop high-gain design.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Thinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal in thinning is to summarize a dataset using a small set of representative points. Remarkably, sub-Gaussian thinning algorithms like Kernel Halving and Compress can match the quality of uniform subsampling while substantially reducing the number of summary points. However, existing guarantees cover only a restricted range of distributions and kernel-based quality measures and suffer from pessimistic dimension dependence. To address these deficiencies, we introduce a new low-rank analysis of sub-Gaussian thinning that applies to any distribution and any kernel, guaranteeing high-quality compression whenever the kernel or data matrix is approximately low-rank. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the techniques, we design practical sub-Gaussian thinning approaches that improve upon the best known guarantees for approximating attention in transformers, accelerating stochastic gradient training through reordering, and distinguishing distributions in near-linear time.</description>

      <title>A stochastic gradient descent algorithm with random search directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic coordinate descent algorithms are efficient methods in which each iterate is obtained by fixing most coordinates at their values from the current iteration, and approximately minimizing the objective with respect to the remaining coordinates. However, this approach is usually restricted to canonical basis vectors of $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this paper, we develop a new class of stochastic gradient descent algorithms with random search directions which uses the directional derivative of the gradient estimate following more general random vectors. We establish the almost sure convergence of these algorithms with decreasing step. We further investigate their central limit theorem and pay particular attention to analyze the impact of the search distributions on the asymptotic covariance matrix. We also provide non-asymptotic $\mathbb{L}^p$ rates of convergence.</description>

      <title>Representation and Stability Analysis of 1D PDEs with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PDEs with periodic boundary conditions are frequently used to model processes in large spatial environments, assuming solutions to extend periodically beyond some bounded interval. However, for 2nd order PDEs with periodic boundary conditions, the nullspace of the differential operator $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$ is nontrivial on the PDE domain, and solutions may converge to non-stationary trajectories existing in this nullspace. To test this convergence behaviour, in this paper, it is shown how we can model these trajectories for a broad class of linear, 2nd order, 1D PDEs with periodic as well as more general boundary conditions, using the Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. In particular, it is first shown how any function $\mathbf{u}(t)$ in the PDE domain can be decomposed into a component defined by $\mathbf{u}_{xx}(t)$, and a component $\bar{\mathbf{u}}(t)$ existing in the nullspace of $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$. An equivalent representation of linear PDEs is then derived as a PIE, explicitly defining the dynamics of both $\mathbf{u}_{xx}(t)$ and $\bar{\mathbf{u}}(t)$. Finally, a notion of exponential stability is defined for trajectories $\mathbf{u}^*(t)=\bar{\mathbf{u}}(t)$, and it is shown that stability of these trajectories as well as of the equilibrium $\mathbf{u}^*\equiv0$ can be tested by solving a linear operator inequality. The proposed methodology is applied to two examples, demonstrating that stability can be verified with tight bounds on the rate of exponential decay.</description>

      <title>$p$-Adic Polynomial Regression as Alternative to Neural Network for Approximating $p$-Adic Functions of Many Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A method for approximating continuous functions $\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ by a linear superposition of continuous functions $\mathbb{Z}_{p}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is presented and a polynomial regression model is constructed that allows approximating such functions with any degree of accuracy. A physical interpretation of such a model is given and possible methods for its training are discussed. The proposed model can be considered as a simple alternative to possible $p$-adic models based on neural network architecture.</description>
