      <title>$C^1$ perturbations of a continuum of critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a real valued function having a nondegenerate compact manifold of critical points, some of these points survive under small $C^2$ perturbations. This is a well-known result in critical point theory. In 1986 Weinstein obtained the analogous conclusions when the perturbation is only $C^2$ and the ambient space is a finite dimensional manifold. In this work we present a complete proof for $C^1$ perturbations in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Generalized probabilistic approximation characteristic based on Birkhoff orthogonality and related conclusions in $S_{\infty}$-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we generalize the definition of the probabilistic Gel'fand width from the Hilbert space to the strictly convex reflexive space by giving Birkhoff left orthogonal decomposition theorem. Meanwhile, a more natural definition of Gel'fand width in the classical setting is selected to make sure probabilistic and average Gel'fand widths will not lose their meaning, so that we can give the equality relation between the probabilistic Gel'fand width and the probabilistic linear width of the Hilbert space. Meanwhile, we use this relationship to continue the study of the Gel'fand widths of the univariate Sobolev space and the multivariate Sobolev space, especially in $S_{\infty}$-norm, and determine the exact order of probabilistic and average Gel'fand widths.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Extremal Bad Science Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the 'bad science matrix problem': among all matrices $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ whose rows have unit $\ell_2$-norm, determine the maximum of $\beta(A)=\frac{1}{2^n}\sum_{x\in\{\pm1\}^n}\|Ax\|_\infty$. Steinerberger [1] (arXiv:2402.03205) showed that the optimal asymptotic rate is $(1+o(1))\sqrt{2\log n}$, and that this rate is attained with high probability by matrices with i.i.d. $\pm1$ entries after normalization. More recent explicit constructions [2] (arXiv:2408.00933) achieve $\beta(A)\ge\sqrt{\log_2(n)+1}$, which lies within a constant factor of the asymptotic optimum. In this paper we bridge the gap between the probabilistic and explicit approaches. We give a geometric description of extremizers as (nearly) isoperimetrically extremal partitions of the $n$-dimensional hypercube induced by the rows of $A$. We obtain precise rates for heuristic constructions by recasting the maximization of $\beta(A)$ in the language of high-dimensional central-limit theorems as in Fang, Koike, Liu and Zhao [16] (arXiv:2305.17365). Using these connections, we present a family of explicit deterministic matrices $A_n$ that exist for all $n$ under the assumption of Hadamard's conjecture, and for infinitely many $n$ unconditionally, such that for all $n$ sufficiently large $\beta(A_n)\ge\bigl(1 - \frac{\log\log(2n)}{4\log(2n)}\bigr)\sqrt{2\log(2n)}.$</description>

      <title>Amenability, Optimal Transport and Abstract Ergodic Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using tools from the theory of optimal transport, we establish several results concerning isometric actions of amenable topological groups with potentially unbounded orbits. Specifically, suppose $d$ is a compatible left-invariant metric on an amenable topological group $G$ with no non-trivial homomorphisms to $\mathbb R$. Then, for every finite subset $E\subseteq G$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, there is a finitely supported probability measure $\beta$ on $G$ such that $$ \max_{g,h\in E}\, {\sf W}(\beta g, \beta h)&lt;\epsilon, $$ where ${\sf W}$ denotes the Wasserstein distance between probability measures on the metric space $(G,d)$. When $d$ is the word metric on a finitely generated group $G$, this strengthens a well known theorem of Reiter and, when $d$ is bounded, recovers a result of Schneider and Thom. Furthermore, when $G$ is locally compact, $\beta$ may be replaced by an appropriate probability density $f\in L^1(G)$.
  Also, when $G\curvearrowright X$ is a continuous isometric action on a metric space, the space of Lipschitz functions on the quotient $X/\!\!/G$ is isometrically isomorphic to a $1$-complemented subspace of the Lipschitz functions on $X$. And, when additionally $G$ is skew-amenable, there is a $G$-invariant contraction $$ \mathfrak {Lip}\, X \overset S\longrightarrow\mathfrak{Lip}(X/\!\!/G) $$ so that $(S\phi\big)\big(\overline{Gx}\big)=\phi(x)$ whenever $\phi$ is constant on every orbit of $G\curvearrowright X$. This latter extends results of Cuth and Doucha from the setting of locally compact or balanced groups.</description>

      <title>Gohberg-Krupnik Localisation for Discrete Wiener-Hopf Operators on Orlicz Sequence Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Phi$ be an $N$-function whose Matuszewska-Orlicz indices satisfy $1&lt;\alpha_\Phi\le\beta_\Phi&lt;\infty$. Using these indices, we introduce ``interpolation friendly" classes of Fourier multipliers $M_{[\Phi]}$ and $M_{\langle\Phi\rangle}$ such that $M_{[\Phi]}\subset M_{\langle\Phi\rangle}\subset M_\Phi$, where $M_\Phi$ is the Banach algebra of all Fourier multipliers on the reflexive Orlicz sequence space $\ell^\Phi(\mathbb{Z})$. Applying the Gohberg-Krupnik localisation in the corresponding Calkin algebra, the study of Fredholmness of the discrete Wiener-Hopf operator $T(a)$ with $a\in M_{\langle\Phi\rangle}$ is reduced to that of $T(a_\tau)$ for certain, potentially easier to study, local representatives $a_\tau\in M_{[\Phi]}$ of $a$ at all points $\tau\in[-\pi,\pi)$.</description>

      <title>A note on disjointness and discrete elements in partially ordered vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notions of disjointness and discrete elements play a prominent role in the classical theory of vector lattices. There are at least three different generalizations of the notion of disjointness to a larger class of partially ordered vector spaces. In recent years, one of these generalizations has been widely studied in the context of pre-Riesz spaces. The notion of $D$-disjointness is the most general of the three disjointness concepts. In this paper we study $D$-disjointness and the related concept of a $D$-discrete element. We establish some basic properties of $D$-discrete elements in Archimedean partially ordered spaces, and we investigate their relationship to discrete elements in the theory of pre-Riesz spaces.</description>

      <title>Absolutely continuous representing measures of complex sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1989, A. J. Duran [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 107 (1989), 731-741] showed, that for every complex sequence $(s_\alpha)_{\alpha\in\mathbb{N}_0^n}$ there exists a Schwartz function $f\in\mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{C})$ with $\mathrm{supp}\, f\subseteq [0,\infty)^n$ such that $s_\alpha = \int x^\alpha\cdot f(x)~\mathrm{d}x$ for all $\alpha\in\mathbb{N}_0^n$. It has been claimed to be a generalization of the result by T. Sherman [Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo 13 (1964), 273-278], that every complex sequences is represented by a complex measure on $[0,\infty)^n$. In the present work we use the convolution of sequences and measures to show, that Duran's result is a trivial consequence of Sherman's result. We use our easy proof to extend the Schwartz function result and to show the flexibility in choosing very specific functions $f$.</description>

      <title>Quantization Errors, Human--AI Interaction, and Approximate Fixed Points in $L^1(\mu)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a rigorous measure-theoretic framework for the analysis of fixed points of nonexpansive maps in the space $L^1(\mu)$, with explicit consideration of quantization errors arising in fixed-point arithmetic. Our central result shows that every bounded, closed, convex subset of $L^1(\mu)$ that is compact in the topology of local convergence in measure (a property we refer to as measure-compactness) enjoys the fixed point property for nonexpansive mappings. The proof relies on techniques from uniform integrability, convexity in measure, and normal structure theory, including an application of Kirk's theorem. We further analyze the effect of quantization by modeling fixed-point arithmetic as a perturbation of a nonexpansive map, establishing the existence of approximate fixed points under measure-compactness conditions. We also present counterexamples that illustrate the optimality of our assumptions.
  Beyond the theoretical development, we apply this framework to a human-in-the-loop co-editing system. By formulating the interaction between an AI-generated proposal, a human editor, and a quantizer as a composition of nonexpansive maps on a measure-compact set, we demonstrate the existence of a "stable consensus artefact". We prove that such a consensus state remains an approximate fixed point even under bounded quantization errors, and we provide a concrete example of a human-AI editing loop that fits this framework. Our results underscore the value of measure-theoretic compactness in the design and verification of reliable collaborative systems involving humans and artificial agents.</description>

      <title>Frame redundancy and Beurling density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the frame measure function of a frame in certain reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces on metric measure spaces is given by the reciprocal of the Beurling density of its index set. In addition, we show that each such frame with Beurling density greater than one contains a subframe with Beurling density arbitrary close to one. This confirms that the concept of frame measure function as introduced by Balan and Landau is a meaningful quantitative definition for the redundancy of a large class of infinite frames. In addition, it shows that the necessary density conditions for sampling in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces obtained by F\"uhr, Gr\"ochenig, Haimi, Klotz and Romero are optimal. As an application, we also settle the open questions of the existence of frames near the critical density for exponential frames on unbounded sets and for nonlocalized Gabor frames. The techniques used in this paper combine a selector form of Weaver's conjecture and various methods for quantifying the overcompleteness of frames.</description>

      <title>Analogues of $s$-potential and $s$-energy of mass distribution on Cantor dyadic group and their relation to Hausdorff dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an analogue of Riesz $s$-potetial and $s$-energy, $0&lt;s&lt;1$, of a mass distribution $\mu$ on the Cantor dyadic group $G$ by defining a respactive $s$-kernel. Then we relate Hausdorff dimension of a set $E\subset G$ to the value of $s$-energy of the mass distribution $\mu$ on this set $E$. Namely we prove that if on a set $E$ there exists a mass distribution $\mu$ with finite $s$-energy, then the Hausdorff dimension of $E$ is at least $s$.
  The same condiion can be expressed also in terms of Fourier coefficients of $\mu$ with respect to Walsh system on the group $G$.</description>

      <title>Algebra bundles, projective flatness and rationally-deformed tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that isomorphism classes $[\mathcal{A}]$ of flat $q\times q$ matrix bundles $\mathcal{A}$ (or projectively flat rank-$q$ complex vector bundles $\mathcal{E}$) on a pro-torus $\mathbb{T}$ are in bijective correspondence with the \v{C}ech cohomology group $H^2(\mathbb{T},\mu_q:=\text{$q^{th}$ roots of unity})$ (respectively $H^2(\mathbb{Z})$) via the image of $[A]\in H^1(\mathbb{T},PGL(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))$ through $H^1(\mathbb{T},PGL(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))\xrightarrow{\quad}H^2(\mathbb{T},\mu(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))$ (respectively the first Chern class $c_1(\mathcal{E})$). This is in the spirit of Auslander-Szczarba's result identifying real flat bundles on the torus with their first two Stiefel-Whitney classes, and contrasts with classifying spaces $B\Gamma$ of compact Lie groups $\Gamma$ (as opposed to $\mathbb{T}^n\cong B\mathbb{Z}^n$), on which flat non-trivial vector bundles abound. The discussion both recovers the Disney-Elliott-Kumjian-Raeburn classification of rational non-commutative tori $\mathbb{T}^n_{\theta}$ with a different, bundle-theoretic proof, and sheds some light on the connection between topological invariants associated to $\mathbb{T}^2_{\theta}$, $\theta\in\mathbb{Q}$ by Rieffel and respectively H{\o}egh-Krohn-Skjelbred.</description>

      <title>Kernel-based Stochastic Approximation Framework for Nonlinear Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic approximation framework for learning nonlinear operators between infinite-dimensional spaces utilizing general Mercer operator-valued kernels. Our framework encompasses two key classes: (i) compact kernels, which admit discrete spectral decompositions, and (ii) diagonal kernels of the form $K(x,x')=k(x,x')T$, where $k$ is a scalar-valued kernel and $T$ is a positive operator on the output space. This broad setting induces expressive vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that generalize the classical $K=kI$ paradigm, thereby enabling rich structural modeling with rigorous theoretical guarantees. To address target operators lying outside the RKHS, we introduce vector-valued interpolation spaces to precisely quantify misspecification error. Within this framework, we establish dimension-free polynomial convergence rates, demonstrating that nonlinear operator learning can overcome the curse of dimensionality. The use of general operator-valued kernels further allows us to derive rates for intrinsically nonlinear operator learning, going beyond the linear-type behavior inherent in diagonal constructions of $K=kI$. Importantly, this framework accommodates a wide range of operator learning tasks, ranging from integral operators such as Fredholm operators to architectures based on encoder-decoder representations. Moreover, we validate its effectiveness through numerical experiments on the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Some dynamical properties of weighted shifts on sequence spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by three recent open questions in the study of linear dynamics, we study weighted shifts on sequence spaces. First, we provide an~example of a~weighted shift on a~locally convex space whose topology is generated by a~sequence of complete seminorms which is generalized hyperbolic, but does not have the shadowing property. Next, we characterise uniform topological expansivity on Fr\'echet spaces satisfying some very natural conditions. Finally, we study the periodic shadowing property on normed spaces leading to a~condition formulated purely in terms of weights which we show is necessary for the periodic shadowing property on $\ell_p$ and equivalent on $c_0$.</description>

      <title>Approximating the operator norm of local Hamiltonians via few quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a Hermitian operator $A$ acting on a complex Hilbert space of dimension $2^n$. We show that when $A$ has small degree in the Pauli expansion, or in other words, $A$ is a local $n$-qubit Hamiltonian, its operator norm can be approximated independently of $n$ by maximizing $|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|$ over a small collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of product states $\ket{\psi}\in (\mathbf{C}^{2})^{\otimes n}$. More precisely, we show that whenever $A$ is $d$-local, \textit{i.e.,} $\deg(A)\le d$, we have the following discretization-type inequality:
  \[ \|A\|\le C(d)\max_{\psi\in \mathbf{X}_n}|\braket{\psi|A|\psi}|.
  \] The constant $C(d)$ depends only on $d$. This collection $\mathbf{X}_n$ of $\psi$'s, termed a \emph{quantum norm design}, is independent of $A$, and consists of product states, and can have
  cardinality as small as $(1+\eps)^n$, which is essentially tight. Previously, norm designs were known only for homogeneous $d$-localHamiltonians $A$ \cite{L,BGKT,ACKK}, and for non-homogeneous $2$-local traceless $A$ \cite{BGKT}.
  Several other results, such as boundedness of Rademacher projections for all levels and estimates of operator norms of random Hamiltonians, are also given.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Random Products of Countably Infinitely Many Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $r \in \mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$ be a fixed number and let $P_j\,\, (1 \leq j\leq r )$ be the projection onto the closed subspace $\mathcal{M}_j$ of $\mathscr{H}$. We are interested in studying the sequence $P_{i_1}, P_{i_2}, \ldots \in\{P_1, \ldots, P_r\}$. A significant problem is to demonstrate conditions under which the sequence $\{P_{i_n}\cdots P_{i_2}P_{i_1}x\}_{n=1}^\infty$ converges strongly or weakly to $Px$ for any $x\in\mathscr{H}$, where $P$ is the projection onto the intersection $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{M}_1\cap \ldots \cap \mathcal{M}_r$. Several mathematicians have presented their insights on this matter since von Neumann established his result in the case of $r=2$. In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to a question posed by M. Sakai. We present a result concerning random products of countably infinitely many projections (the case $r=\infty$) incorporating the notion of pseudo-periodic function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Wiener's Tauberian theorem from the perspective of limit functions, which results in several new versions of the Tauberian theorem. Based on this, we formulate and prove analogous Tauberian theorems for operators in the sense of quantum harmonic analysis. Using these results, we characterize the class of slowly oscillating operators and show that this class is strictly larger than the class of compact operators. Finally, we discuss uniform versions of Wiener's Tauberian theorem and its operator analogue and provide an application of this in operator theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to unify the theory of weights beyond the setting of weighted Lebesgue spaces in the general setting of quasi-Banach function spaces. We prove new characterizations for the boundedness of singular integrals, pose several conjectures, and prove partial results related to the duality of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator. Furthermore, we give an overview of the theory applied to weighted variable Lebesgue, Morrey, and Musielak-Orlicz spaces.</description>

      <title>Extension of contractive projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14808v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through the establishment of several extension theorems, we provide explicit expressions for all contractive projections and 1-complemented subspaces in the Hardy space $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ for $1\leq p&lt;\infty$, $p\neq 2$. Our characterization leads to two corollaries: first, all nontrivial 1-complemented subspaces of $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ are isometric to $H^p(\mathbb{T})$; second, all contractive projections on $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ are restrictions of contractive projections on $L^p(\mathbb{T})$ that leave $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ invariant. The first corollary provides examples of prime Banach spaces \emph{in the isometric sense}, while the second answers a question posed by P. Wojtaszczyk in 2003.</description>

      <title>Contractive projections, conditional expectations, and idempotent coefficient multipliers on $H^p$ spaces $(0&lt;p&lt;1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate contractive projections, conditional expectations, and idempotent coefficient multipliers on the Hardy spaces $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ for $0&lt;p&lt;1$. For such values of $p$, we first establish a general extension theorem for contractive projections in a probability $L^p$-space. Combining this theorem with the study of conditional expectations on $H^p(\mathbb{T})$, we characterize a broad class of contractive projections on $H^p(\mathbb{T})$ that are of particular interest. Furthermore, we apply these results to give a complete characterization of contractive idempotent coefficient multipliers for the Hardy spaces $H^p(\mathbb{T}^d)$ on the $d$-dimensional torus for $0&lt;p&lt;1$ and $1\leq d\leq \infty$. This complements a remarkable result of Brevig, Ortega-Cerd\`{a}, and Seip characterizing such multipliers on $H^p(\mathbb{T}^d)$ for $1\leq p \leq \infty$.</description>

      <title>Completeness of the space of absolutely and upper integrable functions with values in a semi-normed space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies absolute integrability for functions with values in semi-
  normed spaces and in locally convex topological vector spaces (LCTVS). We
  introduce an \emph{upper-integral} approach (based on a $\rho$-variational
  measure $\mu_{\rho}$) to define the spaces $\mathcal{U}^p_{\rho}$ of upper
  integrable functions and investigate their functional-analytic properties.
  The main contributions are:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the precise construction of the $\rho$-upper-integrability spaces
  $\mathcal{U}^p_{\rho}(A;X)$ (and their Fr\'echet analogues), together with the
  natural semi-norms $\|\cdot\|_{\mathcal{U}^p_{\rho}}$;
  \item measure-style inequalities adapted to the variational measure
  $\mu_{\rho}$ (monotone continuity for ascending sets, Fatou-type lemma, and
  Chebyshev inequality) within the $\rho$-upper-integral framework;
  \item functional-analytic results: sequential completeness of
  $\mathcal{U}^p_{\rho}([a,b];X)$ when $X$ is sequentially complete (semi-normed
  case), and sequential completeness of $\mathcal{U}^p([a,b];X)$ when $X$ is a
  sequentially complete Fr\'echet space; and
  \item the closedness of the absolutely integrable subspace
  $L^p_{\rho}([a,b];X)$ inside $\mathcal{U}^p_{\rho}([a,b];X)$ (hence
  $L^p([a,b];X)$ is a closed Fr\'echet subspace of $\mathcal{U}^p([a,b];X)$ under
  the usual hypotheses). \end{itemize}</description>

      <title>Hyperrigidity II: $R$-dilations, ideals and decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hyperrigidity of subsets of unital $C^*$-algebras annihilated by states (or, more generally, by completely positive maps). This is closely related to the concept of rigidity at $0$ introduced by G. Salomon, who studied hyperrigid subsets of Cuntz and Cuntz-Krieger algebras. The absence of the unit in a hyperrigid set allows for the existence of $R$-dilations with non-isometric $R$. The existence of such an $R$-dilation forces the state annihilating the hyperrigid set to be a character. Using a dilation-theoretic approach, we provide multiple equivalent criteria for hyperrigidity involving intertwining relations for representations, valid in both commutative and noncommutative settings. We develop structural models for such dilations via orthogonal decompositions into two or three components, determined by defect operators and generalized eigenspaces associated with underlying representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01381v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish general quantitative conditions for stochastic evolution equations with locally monotone drift and degenerate additive Wiener noise in variational formulation resulting in the existence of a unique invariant probability measure for the associated exponentially ergodic Markovian Feller semigroup. We prove improved moment estimates for the solutions and the $e$-property of the semigroup. Furthermore, we provide quantitative upper bounds for the Wasserstein $\varepsilon$-mixing times. Examples on possibly unbounded domains include the stochastic incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations, shear thickening stochastic power-law fluid equations, the stochastic heat equation, as well as, stochastic semilinear equations such as the 1D stochastic Burgers equation.</description>

      <title>On the limiting distribution of sums of random multiplicative functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the limiting distribution of $\frac{{(\log \log x)}^{1/4}}{\sqrt{x}} \sum_{n\le x}\alpha(n)$ where $\alpha$ is a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, answering a question of Harper. The distributional convergence is proved by applying the martingale central limit theorem to a suitably truncated sum. This truncation is inspired by work of Najnudel, Paquette, Simm and Vu on subcritical holomorphic multiplicative chaos setting, but analysed with a different conditioning argument generalised from Harper's work on fractional moments to circumvent integrability issues at criticality.
  A significant part of the proof is devoted to the convergence in probability of the associated partial Euler product to a critical multiplicative chaos measure, independent of the mild shift away from the critical line. Our approach to the universality of critical non-Gaussian multiplicative chaos bypasses the barrier analysis with the help of a modified second moment method, and employs a novel argument based on coupling and homogenisation by change of measure, which could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Interior Spectral Windows and Transport for Discrete Fractional Laplacians on $d$-Dimensional Hypercubic Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study anisotropic fractional discrete Laplacians $\Delta_{\mathbb{Z}^d}^{\vec{\mathbf{r}}}$ with exponents $\vec{\mathbf{r}}\in\mathbb{R}^d\setminus\{0\}$ on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}^d)$. We establish a Mourre estimate on compact energy intervals away from thresholds. As consequences we derive a Limiting Absorption Principle in weighted spaces, propagation estimates (minimal velocity and local decay), and the existence and completeness of local wave operators for perturbations $H=\Delta_{\mathbb{Z}^d}^{\vec{\mathbf{r}}}+W(Q)$, where $W$ is an anisotropically decaying potential of long--range type. In the stationary scattering framework we construct the on--shell scattering matrix $S(\lambda)$, prove the optical theorem, and, under a standard trace--class assumption on $W$, establish the Birman--Krein formula $\det S(\lambda)=\exp(-2\pi i\,\xi(\lambda))$.</description>
