      <title>Dichotomy for orderings?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class $NP$ can be defined by the means of Monadic Second-Order logic going back to Fagin and Feder-Vardi, and also by forbidden expanded substructures (cf. lifts and shadows of Kun and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il). Consequently, for such problems there is no dichotomy, unlike for $CSP$'s. We prove that ordering problems for graphs defined by finitely many forbidden ordered subgraphs still capture the class $NP$. In particular, we refute a conjecture of Hell, Mohar and Rafiey that dichotomy holds for this class. On the positive side, we confirm the conjecture of Duffus, Ginn and R\"odl that ordering problems defined by one single biconnected ordered graph are $NP$-complete but for the ordered complete graph. An interesting feature appeared and was noticed several times. For finite sets of biconnected patterns (which may be colored structures or ordered structures) complexity dichotomy holds. A principal tool for obtaining this result is known as the Sparse Incomparability Lemma, a classical result in the theory of homomorphisms of graphs and structures. We prove it here in the setting of ordered graphs as a Temporal Sparse Incomparability Lemma for orderings. Interestingly, our proof involves the Lov\'asz Local Lemma.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-time Tractable Problems over the $p$-adic Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of fundamental problems over the $p$-adic numbers ${\mathbb Q}_p$ and the $p$-adic integers ${\mathbb Z}_p$. Gu\'epin, Haase, and Worrell proved that checking satisfiability of systems of linear equations combined with valuation constraints of the form $v_p(x) = c$ for $p \geq 5$ is NP-complete (both over ${\mathbb Z}_p$ and over ${\mathbb Q}_p$), and left the cases $p=2$ and $p=3$ open. We solve their problem by showing that the problem is NP-complete for ${\mathbb Z}_3$ and for ${\mathbb Q}_3$, but that it is in P for ${\mathbb Z}_2$ and for ${\mathbb Q}_2$. We also present different polynomial-time algorithms for solvability of systems of linear equations in ${\mathbb Q}_p$ with either constraints of the form $v_p(x) \leq c$ or of the form $v_p(x)\geq c$ for $c \in {\mathbb Z}$. Finally, we show how our algorithms can be used to decide in polynomial time the satisfiability of systems of (strict and non-strict) linear inequalities over ${\mathbb Q}$ together with valuation constraints $v_p(x) \geq c$ for several different prime numbers $p$ simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Broadcasting under Structural Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Telephone Broadcast problem we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with a designated source vertex $s\in V$. Our goal is to transmit a message, which is initially known only to $s$, to all vertices of the graph by using a process where in each round an informed vertex may transmit the message to one of its uninformed neighbors. The optimization objective is to minimize the number of rounds.
  Following up on several recent works, we investigate the structurally parameterized complexity of Telephone Broadcast. In particular, we first strengthen existing NP-hardness results by showing that the problem remains NP-complete on graphs of bounded tree-depth and also on cactus graphs which are one vertex deletion away from being path forests. Motivated by this (severe) hardness, we study several other parameterizations of the problem and obtain FPT algorithms parameterized by vertex integrity (generalizing a recent FPT algorithm parameterized by vertex cover by Fomin, Fraigniaud, and Golovach [TCS 2024]) and by distance to clique, as well as FPT approximation algorithms parameterized by clique-cover and cluster vertex deletion. Furthermore, we obtain structural results that relate the length of the optimal broadcast protocol of a graph $G$ with its pathwidth and tree-depth. By presenting a substantial improvement over the best previously known bound for pathwidth (Aminian, Kamali, Seyed-Javadi, and Sumedha [arXiv 2025]) we exponentially improve the approximation ratio achievable in polynomial time on graphs of bounded pathwidth from $\mathcal{O}(4^\mathrm{pw})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{pw})$.</description>

      <title>Space-bounded online Kolmogorov complexity is additive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The even online Kolmogorov complexity of a string $x = x_1 x_2 \cdots x_{n}$ is the minimal length of a program that for all $i\le n/2$, on input $x_1x_3 \cdots x_{2i-1}$ outputs $x_{2i}$. The odd complexity is defined similarly. The sum of the odd and even complexities is called the dialogue complexity.
  In [Bauwens, 2014] it is proven that for all $n$, there exist $n$-bit $x$ for which the dialogue complexity exceeds the Kolmogorov complexity by $n\log \frac 4 3 + O(\log n)$. Let $\mathrm C^s(x)$ denote the Kolmogorov complexity with space bound~$s$. Here, we prove that the space-bounded dialogue complexity with bound $s + 6n + O(1)$ is at most $\mathrm C^{s}(x) + O(\log (sn))$, where $n=|x|$.</description>

      <title>Chemically Motivated Simulation Problems are Efficiently Solvable by a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09268v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating chemical systems is highly sought after and computationally challenging, as the number of degrees of freedom increases exponentially with the size of the system. Quantum computers have been proposed as a computational means to overcome this bottleneck , thanks to their capability of representing this amount of information efficiently. Most efforts so far have been centered around determining the ground states of chemical systems. However, hardness results and the lack of theoretical guarantees for efficient heuristics for initial-state generation shed doubt on the feasibility. Here, we propose a heuristically guided approach that is based on inherently efficient routines to solve chemical simulation problems, requiring quantum circuits of size scaling polynomially in relevant system parameters. If a set of assumptions can be satisfied, our approach finds good initial states for dynamics simulation by assembling them in a scattering tree. In particular, we investigate a scattering-based state preparation approach within the context of mergo-association. We discuss a variety of quantities of chemical interest that can be measured after the quantum simulation of a process, e.g., a reaction, following its corresponding initial state preparation.</description>
