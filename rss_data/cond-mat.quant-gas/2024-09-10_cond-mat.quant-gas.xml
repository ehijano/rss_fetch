      <title>Vortex dynamics in two-dimensional supersolids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of quantized vortices in a model two-dimensional supersolid. Starting from an effective action that captures the dynamics of the superfluid condensate and its coupling to the lattice displacements, we integrate out the low-energy Goldstone modes-the phonons of the solid and the superfluid condensate-to arrive at an effective action for the vortices in the condensate. In the low-velocity limit we calculate the effective inertial mass for the vortices, and we find that the mass has a logarithmic frequency dependence, similar to the inertial mass found in superfluid vortices. The vortex dynamics also includes a Magnus force term in the equation of motion that arises from the Berry phase in the effective action.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Spin-Imbalanced Fermi Gases with SU(N) Symmetric Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamics of degenerate Fermi gases has been extensively studied through various aspects such as Pauli blocking effects, collective modes, BCS superfluidity, and more. Despite this, multi-component fermions with imbalanced spin configurations remain largely unexplored, particularly beyond the two-component scenario. In this work, we generalize the thermodynamic study of SU($N$) fermions to spin-imbalanced configurations based on density fluctuations. Theoretically, we provide closed-form expressions of density fluctuation across all temperature ranges for general spin population setups. Experimentally, after calibrating the measurements with deeply degenerate $^{173}$Yb Fermi gases under spin-balanced configurations ($N\leq$~6), we examine the density fluctuations in spin-imbalanced systems. Specifically, we investigate two-species and four-species configurations to validate our theoretical predictions. Our analysis indicates that interaction enhancement effects can be significant even in highly spin-imbalanced systems. Finally, as an application, we use this approach to examine the decoherence process. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the thermodynamic features of spin-imbalanced multi-component Fermi gases and opens new avenues for exploring complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent interaction-induced topology in Bose-Hubbard ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum many-body dynamics of bosonic atoms hopping in a two-leg ladder with strong on-site contact interactions. We observe that when the atoms are prepared in a staggered pattern with pairs of atoms on every other rung, singlon defects, i.e.~rungs with only one atom, can localize due to an emergent topological model, even though the underlying model in the absence of interactions admits only topologically trivial states. This emergent topological localization results from the formation of a zero-energy edge mode in an effective lattice formed by two adjacent chains with alternating strong and weak hoping links (Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains) and opposite staggering which interface at the defect position. Our findings open the opportunity to dynamically generate non-trivial topological behaviors without the need for complex Hamiltonian engineering.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic self-trapping in the dynamical tunneling of a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Bose-Einstein condensate in a modulated, one-dimensional, anharmonic potential can exhibit dynamical tunneling between islands of regular motion in phase space. With increasingly repulsive atomic interactions, dynamical tunneling is predicted to cease due to self-trapping [S. W\"uster et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 080401 (2012)]. This suppression of tunneling oscillations is related to the same phenomenon that occurs in the two-mode dynamics of a repulsively interacting Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential. Here we present a two-mode model for dynamical tunnelling based on nonlinear Floquet states and examine the range of validity of the approximation. We characterise nonlinear dynamical tunneling for different trap strengths, modulation amplitudes, and effective Planck constants. Using the linear Floquet states we derive an expression for the critical nonlinearity beyond which tunneling ceases. Finally we demonstrate the dynamical instability of selected nonlinear Floquet states and show how to initialise some Floquet states in experiments. Our detailed survey will enable experiments to target accessible parameter regimes for the study of nonlinear dynamical tunneling.</description>

      <title>Simulating Chemistry with Fermionic Optical Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that quantum number preserving Ans\"atze for variational optimization in quantum chemistry find an elegant mapping to ultracold fermions in optical superlattices. Using native Hubbard dynamics, trial ground states for arbitrary molecular Hamiltonians can be prepared and their molecular energies measured in the lattice. The scheme requires local control over interactions and chemical potentials and global control over tunneling dynamics, but foregoes the need for optical tweezers, shuttling operations, or long-range interactions. We describe a complete compilation pipeline from the molecular Hamiltonian to the sequence of lattice operations, thus providing a concrete link between quantum simulation and chemistry. Our work enables the application of recent quantum algorithmic techniques, such as Double Factorization and quantum Tailored Coupled Cluster, to present-day fermionic optical lattice systems with significant improvements in the required number of experimental repetitions. We provide detailed quantum resource estimates for small non-trivial hardware experiments.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Dephasing by Hole Motion in a Spin-Orbit-Coupled Mott Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Ramsey interferometry to study spin dynamics in the strongly interacting regime of spin-orbit-coupled quantum gases in one-dimensional optical lattices. We observe an intrinsic many-body dephasing mechanism immune to spin-echo in two-component Mott insulators. We ascribe the dephasing to the motion of hole-like defects in an otherwise inert Mott insulator, the spinless nature of the holes explaining the ineffectiveness of spin echo to restore it. We show that a model of spin-orbit-coupled hardcore bosons can explain quantitatively our experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of interacting particles on a rhombus chain: Aharonov-Bohm caging and inverse Anderson transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm (AB) caging is the phenomenon of extreme localization of particles experiencing magnetic field in certain tight binding lattices. While the AB caging involves the localization of non-interacting particles, it often breaks down due to the effect of interaction resulting in delocalization. In this study, however, we show that interactions under proper conditions can restore the AB caging of particles. By analysing the dynamics of two bosons possessing both onsite and nearest neighbor interactions on a one dimensional diamond/rhombus lattice pierced by an artificial gauge field, we show that the AB caging is restored when both the interactions are of equal strengths. Furthermore, the AB caged bosons, with the onset of an antisymmetric correlated onsite disorder in the lattice, escape from the cages, demonstrating the phenomenon of inverse Anderson transition which is known to be exhibited by the non-interacting AB caged particles. We also obtain situation similar to the inverse Anderson transition when an external potential gradient is applied to the lattice. These findings offer route to realize the AB caging and inverse Anderson transition of interacting particles in experiments involving ultracold atoms in optical lattices or superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Effective spin dynamics of spin-orbit coupled matter-wave solitons in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider matter-wave solitons in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates embedded in optical lattice and study dynamics of soliton within the framework of Gross-Pitaevskii equations. We express spin components of the soliton pair in terms of nonlinear Bloch equation and investigate effective spin dynamics. It is seen that the effective magnetic field that appears in the Bloch equation is affected by the optical lattices, and thus the optical lattice influences the precessional frequency of the spin components. We make use of numerical approaches to investigate the dynamical behavior of density profiles and center-of-mass of the soliton pair in presence of the optical lattice. It is shown that the spin density is periodically varying due to flipping of spinors between the two states. The amplitude of spin flipping oscillation increases with lattice strength. We find that the system can also exhibit interesting nonlinear behavior for chosen values of parameters. We present a fixed point analysis to study the effects of optical lattices on the nonlinear dynamics of the spin components. It is seen that the optical lattice can act as a control parameter to change the dynamical behavior of the spin components from periodic to chaotic.</description>

      <title>Anomalous multi-gap topological phases in periodically driven quantum rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that periodically driven quantum rotors provide a promising and broadly applicable platform to implement multi-gap topological phases, where groups of bands can acquire topological invariants due to non-Abelian braiding of band degeneracies. By adiabatically varying the periodic kicks to the rotor we find nodal-line braiding, which causes sign flips of topological charges of band nodes and can prevent them from annihilating, indicated by non-zero values of the %non-Abelian patch Euler class. In particular, we report on the emergence of an anomalous Dirac string phase arising in the strongly driven regime, a truly out-of-equilibrium phase of the quantum rotor. This phase emanates from braiding processes involving all (quasienergy) gaps and manifests itself with edge states at zero angular momentum. Our results reveal direct applications in state-of-the-art experiments of quantum rotors, such as linear molecules driven by periodic far-off-resonant laser pulses or artificial quantum rotors in optical lattices, whose extensive versatility offers precise modification and observation of novel non-Abelian topological properties.</description>

      <title>Floquet dynamical chiral spin liquid at finite frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral Spin Liquids (CSL) are quantum spin analogs of electronic Fractional Chern Insulators. Their realizations on ultracold-atom or Rydberg-atom platforms remain very challenging. Recently, a setup of time-periodic modulations of nearest-neighbor Heisenberg couplings applied on an initial genuine spin liquid state on the square lattice has been proposed to stabilize a (Abelian) $\mathbb{Z}_2$ CSL phase. In the high-frequency limit, it was shown that time evolution can be described in terms of a static effective chiral Hamiltonian. Here we revisit this proposal and consider drives at lower frequency in a regime where the high-frequency Magnus expansion fails. We show that a Dynamical CSL (DCSL) is nevertheless stabilized in a finite range of frequency. The topological nature of this dynamical phase, as well as its instability below a critical frequency, is connected to specific features of the Floquet pseudo-energy spectrum. We also show that the DCSL can be represented faithfully by a two-dimensional time-periodic tensor network and, as in the static case, topological order is associated to a tensor gauge symmetry ($\mathbb{Z}_2$ in that case).</description>

      <title>Measuring temporal entanglement in experiments as a hallmark for integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel experimental approach to probe many-body quantum systems by developing a protocol to measure generalized temporal entropies. We demonstrate that the recently proposed generalized temporal entropies [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 033021] are equivalent to observing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a replicated system induced by a double quench protocol using local operators as probes. This equivalence, confirmed through state-of-the-art tensor network simulations for one-dimensional systems, validates the feasibility of measuring generalized temporal entropies experimentally. Our results reveal that the dynamics governed by the transverse field Ising model integrable Hamiltonian differ qualitatively from those driven by the same model with an additional parallel field, breaking integrability. They thus suggest that generalized temporal entropies can serve as a tool for identifying different dynamical classes. This work represents the first practical application of generalized temporal entropy characterization in one-dimensional many-body quantum systems and offers a new pathway for experimentally detecting integrability. We conclude by outlining the experimental requirements for implementing this protocol with state of the art quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microscopic pair structure of superfluids has profound consequences on their properties. Delocalized pairs are predicted to be less affected by static disorder than localized pairs. Ultracold gases allow tuning the pair size via interactions, where for resonant interaction superfluids shows largest critical velocity, i.e. stability against perturbations. The sensitivity of such fluids to strong, time-dependent disorder is less explored. Here, we investigate ultracold, interacting Fermi gases across various interaction regimes after rapid switching optical disorder potentials. We record the ability for quantum hydrodynamic expansion of the gas to quantify its long-range phase coherence. Contrary to static expectations, the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) exhibits significant resilience against disorder quenches, while the resonantly interacting Fermi gas permanently loses quantum hydrodynamics. Our findings suggest an additional absorption channel perturbing the resonantly interacting gas as pairs can be directly affected by the disorder quench.</description>

      <title>Relaxation in dipolar spin ladders: from pair production to false-vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold dipolar particles pinned in optical lattices or tweezers provide an excellent platform for studying out-of-equilibrium quantum magnetism with dipole-mediated couplings. Starting with an initial state with spins of opposite orientation in each of the legs of a ladder lattice, we show that spin relaxation displays an unexpected dependence on inter-leg distance and dipole orientation. This intricate dependence, stemming from the interplay between intra- and inter-leg interactions, results in three distinct dynamical regimes: (i) ergodic, characterized by the fast relaxation towards equilibrium of correlated pairs of excitations generated at exponentially fast rates from the initial state; (ii) metastable, in which the state is quasi-localized in the initial state and only decays at exceedingly long timescales, resembling false vacuum decay; and, surprisingly, (iii) partially-relaxed, with coexisting fast partial relaxation and very long-lived partial quasi-localization. Realizing these intriguing dynamics is within reach of current state-of-the-art experiments in dipolar gases.</description>

      <title>Maxwell relation between entropy and atom-atom pair correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For many-particle systems with short-range interactions the local (same point) particle-particle pair correlation function represents a thermodynamic quantity that can be calculated using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. Here we exploit this property to derive a thermodynamic Maxwell relation between the local pair correlation and the entropy of an ultracold Bose gas in one dimension (1D). To demonstrate the utility of this Maxwell relation, we apply it to the computational formalism of the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE) to determine the entropy of a finite-temperature 1D Bose gas from its atom-atom pair correlation function. Such a correlation function is easy to compute numerically within the SPGPE and other formalisms, which is unlike computing the entropy itself. Our calculations can be viewed as a numerical experiment that serves as a proof-of-principle demonstration of an experimental method to deduce the entropy of a quantum gas from the measured atom-atom correlations.</description>

Abstract: The interactions between Rydberg atoms and microwave fields provide a valuable framework for studying the complex dynamics out of equilibrium, exotic phases, and critical phenomena in many-body physics. This unique interplay allows us to explore various regimes of nonlinearity and phase transitions. Here, we observe a phase transition from the state in the regime of bistability to that in multistability in strongly interacting Rydberg atoms by varying the microwave field intensity, accompanying with the breaking of Z3-symmetry. During the phase transition, the system experiences a hidden critical point, in which the multistable states are difficult to be identified. Through changing the initial state of system, we can identify a hidden multistable state and reveal a hidden trajectory of phase transition, allowing us to track to a hidden critical point. In addition, we observe multiple phase transitions in spectra, suggesting higher-order symmetry breaking. The reported results shed light on manipulating multistability in dissipative Rydberg atoms systems and hold promise in the applications of non-equilibrium many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch dynamics and topology in a classical non-equilibrium process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect refers to the accumulation of eigenstates near the boundary in open boundary lattice models, which can be systematically characterized using the non-Bloch band theory. Here, we apply the non-Bloch band theory to investigate the stochastic reaction-diffusion process by mapping it to a non-Hermitian Kitaev chain. We exactly obtain the open boundary spectrum and the generalized Brillouin zone, and identify a robust zero mode arising from the non-Bloch topology. Notably, distinct from its Hermitian counterpart in the quantum context, the zero mode supports anomalous dynamical crossover in the Markov process. We quantitatively demonstrate the intriguing dynamical effects through the spectral decomposition of the Hamiltonian on the non-Bloch eigenstates, and confirm our findings by conducting stochastic simulations with high accuracy. Our study highlights the significant and general role of non-Bloch topology in non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Shadow Tomography through Many-body Localization Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01258v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography serves as a potent tool for extracting numerous properties from quantum many-body systems with minimal measurements. Nevertheless, prevailing methods yielding optimal performance for few-body operators necessitate the application of random two-qubit gates, a task that can prove challenging on specific quantum simulators such as ultracold atomic gases. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach founded on the dynamics of many-body localization, a phenomenon extensively demonstrated in optical lattices. Through an exploration of the shadow norm -- both analytically, employing a phenomenological model, and numerically, utilizing the TEBD algorithm -- we demonstrate that our scheme achieves remarkable efficiency comparable to shallow circuits or measurement-induced criticality, resulting in a significant improvement in the exponential exponent compared to the previous classical shadow protocol. Our findings are corroborated through direct numerical simulations encompassing the entire sampling and reconstruction processes. Consequently, our results present a compelling methodology for analyzing the output states of quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Preserving the Hermiticity of the One-Body Density Matrix for a Non-Interacting Fermi Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The one-body density matrix (ODM) for a zero temperature non-interacting Fermi gas can be approximately obtained in the semiclassical regime through different $\hbar$-expansion techniques. One would expect that each method of approximating the ODM should yield equivalent density matrices which are both Hermitian and idempotent to any order in $\hbar$. However, the Kirzhnits and Wigner-Kirkwood methods do not yield these properties, while the Grammaticos-Voros method does. Here we show explicitly, for arbitrary $d$-dimensions through an appropriate change into symmetric coordinates, that each method is indeed identical, Hermitian, and idempotent. This change of variables resolves the inconsistencies between the various methods, showing that the non-Hermitian and non-idempotent behavior of the Kirzhnits and Wigner-Kirkwood methods is an artifact of performing a non-symmetric truncation to the semiclassical $\hbar$-expansions. Our work also provides the first explicit derivation of the $d$-dimensional Grammaticos-Voros ODM, originally proposed by Redjati et al (2019 $\textit{J. Phys. Chem. Solids}$ 134 313-8) based on their $d=1,2,3,4$ expressions.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-induced spin parity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19311v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin parity effects refer to those special situations where a dichotomy in the physical behavior of a system arises, solely depending on whether the relevant spin quantum number is integral or half-odd integral. As is the case with the Haldane conjecture in antiferromagnetic spin chains, their pursuit often derives deep insights and invokes new developments in quantum condensed matter physics. Here, we put forth a simple and general scheme for generating such effects in any spatial dimension through the use of anisotropic interactions, and a setup within reasonable reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom implementations. We demonstrate its utility through a detailed analysis of the magnetization behavior of a specific one-dimensional spin chain model, an anisotropic antiferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field, unraveling along the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold atom-molecule collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report numerically exact quantum scattering calculations on magnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold, strongly anisotropic atom-molecule [Rb($^2$S) + SrF($^2\Sigma^+$)] collisions based on state-of-the-art ab initio potential energy surfaces. We find broad resonances mediated by the intermolecular spin-exchange interaction, as well as narrow resonances due to the intramolecular spin-rotation interaction, which are unique to atom-molecule collisions. Remarkably, the density of resonances in atom-molecule collisions is not much higher than that in atomic collisions despite the presence of a dense manifold of molecular rotational states, which can be rationalized by analyzing the adiabatic states of the collision complex.</description>
