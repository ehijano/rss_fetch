      <title>Dynamics of antibody binding and neutralization during viral infection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In vivo in infection, virions are constantly produced and die rapidly. In contrast, most antibody binding assays do not include such features. Motivated by this, we considered virions with n=100 binding sites in simple mathematical models with and without the production of virions. In the absence of viral production, at steady state, the distribution of virions by the number of sites bound is given by a binomial distribution, with the proportion being a simple function of antibody affinity (Kon/Koff) and concentration; this generalizes to a multinomial distribution in the case of two or more kinds of antibodies. In the presence of viral production, the role of affinity is replaced by an infection analog of affinity (IAA), with IAA=Kon/(Koff+dv+r), where dv is the virus decaying rate and r is the infection growth rate. Because in vivo dv can be large, the amount of binding as well as the effect of Koff on binding are substantially reduced. When neutralization is added, the effect of Koff is similarly small which may help explain the relatively high Koff reported for many antibodies. We next show that the n+2-dimensional model used for neutralization can be simplified to a 2-dimensional model. This provides some justification for the simple models that have been used in practice. A corollary of our results is that an unexpectedly large effect of Koff in vivo may point to mechanisms of neutralization beyond stoichiometry. Our results suggest reporting Kon and Koff separately, rather than focusing on affinity, until the situation is better resolved both experimentally and theoretically.</description>

      <title>Seasonality and susceptibility from measles time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops mathematical tools to estimate seasonal changes in measles transmission rates and corresponding variation in population susceptibility. The tools are designed to leverage times series of cases in the absence of demographic data. In particular, we focus on publicly available suspected case reports from the World Health Organization (WHO), which routinely publishes country-level, monthly aggregated time series. With that as input, we show that measles epidemiologies can be characterized efficiently at global-scale, and we use our estimates to recommend context-specific, future supplementary immunization times. Throughout the paper, comparisons with more data-informed models illustrate that the approach captures the essential dynamics, and broadly speaking, the tools we describe represent a scalable intermediate between conventional empirical approaches and more intricate disease models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the exclusion principle in epidemiology at its ultimate limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The competitive exclusion principle in epidemiology implies that when competing strains of a pathogen provide complete protection for each other, the strain with the largest reproduction number outcompetes the other strains and drives them to extinction. The introduction of various trade-off mechanisms may facilitate the coexistence of competing strains, especially when their respective basic reproduction numbers are close so that the competition between the strains is weak. Yet, one may expect that a substantial competitive advantage of one of the strains will eventually outbalance trade-off mechanisms driving less competitive strains to extinction. The literature, however, lacks a rigorous validation of this statement. In this work, we challenge the validity of the exclusion principle at an ultimate limit in which one strain has a vast competitive advantage over the other strains. We show that when one strain is significantly more transmissible than the others, and under broad conditions, an epidemic system with two strains has a stable endemic equilibrium in which both strains coexist with comparable prevalence. Thus, the competitive exclusion principle does not unconditionally hold beyond the established case of complete immunity.</description>

      <title>Spatial Cognition: a Wave Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Animals build Bayesian 3D models of their surroundings, to control their movements. There is strong selection pressure to make these models as precise as possible, given their sense data. A previous paper has described how a precise 3D model of space can be built by object tracking. This only works if 3D locations are stored with high spatial precision. Neural models of 3D spatial memory have large random errors; too large to support the tracking model. An alternative is described, in which neurons couple to a wave excitation in the brain, representing 3-D space. This can give high spatial precision, fast response, and other benefits. Three lines of evidence support the wave hypothesis: (1) it has better precision and speed than neural spatial memory, and is good enough to support object tracking; (2) the central body of the insect brain, whose form is highly conserved across all insect species, is well suited to hold a wave; and (3) the thalamus, whose round shape is conserved across all mammal species, is well suited to hold a wave. These lines of evidence strongly support the wave hypothesis.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Tracking Phylogenies in Parallel and Distributed Agent-based Evolution Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer simulations are an important tool for studying the mechanics of biological evolution. In particular, in silico work with agent-based models provides an opportunity to collect high-quality records of ancestry relationships among simulated agents. Such phylogenies can provide insight into evolutionary dynamics within these simulations. Existing work generally tracks lineages directly, yielding an exact phylogenetic record of evolutionary history. However, direct tracking can be inefficient for large-scale, many-processor evolutionary simulations. An alternate approach to extracting phylogenetic information from simulation that scales more favorably is post hoc estimation, akin to how bioinformaticians build phylogenies by assessing genetic similarities between organisms. Recently introduced ``hereditary stratigraphy'' algorithms provide means for efficient inference of phylogenetic history from non-coding annotations on simulated organisms' genomes. A number of options exist in configuring hereditary stratigraphy methodology, but no work has yet tested how they impact reconstruction quality. To address this question, we surveyed reconstruction accuracy under alternate configurations across a matrix of evolutionary conditions varying in selection pressure, spatial structure, and ecological dynamics. We synthesize results from these experiments to suggest a prescriptive system of best practices for work with hereditary stratigraphy, ultimately guiding researchers in choosing appropriate instrumentation for large-scale simulation studies.</description>
