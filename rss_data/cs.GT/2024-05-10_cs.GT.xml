      <title>Selecting the Most Conflicting Pair of Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study committee elections from a perspective of finding the most conflicting candidates, that is, candidates that imply the largest amount of conflict, as per voter preferences. By proposing basic axioms to capture this objective, we show that none of the prominent multiwinner voting rules meet them. Consequently, we design committee voting rules compliant with our desiderata, introducing conflictual voting rules. A subsequent deepened analysis sheds more light on how they operate. Our investigation identifies various aspects of conflict, for which we come up with relevant axioms and quantitative measures, which may be of independent interest. We support our theoretical study with experiments on both real-life and synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Truthful Aggregation of LLMs with an Application to Online Advertising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of aggregating the preferences of multiple agents over LLM-generated replies to user queries, where agents might modify or exaggerate their preferences. New agents may participate for each new query, making fine-tuning LLMs on these preferences impractical. To overcome these challenges, we propose an auction mechanism that operates without fine-tuning or access to model weights. This mechanism is designed to provably converge to the ouput of the optimally fine-tuned LLM as computational resources are increased. The mechanism can also incorporate contextual information about the agents when avaiable, which significantly accelerates its convergence. A well-designed payment rule ensures that truthful reporting is the optimal strategy for all agents, while also promoting an equity property by aligning each agent's utility with her contribution to social welfare - an essential feature for the mechanism's long-term viability. While our approach can be applied whenever monetary transactions are permissible, our flagship application is in online advertising. In this context, advertisers try to steer LLM-generated responses towards their brand interests, while the platform aims to maximize advertiser value and ensure user satisfaction. Experimental results confirm that our mechanism not only converges efficiently to the optimally fine-tuned LLM but also significantly boosts advertiser value and platform revenue, all with minimal computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Correlated vs. Uncorrelated Randomness in Adversarial Congestion Team Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider team zero-sum network congestion games with $n$ agents playing against $k$ interceptors over a graph $G$. The agents aim to minimize their collective cost of sending traffic over paths in $G$, which is an aggregation of edge costs, while the interceptors aim to maximize the collective cost by increasing some of these edge costs. To evade the interceptors, the agents will usually use randomized strategies. We consider two cases, the correlated case when agents have access to a shared source of randomness, and the uncorrelated case, when each agent has access to only its own source of randomness. We study the additional cost that uncorrelated agents have to bear, specifically by comparing the costs incurred by agents in cost-minimal Nash equilibria when agents can and cannot share randomness.
  We consider two natural cost functions on the agents, which measure the invested energy and time, respectively. We prove that for both of these cost functions, the ratio of uncorrelated cost to correlated cost at equilibrium is $O(\min(m_c(G),n))$, where $m_c(G)$ is the mincut size of $G$. This bound is much smaller than the most general case, where a tight, exponential bound of $\Theta((m_c(G))^{n-1})$ on the ratio is known. We also introduce a set of simple agent strategies which are approximately optimal agent strategies. We then establish conditions for when these strategies are optimal agent strategies for each cost function, showing an inherent difference between the two cost functions we study.</description>

      <title>Towards More Realistic Models for Refugee Integration: Anonymous Refugee Housing with Upper-Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: [Knop and Schierreich; AAMAS~'23] recently introduced a novel model for refugee housing, where we are given a city's topology represented as a graph, a set of inhabitants who occupy some vertices of the topology, and a set of refugees that we need to house in unoccupied vertices. Moreover, each inhabitant approves specific numbers of refugees in his neighbourhood, and our goal is to find housing such that every inhabitant approves the number of refugees housed in his neighbourhood. However, such a model suffers from several problems: (i) it is computationally hard to find desirable housing, and (ii) the inhabitants' preferences are not necessarily continuous, which hardly occurs in practice. To avoid these objections, we introduce a restricted variant of the problem that is more closely aligned with practical scenarios of refugee housing and study its complexity.</description>

      <title>Randomness Requirements and Asymmetries in Nash Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general, Nash equilibria in normal-form games may require players to play (probabilistically) mixed strategies. We define a measure of the complexity of finite probability distributions and study the complexity required to play Nash equilibria in finite two player $n\times n$ games with rational payoffs. Our central results show that there exist games in which there is an exponential vs. linear gap in the complexity of the mixed distributions that the two players play in the (unique) Nash equilibrium of these games. This gap induces asymmetries in the amounts of space required by the players to represent and sample from the corresponding distributions using known state-of-the-art sampling algorithms. We also establish exponential upper and lower bounds on the complexity of Nash equilibria in normal-form games. These results highlight (i) the nontriviality of the assumption that players can play any mixed strategy and (ii) the disparity in resources that players may require to play Nash equilibria in normal-form games.</description>
