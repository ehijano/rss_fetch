      <title>Variational Bayesian Methods for a Tree-Structured Stick-Breaking Process Mixture of Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bayes coding algorithm for context tree source is a successful example of Bayesian tree estimation in text compression in information theory. This algorithm provides an efficient parametric representation of the posterior tree distribution and exact updating of its parameters. We apply this algorithm to a clustering task in machine learning. More specifically, we apply it to Bayesian estimation of the tree-structured stick-breaking process (TS-SBP) mixture models. For TS-SBP mixture models, only Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have been proposed so far, but any variational Bayesian methods have not been proposed yet. In this paper, we propose a variational Bayesian method that has a subroutine similar to the Bayes coding algorithm for context tree sources. We confirm its behavior by a numerical experiment on a toy example.</description>

      <title>Geometric Insights into Focal Loss: Reducing Curvature for Enhanced Model Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key factor in implementing machine learning algorithms in decision-making situations is not only the accuracy of the model but also its confidence level. The confidence level of a model in a classification problem is often given by the output vector of a softmax function for convenience. However, these values are known to deviate significantly from the actual expected model confidence. This problem is called model calibration and has been studied extensively. One of the simplest techniques to tackle this task is focal loss, a generalization of cross-entropy by introducing one positive parameter. Although many related studies exist because of the simplicity of the idea and its formalization, the theoretical analysis of its behavior is still insufficient. In this study, our objective is to understand the behavior of focal loss by reinterpreting this function geometrically. Our analysis suggests that focal loss reduces the curvature of the loss surface in training the model. This indicates that curvature may be one of the essential factors in achieving model calibration. We design numerical experiments to support this conjecture to reveal the behavior of focal loss and the relationship between calibration performance and curvature.</description>

      <title>Scaling and renormalization in high-dimensional regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a succinct derivation of the training and generalization performance of a variety of high-dimensional ridge regression models using the basic tools of random matrix theory and free probability. We provide an introduction and review of recent results on these topics, aimed at readers with backgrounds in physics and deep learning. Analytic formulas for the training and generalization errors are obtained in a few lines of algebra directly from the properties of the $S$-transform of free probability. This allows for a straightforward identification of the sources of power-law scaling in model performance. We compute the generalization error of a broad class of random feature models. We find that in all models, the $S$-transform corresponds to the train-test generalization gap, and yields an analogue of the generalized-cross-validation estimator. Using these techniques, we derive fine-grained bias-variance decompositions for a very general class of random feature models with structured covariates. These novel results allow us to discover a scaling regime for random feature models where the variance due to the features limits performance in the overparameterized setting. We also demonstrate how anisotropic weight structure in random feature models can limit performance and lead to nontrivial exponents for finite-width corrections in the overparameterized setting. Our results extend and provide a unifying perspective on earlier models of neural scaling laws.</description>

      <title>From Empirical Observations to Universality: Dynamics of Deep Learning with Inputs Built on Gaussian mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study broadens the scope of theoretical frameworks in deep learning by delving into the dynamics of neural networks with inputs that demonstrate the structural characteristics to Gaussian Mixture (GM). We analyzed how the dynamics of neural networks under GM-structured inputs diverge from the predictions of conventional theories based on simple Gaussian structures. A revelation of our work is the observed convergence of neural network dynamics towards conventional theory even with standardized GM inputs, highlighting an unexpected universality. We found that standardization, especially in conjunction with certain nonlinear functions, plays a critical role in this phenomena. Consequently, despite the complex and varied nature of GM distributions, we demonstrate that neural networks exhibit asymptotic behaviors in line with predictions under simple Gaussian frameworks.</description>

      <title>Queuing dynamics of asynchronous Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study asynchronous federated learning mechanisms with nodes having potentially different computational speeds. In such an environment, each node is allowed to work on models with potential delays and contribute to updates to the central server at its own pace. Existing analyses of such algorithms typically depend on intractable quantities such as the maximum node delay and do not consider the underlying queuing dynamics of the system. In this paper, we propose a non-uniform sampling scheme for the central server that allows for lower delays with better complexity, taking into account the closed Jackson network structure of the associated computational graph. Our experiments clearly show a significant improvement of our method over current state-of-the-art asynchronous algorithms on an image classification problem.</description>

      <title>From Linear to Linearizable Optimization: A Novel Framework with Applications to Stationary and Non-stationary DR-submodular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of upper linearizable/quadratizable functions, a class that extends concavity and DR-submodularity in various settings, including monotone and non-monotone cases over different convex sets. A general meta-algorithm is devised to convert algorithms for linear/quadratic maximization into ones that optimize upper quadratizable functions, offering a unified approach to tackling concave and DR-submodular optimization problems. The paper extends these results to multiple feedback settings, facilitating conversions between semi-bandit/first-order feedback and bandit/zeroth-order feedback, as well as between first/zeroth-order feedback and semi-bandit/bandit feedback. Leveraging this framework, new projection-free algorithms are derived using Follow The Perturbed Leader (FTPL) and other algorithms as base algorithms for linear/convex optimization, improving upon state-of-the-art results in various cases. Dynamic and adaptive regret guarantees are obtained for DR-submodular maximization, marking the first algorithms to achieve such guarantees in these settings. Notably, the paper achieves these advancements with fewer assumptions compared to existing state-of-the-art results, underscoring its broad applicability and theoretical contributions to non-convex optimization.</description>

      <title>Imprecise Markov Semigroups and their Ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of imprecise Markov semigroup. It allows us to see Markov chains and processes with imprecise transition probabilities as (a collection of diffusion) operators, and thus to unlock techniques from geometry, functional analysis, and (high dimensional) probability to study their ergodic behavior. We show that, if the initial distribution of an imprecise Markov semigroup is known and invariant, under some conditions that also involve the geometry of the state space, eventually the ambiguity around the transition probability fades. We call this property ergodicity of the imprecise Markov semigroup, and we relate it to the classical (Birkhoff's) notion of ergodicity. We prove ergodicity both when the state space is Euclidean or a Riemannian manifold, and when it is an arbitrary measurable space. The importance of our findings for the fields of machine learning and computer vision is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Complex contagions can outperform simple contagions for network reconstruction with dense networks or saturated dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network scientists often use complex dynamic processes to describe network contagions, but tools for fitting contagion models typically assume simple dynamics. Here, we address this gap by developing a nonparametric method to reconstruct a network and dynamics from a series of node states, using a model that breaks the dichotomy between simple pairwise and complex neighborhood-based contagions. We then show that a network is more easily reconstructed when observed through the lens of complex contagions if it is dense or the dynamic saturates, and that simple contagions are better otherwise.</description>

      <title>BayesBlend: Easy Model Blending using Pseudo-Bayesian Model Averaging, Stacking and Hierarchical Stacking in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Averaging predictions from multiple competing inferential models frequently outperforms predictions from any single model, providing that models are optimally weighted to maximize predictive performance. This is particularly the case in so-called $\mathcal{M}$-open settings where the true model is not in the set of candidate models, and may be neither mathematically reifiable nor known precisely. This practice of model averaging has a rich history in statistics and machine learning, and there are currently a number of methods to estimate the weights for constructing model-averaged predictive distributions. Nonetheless, there are few existing software packages that can estimate model weights from the full variety of methods available, and none that blend model predictions into a coherent predictive distribution according to the estimated weights. In this paper, we introduce the BayesBlend Python package, which provides a user-friendly programming interface to estimate weights and blend multiple (Bayesian) models' predictive distributions. BayesBlend implements pseudo-Bayesian model averaging, stacking and, uniquely, hierarchical Bayesian stacking to estimate model weights. We demonstrate the usage of BayesBlend with examples of insurance loss modeling.</description>

      <title>Re-visiting Skip-Gram Negative Sampling: Dimension Regularization for More Efficient Dissimilarity Preservation in Graph Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide range of graph embedding objectives decompose into two components: one that attracts the embeddings of nodes that are perceived as similar, and another that repels embeddings of nodes that are perceived as dissimilar. Because real-world graphs are sparse and the number of dissimilar pairs grows quadratically with the number of nodes, Skip-Gram Negative Sampling (SGNS) has emerged as a popular and efficient repulsion approach. SGNS repels each node from a sample of dissimilar nodes, as opposed to all dissimilar nodes. In this work, we show that node-wise repulsion is, in aggregate, an approximate re-centering of the node embedding dimensions. Such dimension operations are much more scalable than node operations. The dimension approach, in addition to being more efficient, yields a simpler geometric interpretation of the repulsion. Our result extends findings from the self-supervised learning literature to the skip-gram model, establishing a connection between skip-gram node contrast and dimension regularization. We show that in the limit of large graphs, under mild regularity conditions, the original node repulsion objective converges to optimization with dimension regularization. We use this observation to propose an algorithm augmentation framework that speeds up any existing algorithm, supervised or unsupervised, using SGNS. The framework prioritizes node attraction and replaces SGNS with dimension regularization. We instantiate this generic framework for LINE and node2vec and show that the augmented algorithms preserve downstream performance while dramatically increasing efficiency.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Active Subspaces to Capture Epistemic Model Uncertainty in Deep Generative Models for Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have been accelerating the inverse design process in material and drug design. Unlike their counterpart property predictors in typical molecular design frameworks, generative molecular design models have seen fewer efforts on uncertainty quantification (UQ) due to computational challenges in Bayesian inference posed by their large number of parameters. In this work, we focus on the junction-tree variational autoencoder (JT-VAE), a popular model for generative molecular design, and address this issue by leveraging the low dimensional active subspace to capture the uncertainty in the model parameters. Specifically, we approximate the posterior distribution over the active subspace parameters to estimate the epistemic model uncertainty in an extremely high dimensional parameter space. The proposed UQ scheme does not require alteration of the model architecture, making it readily applicable to any pre-trained model. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the AS-based UQ and its potential impact on molecular optimization by exploring the model diversity under epistemic uncertainty.</description>

Abstract: As a natural extension to the standard conformal prediction method, several conformal risk control methods have been recently developed and applied to various learning problems. In this work, we seek to control the conformal risk in expectation for ordinal classification tasks, which have broad applications to many real problems. For this purpose, we firstly formulated the ordinal classification task in the conformal risk control framework, and provided theoretic risk bounds of the risk control method. Then we proposed two types of loss functions specially designed for ordinal classification tasks, and developed corresponding algorithms to determine the prediction set for each case to control their risks at a desired level. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methods, and analyzed the difference between the two types of risks on three different datasets, including a simulated dataset, the UTKFace dataset and the diabetic retinopathy detection dataset.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bias-Correction and Valid Inference in High-Dimensional Ridge Regression: A Closed-Form Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ridge regression is an indispensable tool in big data econometrics but suffers from bias issues affecting both statistical efficiency and scalability. We introduce an iterative strategy to correct the bias effectively when the dimension $p$ is less than the sample size $n$. For $p&gt;n$, our method optimally reduces the bias to a level unachievable through linear transformations of the response. We employ a Ridge-Screening (RS) method to handle the remaining bias when $p&gt;n$, creating a reduced model suitable for bias-correction. Under certain conditions, the selected model nests the true one, making RS a novel variable selection approach. We establish the asymptotic properties and valid inferences of our de-biased ridge estimators for both $p&lt; n$ and $p&gt;n$, where $p$ and $n$ may grow towards infinity, along with the number of iterations. Our method is validated using simulated and real-world data examples, providing a closed-form solution to bias challenges in ridge regression inferences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a range of empirical risk functions and regularization methods suitable for self-training methods in semi-supervised learning. These approaches draw inspiration from various divergence measures, such as $f$-divergences and $\alpha$-R\'enyi divergences. Inspired by the theoretical foundations rooted in divergences, i.e., $f$-divergences and $\alpha$-R\'enyi divergence, we also provide valuable insights to enhance the understanding of our empirical risk functions and regularization techniques. In the pseudo-labeling and entropy minimization techniques as self-training methods for effective semi-supervised learning, the self-training process has some inherent mismatch between the true label and pseudo-label (noisy pseudo-labels) and some of our empirical risk functions are robust, concerning noisy pseudo-labels. Under some conditions, our empirical risk functions demonstrate better performance when compared to traditional self-training methods.</description>

      <title>Self-Play Preference Optimization for Language Model Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches relying on parametric models like the Bradley-Terry model fall short in capturing the intransitivity and irrationality in human preferences. Recent advancements suggest that directly working with preference probabilities can yield a more accurate reflection of human preferences, enabling more flexible and accurate language model alignment. In this paper, we propose a self-play-based method for language model alignment, which treats the problem as a constant-sum two-player game aimed at identifying the Nash equilibrium policy. Our approach, dubbed \textit{Self-Play Preference Optimization} (SPPO), approximates the Nash equilibrium through iterative policy updates and enjoys theoretical convergence guarantee. Our method can effectively increase the log-likelihood of the chosen response and decrease that of the rejected response, which cannot be trivially achieved by symmetric pairwise loss such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Identity Preference Optimization (IPO). In our experiments, using only 60k prompts (without responses) from the UltraFeedback dataset and without any prompt augmentation, by leveraging a pre-trained preference model PairRM with only 0.4B parameters, SPPO can obtain a model from fine-tuning Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 that achieves the state-of-the-art length-controlled win-rate of 28.53% against GPT-4-Turbo on AlpacaEval 2.0. It also outperforms the (iterative) DPO and IPO on MT-Bench and the Open LLM Leaderboard. Notably, the strong performance of SPPO is achieved without additional external supervision (e.g., responses, preferences, etc.) from GPT-4 or other stronger language models.</description>

      <title>Hidden yet quantifiable: A lower bound for confounding strength using randomized trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of fast-paced precision medicine, observational studies play a major role in properly evaluating new treatments in clinical practice. Yet, unobserved confounding can significantly compromise causal conclusions drawn from non-randomized data. We propose a novel strategy that leverages randomized trials to quantify unobserved confounding. First, we design a statistical test to detect unobserved confounding with strength above a given threshold. Then, we use the test to estimate an asymptotically valid lower bound on the unobserved confounding strength. We evaluate the power and validity of our statistical test on several synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets. Further, we show how our lower bound can correctly identify the absence and presence of unobserved confounding in a real-world setting.</description>

      <title>Separation capacity of linear reservoirs with random connectivity matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the success of reservoir computing lies within the separation capacity of the reservoirs and show that the expected separation capacity of random linear reservoirs is fully characterised by the spectral decomposition of an associated generalised matrix of moments. Of particular interest are reservoirs with Gaussian matrices that are either symmetric or whose entries are all independent. In the symmetric case, we prove that the separation capacity always deteriorates with time; while for short inputs, separation with large reservoirs is best achieved when the entries of the matrix are scaled with a factor $\rho_T/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the dimension of the reservoir and $\rho_T$ depends on the maximum length of the input time series. In the i.i.d. case, we establish that optimal separation with large reservoirs is consistently achieved when the entries of the reservoir matrix are scaled with the exact factor $1/\sqrt{N}$. We further give upper bounds on the quality of separation in function of the length of the time series. We complement this analysis with an investigation of the likelihood of this separation and the impact of the chosen architecture on separation consistency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1902.09608v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binscatter is a popular method for visualizing bivariate relationships and conducting informal specification testing. We study the properties of this method formally and develop enhanced visualization and econometric binscatter tools. These include estimating conditional means with optimal binning and quantifying uncertainty. We also highlight a methodological problem related to covariate adjustment that can yield incorrect conclusions. We revisit two applications using our methodology and find substantially different results relative to those obtained using prior informal binscatter methods. General purpose software in Python, R, and Stata is provided. Our technical work is of independent interest for the nonparametric partition-based estimation literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Rissanen et al., (2022) have presented a new type of diffusion process for generative modeling based on heat dissipation, or blurring, as an alternative to isotropic Gaussian diffusion. Here, we show that blurring can equivalently be defined through a Gaussian diffusion process with non-isotropic noise. In making this connection, we bridge the gap between inverse heat dissipation and denoising diffusion, and we shed light on the inductive bias that results from this modeling choice. Finally, we propose a generalized class of diffusion models that offers the best of both standard Gaussian denoising diffusion and inverse heat dissipation, which we call Blurring Diffusion Models.</description>

      <title>Inverse Unscented Kalman Filter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid advances in designing cognitive and counter-adversarial systems have motivated the development of inverse Bayesian filters. In this setting, a cognitive 'adversary' tracks its target of interest via a stochastic framework such as a Kalman filter (KF). The target or 'defender' then employs another inverse stochastic filter to infer the forward filter estimates of the defender computed by the adversary. For linear systems, the inverse Kalman filter (I-KF) has been recently shown to be effective in these counter-adversarial applications. In the paper, contrary to prior works, we focus on non-linear system dynamics and formulate the inverse unscented KF (I-UKF) to estimate the defender's state based on the unscented transform, or equivalently, statistical linearization technique. We then generalize this framework to unknown systems by proposing reproducing kernel Hilbert space-based UKF (RKHS-UKF) to learn the system dynamics and estimate the state based on its observations. Our theoretical analyses to guarantee the stochastic stability of I-UKF and RKHS-UKF in the mean-squared sense show that, provided the forward filters are stable, the inverse filters are also stable under mild system-level conditions. We show that, despite being a suboptimal filter, our proposed I-UKF is a conservative estimator, i.e., I-UKF's estimated error covariance upper-bounds its true value. Our numerical experiments for several different applications demonstrate the estimation performance of the proposed filters using recursive Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound and non-credibility index (NCI).</description>

      <title>Multi-objective optimisation via the R2 utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of multi-objective optimisation is to identify a collection of points which describe the best possible trade-offs between the multiple objectives. In order to solve this vector-valued optimisation problem, practitioners often appeal to the use of scalarisation functions in order to transform the multi-objective problem into a collection of single-objective problems. This set of scalarised problems can then be solved using traditional single-objective optimisation techniques. In this work, we formalise this convention into a general mathematical framework. We show how this strategy effectively recasts the original multi-objective optimisation problem into a single-objective optimisation problem defined over sets. An appropriate class of objective functions for this new problem are the R2 utilities, which are utility functions that are defined as a weighted integral over the scalarised optimisation problems. As part of our work, we show that these utilities are monotone and submodular set functions which can be optimised effectively using greedy optimisation algorithms. We then analyse the performance of these greedy algorithms both theoretically and empirically. Our analysis largely focusses on Bayesian optimisation, which is a popular probabilistic framework for black-box optimisation.</description>

      <title>Gaussian random field approximation via Stein's method with applications to wide random neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive upper bounds on the Wasserstein distance ($W_1$), with respect to $\sup$-norm, between any continuous $\mathbb{R}^d$ valued random field indexed by the $n$-sphere and the Gaussian, based on Stein's method. We develop a novel Gaussian smoothing technique that allows us to transfer a bound in a smoother metric to the $W_1$ distance. The smoothing is based on covariance functions constructed using powers of Laplacian operators, designed so that the associated Gaussian process has a tractable Cameron-Martin or Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. This feature enables us to move beyond one dimensional interval-based index sets that were previously considered in the literature. Specializing our general result, we obtain the first bounds on the Gaussian random field approximation of wide random neural networks of any depth and Lipschitz activation functions at the random field level. Our bounds are explicitly expressed in terms of the widths of the network and moments of the random weights. We also obtain tighter bounds when the activation function has three bounded derivatives.</description>

      <title>Prediction without Preclusion: Recourse Verification with Reachable Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are often used to decide who receives a loan, a job interview, or a public benefit. Models in such settings use features without considering their actionability. As a result, they can assign predictions that are fixed $-$ meaning that individuals who are denied loans and interviews are, in fact, precluded from access to credit and employment. In this work, we introduce a procedure called recourse verification to test if a model assigns fixed predictions to its decision subjects. We propose a model-agnostic approach for recourse verification with reachable sets $-$ i.e., the set of all points that a person can reach through their actions in feature space. We develop methods to construct reachable sets for discrete feature spaces, which can certify the responsiveness of any model by simply querying its predictions. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the infeasibility of recourse on datasets from consumer finance. Our results highlight how models can inadvertently preclude access by assigning fixed predictions and underscore the need to account for actionability in model development.</description>

      <title>Unconstrained Stochastic CCA: Unifying Multiview and Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01012v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) family of methods is foundational in multiview learning. Regularised linear CCA methods can be seen to generalise Partial Least Squares (PLS) and be unified with a Generalized Eigenvalue Problem (GEP) framework. However, classical algorithms for these linear methods are computationally infeasible for large-scale data. Extensions to Deep CCA show great promise, but current training procedures are slow and complicated. First we propose a novel unconstrained objective that characterizes the top subspace of GEPs. Our core contribution is a family of fast algorithms for stochastic PLS, stochastic CCA, and Deep CCA, simply obtained by applying stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to the corresponding CCA objectives. Our algorithms show far faster convergence and recover higher correlations than the previous state-of-the-art on all standard CCA and Deep CCA benchmarks. These improvements allow us to perform a first-of-its-kind PLS analysis of an extremely large biomedical dataset from the UK Biobank, with over 33,000 individuals and 500,000 features. Finally, we apply our algorithms to match the performance of `CCA-family' Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with minimal hyper-parameter tuning, and also present theory to clarify the links between these methods and classical CCA, laying the groundwork for future insights.</description>

      <title>Tractable MCMC for Private Learning with Pure and Gaussian Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Posterior sampling, i.e., exponential mechanism to sample from the posterior distribution, provides $\varepsilon$-pure differential privacy (DP) guarantees and does not suffer from potentially unbounded privacy breach introduced by $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-approximate DP. In practice, however, one needs to apply approximate sampling methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), thus re-introducing the unappealing $\delta$-approximation error into the privacy guarantees. To bridge this gap, we propose the Approximate SAample Perturbation (abbr. ASAP) algorithm which perturbs an MCMC sample with noise proportional to its Wasserstein-infinity ($W_\infty$) distance from a reference distribution that satisfies pure DP or pure Gaussian DP (i.e., $\delta=0$). We then leverage a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to generate the sample and prove that the algorithm converges in $W_\infty$ distance. We show that by combining our new techniques with a localization step, we obtain the first nearly linear-time algorithm that achieves the optimal rates in the DP-ERM problem with strongly convex and smooth losses.</description>

      <title>Iterative Preference Learning from Human Feedback: Bridging Theory and Practice for RLHF under KL-Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11456v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the alignment process of generative models with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We first identify the primary challenges of existing popular methods like offline PPO and offline DPO as lacking in strategical exploration of the environment. Then, to understand the mathematical principle of RLHF, we consider a standard mathematical formulation, the reverse-KL regularized contextual bandit for RLHF. Despite its widespread practical application, a rigorous theoretical analysis of this formulation remains open. We investigate its behavior in three distinct settings -- offline, online, and hybrid -- and propose efficient algorithms with finite-sample theoretical guarantees.
  Moving towards practical applications, our framework, with a robust approximation of the information-theoretical policy improvement oracle, naturally gives rise to several novel RLHF algorithms. This includes an iterative version of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm for online settings, and a multi-step rejection sampling strategy for offline scenarios. Our empirical evaluations on real-world alignment experiment of large language model demonstrate that these proposed methods significantly surpass existing strong baselines, such as DPO and Rejection Sampling Optimization (RSO), showcasing the connections between solid theoretical foundations and their potent practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Cross-Validation Conformal Risk Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal risk control (CRC) is a recently proposed technique that applies post-hoc to a conventional point predictor to provide calibration guarantees. Generalizing conformal prediction (CP), with CRC, calibration is ensured for a set predictor that is extracted from the point predictor to control a risk function such as the probability of miscoverage or the false negative rate. The original CRC requires the available data set to be split between training and validation data sets. This can be problematic when data availability is limited, resulting in inefficient set predictors. In this paper, a novel CRC method is introduced that is based on cross-validation, rather than on validation as the original CRC. The proposed cross-validation CRC (CV-CRC) extends a version of the jackknife-minmax from CP to CRC, allowing for the control of a broader range of risk functions. CV-CRC is proved to offer theoretical guarantees on the average risk of the set predictor. Furthermore, numerical experiments show that CV-CRC can reduce the average set size with respect to CRC when the available data are limited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of proliferation of large language and image generation models, the phenomenon of "model collapse" refers to the situation whereby as a model is trained recursively on data generated from previous generations of itself over time, its performance degrades until the model eventually becomes completely useless, i.e the model collapses. In this work, we study this phenomenon in the setting of high-dimensional regression and obtain analytic formulae which quantitatively outline this phenomenon in a broad range of regimes. In the special case of polynomial decaying spectral and source conditions, we obtain modified scaling laws which exhibit new crossover phenomena from fast to slow rates. We also propose a simple strategy based on adaptive regularization to mitigate model collapse. Our theoretical results are validated with experiments.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein: A Scalable Metric for Heterogeneous Joint Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) and Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) have been widely used in applications due to their computational and statistical scalability. However, the SW and the GSW are only defined between distributions supported on a homogeneous domain. This limitation prevents their usage in applications with heterogeneous joint distributions with marginal distributions supported on multiple different domains. Using SW and GSW directly on the joint domains cannot make a meaningful comparison since their homogeneous slicing operator i.e., Radon Transform (RT) and Generalized Radon Transform (GRT) are not expressive enough to capture the structure of the joint supports set. To address the issue, we propose two new slicing operators i.e., Partial Generalized Radon Transform (PGRT) and Hierarchical Hybrid Radon Transform (HHRT). In greater detail, PGRT is the generalization of Partial Radon Transform (PRT), which transforms a subset of function arguments non-linearly while HHRT is the composition of PRT and multiple domain-specific PGRT on marginal domain arguments. By using HHRT, we extend the SW into Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW) distance which is designed specifically for comparing heterogeneous joint distributions. We then discuss the topological, statistical, and computational properties of H2SW. Finally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of H2SW in 3D mesh deformation, deep 3D mesh autoencoders, and datasets comparison.</description>

      <title>U-Nets as Belief Propagation: Efficient Classification, Denoising, and Diffusion in Generative Hierarchical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: U-Nets are among the most widely used architectures in computer vision, renowned for their exceptional performance in applications such as image segmentation, denoising, and diffusion modeling. However, a theoretical explanation of the U-Net architecture design has not yet been fully established.
  This paper introduces a novel interpretation of the U-Net architecture by studying certain generative hierarchical models, which are tree-structured graphical models extensively utilized in both language and image domains. With their encoder-decoder structure, long skip connections, and pooling and up-sampling layers, we demonstrate how U-Nets can naturally implement the belief propagation denoising algorithm in such generative hierarchical models, thereby efficiently approximating the denoising functions. This leads to an efficient sample complexity bound for learning the denoising function using U-Nets within these models. Additionally, we discuss the broader implications of these findings for diffusion models in generative hierarchical models. We also demonstrate that the conventional architecture of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) is ideally suited for classification tasks within these models. This offers a unified view of the roles of ConvNets and U-Nets, highlighting the versatility of generative hierarchical models in modeling complex data distributions across language and image domains.</description>

      <title>Why You Should Not Trust Interpretations in Machine Learning: Adversarial Attacks on Partial Dependence Plots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) across industries has led to the widespread use of complex black-box models and interpretation tools for decision making. This paper proposes an adversarial framework to uncover the vulnerability of permutation-based interpretation methods for machine learning tasks, with a particular focus on partial dependence (PD) plots. This adversarial framework modifies the original black box model to manipulate its predictions for instances in the extrapolation domain. As a result, it produces deceptive PD plots that can conceal discriminatory behaviors while preserving most of the original model's predictions. This framework can produce multiple fooled PD plots via a single model. By using real-world datasets including an auto insurance claims dataset and COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) dataset, our results show that it is possible to intentionally hide the discriminatory behavior of a predictor and make the black-box model appear neutral through interpretation tools like PD plots while retaining almost all the predictions of the original black-box model. Managerial insights for regulators and practitioners are provided based on the findings.</description>

Abstract: Bootstrap is a popular methodology for simulating input uncertainty. However, it can be computationally expensive when the number of samples is large. We propose a new approach called \textbf{Orthogonal Bootstrap} that reduces the number of required Monte Carlo replications. We decomposes the target being simulated into two parts: the \textit{non-orthogonal part} which has a closed-form result known as Infinitesimal Jackknife and the \textit{orthogonal part} which is easier to be simulated. We theoretically and numerically show that Orthogonal Bootstrap significantly reduces the computational cost of Bootstrap while improving empirical accuracy and maintaining the same width of the constructed interval.</description>
