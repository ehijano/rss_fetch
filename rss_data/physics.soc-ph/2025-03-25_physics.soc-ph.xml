      <title>Forward propagation of a push through a row of people</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security plays a crucial role when it comes to planning large events such as concerts, sporting tournaments, pilgrims, or demonstrations. Monitoring and controlling pedestrian dynamics can prevent dangerous situations from occurring. However, little is known about the specific factors that contribute to harmful situations. For example, the individual response of a person to external forces in dense crowds is not well studied. In order to address this gap in knowledge, we conducted a series of experiments to examine how a push propagates through a row of people and how it affects the participants. We recorded 2D head trajectories and 3D motion capturing data. To ensure that different trials can be compared to one another, we measured the force at the impact. We find that that the propagation distance as well as the propagation speed of the push are mainly functions of the strength of the push and in particular the latter depends on the initial arm posture of the pushed participants. Our results can contribute to a deeper understanding of the microscopic causes of macroscopic phenomena in large groups, and can be applied to inform models of pedestrian dynamics or validate them, ultimately improving crowd safety.</description>

      <title>Propagation of controlled frontward impulses through standing crowds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impulse propagation in crowds is a phenomenon that is crucial for understanding collective dynamics, but has been scarcely addressed so far. Therefore, we have carried out experiments in which persons standing in a crowd are pushed forward in a controlled manner. Variations of experimental parameters include (i) the intensity of the push, (ii) the initial inter-person distance, (iii) the preparedness of participants and (iv) the crowd formation. Our analysis links the intensity of an impulse recorded by a pressure sensor with individual movements of participants based on head trajectories recorded by overhead cameras and 3D motion capturing data.
  The propagation distance as well as the propagation speed of the external impact depends mainly on the intensity of the impulse, whereas no significant effect regarding the preparedness of participants could be found. Especially the propagation speed is influenced by the initial inter-person distance. From the comparison between two methods that detect the time of motion due to the impulse, a more sensitive result is obtained when the velocity of three landmarks of the human body is taken into account and not only the forward displacement of the center of mass. Furthermore, the more intertwined participants are in relation to each other, the more the impulse is distributed to the sides. As a result, more people are affected, however with smaller individual displacements.</description>

      <title>Role of spatial embedding and planarity in shaping the topology of the Street Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topology of city street networks (SNs) is constrained by spatial embedding, requiring non-crossing links and preventing random node placement or overlap. Here, we analyzed SNs of $33$ Indian cities to explore how the spatial embedding and the planarity jointly shape their topology. Overall, we found that all the studied SNs have small-world properties with higher clustering and efficiency. The efficiency of the empirical networks is even higher than that of the corresponding degree of preserved random networks. This increased efficiency can be explained by Dijkstra's path-length distribution, which closely fits a right-skewed normal or log-normal distribution. Moreover, we observed that the connectivity of the streets is length-dependent: the smaller streets connect preferably to the smaller streets, while longer streets tend to connect with the longer counterparts. This length-dependent connectivity is more profound in the empirical SNs than in the corresponding degree preserved random and random planar networks. However, planar networks maintaining the empirical spatial coordinates replicate the connectivity behavior of empirical SNs, highlighting the influence of spatial embedding. Moreover, the robustness of the cities in terms of resilience to random errors and targeted attacks is independent of the SN's size, indicating other factors, such as geographical constraints, substantially influence network stability.</description>

      <title>The impact of digital media-driven affective polarisation on epidemic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While prior studies have examined the influence of information diffusion on epidemic dynamics, the role of affective polarisation--driven by digital media usage--remains less understood. This study introduces a mathematical framework to quantify the interplay between affective polarisation and epidemic spread, revealing contrasting effects depending on transmission rates. The model demonstrates that greater digital media influence leads to increased polarisation. Notably, the results reveal opposing trends: a negative correlation between polarisation and the infected population is observed when transmission rates are low, whereas a positive correlation emerges in high-transmission scenarios. These findings provide a quantitative foundation for assessing how digital media-driven polarisation may exacerbate health crises, informing future public health strategies.</description>

      <title>Links between Entropy, Complexity, and the Technological Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropy always increases monotonically in a closed system but complexity increases at first and then decreases as equilibrium is approached. Commonsense information-related definitions for entropy and complexity demonstrate that complexity behaves like the time derivative of entropy, which is proposed here as a new definition for complexity. A 20-year-old study had attempted to quantify complexity (in arbitrary units) for the entire Universe in terms of 28 milestones, breaks in historical perspective, and had concluded that complexity will soon begin decreasing. That conclusion is now corroborated by other researchers. In addition, the exponential runaway technology trend advocated by supporters of the singularity hypothesis, which was in part based on the trend of the very 28 milestones mentioned above, would have anticipated five new such milestones by now, but none have been observed. The conclusions of the 20-year-old study remain valid: we are at the maximum of complexity and we should expect the next two milestones at around 2033 and 2078.</description>

      <title>Opinion dynamics model of collaborative learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a simple model to explore an educational phenomenon where the correct answer emerges from group discussion. We construct our model based on several plausible assumptions: (i) We tend to follow peers' opinions. However, if a peer's opinion is too different from yours, you are not much influenced. In other words, your opinion tends to align with peers' opinions, weighted by the similarity to yours. (ii) Discussion among group members helps the opinion to shift toward the correct answer even when the group members do not know it clearly. However, if everyone tells exactly the same, you often get lost and it becomes more difficult to find the correct answer. In other words, you can find the correct answer when everyone has largely different voices. (iii) We are sometimes stuck to our past. If you keep one opinion for a long time, such a memory works like an inertia in classical mechanics. We use our model to perform numerical investigations and find that the performance of a group is enhanced when initial opinions are diverse, that a lower memory capacity makes consensus occur faster, and that a small group size, typically three or four, is beneficial for better group performance.</description>
