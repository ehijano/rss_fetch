      <title>Incomplete Information and Matching of Likes: A Mechanism Design Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the implementability of stable matchings in a two-sided market model with one-sided incomplete information. Firms' types are publicly known, whereas workers' types are private information. A mechanism generates a matching and additional announcements to the firms at each report profile of workers' types. When agents' preferences are increasing in the types of their matched partner, we show that the assortative matching mechanism which publicly announces the entire set of reported types is incentive compatible. Furthermore, any mechanism that limits information disclosure to firms' lower contour sets of reported types remains incentive compatible. However, when information is incomplete on both sides of the market, assortative matching is no longer implementable.</description>

      <title>Structural Reinforcement Learning for Heterogeneous Agent Macroeconomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach to formulating and solving heterogeneous agent models with aggregate risk. We replace the cross-sectional distribution with low-dimensional prices as state variables and let agents learn equilibrium price dynamics directly from simulated paths. To do so, we introduce a structural reinforcement learning (SRL) method which treats prices via simulation while exploiting agents' structural knowledge of their own individual dynamics. Our SRL method yields a general and highly efficient global solution method for heterogeneous agent models that sidesteps the Master equation and handles problems traditional methods struggle with, in particular nontrivial market-clearing conditions. We illustrate the approach in the Krusell-Smith model, the Huggett model with aggregate shocks, and a HANK model with a forward-looking Phillips curve, all of which we solve globally within minutes.</description>

      <title>Will AI Trade? A Computational Inversion of the No-Trade Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classic no-trade theorems attribute trade to heterogeneous beliefs. We re-examine this conclusion for AI agents, asking if trade can arise from computational limitations, under common beliefs. We model agents' bounded computational rationality within an unfolding game framework, where computational power determines the complexity of its strategy. Our central finding inverts the classic paradigm: a stable no-trade outcome (Nash equilibrium) is reached only when "almost rational" agents have slightly different computational power. Paradoxically, when agents possess identical power, they may fail to converge to equilibrium, resulting in persistent strategic adjustments that constitute a form of trade. This instability is exacerbated if agents can strategically under-utilize their computational resources, which eliminates any chance of equilibrium in Matching Pennies scenarios. Our results suggest that the inherent computational limitations of AI agents can lead to situations where equilibrium is not reached, creating a more lively and unpredictable trade environment than traditional models would predict.</description>

      <title>Three Tiers and Thresholds: Incentives in Private Market Investing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies optimal contract design in private market investing, focusing on internal decision making in venture capital and private equity firms. A principal relies on an agent who privately exerts costly due diligence effort and then recommends whether to invest. Outcomes are observable ex post even when an opportunity is declined, allowing compensation to reward both successful investments and prudent decisions to pass. We characterize profit maximizing contracts that induce information acquisition and truthful reporting. We show that three tier contracts are sufficient, with payments contingent on the agent's recommendation and the realized return. In symmetric environments satisfying the monotone likelihood ratio property, the optimal contract further simplifies to a threshold contract that pays only when the recommendation is aligned with an extreme realized return. These results provide guidance for performance based compensation that promotes diligent screening while limiting excessive risk taking.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Forecasters to Learn: Summarized vs. Unrestricted Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19147v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How should forecasters be incentivized to acquire the most information when learning takes place over time? We address this question in the context of a novel dynamic mechanism design problem in which a designer incentivizes an expert to learn by conditioning rewards on an event's outcome and the expert's reports. Eliciting summarized advice at a terminal date maximizes information acquisition if an informative signal either fully reveals the outcome or has predictable content. Otherwise, richer reporting capabilities may be required. Our findings shed light on incentive design for consultation and forecasting by illustrating how learning dynamics shape the qualitative properties of effort-maximizing contracts.</description>

      <title>Random Attention and Unobserved Reference Alternatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01528v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, I develop and characterize two models of random attention that differ from each other with respect to the menu-dependence of the unobserved reference alternatives. In both models, the decision-maker pays attention to subsets of the available set of alternatives randomly with the reference alternatives being always paid attention to. Under menu-dependence, partial identification of both the reference alternatives and the underlying preferences is provided. For the case of multiple menu-independent references, I provide a complete identification of the references and a coarse identification of the underlying preferences. A complete identification of the latter is provided when the independent random attention function is considered.</description>

      <title>Propose or Vote: A Canonical Democratic Procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Propose or Vote (PoV), a democratic procedure for collective decision-making and elections that does not rely on a central mechanism designer. In the first stage, members of a polity choose whether to become proposal-makers or to participate only as voters. In the second stage, voters decide by majority voting over the set of submitted proposals. With appropriately chosen default points, PoV implements the Condorcet winner in a single round of voting whenever one exists. We show that this implementation is globally unique when the number of members is odd; for an even number of members, uniqueness can be restored by adding an artificial agent. PoV can also be applied to elections, where agents decide whether to stand as candidates or vote over the resulting candidate set.</description>

      <title>The Moroccan Public Procurement Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the public procurement market through the lens of game theory by modeling it as a strategic game with discontinuous and non-quasiconcave payoffs. We first show that the game admits no Nash equilibrium in pure strategies. We then analyze the two-player case and derive two explicit mixed-strategy equilibria for the symmetric game and for the weighted $(p,1-p)$ formulation. Finally, we study the existence of a symmetric mixed strategies Nash equilibrium in the general $N$-player case by applying the diagonal disjoint payoff matching condition.</description>

      <title>Occupational Tasks, Automation, and Economic Growth: A Modeling and Simulation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fourth Industrial Revolution commonly refers to the accelerating technological transformation that has been taking place in the 21st century. Economic growth theories which treat the accumulation of knowledge and its effect on production endogenously remain relevant, yet they have been evolving to explain how the current wave of advancements in automation and artificial intelligence (AI) technology will affect productivity and different occupations. The work contributes to current economic discourse by developing an analytical task-based framework that endogenously integrates knowledge accumulation with frictions that describe technological lock-in and the burden of knowledge generation and validation. The interaction between production (or automation) and growth (or knowledge accumulation) is also described explicitly. To study how automation and AI shape economic outcomes, I rely on high-throughput calculations of the developed model. The effect of the model's structural parameters on key variables such as the production output, wages, and labor shares of output is quantified, and possible intervention strategies are briefly discussed. An important result is that wages and labor shares are not directly linked, instead they can be influenced independently through distinct policy levers. Generally, labor share depends sensitively on capital-labor ratio, while wages respond positively to larger knowledge stocks.</description>
