      <title>Generative Models of 21cm EoR Lightcones with 3D Scattering Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is observed as a three-dimensional data set known as a lightcone, consisting of a redshift (frequency) axis and two spatial sky plane axes. When observed by radio interferometers, this EoR signal is strongly obscured by foregrounds that are several orders of magnitude stronger. Due to its inherently non-Gaussian nature, the EoR signal requires robust statistical tools to accurately separate it from these foreground contaminants, but current foreground separation techniques focus primarily on recovering the EoR power spectrum, often neglecting valuable non-Gaussian information. Recent developments in astrophysics, particularly in the context of the Galactic interstellar medium, have demonstrated the efficacy of scattering transforms - novel summary statistics for highly non-Gaussian processes - for component separation tasks. Motivated by these advances, we extend the scattering transform formalism from two-dimensional data sets to three-dimensional EoR lightcones. To this end, we introduce a 3D wavelet set from the tensor product of 2D isotropic wavelets in the sky plane domain and 1D wavelets in the redshift domain. As generative models form the basis of component separation, our focus here is on building and validating generative models that can be used for component separation in future projects. To achieve this, we construct maximum entropy generative models to synthesise EoR lightcones, and statistically validate the generative model by quantitatively comparing the synthesised EoR lightcones with the single target lightcone used to construct them, using independent statistics such as the power spectrum and Minkowski Functionals. The synthesised lightcones agree well with the target lightcone both statistically and visually, opening up the possibility of developing for component separation methods using 3D scattering transforms.</description>

      <title>Positron Signal from the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bursts from the very early universe may lead to a detectable signal via the production of positrons, whose annihilation gives an observable X-ray signal. Using the absorption parameters for the annihilation photons of 511 keV, it is found that observable photons would originate at a red-shift around $z\approx$ 200-300, resulting in soft X-rays of energy $\sim$ 2-3 keV at present. Positrons are expected to be absent at these times or red-shifts in the standard picture of the early universe. Detection of the X-rays would thus provide dramatic support for the hypothesis of the bursts, explosive events at very early times. We urge the search for such a signal.</description>

      <title>Constraining the lensing dispersion from the angular clustering of binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binaries provide direct measurements of luminosity distances and serve as a powerful probe of the high-redshift Universe. In addition to their role as standard sirens, they offer an opportunity to constrain small-scale density fluctuations through the dispersion in the distance-redshift relation induced by gravitational lensing. We propose a method to constrain this lensing dispersion without requiring the redshift information by analyzing the angular clustering of gravitational wave sources. Our formalism incorporating second-order lensing effects in the luminosity distance shows that the amplitude of the auto-correlation angular clustering decreases with increasing lensing dispersion. While we show that the auto-correlation signal is detected with sufficient signal-to-noise ratios in future gravitational wave experiments, there exists a strong degeneracy between the lensing dispersion and the linear bias of gravitational wave sources. We demonstrate that this degeneracy is partially broken by a joint analysis of the auto-correlation of gravitational wave sources and the cross-correlation with galaxies whose redshifts are known. This approach enhances the use of gravitational waves as a cosmological probe at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Testing the local supervoid solution to the Hubble tension with direct distance tracers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several observational studies suggest that the local few hundred Mpc around the Local Group are significantly underdense based on source number counts in redshift space across much of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly in near-infrared galaxy counts. This ``Keenan--Barger--Cowie (KBC) void'', ``Local Hole'', or ``local supervoid'', would have significant ramifications for the Hubble tension by generating outflows that masquerade as an enhanced local expansion rate. We evaluate models for the KBC void capable of resolving the Hubble tension with a background Planck cosmology. We fit these models to direct distances from the Tully--Fisher catalogue of the CosmicFlows-4 compilation using a field-level forward model. Depending on the adopted void density profile, we find the derived velocity fields to prefer a void size of less than 70 Mpc, which is less than 10 per cent of the fiducial size found by Haslbauer et al. based on the KBC luminosity density data. The predicted local Hubble constant is $72.1^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$, $70.4^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$, or $70.2^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ km/s/Mpc for an initial underdensity profile that is exponential, Gaussian, or Maxwell-Boltzmann, respectively. The latter two ameliorate the Hubble tension to within $3\sigma$ of the 4-anchor distance ladder approach of Breuval et al. giving $73.2 \pm 0.9$ km/s/Mpc. The exponential profile does achieve consistency with this measurement at just over $1\sigma$, but it is disfavoured by the Bayesian evidence. The preferred models produce bulk flow curves that disagree with recent estimates from CosmicFlows-4, despite the void models being flexible enough to match such estimates.</description>

      <title>A Visibility-based 21 cm Bispectrum Estimator for Radio-interferometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fast and scalable estimator for the binned multi-frequency angular bispectrum (MABS) and the 3D bispectrum (BS) of the redshifted 21 cm signal from radio interferometric observations. The estimator operates on gridded visibilities and leverages the FFT-based acceleration to efficiently compute the MABS and the 3D BS covering all possible triangle configurations. We present the formalism and validate the estimator using simulated visibility data for a known input model BS, considering the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations with a bandwidth of $30.72$ MHz centered at $154.25$ MHz. We consider two cases, namely, without flagging, and with flagging, which has exactly the same frequency channels flagged as the actual data. We obtain estimates of the BS for a wide range of triangle shapes covering the scales $0.003 ~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\leq k_1 \leq 1.258 ~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The estimated BS shows excellent agreement with analytical predictions based on the input model BS. We find that the deviations, which are below 20\% even in the presence of flagging, are mostly consistent with the expected statistical fluctuations. This work paves the way for reliable observational estimates of the 21 cm BS for the epoch of reionization, where the signal is predicted to be highly non-Gaussian.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-attractor inflation modified by GUP in light of ACT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, the $\alpha$-attractor inflation is investigated within a framework incorporating a minimal measurable length, as implemented by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). The GUP modifications to the Friedmann equations and cosmological perturbation parameters are employed to assess the model observational viability against recent high-precision data, primarily from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6 (ACT DR6) combined with Planck, DESI BAO, and BICEP/Keck 2018 observations (P-ACT-LB-BK18). Our results indicate that while the standard $\alpha$-attractor model ($\beta=0$) for $N_*=60$ lies near the $2\sigma$ boundary of the P-ACT-LB-BK18 dataset, the inclusion of GUP effects significantly shifts the predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Notably, for the GUP parameter $\beta$ values surpassing approximately $10^{13}$, the model predictions are shown to fall well within the 68\% CL region of this combined observational data, enhancing its consistency. The viable parameter space in the $\alpha-\beta$ plane is explored, revealing that a maximum $\alpha \simeq 0.74$ is consistent with the 68\% CL for $\beta \simeq 1.4\times 10^{13}$. In addition, for smaller values of $\alpha$, the predictions of the model remain inside the 68\% CL region for larger values of $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Numerical tests of cosmological Alfv\'en waves with Ohmic diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical problems with a solution that can be expressed analytically are scarce; this holds even more true for problems set in a cosmological context. Such solutions are, however, invaluable tools for making comparisons between theory, numerical experimentation and observations. In this work we present what to our knowledge is the first set of non-trivial closed-form expressions describing the behaviour of a system governed by the equations of non-ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), where the effects of Ohmic diffusion are considered, in a cosmologically expanding frame. We provide analytical solutions that describe the time evolution of linear perturbations to a homogeneous background in a radiation-dominated universe, yielding dissipative Alfv\'en waves. Although in our base framework solutions for any other cosmology of interest cannot be expressed in a closed form, they can still be obtained reliably through numerical integration of the coupled system of ordinary differential equations we provide. We compare our analytical solutions to numerical results obtained using our novel implementation of Smoothed Particle Magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) in the SWIFT astrophysical simulation code, to find good agreement between the two. We find the code to display good convergence behaviour, its predictions agreeing with theory to within 0.1% for a modest number of resolution elements and at a negligible computational cost. We aim this work as a companion and supplement to the cosmological ideal MHD wave tests recently presented in the literature, and suggest that it be adopted as part of standard testing of code implementations of MHD.</description>

      <title>Viscosity in Isotropic Cosmological Backgrounds in General Relativity and Starobinsky Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05180v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general analysis of the role of shear viscosity in cosmological backgrounds, focusing on isotropic space-time in both Einstein and $f(R)$ gravity. By computing the divergence of the stress-energy tensor in a general class of isotropic (but not necessarily homogeneous) geometries, we show that shear viscosity does not contribute to the background dynamics when the fluid is comoving. This result holds in both the Jordan and Einstein frames, and implies that shear viscosity cannot affect the electromagnetic luminosity distance which is determined by the background light-like geodesics. As an application of our results, we critically examine recent claims that shear viscosity can alter the Hubble evolution and the electromagnetic luminosity distance in Starobinsky gravity. We demonstrate that the continuity equation used in that work is at odds both with the covariant conservation of the stress-energy tensor and the local second law of thermodynamics. We further show that even in models where such modifications could mimic bulk viscosity, the resulting entropy evolution is inconsistent with standard thermodynamic expectations.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Owl: Twin Active Collisional Ring Galaxies with Starburst Merging Front at $z=1.14$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers play a critical role in driving galaxy evolution, especially by transforming galaxy morphology, redistributing the gas around galaxies, triggering AGN activity and star formation. We present the Cosmic Owl, a galaxy merger at $z=1.14$, identified in the COSMOS field. Deep imaging and spectroscopy from JWST, ALMA, and VLA reveal a complex system of twin collisional ring galaxies, exhibiting a nearly identical morphology. The grism spectra from the JWST COSMOS-3D program confirm that both galaxies host an AGN. A bipolar radio jet from one AGN extends to strike the merging front. In addition, we detect a starburst at the merging front, characterized by luminous extended nebular line emission and a massive cold gas reservoir. This starburst is likely triggered by interstellar shocks induced by galaxy collision and the AGN jet. The twin ring structure of the Cosmic Owl requires further numerical simulations to clarify the precise conditions that lead to the formation of this rare morphology. This system exemplifies how shock-induced star formation, driven by galaxy collision or AGN jet, can act as a previously underappreciated yet crucial mechanism for efficient gas-to-star conversion and rapid stellar mass assembly in the early Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the possibility that the dynamical dark energy hinted at by recent DESI data may be mimicked by the effects of additional components in the universe, potentially arising from topological defects. We find that the data does not show a particular preference for the existence of cosmic strings. However, a domain wall contribution at the percent level can improve the fit, yielding a $\Delta \chi^2= -1.72$ compared to the $\Lambda \rm{CDM}$ model. The improvement indicates that topological defects remain a viable and interesting extension to $\Lambda\rm{CDM}$, meriting further investigation with future cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Precision predictions of Starobinsky inflation with self-consistent Weyl-squared corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starobinsky's $R+\alpha R^2$ inflation provides a compelling one-parameter inflationary model that is supported by current cosmological observations. However, at the same order in spacetime derivatives as the $R^2$ term, an effective theory of spacetime geometry must also include the Weyl-squared curvature invariant $W^2$. In this paper, we study the inflationary predictions of the gravitational theory with action of the form $R+\alpha R^2 - \beta W^2$, where the coupling constant $\alpha$ sets the scale of inflation, and corrections due to the $W^2$ term are treated self-consistently via reduction of order in an expansion in the coupling constant $\beta$, at the linear order in $\beta/\alpha$. Cosmological perturbations are found to be described by an effective action with a non-trivial speed of sound $c_{\textrm{s}}$ for scalar and $c_{\textrm{t}}$ for tensor modes, satisfying the relation $c_{\textrm{t}}/c_{\textrm{s}} \simeq 1+ \frac{\beta}{6\, \alpha}$ during the inflationary phase. Within this self-consistent framework, we compute several primordial observables up to the next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N3LO). We find the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 3(1-\frac{\beta}{6\alpha})(n_\textrm{s}-1)^2$, the tensor tilt $n_{\textrm{t}}\simeq-\frac{r}{8}$ and the running of the scalar tilt $\mathfrak{a}_{\textrm{s}}\simeq-\frac{1}{2} (n_{\textrm{s}} - 1)^2$, all expressed in terms of the observed scalar tilt $n_{\textrm{s}}$. We also provide the corresponding corrections up to N3LO, $\mathcal{O}((n_{\textrm{s}} - 1)^3)$.</description>

      <title>Bayesian luminosity function estimation in multidepth datasets with selection effects: a case study for $3&lt;z&lt;5$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework designed to infer the luminosity function of any class of objects by jointly modeling data from multiple surveys with varying depth, completeness, and sky coverage. Our method explicitly accounts for selection effects and measurement uncertainties (e.g., in luminosity) and could be generalized to any extensive quantity, such as mass. We validate the model using mock catalogs, recovering how deep data reaching $\gtrsim 1.5$ dex below a characteristic luminosity $\tilde{L}^\star$ are essential to reduce biases at the faint end ($\lesssim 0.1$ dex), while wide-area data help constrain the bright end. As proof of concept, we consider a combined sample of 1176 Ly$\alpha$ emitters at redshift $3 &lt; z &lt; 5$ drawn from several MUSE surveys, ranging from ultra-deep ($\gtrsim 90$ hr) and narrow ($\lesssim 1$ arcmin$^2$) fields to shallow ($\lesssim 5$ hr) and wide ($\gtrsim 20$ arcmin$^2$) fields. With this complete sample, we constrain the luminosity function parameters $\log(\Phi^\star/\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}) = -2.86^{+0.15}_{-0.17}$, $\log(L^\star/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) = 42.72^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, and $\alpha = -1.81^{+0.09}_{-0.09}$, where the uncertainties represent the $90\%$ credible intervals. These values are in agreement with studies based on gravitational lensing that reach $\log(L/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) \approx 41$, although differences in the faint-end slope underscore how systematic errors are starting to dominate. In contrast, wide-area surveys represent the natural extension needed to constrain the brightest Ly$\alpha$ emitters [$\log(L/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) \gtrsim 43$], where statistical uncertainties still dominate.</description>

      <title>A novel method to trace the dark matter density profile around supermassive black holes with AGN reverberation mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to determine the dark matter density profile in the vicinity of distant supermassive black holes (SMBH) using reverberation mapping measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN). For some AGN, the mapping of multiple emission lines allows us to measure the enclosed mass within different radii from the central SMBH, which allows us to infer or constrain the dark matter density profile on sub-pc scales. We find that for five out of fourteen AGN in our identified sample, the observed enclosed mass grows with radii, hinting evidence for the presence of a dark matter component at the 1-2 $\sigma$ level. For these sources, we find global evidence for a universal dark matter profile with a preferred radial steepness of index $\gamma \sim 1.6$, consistent with the scenario expected for a dark matter spike mildly relaxed by stellar heating processes. For the remaining AGN in our sample, we are able to derive upper limits on the dark matter density profile parameters. Interestingly, the strongest evidence for a dark matter component arises from the farthest object considered, 3C 390. This new method allows us to measure or constrain for the first time the dark matter density in the vicinity of extragalactic SMBHs, which is crucial to our understanding of the dynamics and nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Confirmation of a Remarkable Linear Trail of Galaxies in the NGC 1052 Field, Consistent with Formation in a High-Speed Bullet Dwarf Collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A unique linear trail of diffuse galaxies was recently identified in the NGC 1052 field. This trail includes the remarkable, ultra-diffuse galaxies DF2 and DF4 which lack dark matter and host unusually luminous globular clusters. It has been proposed that the trail formed via a high-speed collision between two gas-rich dwarf galaxies. This scenario predicts that the trail galaxies are kinematically connected and follow a specific trend in radial velocity as a function of position, based on the known velocities and positions of DF2 and DF4. To test this hypothesis, we measured radial velocities for seven additional galaxies on the trail. While the galaxies' low surface brightnesses presented observational challenges, we employ several methods to obtain measurements for galaxies with effective surface brightnesses up to 28.6 mag arcsec$^{-2}$, including a narrow slit placed over globular clusters and a novel wide slit mode on Keck/LRIS, as well as a 'light bucket' mode on Keck/KCWI. We find that five of our seven targets follow the precise velocity trend predicted by DF2 and DF4, to a degree with just a 2% chance of randomly occurring. Moreover, the trail galaxies' radial velocities are significantly higher than those of the NGC 1052 group, setting it apart as a separate, kinematically connected system. Our findings support the theory that this trail of galaxies, including DF2 and DF4, formed together in a single event. A 'bullet dwarf' collision remains the only known explanation for all the unusual properties of DF2, DF4, and the associated trail of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Two coincidences are a clue: Probing a GeV-scale dark QCD sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The similarity between dark matter and baryon energy densities suggests the existence of a dark sector analogous to the visible QCD sector. In addition, small-scale structure issues can be addressed by dark matter self-interactions with a cross section comparable to that of QCD. Both observations point to a GeV-scale dark QCD sector. In this letter, guided by these two coincidences, we investigate how a chiral dark QCD model with a MeV-scale dark photon can resolve the core-cusp problem. A potential third coincidence, associated with the latest measurement of $N_{\rm eff}$ being lower than the Standard Model prediction, is also discussed. Current constraints leave a finite window in the parameter space, which can be tested by future experiments such as Gamma Factory.</description>

      <title>A Double-Sine-Gordon Early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A solitonic model of the early universe is introduced by employing the Double-Sine-Gordon (DSG) potential. The model predicts the appropriate number of e-foldings ($N_e$) required for favored inflation and is an advantage for the model in addressing the flatness, horizon, and magnetic monopole problems. Compatibility of the model with observations, including the Planck $2018$ data \cite{Akrami et al. (2020)} and the Planck $2018$ data+BK$18$+BAO \cite{Ade et al. (2021)} paves the way to estimate the model's free parameters. The results generate acceptable and proper values for the spectral index ($n_s$) and the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) in agreement with the Planck $2018$ data \cite{Akrami et al. (2020)} and the Planck $2018$ data+BK$18$+BAO \cite{Ade et al. (2021)}. Correspondingly, a consistent description of the reheating era is obtained, yielding positive reheating number of e-foldings ($N_{\mathrm{reh}}$) and reheating final temperature ($T_{\mathrm{reh}}$) from $10^{-2}$ GeV to $10^{16}$ GeV. Overall, the model seems viable at the inflationary and reheating eras.</description>

      <title>Combining strongly lensed and unlensed fast radio bursts: To be a more precise late-universe probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03126v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Macquart relation and time-delay cosmography are now two promising ways to fast radio burst (FRB) cosmology. In this work, we propose a joint method that combines strongly lensed and unlensed FRBs for improving cosmological parameter estimation by using simulated FRB data from the future sensitive coherent all-sky monitor survey, which is expected to detect a large number of FRBs including galaxy-galaxy strongly lensed events. We find that using a detectable sample of 100,000 localized FRBs including $40$ lensed events can simultaneously constrain the Hubble constant and the equation of state of dark energy, with high precision of $\varepsilon(H_0)=0.4\%$ and $\varepsilon(w)=4.5\%$ in the simplest dynamical dark energy model. The joint analysis of unlensed and lensed FRBs significantly improves the constraint on $H_0$, which could be more effective than combining either the unlensed FRBs with future gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens or the lensed FRBs with CMB. Furthermore, combining the full FRB sample with the CMB+BAO+SNe data yields $\sigma(H_0)=0.29~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, $\sigma(w_0)=0.046$, and $\sigma(w_a)=0.15$ in the two-parameter dynamical dark energy model, which outperform the results from the CMB+BAO+SNe+GW data. This reinforces the cosmological implications of a multi-wavelength observational strategy in optical and radio bands. We conclude that the future FRB observations will shed light on the nature of dark energy and also the Hubble tension if enough events with long-duration lensing are incorporated.</description>

      <title>HI Intensity Mapping with the MIGHTEE Survey: First Results of the HI Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first results of the HI intensity mapping power spectrum analysis with the MeerKAT International GigaHertz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) survey. We use data covering $\sim$4 square degrees in the COSMOS field using a frequency range 962.5 MHz to 1008.42 MHz, equivalent to HI emission in $0.4&lt;z&lt;0.48$. The data consists of 15 pointings with a total of 94.2 hours on-source. We verify the suitability of the MIGHTEE data for HI intensity mapping by testing for residual systematics across frequency, baselines and pointings. We also vary the window used for HI signal measurements and find no significant improvement using stringent Fourier mode cuts. Averaging in the power spectrum domain, i.e. using incoherent averaging, we calculate the first upper limits from MIGHTEE on the HI power spectrum at scales 0.5 Mpc$^{-1} \lesssim k \lesssim$ 10 Mpc$^{-1}$. We obtain the best 1$\sigma$ upper limit of 28.6 mK$^{2}$Mpc${^3}$ on $k\sim$2 Mpc$^{-1}$. Our results are consistent with the power spectrum detected with observations in the DEEP2 field with MeerKAT. The data we use here constitutes a small fraction of the MIGHTEE survey and demonstrates that combined analysis of the full MIGHTEE survey can potentially detect the HI power spectrum at $z\lesssim0.5$ in the range 0.1 Mpc$^{-1} \lesssim k \lesssim$ 10 Mpc$^{-1}$ or quasi-linear scales.</description>

      <title>New constraints on interacting dark energy from DESI DR2 BAO observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In its second data release (DR2), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) publicly released measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from over 13.1 million galaxies and 1.6 million quasars, covering the redshift range $0.295 \leq z \leq 2.330$. In this work, we investigate the impact of this new dataset on dark sector interaction models, which are motivated by non-gravitational interactions between dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM), commonly referred to as interacting dark energy models (IDE). We focus on two frameworks: the traditional IDE model and the recently proposed sign-switching Interacting model (S-IDE), aiming to derive new and robust constraints on both scenarios. After carefully selecting the sample for the joint analysis, ensuring compatibility among the data without significant tension, our main results indicate that both models can alleviate the $H_0$ tension, reducing it to moderate tension approximately $2.7\sigma$. The IDE model shows compatibility with the latest $S_8$ constraints from cosmic shear surveys, while the S-IDE model predicts lower values of $S_8$, which align with alternative perspectives on the $S_8$ tension. For the traditional IDE model, we derive new bounds for the coupling parameter, marking the strongest constraints to date through geometric measurements. This highlights the crucial role that supernova samples can play in refining these constraints. For the S-IDE model, we find mild evidence (over $2\sigma$) for a non-zero coupling, once the PantheonPlus dataset calibrated with Cepheid-based magnitude measurements is included in the analysis.</description>

      <title>Physical vs phantom dark energy after DESI: thawing quintessence in a curved background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent data from DESI, in combination with other data, provide moderate evidence of dynamical dark energy, $w\neq-1$. In the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization of $w$, there is a preference for a phantom crossing, $w&lt;-1$, at redshift $z\sim0.5$. In general relativity, the phantom equation of state is unphysical. Thus it is important to check whether phantom crossing is present in other physically self-consistent models of dark energy that have equivalent evidence to the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization. We find that thawing quintessence with nonzero cosmic curvature can fit the recent data as well as $w_0, w_a$ in a flat background, based on both parametric and realistic scalar field evolutions. Although the realistic model does not allow $w&lt;-1$, the parametrizations do allow it. However even if we allow $w&lt;-1$ the data do not enforce phantom crossing. Thus, the phantom crossing is an artifact of a parametrization that is not based on a physical model.</description>

      <title>It's All ${\tt Ok}$: Curvature in Light of BAO from DESI DR2</title>

Abstract: Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) show hints of tension with data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) when interpreted within the standard model of cosmology. In this short note we discuss the consequences of one solution to this tension, a small but negative spatial curvature with $R_k = 21 H_0^{-1}$, which DESI measures at $2\sigma$ when combined with CMB data. We describe the physical role of curvature in cosmological distance measures tied to recombination, i.e. the CMB and BAO, and the relation to neutrino mass constraints which are relaxed to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.10$ eV at $95\%$ confidence when curvature is allowed to deviate from zero. A robust detection of negative curvature would have significant implications for inflationary models: improved BAO measurements, particularly from future high-redshift spectroscopic surveys, will be able to distinguish curvature from other solutions to the DESI-CMB tension like phantom dark energy at high significance.</description>

      <title>A G_2G2-Holonomy Model for Late-Time Cosmic Acceleration in M-theory: Alleviating the Hubble Tension through Geometric Vacuum Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06654v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An M-theory framework with $G_{\mathrm{2}}$-holonomy compactification yields dynamical geometric moduli generating an evolving $\Lambda(z)$, termed ``geometric vacuum energy'' from fluxes and instanton corrections. Evolving the model from early cosmic times reveals strong attractor behaviors. For specific potential parameters ($\phi_c \approx 5.0$, fine-tuned $V_0$), a natural attractor solution emerges, alleviating the Hubble tension. It yields $H_0 \approx 69.4\ \mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ (compared to $H_0 \approx 67\ \mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ from early-Universe probes) and $\Lambda(0) \approx 1.105 \times 10^{-52}\ \mathrm{m}^{-2}$, with $\Phi(0) \approx 2.2$. This maintains overall concordance, accommodating $\Omega_{k0}\approx 0.097$, $\Omega_{m0}\approx 0.25$, age $\approx 13.8\mathrm {Gyr}$, and is consistent with BBN/CMB constraints where geometric vacuum energy is subdominant. Excellent fit ($\chi^2/N \approx 0.44$) is found against 34 $H(z)$ cosmic chronometer data. The model yields $S_8 \approx 0.74$. This highlights how $G_{\mathrm{2}}$-M-theory can reconcile late-time observations via attractor dynamics, suggesting a UV-complete origin for dynamical vacuum energy. Further investigations are envisaged.</description>

      <title>Forecast Analysis of Astrophysical Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background beyond general relativity: A Case Study on Brans-Dicke Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor gravity, exemplified by Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity, introduces additional scalar polarization modes that contribute scalar radiation alongside tensor modes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of how gravitational wave generation and propagation effects under Brans-Dicke gravity are encoded into the astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave background (AGWB). We perform end-to-end analyses of realistic populations of simulated coalescing binary systems to generate AGWB mock data with third-generation gravitational wave detectors and conducted a complete Bayesian analysis for the first time. We find the uncertainties in the population properties of binary black holes (BBH) significantly affect the ability to constrain BD gravity. Furthermore, we explore the detectability of potential scalar backgrounds that originates from binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron-star-black-hole (NSBH) mergers, with NSBH systems expected to modify the spectral index of the scalar background and introduce oscillatory behavior. We show that the observations of the AGWB enable the separation of mixed tensor and scalar polarization modes with comparable sensitivity to each mode. However, the scalar background is expected to remain substantially weaker than the tensor background, even in scenarios where BD gravity exhibits significant deviations from general relativity (GR), resulting only upper limits can be placed on the scalar background. We conclude that for ambiguous populations, employing waveform matching with individual sources provides a more robust approach to constrain BD gravity.</description>

      <title>Improved quantum algorithm for calculating eigenvalues of differential operators and its application to estimating the decay rate of the perturbation distribution tail in stochastic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for scientific computing and their applications have been studied actively. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for estimating the first eigenvalue of a differential operator $\mathcal{L}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and its application to cosmic inflation theory. A common approach for this eigenvalue problem involves applying the finite-difference discretization to $\mathcal{L}$ and computing the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix, but this method suffers from the curse of dimensionality, namely the exponential complexity with respect to $d$. Our first contribution is the development of a new quantum algorithm for this task, leveraging recent quantum singular value transformation-based methods. Given a trial function that overlaps well with the eigenfunction, our method runs with query complexity scaling as $\widetilde{O}(d^3/\epsilon^2)$ with $d$ and estimation accuracy $\epsilon$, which is polynomial in $d$ and shows an improvement over existing quantum algorithms. Then, we consider the application of our method to a problem in a theoretical framework for cosmic inflation known as stochastic inflation, specifically calculating the eigenvalue of the adjoint Fokker--Planck operator, which is related to the decay rate of the tail of the probability distribution for the primordial density perturbation. We numerically see that in some cases, simple trial functions overlap well with the first eigenfunction, indicating our method is promising for this problem.</description>

      <title>Reconstructions of Einstein-Aether Gravity from Barrow Agegraphic and New Barrow Agegraphic Dark Energy models: Examinations and Observational Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation exploring the theoretical framework of Einstein-Aether gravity theory when combined with two modified cosmological paradigms: the Barrow Agegraphic Dark Energy (BADE) and its newer variant, the New Barrow Agegraphic Dark Energy (NBADE). Our study focuses on reconstructing the functional form of the Einstein-Aether Lagrangian component $F(K)$ from these phenomenological dark energy models. Model parameters are constrained using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach based on multiple datasets, including cosmic chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the Pantheon+SH0ES compilation. Using best-fit parameters, we analyze various cosmological diagnostics: Hubble and deceleration parameter evolution, dark energy equation of state $\omega_{DE}$, density parameter trajectories, $\omega'_{DE}$--$\omega_{DE}$ phase space behavior, statefinder diagnostics $(r,s^*)$ and $(r,q)$, and Om(z) trajectories. Both models exhibit late-time acceleration, with the dark energy sector showing a quintessence-like nature in the current epoch and evolving toward a phantom regime in the future. Stability analysis based on the squared sound speed $v_s^2$ highlights partial epoch-dependent stability. While our results demonstrate reasonable agreement with observational data and reveal physically plausible dynamics, the models do not yet offer a fundamentally superior alternative to other dark energy reconstructions. Nonetheless, their behavior under modified entropy assumptions and their flexibility in dynamical diagnostics provide a useful framework for probing non-standard extensions of Einstein-Aether gravity and dark energy phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Chiral global embedding of Fibre Inflation with $\overline{\rm D3}$ uplift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carefully analyse the challenges posed by the construction of type IIB chiral global embeddings of Fibre Inflation with $\overline{ \rm D3}$ uplift to a de Sitter vacuum. We present an explicit example involving an $h^{1,1}=4$ Calabi-Yau manifold with a K3 fibration and a del Pezzo divisor supporting non-perturbative effects. The chosen orientifold involution induces O3-planes that can be placed on top of each other at the tip of the throat of a deformed conifold singularity. The D7-brane sector contains standard magnetised branes and a Whitney brane. The former induce chiral matter and generate quantum effects that stabilise the K\"ahler moduli, while the latter helps to increase the total D3-charge. We study in detail the constraints on the parameter space leading to an observationally viable inflationary dynamics, finding several regions where the effective field theory is under control.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Moduli and Non-perturbative Production of Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17229v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological moduli generically come to dominate the energy density of the early universe, and thereby trigger an early matter dominated era. Such non-standard cosmological histories are expected to have profound effects on the evolution and production of axion cold dark matter and dark radiation, as well as their prospects for detection. We consider moduli-axion couplings and investigate the early history of the coupled system, considering closely the evolution of the homogeneous modulus field, the back-reaction from the axion, and the energy densities of the two fields. A particular point of interest is the enhancement of axion production from modulus decay, due to tachyonic and parametric resonant instabilities, and the implications of such production on the cosmological moduli problem, axion dark radiation, and the available parameter space for axion dark matter. Using an effective field theory approach, WKB-based semi-analytical analysis, and detailed numerical estimates of the co-evolution of the system, we evaluate the expected decay efficiency of the modulus to axions. The effects of higher-order operators are studied and implications for UV-complete frameworks such as the Large Volume Scenarios in Type IIB string theory are considered in detail.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of $f(Q)$ cosmology with quintom-like scenario: the phantom field as effective realization of the non-trivial connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that $f(Q)$ cosmology with a non-trivial connection, namely the Connection II of the literature, is dynamically equivalent with a quintom-like model. In particular, we show that the scalar field arising from the non-linear $f(Q)$ form, and the scalar field associated to the non-trivial connection, are combined to provide one canonical and one phantom field in the minisuperspace Lagrangian. Hence, the combination of two well-behaved fields appears effectively as a phantom field. This is fundamentally different from the usual approach in phantom and quintom cosmology, in which the phantom field is introduced ad hoc, and thus it may open a new way to handle the phantom fields, namely as effective realizations of the connection-related canonical fields.</description>

      <title>Domain wall evolution beyond quartic potentials: The Sine-Gordon and Christ-Lee potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain walls are the simplest type of topological defects formed at cosmological phase transitions, and one of the most constrained. Their studies typically assume a quartic double well potential, but this model is not fully representative of the range of known or plausible particle physics models. Here we study the cosmological evolution of domain walls in two other classes of potentials. The Sine-Gordon potential allows several types of walls, interpolating between different pairs of minima (which demands specific numerical algorithms to separately measure the relevant properties of each type). The Christ-Lee potential parametrically interpolates between sextic and quartic behavior. We use multiple sets of simulations in two and three spatial dimensions, for various cosmological epochs and under various choices of initial conditions, to discuss the scaling properties of these networks. In the Sine-Gordon case, we identify and quantify deviations from the usual scaling behavior. In the Christ-Lee case, we discuss conditions under which walls form (or not), and quantify how these outcomes depend on parameters such as the energy difference between the false and true vacua and the expansion rate of the Universe. Various biased initial conditions are also addressed in appendices. Finally, we briefly comment on the possible cosmological implications of our results.</description>

      <title>Four-point correlation functions in axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study parity violation in the early universe by examining the four-point correlation function within the axion inflation model. Using an open quantum system formalism from our previous work, we calculate the influence functional to fourth order, from which we then derive the inflaton four-point correlation function. When we decompose this function using isotropic basis functions, the expansion coefficients $\zeta_{\ell',\ell'',\ell'''}$ naturally split into parity-even and parity-odd components. In the large $\xi$ approximation, which enhances the production of right-handed photons in the model, the derivation of these coefficients simplifies. We work out the lowest-order nonvanishing parity-odd $\zeta_{234}$ term which clearly indicates the presence of parity violation. Moreover, our derived values of the coefficients are consistent with recent observational data from galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Dissecting environmental effects with eccentric gravitational wave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model the effect of resonances between time-varying perturbative forces and the epi-cyclical motion of eccentric binaries in the gravitational wave (GW) driven regime. These induce secular drifts in the orbital elements which are reflected in a dephasing of the binary's GW signal, derived here systematically. The resulting dephasing prescriptions showcase a much richer phenomenology with respect to typically adopted power-laws, and are better able to model realistic environmental effects (EE). The most important consequences are for gas embedded binaries, which we analyse in detail with a series of analytical calculations, numerical experiments and a curated set of hydrodynamical simulations. Even in these simplified tests, we find the surprising result that dephasing caused by epi-cyclical resonances dominate over expectations based on smoothed or orbit averaged gas drag models in GW signals that retain mild eccentricity in the detector band ($e&gt; 0.05$). We discuss how dissecting GW dephasing in its component Fourier modes can be used to probe the coupling of binaries with their surrounding environment in unprecedented detail.</description>
