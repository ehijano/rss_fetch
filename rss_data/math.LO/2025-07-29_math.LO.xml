      <title>The number of normal measures, revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new version of the Friedman-Magidor theorem: for every measurable cardinal $\kappa$ and $\tau\leq\kappa^{++}$, there exists a forcing extension $V\subseteq V[G]$ such that any normal measure $U\in V$ on $\kappa$ has exactly $\tau$ distinct lifts in $V[G]$, and every normal measure on $\kappa$ in $V[G]$ arises as such a lift. This version differs from the original Friedman-Magidor theorem in several notable ways. First, the new technique does not involve forcing over canonical inner models or rely on any fine-structural tools or assumptions, allowing it to be applied in the realm of large cardinals beyond the current reach of the inner model program. Second, in the case where $\tau\leq \kappa^+$, all lifts of a normal measure $U\in V$ on $\kappa$ to $V[G]$ have the same ultrapower. Finally, the technique generalizes to a version of the Friedman-Magidor theorem for extenders. An additional advantage is that the forcing used is notably simple, relying only on nonstationary support product forcing.</description>

      <title>Unravelling Cyclic First-Order Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclic proof systems for Heyting and Peano arithmetic eschew induction axioms by accepting proofs which are finite graphs rather than trees. Proving that such a cyclic proof system coincides with its more conventional variants is often difficult: Previous proofs in the literature rely on intricate arithmetisations of the metamathematics of the cyclic proof systems.
  In this article, we present a simple and direct embedding of cyclic proofs for Heyting and Peano arithmetic into purely inductive, i.e. 'finitary', proofs by adapting a translation introduced by Sprenger and Dam for a cyclic proof system of $\mu\text{FOL}$ with explicit ordinal approximations. We extend their method to recover Das' result of $\text{C}\Pi_n \subseteq \text{I}\Pi_{n + 1}$ for Peano arithmetic. As part of the embedding we present a novel representation of cyclic proofs as a labelled sequent calculus.</description>

      <title>The Boolean Compactness Theorem for $\mathrm{L}_{\infty\infty}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, contrary to the commonly held view, there is a natural and optimal compactness theorem for $\mathrm{L}_{\infty\infty}$ which generalizes the usual compactness theorem for first order logic. The key to this result is the switch from Tarski semantics to Boolean valued semantics. On the way to prove it, we also show that the latter is a (the?) natural semantics both for $\mathrm{L}_{\infty\infty}$ and for $\mathrm{L}_{\infty\omega}$.</description>

      <title>Structured Sunflowers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We call an infinite structure $\mathcal{M}$ sunflowerable if whenever $\mathcal{M}'$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{M}$ with underlying set $M'$, consisting of finite sets of bounded size, there is an $M_0 \subseteq M'$ such that $M_0$ is a sunflower and $\mathcal{M}'\!\!\upharpoonright[M_0]$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{M}$. We give sufficient conditions on $\mathcal{M}$ to show that $\mathcal{M}$ is sunflowerable. These conditions allow us to show that several well-known structures are sunflowerable and give a complete characterization of the countable linear orderings which are sunflowerable. We show that a sunflowerable structure must be indivisible. This allows us to show that any Fra\"iss\'e limit which has the 3-disjoint amalgamation property and a single unary type must be indivisible. In addition to studying sunflowerability of infinite structures, we also consider an analogous property of an age which we call the sunflower property. We show that any sunflowerable structure must have an age with the sunflower property. We also give concrete bounds in the case that the age has the hereditary property, the 3-disjoint amalgamation property, and is indivisible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend logical categories with fiberwise interior and closure operators so as to obtain an embedding theorem into powers of the category of topological spaces. The required axioms, besides the Kuratowski closure axioms, are a `product independence' and a `loop contraction' principle.</description>

      <title>Indiscernibles in monadically NIP theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove various results around indiscernibles in monadically NIP theories. First, we provide several characterizations of monadic NIP in terms of indiscernibles, mirroring previous characterizations in terms of the behavior of finite satisfiability. Second, we study (monadic) distality in hereditary classes and complete theories. Here, via finite combinatorics, we prove a result implying that every planar graph admits a distal expansion. Finally, we prove a result implying that no monadically NIP theory interprets an infinite group, and note an example of a (monadically) stable theory with no distal expansion that does not interpret an infinite group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use reverse mathematics to analyze "iterated jump" versions of the following four principles: the atomic model theorem with subenumerable types (AST), the diagonally noncomputable principle (DNR), weak weak K\H{o}nig's lemma (WWKL), and weak K\H{o}nig's lemma (WKL). The logical relationships between these principles are summarized in Figure 1 and include, among other things, an infinite chain and an infinite antichain, the latter of which represents a strong form of non-linearity in terms of provability strength among "natural" combinatorial principles.</description>

      <title>Term Assignment and Categorical Models for Intuitionistic Linear Logic with Subexponentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a typed lambda calculus ${\bf SILL}(\lambda)_{\Sigma}$, a type-theoretic version of intuitionistic linear logic with subexponentials, that is, we have many resource comonadic modalities with some interconnections between them given by a subexponential signature. We also give proof normalisation rules and prove the strong normalisation and Church-Rosser properties for $\beta$-reduction by adapting the Tait-Girard method to subexponential modalities. Further, we analyse subexponentials from the point of view of categorical logic. We introduce the concepts of a Cocteau category and a $\Sigma$-assemblage to characterise models of linear type theories with a single exponential and affine and relevant subexponentials and a more general case respectively. We also generalise several known results from linear logic and show that every Cocteau category and a $\Sigma$-assemblage can be viewed as a symmetric monoidal closed category equipped with a family of monoidal adjunctions of a particular kind. In the final section, we give a stronger 2-categorical characterisation of Cocteau categories.</description>

      <title>Algebraic independence of solutions to multiple Lotka-Volterra systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider some non-zero complex numbers $a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i$ with $1 \leq i \leq n$ and the associated classical Lotka-Volterra systems
  \[
  \begin{cases}
  x' = a_i xy + b_i y \newline
  y' = c_i xy + d_i y \text{ .}
  \end{cases}
  \] We show that as long as $b_i \neq d_i$ for all $i$ and $\{ b_i, d_i\} \neq \{ b_j, d_j\}$ for $i \neq j$, any tuples $(x_1,y_1) , \cdots , (x_m,y_m)$ of pairwise distinct, non-degenerate solutions of these systems are algebraically independent over $\mathbb{C}$, meaning $\mathrm{trdeg}((x_1,y_1) , \cdots , (x_m,y_m)/\mathbb{C}) = 2m$. Our proof relies on extending recent work of Duan and Nagloo by showing strong minimality of these systems, as long as $b_i \neq d_i$. We also generalize a theorem of Brestovski which allows us to control algebraic relations using invariant volume forms. Finally, we completely classify all invariant algebraic curves in the non-strongly minimal, $b_i = d_i$ case by using machinery from geometric stability theory.</description>

      <title>A Proposed Characterization of p-Simulation Between Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a characterization of when one axiomatic theory, as a proof system for tautologies, $p$-simulates another, by showing: (i)~if c.e. theory $\mathcal{S}$ efficiently interprets $\mathcal{S}{+}\phi$, then $\mathcal{S}$ $p$-simulates $\mathcal{S}{+}\phi$ (Je\v{r}\'abek in Pudl\'ak17 proved simulation), since the interpretation maps an $\mathcal{S}{+}\phi$-proof whose lines are all theorems into an $\mathcal{S}$-proof; (ii)~$\mathcal{S}$ proves ``$\mathcal{S}$ efficiently interprets $\mathcal{S}{+}\phi$'' iff $\mathcal{S}$ proves ``$\mathcal{S}$ $p$-simulates $\mathcal{S}{+}\phi$'' (if so, $\mathcal{S}$ already proves the $\Pi_1$ theorems of $\mathcal{S}{+}\phi$). To explore whether this framework conceivably resolves other open questions, the paper formulates conjectures stronger than ``no optimal proof system exists'' that imply Feige's Hypothesis, the existence of one-way functions, and circuit lower bounds.</description>
