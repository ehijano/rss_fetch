      <title>A Taste for Variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A decision maker repeatedly chooses one of a finite set of actions. In each period, the decision maker's payoff depends on fixed basic payoff of the chosen action and the frequency with which the action has been chosen in the past. We analyze optimal strategies associated with three types of evaluations of infinite payoffs: discounted present value, the limit inferior, and the limit superior of the partial averages. We show that when the first two are the evaluation schemes, a stationary strategy can always achieve the best possible outcome. However, for the latter evaluation scheme, a stationary strategy can achieve the best outcome only if all actions that are chosen with strictly positive frequency by an optimal stationary strategy have the same basic payoff.</description>

      <title>A Revisit of the Optimal Excess-of-Loss Contract</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that Excess-of-Loss reinsurance has more marketability than Stop-Loss reinsurance, though Stop-Loss reinsurance is the most prominent setting discussed in the optimal (re)insurance design literature. We point out that optimal reinsurance policy under Stop-Loss leads to a zero insolvency probability, which motivates our paper. We provide a remedy to this peculiar property of the optimal Stop-Loss reinsurance contract by investigating the optimal Excess-of-Loss reinsurance contract instead. We also provide estimators for the optimal Excess-of-Loss and Stop-Loss contracts and investigate their statistical properties under many premium principle assumptions and various risk preferences, which according to our knowledge, have never been investigated in the literature. Simulated data and real-life data are used to illustrate our main theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Limited Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study limited strategic leadership. A collection of subsets covering the leader's action space determine her commitment opportunities. We characterize the outcomes resulting from all possible commitment structures of this kind. If the commitment structure is an interval partition, then the leader's payoff is bounded by her Stackelberg and Cournot payoffs. However, under more general commitment structures the leader may obtain a payoff that is less than her minimum Cournot payoff. We apply our results to study information design problems in leader-follower games where a mediator communicates information about the leader's action to the follower.</description>

      <title>Continuous space core-periphery model with transport costs in differentiated agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01040v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The core-periphery model with transport costs in differentiated agriculture is extended to a continuous space. The stability of a homogeneous stationary solution exhibits redispersion under positive agricultural transport costs; it transitions from stable to unstable and finally stable again as manufacturing transport costs decrease. It is numerically observed that a solution starting from around the unstable homogeneous solution eventually forms a spike-like agglomeration. Moreover, the redispersion also appears here in the sense that the number of the spikes goes from decreasing to increasing as the manufacturing transport costs decrease. It is also observed that lower agricultural transport costs and stronger preference for agricultural variety promote agglomeration.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium in Style: A Modeling Framework on the Cash Flow and the Life Cycle of a Consumer Store</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The consumer store is ubiquitous and plays an important role in our everyday lives. It is an open question why stores usually have such short life cycles (typically around 3 years in China). This paper proposes a theoretical framework based on an equilibrium in style supply of stores and style demand of consumers to characterize store cash flow (revenue), leading to a strong explanation of this puzzle. In our model, we derive that the preference shifting of consumers is the main reason for the cash flow decreasing to its break-even line over time, while the visibility broadening leads to initial growth, resulting in rainbow-shaped cash flow and its life cycle. Moreover, the intensified spatial competition will lead to an unexpected decrease in the store's cash flow, or even closure. We calibrate our model with proprietary data of three Chinese stores from three representative industries and study the relationship between customers' preference shifting and cash flow. To our knowledge, there have been no prior attempts to quantitatively model the life cycle of the store.</description>

      <title>Level-$k$ Reasoning, Cognitive Hierarchy, and Rationalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a uniform framework to give Camerer, Ho, and Chong's (2004) cognitive hierarchy (CH) solution and its dynamic extension a decision-theoretical foundation by the epistemic game theoretical solution concept $\Delta$-rationalizability (Battigalli and Siniscalchi, 2003). We interpret level-$k$ strategic sophistication as an information type and define restriction $\Delta^\kappa$ on information types; based on it, we show that in the behavioral consequence of rationality, common belief in rationality and transparency, called $\Delta^\kappa$-rationalizability, the levels of reasoning is endogenously determined. We show that in static games, CH solution generically coincides with $\Delta^\kappa$-rationalizability; based on this, we connect CH with Bayesian equilibrium. By adapting $\Delta^\kappa$ into dynamic games, we show that Lin and Palfrey's (2024) DCH solution generically coincides with the behavioral consequence of rationality, common strong belief in rationality, and transparency of (dynamic) $\Delta^\kappa$. The same framework could also be used to analyze many variations of CH in the literature.</description>

      <title>Strategic Bidding in Knapsack Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines knapsack auctions as a method to solve the knapsack problem with incomplete information, where object values are private and sizes are public. We analyze three auction types-uniform price (UP), discriminatory price (DP), and generalized second price (GSP)-to determine efficient resource allocation in these settings. Using a Greedy algorithm for allocating objects, we analyze bidding behavior, revenue and efficiency of these three auctions using theory, lab experiments, and AI-enriched simulations. Our results suggest that the uniform-price auction has the highest level of truthful bidding and efficiency while the discriminatory price and the generalized second-price auctions are superior in terms of revenue generation. This study not only deepens the understanding of auction-based approaches to NP-hard problems but also provides practical insights for market design.</description>
