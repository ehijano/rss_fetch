      <title>Low Rank Matrix Rigidity: Tight Lower Bounds and Hardness Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an $N \times N$ matrix $A$, its rank-$r$ rigidity, denoted $\mathcal{R}_A(r)$, is the minimum number of entries of $A$ that one must change to make its rank become at most $r$. Determining the rigidity of interesting explicit families of matrices remains a major open problem, and is central to understanding the complexities of these matrices in many different models of computation and communication. We focus in this paper on the Walsh-Hadamard transform and on the `distance matrix', whose rows and columns correspond to binary vectors, and whose entries calculate whether the row and column are close in Hamming distance. Our results also generalize to other Kronecker powers and `Majority powers' of fixed matrices. We prove two new results about such matrices.
  First, we prove new rigidity lower bounds in the low-rank regime where $r &lt; \log N$. For instance, we prove that over any finite field, there are constants $c_1, c_2 &gt; 0$ such that the $N \times N$ Walsh-Hadamard matrix $H_n$ satisfies $$\mathcal{R}_{H_n}(c_1 \log N) \geq N^2 \left( \frac12 - N^{-c_2} \right),$$ and a similar lower bound for the other aforementioned matrices. This is tight, and is the new best rigidity lower bound for an explicit matrix family at this rank; the previous best was $\mathcal{R}(c_1 \log N) \geq c_3 N^2$ for a small constant $c_3&gt;0$.
  Second, we give new hardness amplification results, showing that rigidity lower bounds for these matrices for slightly higher rank would imply breakthrough rigidity lower bounds for much higher rank. For instance, if one could prove $$\mathcal{R}_{H_n}(\log^{1 + \varepsilon} N) \geq N^2 \left( \frac12 - N^{-1/2^{(\log \log N)^{o(1)}}} \right)$$ over any finite field for some $\varepsilon&gt;0$, this would imply that $H_n$ is Razborov rigid, giving a breakthrough lower bound in communication complexity.</description>

      <title>Polynomial time classical versus quantum algorithms for representation theoretic multiplicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Littlewood-Richardson, Kronecker and plethysm coefficients are fundamental multiplicities of interest in Representation Theory and Algebraic Combinatorics. Determining a combinatorial interpretation for the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients is a major open problem, and prompts the consideration of their computational complexity. Recently it was shown that they behave relatively well with respect to quantum computation, and for some large families there are polynomial time quantum algorithms [Larocca,Havlicek, arXiv:2407.17649] (also [BCGHZ,arXiv:2302.11454]). In this paper we show that for many of those cases the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients can also be computed in polynomial time via classical algorithms, thereby refuting some of the conjectures in [LH24]. This vastly limits the cases in which the desired super-polynomial quantum speedup could be achieved.</description>

      <title>Computing Hamiltonian Paths with Partial Order Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When solving the Hamiltonian path problem it seems natural to be given additional precedence constraints for the order in which the vertices are visited. For example one could decide whether a Hamiltonian path exists for a fixed starting point, or that some vertices are visited before another vertex. We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path that observes all precedence constraints given in a partial order on the vertex set. We show that this problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete even if restricted to complete bipartite graphs and posets of height 2. In contrast, for posets of width $k$ there is a known $\mathcal{O}(k^2 n^k)$ algorithm for arbitrary graphs with $n$ vertices. We show that it is unlikely that the running time of this algorithm can be improved significantly, i.e., there is no $f(k) n^{o(k)}$ time algorithm under the assumption of the Exponential Time Hypothesis. Furthermore, for the class of outerplanar graphs, we give an $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ algorithm for arbitrary posets.</description>

      <title>Learning junta distributions, quantum junta states, and QAC$^0$ circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problems of learning junta distributions, their quantum counterparts (quantum junta states) and $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits, which we show to be close to juntas.
  (1) Junta distributions. A probability distribution $p:\{-1,1\}^n\to \mathbb [0,1]$ is a $k$-junta if it only depends on $k$ bits. We show that they can be learned with to error $\varepsilon$ in total variation distance from $O(2^k\log(n)/\varepsilon^2)$ samples, which quadratically improves the upper bound of Aliakbarpour et al. (COLT'16) and matches their lower bound in every parameter.
  (2) Junta states. We initiate the study of $n$-qubit states that are $k$-juntas, those that are the tensor product of a $k$-qubit state and an $(n-k)$-qubit maximally mixed state. We show that these states can be learned with error $\varepsilon$ in trace distance with $O(12^{k}\log(n)/\varepsilon^2)$ single copies. We also prove a lower bound of $\Omega((4^k+\log (n))/\varepsilon^2)$ copies. Additionally, we show that, for constant $k$, $\tilde{\Theta}(2^n/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient to test whether a state is $\varepsilon$-close or $7\varepsilon$-far from being a $k$-junta.
  (3) $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits. Nadimpalli et al. (STOC'24) recently showed that the Pauli spectrum of $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits (with a limited number of auxiliary qubits) is concentrated on low-degree. We remark that they implied something stronger, namely that the Choi states of those circuits are close to be juntas. As a consequence, we show that $n$-qubit $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits with size $s$, depth $d$ and $a$ auxiliary qubits can be learned from $2^{O(\log(s^22^a)^d)}\log (n)$ copies of the Choi state, improving the $n^{O(\log(s^22^a)^d)}$ by Nadimpalli et al.</description>
