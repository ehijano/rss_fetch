      <title>Modules over the category of Jacobi diagrams in handlebodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear category $\mathbf{A}$ of Jacobi diagrams in handlebodies was introduced by Habiro and Massuyeau. We study the category of modules over the category $\mathbf{A}$. We generalize the adjunction given by Powell to an adjunction between the category of $\mathbf{A}$-modules and the category of modules over the linear PROP for Casimir Lie algebras by using the category $\mathbf{A}^{L}$ of extended Jacobi diagrams in handlebodies. Then we study subquotient $\mathbf{A}$-modules of $\mathbf{A}(0,-)$.</description>

      <title>The Hom-Ext quiver and applications to exceptional collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study what we call the Hom-Ext quiver and characterize it as a type of 'superquiver'. In type $\widetilde{\mathbb{A}}$, the Hom-Ext quiver of an exceptional set is the tiling algebra of the corresponding geometric model. And, in that case, Hom-Ext quivers classify exceptional sets up to Dehn twist of the corresponding geometric model. We show that these Dehn twists are realized by twist functors and give autoequivalences of the derived category. We provide a generating set for the group of autoequivalences of the derived category in type $\widetilde{\mathbb{A}}$, and show that the Hom-Ext quiver classifies exceptional sets up to derived autoequivalence. We introduce superquivers, which are a generalization of Hom-Ext quivers. Exceptional sets over finite acyclic quivers are realized as representations of superquivers. Throughout, we list several questions and conjectures that make for, what we believe, exciting new research.</description>

      <title>Frieze patterns in representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Friezes are infinite arrays of numbers, in which every four neighbouring vertices arranged in a diamond satisfy the same arithmetic rule. Introduced in the late 1960s by Coxeter, and further studied by Conway and Coxeter in their remarkable papers from 1973, this topic has been nearly forgotten for over thirty years. But since the discovery of connections to cluster algebras and categories of type $A$, interest in friezes has exploded, several generalizations have been studied, and links to geometry and combinatorics have been explored.
  In this article we will review some of the most striking results connecting the purely combinatorially defined friezes with triangulations of polygons, Grassmannian cluster algebras and (Grassmannian) cluster categories. Then we will focus on Grassmannian cluster categories and some recent results linking them to friezes.</description>

      <title>Envelope of Holomorphy of Matsuki Orbits in Complex Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the envelopes of holomorphy of Matsuki orbits $M_{\ell,m,r}$ arising as intersections of $G_0$- and $K$-orbits in complex Grassmannians. These orbits, equipped with natural CR-structures, form a class of compact homogeneous CR-submanifolds whose analytic continuation properties are of fundamental interest. Building on Rossi's theory of holomorphic extension, we establish that the envelope of holomorphy of each Matsuki orbit coincides biholomorphically with the containing $K$-orbit $O_{\ell,m}$. Our approach provides a geometric proof based on the holomorphic fiber bundle structure $\pi : M_{\ell,m,r} \to \mathrm{Gr}_{\ell}(E_+) \times \mathrm{Gr}_{m}(E_-)$, clarifying the role of compact isotropic fibers in constraining holomorphic extension. Explicit examples, including the orbit $M_{1,1,1} \subset \mathrm{Gr}_3(\mathbb{C}^8)$, illustrate the method and highlight connections with classical constructions in complex geometry and representation theory.</description>

      <title>Translation functors, branching problems, and applications to the restriction of coherent cohomology of Shimura varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study properties of the restriction of discrete series representations of $G=U(p,q)$ to $G'= U(p-1,q)$ and the corresponding symmetry breaking operators in $\operatorname{Hom}_{G'}(\pi|_{G'}, \pi')$. This leads to the introduction of elementary and coherent pairs of discrete series representations and their classification. Translations of symmetry breaking operators are defined via tensor products with finite-dimensional representations, which leads to the study of the coherent cohomology of discrete series representations under restriction and translations. This is applied to the study of cup products of coherent cohomology of associated Shimura varieties, and to the arithmetic of central values of certain Rankin--Selberg $L$-functions of $GL(n+1)\times GL(n)$.</description>

      <title>Lattice Models for Double Whittaker Polynomials and Motivic Chern Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will describe solvable lattice models whose partition functions depend on two sets of variables, $x_1,\cdots,x_n$ and $y_1, y_2, \cdots $ that have different connections with the representation theory of $\text{GL}(n,F)$ where $F$ is a nonarchimedean local field. If the boundary conditions are chosen in one way, they are essentially the Motivic Chern classes that were used very effectively by Aluffi, Mihalcea, Sch\"urmann and Su (AMSS) to study such problems. In particular, using this specialization we can obtain deformations $r_{u,v}$ of the Kazhdan-Lusztig R-polynomials that were used by Bump, Nakasuji and Naruse to study matrix coefficients of intertwining operators (introduced by Casselman). Thus we are able see that the recursion formula for the $r_{u,v}$ is a reflection of the Yang-Baxter equation. On the other hand, with more general boundary conditions, specializing the parameters $y_i\to 0$ we recover colored lattice models that were previously used by Brubaker, Buciumas, Bump and Gustafsson to represent Iwahori Whittaker functions on $GL(n,F)$. Thus we term the resulting two-variable-set family of functions as ``double Whittaker polynomials.''</description>

      <title>Equivariant $H\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p$-modules are wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be an arbitrary field of characteristic $p$ and let $G$ be a finite group. We investigate the representation type, derived representation type, and singularity category of the $k$-linear (cohomological) Mackey algebra. We classify when the cohomological Mackey algebra is wild for $G$ a cyclic $p$-group. Furthermore, we show the cohomological Mackey algebra is derived wild whenever $G$ surjects onto a $p$-group of order more than two, and the Mackey algebra is derived wild whenever $G$ is a nontrivial $p$-group.
  Derived wildness has some immediate consequences in equivariant homotopy theory. In particular, for the constant Mackey functor $\underline{k}$, the classification of compact modules over the $G$-equivariant Eilenberg--MacLane spectrum $H\underline{k}$ is also wild whenever $G$ surjects onto a $p$-group of order more than two. Thus, in contrast to recent work at the prime $2$ by Dugger, Hazel, and the second author, no meaningful classification of compact $C_p$-equivariant $H\underline{\mathbb{F}}_p$-modules exists at odd primes. For the Burnside Mackey functor $\underline{A}_k$, there is no classification of compact $G$-equivariant $H\underline{A}_k$-modules whenever $G$ is a nontrivial $p$-group.</description>

      <title>Functor-induced isomorphisms and $G$-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how functor-induced isomorphisms are encoded by $G$-matrices. We first show that the Grothendieck group isomorphism induced by a tilting module can be realized via the $G$-matrix of this tilting module. Building on this, we compare $g$-vectors for a tilted algebra and its associated hereditary algebra, and provide $G$-matrix interpretations of the Coxeter transformation, the Nakayama functor, and the Auslander-Reiten translation for suitable algebras. Furthermore, we demonstrate that every element of any symmetric group and Weyl group can be expressed as the transpose of the $G$-matrix of some tilting module or support $\tau$-tilting module. Finally, we show that the Grothendieck group isomorphism induced by a $2$-term silting complex can also be realized via the $G$-matrix of this $2$-term silting complex.</description>

      <title>Coxeter-Dynkin algebras of canonical type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a definition of Coxeter-Dynkin algebras of canonical type generalising the definition as a path algebra of a quiver. Moreover, we construct two tilting objects over the squid algebra - one via generalised APR-tilting and one via one-point-extensions and reflection functors - and identify their endomorphism algebras with the Coxeter-Dynkin algebra. This shows that our definition gives another representative in the derived equivalence class of the squid algebra, and hence of the corresponding canonical algebra. Finally, we explain how these Coxeter-Dynkin algebras illustrate the connection to Saito's classification of marked extended affine root systems.</description>

      <title>Construction of $d$-abelian categories via derived categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a simple way to construct $d$-abelian categories via bounded derived categories for certain values of $d$. Namely, let ${\mathcal C}$ be an abelian category, and let ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ denote the full subcategory of the bounded derived category of ${\mathcal C}$ whose objects $X$ satisfy that $H_*(X)$ is concentrated in degrees $j$ where $0 \leq j \leq m$. We prove that if ${\mathcal C}$ is hereditary, then ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ is a $d$-abelian category where $d = 3m + 1$.
  Beyond offering a uniform method for constructing $d$-abelian categories, this construction allows us to create $d$-abelian categories that exhibit some unexpected properties depending on the choice of the category ${\mathcal C}$. For instance, if ${\mathcal C}$ is the category of abelian groups, then ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ is a $d$-abelian category which is not $\mathbb{K}$-linear over a field $\mathbb{K}$ but has set indexed products and coproducts. Similarly, if ${\mathcal C}$ is the category of coherent sheaves over certain algebraic curves, then ${\mathcal C}[0,m]$ is a $d$-abelian category without enough injectives.
  We extend our results to $(n+2)$-angulated categories. Namely, let $M$ be an $n$-cluster tilting object over an $n$-representation finite algebra and let ${\mathcal T}$ be the corresponding $(n+2)$-angulated category with $n$-suspension functor $\Sigma_n$. We prove that the full subcategory ${\mathcal T}[0,m] = \mathrm{add} \bigoplus^{m}_{j=0}\Sigma^j_n M$ is a $d$-abelian category where $d = (n+2)(m+1)-2$. Furthermore, we show that there is a bijection between the functorially finite wide subcategories of $\mathrm{add}\,M$ and the functorially finite repetitive wide subcategories of ${\mathcal T}[0,m]$.</description>

      <title>Central values of Asai L-functions and twisted Gan--Gross--Prasad conjecture: relative trace formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study certain new relative trace formulas on (non-reductive) period integrals involving Weil representations, in the context of the relative Langlands program. We study normal representatives using Galois theory, and establish geometric decompositions of relative trace formulas using normal representatives for good test functions. By comparing global representatives, local distributions and orbital integrals, we prove the twisted Gan--Gross--Prasad (GGP) conjecture on Asai L-functions, in any dimension under some local assumptions, allowing ramifications of number fields.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the approach via flipclasses to the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture for Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials of all Coxeter groups. We prove the combinatorial invariance of Kazhdan--Lusztig $\widetilde{R}$-polynomials of Weyl groups modulo $q^7$ and of Kazhdan--Lusztig $\widetilde{R}$-polynomials of type $A$ Weyl groups modulo $q^8$. As a consequence, the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture holds for all intervals up to length 8 in Weyl groups and up to length 10 in type $A$ Weyl groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate invertible projective representations and their 2-categorical analogues using the language of TQFTs with defects. The main result is a freeness property for invertible projective representatios. While trivial in the 1-categorical setting, this result becomes interesting for 2-representations: as an application, only relying only on invertibility of Clifford algebras and Fock bimodules in the Morita 2-category of super vector spaces we recover Ludewig--Roos' result that the Clifford/Fock construction is a projective 2-representation of the category of Lagrangian correspondences.</description>

      <title>Stable Invariants of Words from Random Matrices II: Formulas and Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $w$ be a word in a free group. As was revealed by Magee and Puder in [arXiv:1802.04862], the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices. In the first part of the current work [arXiv:2311.17733], we demonstrated how this phenomenon is much broader: we proved more instances of such results and conjectured others. These new results and conjectures involved other topological invariants (relatives of scl) and different families of groups.
  In the current paper we further extend and support this theory. We provide another instance of the theory and prove that the stable primitivity rank, too, can be expressed in terms of stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements of groups. We introduce concrete formulas for stable Fourier coefficients of $w$-random elements in the symmetric group $S_N$ and its generalizations in the form of the wreath products $G\wr S_N$ where $G$ is an arbitrary compact group. We also define new stable invariants related to these groups, and prove they give bounds to many of the stable Fourier coefficients.
  As an aside, we generalize to tuples of words a result of Puder and Parzanchevski [arXiv:1202.3269] about the expected number of fixed points of $w$-random permutations.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Casimir elements and hook partitions for quantum groups of types B, C and D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The higher-order quantum Casimir elements, introduced by Zhang, Bracken, and Gould in the early 1990s, were conjectured to generate the centre of the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum (super)groups. This was previously confirmed in the classical type A. In this paper we extend the result to the classical types B, C, D, with the additional inclusion of quantum Casimir elements arising from spin and half-spin representations in types B and D. We identify the Harish-Chandra images of these elements and reinterpret them uniformly in terms of irreducible characters associated with hook partitions. This yields explicit and minimal generating sets for the centres in all classical types, and provides new connections between higher-order quantum Casimir elements and hook partitions that exhibit a stability phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Unit Uniquely Clean Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the class of {\it unit uniquely clean} rings ({\it UnitUC} for short), that is a common generalization of uniquely clean rings and strongly nil clean rings. Abelian {\it UnitUC} rings are uniquely clean and {\it UnitUC} rings with nil Jacobson radical are strongly nil clean. These rings also generalize the UUC and CUC rings, defined by Calugareanu-Zhou in Mediterranean J. Math. (2023), which are rings whose clean elements are uniquely clean. These rings are also represent a natural generalization of the Boolian rings in that a ring is {\it UnitUC} if, and only if, it is exchange and Boolean modulo the Jacobson radical. The behavior of {\it UnitUC} rings under group ring and matrix ring extensions is investigated. Several examples are provided to explain and delimit the results.</description>

      <title>A converse theorem for hyperbolic surface spectra and the conformal bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conformal bootstrap in physics has recently been adapted to prove remarkably sharp estimates on Laplace eigenvalues and triple correlations of automorphic forms on compact hyperbolic surfaces. These estimates derive from an infinite family of algebraic equations satisfied by this spectral data. The equations encode $G$-equivariance and associativity of multiplication on $\Gamma \backslash G$, for $\Gamma$ a cocompact lattice in $G = \text{PSL}_2(\mathbf{R})$. The effectiveness of the conformal bootstrap suggests that the equations characterize hyperbolic surface spectra, i.e., that every solution to the equations comes from a compact hyperbolic surface. This paper proves this rigorously with no analytic assumptions on the solution except discreteness of the spectrum. The key intermediate result is an axiomatic characterization of representations of $G$ of the form $L^2(\Gamma \backslash G)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of these notes is to give an overview of several aspects of what has come to be called the relative Langlands program, a theme that takes its origin in the study of automorphic periods and their relations to particular cases of Langlands functoriality and special values of (automorphic) $L$-functions. Following the work of Sakellaridis and Sakellaridis-Venkatesh, we emphasize the unifying role played by spherical varieties and harmonic analysis on them. We also review various instances of the phenomena, discovered by Jacquet, Gan-Gross-Prasad, Ichino-Ikeda and many others, that motivated these developments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine clusters in the cluster tube of rank $n+1$ using exceptional sequences in the abelian tube of rank $n+1$. Although the abelian tube has more exceptional sequences than the module categories of type $B_{n}/C_{n}$, we obtain a bijection between the set of signed exceptional sequences of any length in these categories. This bijection gives a reinterpretation of the formula of Buan-Marsh-Vatne comparing clusters of type $B_n/C_n$ with maximal rigid objects in the cluster tube of rank $n+1$. The bijection passes through the set of "augmented" rooted labeled trees.</description>

      <title>On induced completely prime primitive ideals in enveloping algebras of classical Lie algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A distinguished family of completely prime primitive ideals in the universal enveloping algebra of a reductive Lie algebra ${\mathfrak g}$ over ${\mathbb C}$ are those ideals constructed from one-dimensional representations of finite $W$-algebras. We refer to these ideals as Losev--Premet ideals. For ${\mathfrak g}$ simple of classical type, we prove that for a Losev-Premet ideal $I$ in $U({\mathfrak g})$, there exists a Losev-Premet ideal $I_0$ for a certain Levi subalgebra ${\mathfrak g}_0$ of ${\mathfrak g}$ such that associated variety of $I_0$ is the closure of a rigid nilpotent orbit in ${\mathfrak g}_0$ and $I$ is obtained from $I_0$ by parabolic induction; in turn, this gives a classification of rigid Losev-Premet ideals in $U({\mathfrak g})$. This is deduced from the corresponding statement about one-dimensional representations of finite $W$-algebras.</description>

Abstract: We study linear versions of Reedy categories in relation with finite dimensional algebras and abelian model structures. We prove that, for a linear Reedy category $\mathcal{C}$ over a field, the category of left $\mathcal{C}$--modules admits a highest weight structure, which in case $\mathcal{C}$ is finite corresponds to a quasi-hereditary algebra with an exact Borel subalgebra. We also lift complete cotorsion pairs and abelian model structures to certain categories of additive functors indexed by linear Reedy categories, generalizing analogous results from the hereditary case.</description>

      <title>Vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quasimap vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties. When the quiver varieties have isolated torus fixed points, we compute the coefficients of the vertex functions in the $K$-theoretic fixed point basis. We also give an explicit combinatorial description of zero-dimensional type $D$ quiver varieties and their vertex functions using the combinatorics of minuscule posets. Using Macdonald polynomials, we prove that these vertex functions can be expressed as products of $q$-binomial functions, which proves a degeneration of the conjectured 3d mirror symmetry of vertex functions. We provide an interpretation of type $D$ spin vertex functions as the partition functions of the half-space Macdonald processes of Barraquand, Borodin, and Corwin. This hints that the geometry of quiver varieties may provide new examples of integrable probabilistic models.</description>

      <title>Local models for the trianguline variety and partially classical families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.03823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Breuil-Hellmann-Schraen's local model for the trianguline variety to certain points with non-regular Hodge-Tate weights. With the local models we are able to prove, under the Taylor-Wiles hypothesis, the existence of certain companion points on the global eigenvariety and the appearance of related companion constituents in the completed cohomology for non-regular crystalline Galois representations. The new ingredients in the proof of the global applications are results relating the partial classicality of locally analytic representations (the existence of non-zero locally algebraic vectors in the non-Borel parabolic Emerton's Jacquet modules), the partially de Rham properties of Galois representations (the de Rhamness of graded pieces along the paraboline filtrations of the associated $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over the Robba rings) and the relevant properties of cycles on the generalized Steinberg varieties. We prove that partial classicality implies partial de Rhamness in finite slope cases using Ding's partial eigenvarieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.12436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $Z$ be an l.c.i. scheme over $\mathbb{C}$. In this paper, we introduce a Kashiwara--Schapira-style functor of derived microlocalization, which we use to define a perverse sheaf $\mu_{Z}$ on the $-1$-shifted cotangent bundle, $T^*[-1]Z$. The sheaf $\mu_{Z}$ is designed to be a refinement of the microlocal homology of $Z$: a family of invariants introduced by Nadler that interpolates between the singular cohomology and Borel--Moore homology of $Z$.
  Our main result is an equivalence between $\mu_{Z}$ and the DT sheaf $\varphi_{T^*[-1]Z}$ on $T^*[-1]Z$. This provides an alternative construction for the DT sheaf in the case of a shifted cotangent bundle. The main step of our argument, which may be of independent interest, is a local computation -- closely related to one obtained recently by Kinjo using different methods -- providing a description of the classical microlocalization functor in terms of vanishing cycles.</description>

      <title>LieDetect: Detection of representation orbits of compact Lie groups from point clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest a new algorithm to estimate representations of compact Lie groups from finite samples of their orbits. Different from other reported techniques, our method allows the retrieval of the precise representation type as a direct sum of irreducible representations. Moreover, the knowledge of the representation type permits the reconstruction of its orbit, which is useful for identifying the Lie group that generates the action, from a finite list of candidates. Our algorithm is general for any compact Lie group, but only instantiations for SO(2), T^d, SU(2), and SO(3) are considered. Theoretical guarantees of robustness in terms of Hausdorff and Wasserstein distances are derived. Our tools are drawn from geometric measure theory, computational geometry, and optimization on matrix manifolds. The algorithm is tested for synthetic data up to dimension 32, as well as real-life applications in image analysis, harmonic analysis, density estimation, equivariant neural networks, chemical conformational spaces, and classical mechanics systems, achieving very accurate results.</description>

      <title>Stable Invariants of Words from Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $w$ be a word in a free group. A few years ago, Magee and the first named author discovered that the stable commutator length (scl) of $w$, a well-known topological invariant, can also be defined in terms of certain Fourier coefficients of $w$-random unitary matrices [arXiv:1802.04862]. But the random-matrix side of this equality can be naturally tweaked by considering $w$-random permutations, $w$-random orthogonal matrices and so on, to produce new invariants for any given word. Are these invariants new? interesting? Do they admit an intrinsic topological description as in the case of $w$-random unitaries and scl?
  The current paper formalizes the definition of these invariants coming from $w$-random matrices, answers the above questions in certain cases involving generalized symmetric groups, and poses detailed conjectures in many others. In particular, we present a plethora of topological, combinatorial and algebraic invariants of words which play, or are at least conjectured to play, a similar role to the one played by scl in the above-mentioned result. Among others, these invariants include two invariants recently defined by Wilton [arXiv:2210.09853]: the stable primitivity rank and a non-oriented analog of scl.</description>

Abstract: We study generalised core partitions arising from affine Grassmannian elements in arbitrary Dynkin type. The corresponding notion of size is given by the atomic length in the sense of [CLG22]. In this paper, we first develop the theory for extended affine Weyl groups. In a series of applications, we give some remarkable parametrisations of the solutions of certain Diophantine equations resembling Pell's equation, by refining the results of [BN22] and [Alp14], and generalising them to further types.</description>

Abstract: We study ``change of weights'' maps between loci of the stack of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over the Robba ring with integral Hodge-Tate-Sen weights. We show that in the $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ case these maps can realize translations of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules geometrically. The motivation is to investigate translations of locally analytic representations under the categorical $p$-adic Langlands correspondence.</description>

Abstract: Based on the intrinsic connection between Gaussian Free Fields and the Heisenberg vertex algebra, we study some aspects of the correspondence between probability theory and $W$-algebras. This is first achieved by providing a construction of the $W$-algebra associated to a complex simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ by means of Gaussian Free Fields.
  This correspondence in turn allows to translate algebraic statements into actual constraints for free-field correlation functions. This leads to new integrability results for Dotsenko-Fateev integrals associated to $\mathfrak g$, such as Ward identities and the derivation of a new Fuchsian differential equation for deformations of $B_2$-Dotsenko-Fateev integrals arising from the Mukhin-Varchenko conjecture.
  Along the proof of this statement we also provide new results on representation theory of $W$-algebras such as the description of some singular vectors for the $W$-algebra associated to $\mathfrak g=B_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a formula for computing the size of lower Bruhat intervals for elements in the dominant cone of an affine Weyl group of type $A$. This enumeration problem is reduced to counting lattice points in certain polyhedra. Our main tool is a decomposition -- or tiling -- of each interval into smaller, combinatorially tractable pieces, which we call paper boats. We also conjecture a generalization of this formula to all affine Weyl groups, restricted to elements in the lowest two-sided Kazhdan-Lusztig cell, which contains almost all of the elements.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the special values of Rankin-Selberg L-functions as a continuation of [LLS24]. Utilizing the modular symbol approach, we prove the rationality and period relations for critical values of Rankin-Selberg L-functions for $\mathrm{GL}(n)\times\mathrm{GL}(n)$ over any number field that contains a CM field.</description>

      <title>Quantum carrollian bosonic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a recently discovered carrollian bosonic string, described classically by a sigma model where both the worldsheet and the target spacetime are carrollian. After fixing the carrollian analogue of the conformal gauge, we determine the Lie algebra of residual gauge symmetries and show it is isomorphic to the three-dimensional extended BMS algebra. We quantise the sigma model \`a la BRST and determine the spectrum of the corresponding string theory by computing the BRST cohomology. In contrast with the usual bosonic string, the spectrum of the carrollian string is finite-dimensional. The cohomology displays Poincar\'e duality and can be interpreted, for a given momentum, as inducing representations for unitary irreducible representations of the 26-dimensional Carroll group. Furthermore we interpret (most of) the cohomology as deformations of the spacetime carrollian structure augmented by the Kalb--Ramond field to which the carrollian string couples.</description>
