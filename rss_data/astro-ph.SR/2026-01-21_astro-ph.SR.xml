      <title>Inferring hemispheric asymmetries of stellar active regions through the information content of astrometric signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric light curves suffer from fundamental degeneracies that limit surface information recovery. We demonstrate that astrometry enables access to complementary information through photocentre variations induced by rotating surface features. The forthcoming commissioning of microarcsecond-precision astrometric missions presents an opportunity to improve stellar surface mapping. This paper extends a previous theoretical framework for stellar surface mapping, along three primary directions: (1) we derive analytical selection rules showing that astrometry is sensitive to spherical harmonic modes not detectable via photometry, particularly odd-$\ell$ modes that encode north-south asymmetries; (2) we quantify the information content of combined photometric and astrometric observations, showing that the rank of observable modes grows faster for combined observations than for either technique alone, though the fraction of recoverable modes still decreases asymptotically with increasing spatial resolution; and (3) we reframe astrometric jitter-traditionally treated as noise in exoplanet studies-as a signal encoding stellar surface structure. Given the limited proposed target lists of high-precision astrometric missions, this capability is particularly valuable: understanding host star surfaces is crucial for both removing stellar signals from exoplanet detections and characterising star-planet interactions. We show that while Sun-like stars require sub-microarcsecond precision, evolved stars with angular diameter and larger spots present immediate opportunities with current technology, such as the Gaia mission.</description>

      <title>Using Astrometry to Break Degeneracies in Stellar Surface Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometric jitter noise arises when starspots on a rotating stellar surface move in and out of view, shifting the photocenter. This noise may limit our ability to detect and weigh small, sub-Neptune-sized planets around active stars. By deriving a linear forward model for the astrometric jitter signal of a rotating star in a spherical-harmonic coordinate system, we show that jitter noise can be used to reconstruct surface-brightness maps and, in principle, disentangle jitter from stellar reflex motion due to an orbiting planet. Furthermore, we show that astrometry and photometry probe complementary surface information: photometry measures even-degree spherical harmonic surfaces that are symmetric about the equator, while astrometry measures odd-degree modes. Their joint use, therefore, breaks degeneracies in surface mapping. Our model further quantifies the variation in the astrometric signal with inclination angle, which is foundational for studies of worst-case configurations of astrometric star-spot noise. For example, we show that pole-on stellar inclinations lead to poorly constrained inversions, as any stellar surface produces a purely circular astrometric jitter signal. We characterize the degeneracy in jointly identifying the stellar surface and stellar inclination, and develop a surface estimation approach. Using this approach, we present example simulations and reconstructions that demonstrate the use of astrometry data alongside light-curve data to improve stellar surface mapping and localize spot positions in latitude and longitude. With forthcoming high-precision Gaia astrometry, astrometric surface mapping provides a promising new approach to probe stellar activity.</description>

      <title>Quiet, but not silent. The X-ray activity of the Maunder minimum star HD 166620</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the only known unambiguous star in a Maunder minimum-like chromospheric activity state, the properties of HD 166620 can provide valuable insight into the behaviour of the Sun during the historic extended low-states of its activity cycle. The coronal X-ray activity of HD 166620 has so far only been probed with a ROSAT/HRI observation in 1996, near the chromospheric activity maximum before the star entered its grand minimum around 2004. We conducted a deep {\it XMM-Newton} observation of HD 166620 during its chromospheric Ca II H&amp;K activity grand minimum to achieve a better understanding of its magnetic activity. We detected HD 166620 with an X-ray luminosity of ${{\rm log}\,L_{\rm X}\,\rm{(erg\,s^{-1})}=26.56^{+0.10}_{-0.12}}$, corresponding to ${{\rm log}\,(L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol}) = -6.58^{+0.10}_{-0.12}}$ and an X-ray surface flux of log Fx (erg/cm^2/s) = 3.97+0.10-0.12. With respect to the earlier ROSAT observation, the X-ray brightness of HD 166620 has decreased by a factor of 2.5 during its Maunder minimum-like state. To place its X-ray properties into context, we constructed an X-ray sample of late-type stars within 10 pc of the Sun. The activity of HD 166620 is below the levels of all other K dwarfs in the 10 pc sample. The corona of HD 166620 during its grand minimum emits at the level of the solar background corona, which implies that it has no large active magnetic structures. Along with long-term Ca II H&amp;K monitoring of HD 166620, this result provides evidence that the solar activity during the Maunder minimum was not reduced significantly below the levels seen during its present-day cycle minima. The similar X-ray surface flux of HD 166620 and the modern quiet Sun, and also their Rossby number near the critical value of spin-down models, suggest a connection between the regime of weakened magnetic braking and the occurrence of Maunder minimum states.</description>

      <title>A Dynamo Confinement Scenario for the Solar Tachocline and its Implications for Spin-down in the Radiative Spreading Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the base of the Sun's convective zone, a narrow shear layer called the tachocline separates strong latitudinal differential rotation above from nearly rigid rotation in the radiative zone below. The observed thinness of the tachocline is a long-standing dynamical puzzle because the tachocline should have spread significantly due to inward-burrowing meridional circulation, also called "radiative spreading." We recently presented the first pair of global simulations to reveal a statistically stationary tachocline confined against radiative spreading by the Maxwell stresses from the nonaxisymmetric modes of a dynamo, which penetrated into and below the tachocline through a novel magnetic skin effect. In the work presented here, we systematically examine how this "dynamo confinement scenario" works against radiative spreading in a suite of simulations as the governing parameters trend in the direction of the true solar regime. We find that as the stable stratification of the radiative zone is made progressively stronger, the dynamo cycles get longer, the magnetic field consequently penetrates deeper due to the skin effect, and the tachocline becomes more confined. Furthermore, these results have interesting consequences for solar spin-down. In all of our radiatively spreading simulations, the tachocline region spins down due to the burrowing circulation. Below the tachocline, the Maxwell stresses transmit this spin-down further to rigidify the deeper radiative zone. We thus speculate that, in addition to confining the tachocline, the dynamo may provide a pathway to communicate spin-down from the near-surface layers to the deep interior.</description>

      <title>The identification of new Herbig Ae/Be stars from LAMOST DR7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBes) are critical tracers of intermediate- and high-mass star formation, yet their census remains incomplete compared to low-mass young stellar objects like T-Tauri stars. To expand the known population, we systematically searched for HAeBes in LAMOST DR7 low-resolution spectra. Following Sun et al., we applied Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, identifying $\sim$240,000 spectra with potential H$\alpha$ emission. After removing contaminants (non-stellar objects, extragalactic sources, CVs, and Algol systems) and restricting to B/A-type stars, we obtained 1,835 candidates through 2MASS/WISE visual inspection. Spectral energy distribution analysis confirmed 143 sources with infrared excess ($J$-band or longer wavelengths), including 92 known HAeBes. From the remaining 51 candidates, we classified 26 with strong infrared excess as new HAeBes. Color-index analysis of confirmed HAeBes and classical Ae/Be stars (CAeBes) revealed that the $(K-W1)_0$ vs. $(W2-W3)_0$ diagram effectively separates these populations: CAeBes predominantly occupy $(K-W1)_0 \leq 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 \leq 1.1$, while other regions trace transition disks ($(K-W1)_0 &lt; 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 &gt; 1.1$), globally depleted disks ($(K-W1)_0 &gt; 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 &lt; 1.1$), and Class I/Flat/II HAeBes ($(K-W1)_0 &gt; 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 &gt; 1.1$). More importantly, the HAeBes exhibit a clear evolutionary gradient on this diagram, with those in the Class III, Class II, Flat-SED, and Class I evolutionary stages being effectively distinguished by concentric ellipses that are roughly centered at (0,0) with semi-major axes of $a$=1.5, $a$=3.0, and $a$=4.0, and a semi-major to semi-minor axis ratio of 1.6:1.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the First O-Type Bloated Star Candidate through ALMA and EVLA Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the circumstellar environment of the O-type bloated star candidate IRAS 19520+2759 (I19520) using high-resolution observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA). Radio continuum emission traced by the EVLA (C, K, and Q bands) exhibits a spectral index of 0.5, consistent with a thermal jet. ALMA 1.3 mm continuum map reveals a compact source coincident with the optical counterpart of I19520, likely tracing the dense core hosting the central massive young stellar object. A prominent molecular outflow in the east-west direction, along with a possible secondary outflow oriented northeast-southwest, is identified in the $^{13}\mathrm{CO}$ emission. A hot molecular core and a Keplerian disk are detected in several $\mathrm{SO}_2$ transitions. Assuming an edge-on disk geometry, the dynamical mass of the central object is estimated to be in the range of $10$-$15~M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Evidence of energy conversion in weakly collisional plasma during an interplanetary coronal mass ejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intervals of enhanced turbulent fluctuations are typically less frequent within the magnetic cloud region of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). We investigate two such intervals inside an ICME observed by the \textit{Wind} spacecraft on 8--9 June 2000 and characterize their associated wave populations. We focus on spectral analysis and plasma instability analysis, using ion-scale normalized magnetic helicity and polarization properties with respect to the background magnetic field $B_0$. In the first interval, the ion-scale normalized magnetic helicity shows a left-handed circularly polarized signature. In the second interval, the left-handed signature persists and an additional high-frequency right-handed population appears. The propagation is approximately parallel to $B_0$. The left-handed fluctuations are compatible with Alfv\'en ion-cyclotron (AIC) waves, while the right-handed fluctuations are consistent with fast magnetosonic/whistler (FM/W) waves. The ICME plasma accesses resonance conditions that support multiple ion-scale wave modes. Evolving anisotropies in the plasma and the approach to marginal stability allow the coexistence of AIC-like and fast-magnetosonic/whistler-like fluctuations, with enhanced electron heating favoring the growth of the FM/W contribution and strengthening the density--magnetic-field magnitude correlation.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field detections in massive systems at different stages of interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the importance of magnetic fields in massive stars, their origin is widely debated and still not well understood. With the mounting evidence for the importance of studying magnetic fields in interacting massive binary and multiple systems, it appears necessary to investigate the presence of magnetic fields in semi-detached systems with ongoing mass transfer, and in contact systems where mass is actively being exchanged. We present an analysis of 53 high-resolution HARPSpol spectropolarimetric observations of a sample of 14 massive binary and multiple systems using the least-squares deconvolution technique. The majority of the studied systems are classified as semi-detached or contact binaries. Definite detections of the presence of a magnetic field are achieved in all studied systems apart from the rather faint system SV Cen, for which only a marginal detection was obtained. The fact that the presence of magnetic fields is detected in all but one of the studied systems strongly suggests that interaction between the system components plays a definite role in the generation of magnetic fields in massive stars. The measured mean longitudinal magnetic field strength for all targets is of the order of a few hundred Gauss to a few kiloGauss. The strongest longitudinal magnetic fields of 4 to 5kG are discovered in the massive O-type triple system MY Ser in both components of the contact binary. kiloGauss-order magnetic fields are also detected in two other systems, V1294 Sco and V606 Cen. It is possible that there is an implication of some system characteristics, such as multiplicity, the mass ratio between the components, and a large fillout factor, on the measured magnetic field strength. Our results for the magnetic field measurements in interacting binaries present the first assessment of the occurrence rate of magnetic fields in a representative sample of such systems.</description>

      <title>Clouds and Chemistry Across the Brown Dwarf T-Y Sequence: Insights from JWST Atmospheric Retrievals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offers exceptional spectral resolution and wavelength coverage, which are essential for studying the coldest brown dwarfs, particularly Y dwarfs. These objects are at the cold end of the sub-stellar sequence and exhibit atmospheric phenomena such as cloud formation, chemical disequilibrium, and radiative-convective coupling. We examine a curated sample of 22 late-T to Y dwarfs through Bayesian atmospheric retrieval (nested sampling) and supervised machine learning (random forests). Bayesian model comparison indicates that cloud-free models are generally favored for the hottest objects in the sample (T6-T8). Conversely, later-type dwarfs exhibit varying preferences, with both gray-cloud and cloud-free models providing comparable fits. The atmospheric parameters retrieved are consistent across the applied methodologies. Evidence of vertical mixing and disequilibrium chemistry is found in several objects; notably, the Y1 dwarf WISEPAJ1541-22 favors a gray cloud model and shows elevated abundances of both CO and CO2 compared to equilibrium chemistry calculations. As anticipated, the abundances of H2O, CH4, and NH3 increase with decreasing effective temperature over the T-Y sequence.</description>

      <title>LAMOST J113208.06-005052.3 and LAMOST J052957.56+344127.0: two new binaries with a hot white dwarf and a flaring companion star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binaries contain rich physical information, and the study of binaries has always been a hot topic in stellar physics research. The stars LAMOST J1132 and LAMOST J0529 have not yet been recorded in the SIMBAD astronomical database. We have investigated their physical properties via methods such as spectral analysis, photometric analysis, and light curve analysis. Based on comprehensive analysis, we conclude that they are two newly discovered binary systems, each consisting of a hot white dwarf and a flaring companion star. Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) spectra indicate that both stars contain hot white dwarfs. The spectral fitting yields $T_{eff}$=53728$\pm$2467\,K, log$g$=7.98$\pm$0.08 for LAMOST J1132, and $T_{eff}$=47381$\pm$494\,K, log$g$=7.84$\pm$0.05 for LAMOST J0529. The weak neutral metal lines in the LAMOST spectra and the discrepancy between the Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics (GAIA) and LAMOST spectra both indicate that these two sources are likely binary systems. The relatively high flux values for both sources in the near-infrared and mid-infrared bands support our preliminary judgment. The color index in the near-infrared bands suggests that the companion star is K or M type for LAMOST J1132 and M type for LAMOST J0529. Light curve data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) indicate that the companion stars of both sources are stars exhibiting flare activity. The eclipse probability is very low, indicating that these two sources are non-eclipsing binary systems. The physics of binaries is fascinating, and future data from LAMOST Medium Resolution Spectra are expected to enable the detection of magnetic fields in these two hot white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Optical Continuum Light Curves and Bolometric Energy Estimates of Solar White-light Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar white-light flares (WLFs) are solar flares exhibiting enhanced emission in the optical continuum. They are critical for understanding energy release and transport mechanisms in solar flares and for conducting comparative studies with stellar WLFs. However, the scarcity of accurately and reliably measured optical continuum light curves for solar WLFs significantly hampers related studies. Based on the optimized solar WLF identification method, we construct a dataset of optical continuum light curves for 70 solar WLFs using 6173 {\AA} continuum intensity images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Moreover, for each solar WLF event, we also provide the location of the white-light emission enhancement signals and key parameters including bolometric energies and durations derived from both the traditional fixed-temperature blackbody model and the refined variable-temperature blackbody model. This dataset will serve as a valuable resource for future statistical investigations of solar WLFs and for comparative studies between solar and stellar flares.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic Effect on Convective Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The systematic analysis of non-adiabatic effect on convective mode has been conducted using wave energy relation. In the adiabatic analysis, the "propagation diagram" for convective mode is proposed as a useful tool to see its behavior. In the non-adiabatic analysis, it is found that for strongly non-adiabatic case, a monotonically growing convective mode becomes oscillatory. In this phase, the radial displacement and the distribution of wave energy show only one bump, in which the distribution of entropy energy eS almost overlaps with the distribution of gravity energy eg. Entropy energy eS seems to act as potential energy of oscillatory convection. In addition to this, this change occurs not gradually, but abruptly with change of non-adiabatic indicator.</description>

      <title>Testing Red Clump Models with the Asteroseismic Binary KIC 10841730</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binaries in which both stars are pulsating are rare but extremely valuable. We present the first study of an asteroseismic binary system consisting of a core helium-burning red clump (RC) star and a red giant branch (RGB) star. The Kepler target KIC 10841730 is a wide binary (period $2917 \pm 8$ d) that provides ideal conditions to test the accuracy of RC models. While prior studies of RC stars have revealed discrepancies in modelling the period spacings of mixed modes, other model parameters remain largely untested. We perform a detailed modelling analysis using individual mode frequencies and cover a large parameter space in mass, metallicity, He-abundance, mixing length, overshooting, and mass-loss, and we also explore different methods to correct for surface effects. We find two possible results for the red clump models. One solution requires introducing an unexpected offset of the phase shift in the red clump model, yielding an age consistent with the companion star and current masses of $1.01 \pm 0.06$ and $1.08 \pm 0.06$ M$_\odot$ for the RC and RGB star, respectively. Alternatively, we find that excluding the identification of two questionable radial modes resolves the phase-shift offset issue but results in a higher mass and thus a much younger age for the red clump star, contradicting the age obtained from its companion. We conclude that uncertainties in red clump models affect not only the g-mode period spacings but also the properties of the p modes. We show the power of asteroseismic binaries in validating and constraining stellar models and highlight the need for refining red-clump models.</description>

      <title>Classical Be Stars and Classical Be Star Binaries from LAMOST DR12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Be (CBe) stars are rapidly rotating B-type stars with Balmer emission lines that originated from the decretion disks surrounding them in their spectra. Accounting for $\sim$20% of all B-type stars, most CBe stars are thought to form through mass and angular momentum transfer from their companions. It follows that in most close CBe star binaries, the companions are expected to be post-main-sequence stars rather than main-sequence (MS) stars. Hitherto, $\sim$100 CBe star binaries have been identified, the majority of which are Be/X-ray binaries. As expected, none of the others have indeed been confirmed as CBe+MS binary stars. To further study and verify the origin of CBe stars, identifying additional CBe star binaries is indispensable. In this study, we report 504 CBe stars identified using data from Data Release 12 of the Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope. Among these, 141 are newly identified and 14 exhibiting radial velocity variations are identified as CBe star binaries. Besides, 60 CBe stars with high normalized unit weight error (RUWE) but not confirmed by dynamics are proposed as potential CBe star binaries. We also find that 34 CBe stars are potential cluster members. By calculating peculiar velocities, 37 runaway stars are identified with peculiar velocities ranging from $\sim$40 km s$^{-1}$ to $\sim$101 km s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Identification of false positive double-lined spectroscopic binaries in LAMOST-MRS data due to moonlight contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for identifying false positive double-lined spectroscopic binary (SB2) candidates by analysing medium-resolution survey spectra from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) DR10. Specifically, we focus on spectra contaminated by moonlight, which exhibit near-zero radial velocity (RV) and solar-like spectral lines from the secondary component. By applying strict constraints on the contamination parameters and fitting the contaminated spectra, we ultimately confirmed that 126 false positive binaries are single stars contaminated by moonlight. Additionally, we identify several key factors contributing to moonlight contamination: the lunar phase during observation, the G-band magnitude of the star, and the angular distance between the star and the moon. Notably, artificial satellites in low-orbital can also introduce contamination from solar-like spectral components, but they typically display significantly higher transverse velocities. In a follow-up study, we will expand our analysis to identify additional false positive SB2 systems and systematically classify them according to their contamination sources.</description>

      <title>Project FOSSO I: Fates of the Known BDs in MS-BD Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Understanding the survival and orbital evolution of brown dwarf (BD) companions during the post-main-sequence (MS) evolution of their host stars is increasingly important, especially with recent discoveries of many substellar companions around white dwarfs (WDs). Aims. We investigate the long-term evolution and final outcomes of BDs orbiting low-mass MS stars as these evolve into WDs. By comparing forward-modeling populations with observed WD-BD binaries, we test evolutionary models and predict the existence of yet-undetected systems. Methods. We employ the COMPAS binary population synthesis code to evolve observed MS-BD systems through the post-MS phases of their host stars into the WD stage, tracking orbital changes driven by mass loss, tides, and common-envelope (CE) evolution. Results. Our simulations reproduce a period gap in the distribution of detached WD-BD binaries, consistent with observations. We also identify a boundary separating detached and semi-detached systems on the period-mass diagram, located at orbital periods of $\sim$1-2 hours depending on the BD mass. Conclusions. We predict that a subset of currently known MS-BD binaries will survive post-MS evolution and emerge as detached WD-BD systems, while others will undergo CE evolution and potentially form cataclysmic variables with BD donors. Our results reproduce the observed period gap in WD-BD binaries and provide quantitative predictions for the role of CE efficiency in shaping their distribution. This work predicts that many WD-BD systems remain undetected, motivating targeted searches with microlensing and high-contrast imaging techniques using next-generation large telescopes.</description>

      <title>BE Lyncis: An Extremely Eccentric Binary with the Nearest Known Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an exceptionally eccentric binary system, BE Lyncis (BE Lyn), which hosts the nearest known black hole (BH) to Earth. Through the analysis of $\textit{TESS}$ photometry combined with an extensive set of times of maximum light spanning 39 years, we identify BE Lyn as a high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti star in a binary with an orbital period of $\approx15.9$ years and an extraordinary orbital eccentricity of $e=0.9989^{+0.0008}_{-0.0021}$ ($&gt;0.9968$ at 95% confidence) -- the highest reliably measured for any binary system. Dynamical constraints impose an upper limit on the orbital inclination of $i \lesssim 4.0^{\circ}$, corresponding to a companion mass of $M_2 \gtrsim 17.5~M_{\odot}$, which unequivocally favors a black hole. This system provides a unique laboratory for studying asteroseismology in strong gravitational fields, the formation of black holes via asymmetric supernovae, and the evolution of extreme binary systems. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, the successful application of the light-travel time effect in a pulsating variable to unveil a dormant black hole, establishing a novel method for BH detection in non-interacting binaries.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Continuum Intensity for Solar Active Region Emergence Prediction using Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of solar active region (AR) emergence is crucial for space weather forecasting. Building on established Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based approaches for forecasting the continuum intensity decrease associated with AR emergence, this work expands the modeling with new architectures and targets. We investigate a sliding-window Transformer architecture to forecast continuum intensity evolution up to 12 hours ahead using data from 46 ARs observed by SDO/HMI. We conduct a systematic ablation study to evaluate two key components: (1) the inclusion of a temporal 1D convolutional (Conv1D) front-end and (2) a novel `Early Detection' architecture featuring attention biases and a timing-aware loss function. Our best-performing model, combining the Early Detection architecture without the Conv1D layer, achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.1189 (representing a 10.6% improvement over the LSTM baseline) and an average advance warning time of 4.73 hours (timing difference of -4.73h), even under a stricter emergence criterion than previous studies. While the Transformer demonstrates superior aggregate timing and accuracy, we note that this high-sensitivity detection comes with increased variance compared to smoother baseline models. However, this volatility is a necessary trade-off for operational warning systems: the model's ability to detect micro-changes in precursor signals enables significantly earlier detection, outweighing the cost of increased noise. Our results demonstrate that Transformer architectures modified with early detection biases, when used without temporal smoothing layers, provide a high-sensitivity alternative for forecasting AR emergence that prioritizes advance warning over statistical smoothness.</description>

      <title>SolARED: Solar Active Region Emergence Dataset for Machine Learning Aided Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of accurate forecasts of solar eruptive activity has become increasingly important for preventing potential impacts on space technologies and exploration. Therefore, it is crucial to detect Active Regions (ARs) before they start forming on the solar surface. This will enable the development of early-warning capabilities for upcoming space weather disturbances. For this reason, we prepared the Solar Active Region Emergence Dataset (SolARED). The dataset is derived from full-disk maps of the Doppler velocity, magnetic field, and continuum intensity, obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). SolARED includes time series of remapped, tracked, and binned data that characterize the evolution of acoustic power of solar oscillations, unsigned magnetic flux, and continuum intensity for 50 large ARs before, during, and after their emergence on the solar surface, as well as surrounding areas observed on the solar disc between 2010 and 2023. The resulting ML-ready SolARED dataset is designed to support enhancements of predictive capabilities, enabling the development of operational forecasts for the emergence of active regions. The SolARED dataset is available at https://sun.njit.edu/sarportal/, through an interactive visualization web application.</description>

      <title>Time variations of the mean magnetic flux in active regions of different magneto-morphological classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a recently suggested magneto-morphological classification (MMC, Abramenko, 2021, MNRAS Vol 507) of solar active regions (ARs), we explored 3048 ARs, observed from12 May 1996 to 27 December 2021. Magnetograms were acquired with the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).
  ARs were separated between three classes: class A - regular ARs (bipoles which follow the empirical rules compatible with the mean field dynamo theory); class B - irregular ARs (``wrong'' bipoles and multipolars); class U - unipolar sunspots. An aim of the present study is to explore time variations of a typical unsigned magnetic flux of ARs of different classes. The typical flux was acquired as the mean flux over all ARs of a given class observed during one solar rotation. The time profiles of the mean fluxes for different classes were compared.
  We found that, except for periods of deep solar minima, the mean flux of B-class ARs always dominate that of A-class ARs, and, what is the most important, the time profile of B-class ARs is highly intermittent versus the rather smooth and quazi-constant A-class profile. Intermittency implies a direct involvement of turbulence.
  We conclude that, through the entire active phase, the Sun is capable of producing regular moderate ARs at a quazi-constant rate along with the production of large and complex irregular ARs in the very intermittent manner. The result is the first observational evidence for the long-standing speculative assumption on the involvement of the convection zone turbulence into the regular global dynamo-process on a stage of the active regions formation.</description>

      <title>The Relationship between Accretion and Ionised Ejection among Young Stellar Objects in the Coronet Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from a coordinated, multi-epoch near-infrared and centimeter radio survey of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Coronet, aimed at probing the connection between mass accretion and ionised mass loss. Using VLT-KMOS, we detect Br$\gamma$ emission in 5 of the 26 targets, which also exhibit 3.3-cm continuum emission in VLA images, consistent with partially ionised jets. For seven additional sources, stringent flux upper limits were obtained. The derived accretion and ionised mass-loss rates for class I and class II YSOs follow a sublinear correlation $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{ion}} \propto \dot{M}_{\mathrm{acc}}^{0.3}$, consistent with previous results for class II YSOs but extended here to earlier stages. Multi-epoch observations reveal modest variability in both tracers but no clear temporal correlation between accretion and ejection within timescales of a few months. The ratio $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{ion}}/\dot{M}_{\mathrm{acc}}$ shows an anti-correlation with $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{acc}}$, increasing with time from class I YSOs to class II YSOs, suggesting an increase in jet-launching efficiency or ionisation fraction with evolution. These findings support a direct connection between accretion and outflow across the $\sim$ Myr timescale of YSO evolution, while highlighting the complexity of their short-term interplay.</description>

      <title>HD 26172: an active solar-type subgiant in a close binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the RS CVn system HD 26172, robustly determining the previously debated evolutionary state of its primary star. Since this system is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with spot-induced light curve modulations, we derived its physical parameters by combining the TESS light curves, the radial velocity curve from our observations, and the primary-star mass estimates based on three complementary methods.Our results reveal that HD 26172 is a detached binary system composed of a $1.25 \pm 0.32 M_{\odot}$ subgiant and a $0.63 \pm 0.11 M_{\odot}$ main-sequence star. The conclusion of subgiant primary is also supported by the absence of lithium absorption and no observed infrared excess. Using long-term photometry from the KWS survey, we detected a tentative stellar activity cycle of 5635 days with an amplitude of 0.04 mag in HD 26172. Additionally, we identified ten optical flare events exhibiting temporally clustered outburst behavior. The presence of a long-term activity cycle, pronounced starspot activity, and frequent optical flares makes HD 26172 a valuable laboratory for studying magnetic activity in subgiants within close binary systems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional properties of a coronal shock and the longitudinal distribution of its related solar energetic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to investigate the relationship between the spatial-temporal evolution of shock properties and the longitudinal dependence of SEP intensities and spectra. The shock parameters, including the normal speed, oblique angles, compression ratio, and Alfven Mach number, were derived by combining a steady-state solar-wind simulation with the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the shock surface based on multi-view observations. We compared the local shock parameters at the magnetic connecting points with in situ proton intensities and peak spectra to establish the link between shock evolution and SEP characteristics. The shock nose consistently exhibited higher particle-acceleration efficiency with the largest normal speed, compression ratio, and supercritical Alfven Mach number, while the flanks showed delayed transition to supercritical Alfven Mach number with weaker efficiency. The earliest and most rapid proton enhancement of STEREO-B correlated with efficient shock acceleration and prompt magnetic connectivity to the shock. Spectral analysis revealed that proton energy spectra were consistent with the relativistic diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) estimations. The initial shock acceleration began at about 1.4-5 Rsun and caused the widespread longitudinal SEP distribution. The longitudinal dependence of SEP intensity and spectral variations arise from the combined influence of 3D shock properties, magnetic connectivity, and particle transport processes. The agreement between in situ proton indices and relativistic DSA estimations supports DSA in this SEP event and provides insights into the early-stage acceleration at the source region.</description>

      <title>Follow-up of three exocomet-host candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exocomets are small bodies that evaporate when they approach their host star. They are detected through variability of non-photospheric features with spectroscopy and/or asymmetric transits in time-series photometry. In the past four decades ~30 systems have shown such variations, and were therefore classified as exocomet host stars. However, some publications have pointed out mechanisms that might mimic exocometary features, and therefore, careful monitoring is needed to confirm the origin of the observed variability. With this paper we aim to investigate the exocomet nature of the non-photospheric variable features observed in the exocomet candidate stars HD 36546, HD 42111 and HD 85905. All of them have shown some degree of variability, particularly in their Ca II K line. We analysed the non-photospheric Ca II K line features from high-resolution spectra obtained using new NOT/FIES and Mercator/HERMES, and some additional archival spectra of the target stars. The variability was quantified through the changes in the equivalent widths of those features, which are assumed to be of circumstellar origin. Column densities were also estimated for each variable feature. Strong variability was found for HD 85905, consistent with a potential link to exocometary activity. However, the binarity of the system, which we confirmed through interferometric VLTI/PIONIER observations, complicates the interpretation of these signatures and prevents us from drawing definitive conclusions. The remaining two sources do not show any significant variability, but due to the sporadic nature of the exocometary events, we cannot discard the exocomet hypothesis. Further monitoring of the stars will be necessary to carry out a robust determination of the variability patterns and timescales that would completely rule out other scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Asteroseismology is widely used for precise determining of masses of solar-like oscillating stars by performing individual-frequency modeling or applying homological scaling relations. However, these methods lack dynamical validation on the main sequence due to the absence of eclipsing double-lined binary system (SB2) as benchmark objects. By providing the orbital inclination, astrometric binary systems from ESA Gaia DR3 offer an abundant alternative for eclipsing systems. We present KIC693187 as the first SB2, hosting a solar-like oscillating post-main-sequence star with dynamical masses. By combining Gaia astrometry with spectroscopic obtained with the Las Cumbres Observatory network (LCO), we find $M_1^\mathrm{dyn}$=0.99$\pm$0.05$M_\odot$ and $M_2^\mathrm{dyn}$=0.89$\pm$0.04$M_\odot$ for the primary and secondary, respectively. Asteroseismic parameters were extracted from photometry of the NASA \Kepler satellite. The mass from individual frequency modeling is $M_1^\mathrm{IF}$=0.92$\pm$0.01$M_\odot$. Taking into account the systematic uncertainty of 0.04$M_\odot$ for best fit models from individual frequency fitting, we find an agreement within 1.2$\sigma$. From scaling relations we obtain a mass range of 0.93 to 0.98$M_\odot$ by using the observed large frequency separations (\dnu) in the scaling relations for the primary. By using standard corrections for departures from the asymptotic regime of \dnu, we obtained a mass range of 0.83 to 1.03$M_\odot$. The upper ends of both ranges agree well with the dynamical mass of the primary. This approach provides the first empirical validation for main-sequence solar-like oscillators and opens a new window for validating asteroseismology. Through a dedicatded program targeting astrometric SB2 binary systems, ESA's PLATO space mission will provide will enlarge the benchmark sample substantially.</description>

      <title>The [Fe XIII] Infrared 10747 Angstrom and 10798 Angstrom Lines in Novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forbidden lines of [Fe XIII] at 10,747 Angstrom and 10,798 Angsrtom are among the most prominent lines in the near-infrared spectrum of the solar corona. They have been used routinely, both outside and during eclipses, as sensitive probes of the electron density and polarization in the solar corona. Many novae pass through a coronal phase, wherein the highly ionized nova ejecta have physical conditions that are remarkably similar to those of the solar corona. Many of the coronal emission lines that are seen are common to the spectra of both the Sun and novae. Yet, it appears that no robust detection of the [Fe XIII] lines has been made in a nova. Here we report the detection of these two infrared [Fe XIII]lines in the spectrum of the recurrent nova V3890 Sgr, taken 23.43 and 31.35 days after its August 2019 outburst. From their line strengths, we derive values of 10^10 per cubic cm and 10^[8.5-9] per cubic cm for the electron density on the two. The decrease in density between epochs can be explained if the density decreased with a power law n ~ r**alpha with a alpha inferred to be -3. The average temperature of the coronal gas is estimated to be T = (2.51\pm0.06) x 10^6~K. We find that recurrent novae with giant secondaries, including T CrB whose eruption is imminent, are the most suitable sources for further detections of the [Fe XIII] lines. epochs.</description>

      <title>Hedorah, the first yellow supergiant Kaiju star candidate at $z\approx3$ revealed by behind AS1063</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new free-form lens model for the $z=0.348$ galaxy cluster AS1063, based on previously spectroscopically confirmed lensed galaxies and new images from the GLIMPSE program. We use the ultra-deep data to identify new counterimages for previously confirmed (spectroscopically) lensed systems. We use the full set of spectroscopically confirmed systems to derive a new lens model, which is later used to confirm many of the previous lensed system candidates and discover new lensed system candidates in the images. We compute the geometric redshifts, time delays, and magnification for all counterimages (confirmed and not confirmed). Among the new systems we find a peculiar multiply lensed galaxy with a strong emission line at $\approx 4\, \mu$m that likely corresponds to H$-\beta$ and/or OIII at $z\approx 7.5$. This galaxy could be a little-red-dot or an extreme emission line galaxy. We also identify a yellow supergiant lensed star candidate at $z\approx 3.1$. This star shows some similarities with previous Kaiju stars and we nickname it "Hedorah", in honor of the famous yellow-eyed Kaiju. Previous lensed stars at $z&gt;0.1$ are either blue supergiants or red supergiants, making Hedorah the first yellow supergiant discovered beyond $z=0.1$ and confirming that, despite their rarity, they can also be found at these redshifts. Since many Cepheid stars are yellow supergiants, we consider the possibility that Hedorah could also be the first Cepheid discovered at cosmological distances, but we conclude that Hedorah is more likely a hypergiant yellow star approaching the end of its life. Alternatively, Hedorah could be a small group of stars, although this is less likely based on Hedorah's peculiar colors and additionally may require the more exotic fuzzy dark matter to help explain the lack of counterimage.</description>

      <title>The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) IV: CO gas imaging and overview</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CO gas is detected in a significant number of debris discs, but its origin and evolution remains unclear. Key constraints are its mass and spectro-spatial distribution, which are coupled through optical depth and have only been analysed at low to moderate resolution so far. The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) is the first ALMA large program to target debris discs at high spectro-spatial resolution. We used $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO J=3-2 line data of 18 ARKS debris belts, 5 of which were already known to host gas, to analyse the spectro-spatial distribution of CO, constrain the gas masses, and to search for gas in the remaining systems. We developed a line-imaging pipeline and produced line cubes for each disc, with a spatial resolution down to $\sim$70 mas and spectral resolution of 26 m s$^{-1}$. Using spectro-spatial shifting and stacking, we produced high signal-to-noise maps, and radial and spectral profiles that reveal the distribution and kinematics of gas in 5 gas-bearing discs. For these discs, we constrained the inner radius of the $^{12}$CO, and found the radial brightness profile of CO peaked interior to the dust ring, but that CO was more radially extended than the dust. We present the first radially resolved $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO isotopologue flux ratios in gas-bearing debris discs, which are constant with radius for the majority of systems, indicating $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO are both optically thick or thin throughout the discs. We report CO line fluxes/upper limits for all systems and optical depth dependant masses for the 5 gas-bearing systems. Finally, we analysed the $^{12}$CO J=3-2 line luminosities for the ARKS debris discs and discs from the literature. We confirm that gas is mostly detected in young systems. However, the high scatter seen in young/high fractional luminosity systems indicates no trend within the systems with detected gas.</description>

      <title>Increased and Varied Radiation during the Sun's Encounters with Cold Clouds in the last 10 million years</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research raises the possibility that 3 and 7 million years ago, the Sun encountered massive clouds that shrank the heliosphere--the solar cocoon protecting our solar system--exposing Earth to its interstellar environment, in agreement with geological evidence from 60Fe and 244Pu isotopes. Here we show that during such encounters Earth was exposed to increased radiation in the form of high-energy particles. During periods of Earth's immersion in the heliosphere, it received particle radiation that we name Heliospheric Energetic Particles (HEPs). The intensity of &lt; 10 MeV protons was at least an order of magnitude more intense than today's most extreme solar energetic particle (SEP) events. SEPs today last minutes to hours, but HEP exposure then lasted for extensive periods of several months, making it a prolonged external driver. During Earth's excursion outside the heliosphere, it was exposed to a galactic cosmic ray radiation with the intensity of &lt; 1 GeV protons at least an order of magnitude more intense than today. Therefore, the space surrounding Earth was permeated by a variable high-energy radiation. We discuss the implications for Earth's climate and biodiversity.</description>

      <title>Timing analysis of a sample of five cataclysmic variable candidates observed by the XMM-Newton satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermediate polars are a class of cataclysmic variables in which a white dwarf accretes material from a companion star. The intermediate polar nature confirmation usually derives from the detection of two periods in both $X$-ray and optical photometry. In this respect, the high energy signal is often characterized by modulations on the white dwarf spin and the orbital period. However, noting that the periodograms may be characterized by strong features also at the synodic period and/or other sidebands, the timing analysis of the $X$-ray signal may offer the unique possibility to firmly discover an intermediate polar candidate. Here, we concentrate on a sample of five cataclysmic variable {binary} candidates: {i.e. SAXJ1748.2-2808, 1RXS J211336.1+542226, CXOGC J174622.7-285218, CXOGC J174517.4-290650, and V381 Vel, listed in the IPHome catalogue. Our main aim is to confirm if they belong to the intermediate polar class or not. The results of our analysis show that we can safely assess the intermediate polar nature of all the considered sources, apart for the case of V381 Vel which instead behaves like a cataclysmic variable of the polar subclass. Moreover, the source SAXJ1748.2-2808, previously classified as a HMXB, appears to be, most likely, an intermediate polar variable.</description>

      <title>Reconciling the Systemic Kicks of Observed Millisecond Pulsars, Spider Pulsars, and Low-mass X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) have been proposed as evolutionary products of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) through a stage in which they are spider pulsars (i.e., redbacks and black widows). However, recent work has found that the systemic kicks of observed MSPs are significantly lower than the kicks of LMXBs and spiders, which appears to be in tension with this evolutionary model. We argue that this tension can be relieved, at least to some degree, by considering the fact that the observed MSPs are located at relatively short distances, whereas spider pulsars are located at greater distances and LMXBs are situated even further away. We model the distance-dependent kinematic bias for dynamically old objects, which favors observing objects that have received low kicks at short distances and correct the observed systemic kicks for this bias. We find that this kinematic bias can be big enough to close the gap between the MSP and LMXB kicks, although the spider pulsars appear to come from a slightly different systemic kick distribution, but this difference is not necessarily physical. All corrected systemic kick distributions are consistent with predictions from binary population synthesis for progenitor systems with a post-supernova orbital period of $P_{\text{orb}}\leq10\,$d and a companion mass of $M_{c}\leq1\,M_{\odot}$, where the natal kicks are calibrated to the velocities of young isolated pulsars. We conclude that the difference in observed systemic kicks is not necessarily in tension with a common origin for MSPs, spider pulsars, and LMXBs.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the exoplanet radius valley with host stars from SWEET-Cat</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radius valley,a deficit of planets near 2 $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$, was observed among exoplanets of radius $\lesssim$ 5 $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ with periods $&lt;$ 100 days by NASA's $Kepler$ mission. It separates super-Earths (rocky, $\lesssim 1.9$ $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$) from sub-Neptunes (volatile-rich, $\gtrsim 2$ $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$) and may arise from formation conditions or atmospheric loss. Disentangling these mechanisms has led to numerous studies of population-level trends, although the resulting interpretations remain sensitive to sample selection and the robustness of host-star parameters. We re-examine its existence, depth, and dependence on period, flux, stellar mass, and age. Using SWEET-Cat and MAISTEP tool, we derived stellar parameters for 1,221 main-sequence stars (1,405 planets), with effective temperatures 4400--7500 K and radii 0.62--2.75 $\mathrm{R_{\odot}}$, achieving 2\% precision in radius and mass. Planetary radii were recomputed from radius ratios, yielding 5\% median uncertainty. The valley is partially filled near 2 $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ and depends on period, flux, and stellar mass, with slopes $-0.12^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$, $0.10^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$, and $0.19^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$. Sub-Neptunes show a stronger stellar mass-dependent trend than super-Earths ($0.17^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ vs $0.11^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$). With stellar age, the super-Earth/sub-Neptune ratio rises from $0.51^{+0.11}_{-0.08}$ ($&lt;3$ Gyr) to $0.64^{+0.11}_{-0.11}$ ($\gtrsim3$ Gyr), and the valley becomes shallower and shifts to larger radii. A 4D fit shows consistent slopes with 2D analyses and a weaker age trend ($0.07^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$). These results suggest prolonged atmospheric loss, which is consistent with a core-powered mass loss scenario and emphasize the need for improved determinations, a goal expected to be achieved by future missions like PLATO.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $^7$Be Weak and Radiative Transition Rates in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: Implications for the Primordial Lithium Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primordial 7Li abundance predicted by standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) exceeds that inferred from old, metal-poor stars by a factor of about 3-4. In standard BBN, most primordial 7Li is produced as 7Be in the early Universe and later converted by electron capture. Additional production or destruction channels of 7Be, such as proton capture or antineutrino capture during BBN, may therefore affect the final lithium yield. We quantify the depletion of 7Be due to in-situ electron capture, including the associated antineutrino channel, positron decay from nuclear excited states, and proton capture through the radiative 7Be(p,gamma)8B reaction. We also investigate stimulated emission induced by the dense photon background during the nuclear statistical equilibrium epoch, as well as a three-body Auger-like variant transferring the capture energy to a continuum electron. Decay rates are computed using first-order perturbation theory, modelling weak interactions with a Fermi contact term and factorising hadronic and leptonic currents. Thermally averaged rates are obtained by folding cross-sections with Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions and accounting for particle densities in the temperature range 10-100 keV. We find that the electron-capture rate decreases rapidly with temperature and is significantly enhanced by the inclusion of the antineutrino channel. Stimulated emission and plasma screening increase the radiative proton-capture rate by only 1-3 percent at temperatures around 87 keV. The Auger-like channel contributes at the level of a few thousandths of a percent and becomes negligible at lower temperatures. Overall, our total rate revises previous estimates by nearly an order of magnitude. Electron capture, proton capture, and positron decay provide corrections to the dominant depletion channel 7Be(n,p)7Li.</description>

      <title>Plasmoid formation via competing lower-hybrid drift and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities: A hybrid kinetic-gyrokinetic simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear formation of plasmoids in 2D low-beta current sheets through the interplay between the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) and the lower-hybrid drift instability (LHDI). Using a hybrid kinetic-gyrokinetic model-based Super Simple Vlasov (ssV) code with fully kinetic ions and drift-kinetic electrons, we simulate Harris-type current sheets and velocity shear layers with strong cross-field density gradients. Our central hypothesis is that steep density gradients drive LHDI, which can grow faster than KHI and initiate an inverse cascade from kinetic to fluid scales, potentially suppressing KHI. Our simulations confirm that, in thin current sheets, LHDI develops rapidly at the sheet edges and nonlinearly merges into larger-scale magnetic islands before KHI can evolve. These LHDI-driven structures distort the velocity shear and suppress classical KH vortices. In contrast, for thicker current sheets or weaker density gradients, KHI dominates and produces the expected rolled-up vortices and associated plasmoids. These findings demonstrate that LHDI-induced turbulence can act as both a seed and a regulator of plasmoid-generating instabilities, mediating cross-scale energy transfer. This mechanism is relevant to thin boundary layers in space plasmas, such as the solar wind magnetosphere interface, and suggests that microturbulence can govern large-scale magnetic topology during collisionless reconnection.</description>

      <title>Antarctic Infrared Binocular Telescope: Early Data Release of observations in the 1.4 {\mu}m water-vapor-absorption band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-based observations around 1.4 $\mu$m are normally limited by strong absorption of telluric water-vapor. However, Dome A, Antarctica has exceptionally dry conditions that offer a unique opportunity for observations in this band. We designed a new filter covering 1.34--1.48 $\mu$m, namely $W'$, and installed it on the Antarctic Infrared Binocular Telescope (AIRBT) at Dome A in 2025. AIRBT comprises two identical 15 cm optical tube assemblies and two InGaAs cameras equipped with $J$ and $W'$ filters, respectively. With this Early Data Release (EDR), we aim to evaluate the performance of the $W'$ band at Dome A to observe objects with water-vapor features. This EDR covers $\thicksim 20 \ \mathrm{deg^2}$ in the Galactic plane using $\thicksim 20,000$ images in three nights. For 2 s exposures, the 5 $\sigma$ limiting magnitude histogram peaks at $J \thicksim 11.5$ mag (Vega) and $W' \thicksim 9.9$ mag, respectively. The $J-W'$ vs $J-H$ color-color diagram distinguishes ultracool candidates with water-vapor-absorption features from reddened early type stars. Furthermore, later-type stars tend to exhibit stronger water-vapor absorption. Some sources show larger $\Delta W'$ than $\Delta J$ across the three nights, which we attribute to variations of their water-vapor-absorption depth. We conclude that it will be efficient to search for ultracool stars and estimate their spectral subtypes using $W'$ band imaging at Dome A, where the atmospheric transmission is high and stable.</description>

      <title>A Newly Identified Degeneracy Keeps the Planetary Interpretation Viable for OGLE-2011-BLG-0950</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microlensing event OGLE-2011-BLG-0950 exhibits the well-known ``Planet/Binary'' degeneracy, in which distinct lens configurations produce similar light curves but imply substantially different mass ratios between the lens components. A previous study suggested that high-resolution imaging could break this degeneracy through differences in the lens-source relative proper motion. In this work, we identify a new planetary model for this event that arises from a newly identified degeneracy, simultaneously reproducing the observed light curve and remaining consistent with the relative proper motion measured from high-resolution imaging. By combining constraints from the light-curve modeling and high-resolution observations, we infer a lens system consisting of a $\sim 1~M_{\odot}$ host star orbited by a $\sim 1.5~M_{\rm Jup}$ planet, with a projected separation of about 2 or 8 au, subject to the ``Close/Wide'' degeneracy. Our reanalysis of the color-magnitude diagram further indicates that the source star has unresolved companions that contribute non-negligible blended light, highlighting the importance of carefully accounting for source and lens companions in future Roman microlensing analyses. Finally, we show that adopting a single mass--luminosity relation significantly underestimates the uncertainties in the inferred lens properties for host masses $\gtrsim 1~M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>The DESIRED temperature-metallicity relations in star-forming regions: probing the Galactic radial and azimuthal metallicity distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse a sample of 225 star-forming regions from the DESIRED-E project, each with simultaneous determinations of the electron temperature from ionized nitrogen and oxygen, $T_{\rm e}$([NII]) and $T_{\rm e}$([OIII]), respectively. We derive new empirical relations connecting the gas-phase metallicity to the global electron temperature, $T_{\rm e}$(H$^+$), as determined via radio observations. We establish two calibrations: one assuming a homogeneous temperature distribution ($t^2 = 0$, the ``direct method''), and another accounting for internal temperature fluctuations ($t^2 &gt; 0$). Applying these calibrations to 460 radio observations of Galactic HII~regions spanning Galactocentric distances from $\sim0.1$ to 16 kpc, we determine the radial O/H gradient in the Milky Way under both assumptions. We further compare these nebular gradients to independent metallicity estimates from young O- and B-type stars and Cepheid variables. We find that the $t^2 &gt; 0$ calibration yields a gradient in excellent agreement with stellar-based determinations, whereas the $t^2 = 0$ method underestimates metallicities by up to $\sim$0.3 dex. This discrepancy cannot be reconciled by invoking oxygen depletion onto dust grains or nucleosynthetic processing via the CNO cycle in massive stars. We also find that one widely used relation in the literature, assuming $t^2 = 0$, produces an excessively steep gradient -- likely due to the use of outdated atomic data and pre-CCD observations. Finally, we explore potential azimuthal variations in the Galactic metallicity distribution driven by the presence of the spiral arms, finding no evidence for variations larger than $\sim$0.1 dex with respect to the general radial gradient.</description>

      <title>Observations with the Southern Connecticut Stellar Interferometer. II. First Three-Telescope Observations and a New Diameter Measurement of Arcturus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the most recent observations made with the Southern Connecticut Stellar Interferometer (SCSI), which is a three-station stellar intensity interferometer located on the campus of Southern Connecticut State University, in New Haven, Connecticut. Two different kinds of observations are presented. We first analyze observations of Vega taken in a three-telescope mode. (Previously, the instrument had only two operational stations.) We show that, while the efficiency remains nearly identical to that reported in our last paper, the addition of the third station allows more photon data to be recorded simultaneously, and therefore we can build up the photon-bunching peak in the data stream in fewer hours on sky for an unresolved source. In the second part of the paper, we report our observations to date of the nearby red giant star, Arcturus, most of which occurred in the first half of 2025. These show that, as a partially resolved source at the baselines we used, we detect fewercorrelations in the photon-bunching peak than for an unresolved source of comparable brightness. Combining the data with speckle imaging observations taken at Apache Point Observatory, we derive a new measurement of Arcturus' diameter that extends the time baseline of interferometric observations of the star and is consistent with previous analyses made by other investigators.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Origin of (469219) Kamo`oalewa of Tianwen-2 Mission from the Main-Belt: $\nu_6$ Secular Resonance, Flora Family or 3:1 Resonance with Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: China's Tianwen-2 mission, launched on 29 May 2025, targets the near-Earth object (469219) Kamo`oalewa, an Earth quasi-satellite trapped in a 1:1 mean-motion resonance with our planet. Determining the origin of Kamo`oalewa is central to understanding the formation pathways and dynamical evolution of Earth's quasi-satellite population. Here we show a strong possibility of main-belt origin for Kamo`oalewa using long-term dynamical simulations. We examine three candidate source regions: the $\nu_6$ secular resonance ($\nu_6$), the 3:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter (3:1J MMR), and the Flora family. A total of 42,825 test particles were integrated over 100 Myr. We find that asteroids from all three regions can be transported onto Kamo`oalewa-like orbits, albeit with markedly different efficiencies. Particles originating near the $\nu_6$ show the highest transfer probability (3.31%), followed by the Flora family (2.54%) and the 3:1J MMR (0.39%). We further identify representative dynamical pathways linking these source regions to Earth quasi-satellite orbits. The Tianwen-2 spacecraft is expected to rendezvous with Kamo`oalewa in 2026, performing close-proximity operations and returning samples. The mission will provide decisive observational constraints on the asteroid's composition and physical properties, offering a critical test of its proposed origin.</description>

      <title>The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) II. The radial structure of debris discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) was recently completed to cover the lack of high-resolution observations of debris discs and to investigate the prevalence of substructures such as radial gaps and rings in a sample of 24 discs. This study characterises the radial structure of debris discs in the ARKS programme. To identify and quantify the disc substructures, we modelled all discs with a range of non-parametric and parametric approaches. We find that of the 24 discs in the sample, 5 host multiple rings, 7 are single rings that display halos or additional low-amplitude rings, and 12 are single rings with at most tentative evidence of additional substructures. The fractional ring widths that we measured are significantly narrower than previously derived values, and they follow a distribution similar to the fractional widths of individual rings resolved in protoplanetary discs. However, there exists a population of rings in debris discs that are significantly wider than those in protoplanetary discs. We also find that discs with steep inner edges consistent with planet sculpting tend to be found at smaller (&lt;100 au) radii, while more radially extended discs tend to have shallower edges more consistent with collisional evolution. An overwhelming majority of discs have radial profiles well-described by either a double power law or double-Gaussian parametrisation. While our findings suggest that it may be possible for some debris discs to inherit their structures directly from protoplanetary discs, there exists a sizeable population of broad debris discs that cannot be explained in this way. Assuming that the distribution of millimetre dust reflects the distribution of planetesimals, mechanisms that cause rings in protoplanetary discs to migrate or debris discs to broaden soon after formation may be at play, possibly mediated by planetary migration or scattering.</description>

      <title>Quasi-linear approach of bi-Kappa distributed electrons with dynamic $\kappa$ parameter. EMEC instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the velocity-moment-based quasi-linear (QL) theory of waves and instabilities in plasmas with nonequilibrium velocity distributions (VDs) of the Kappa (or $\kappa$) type. However, the temporal variation of the parameter $\kappa$, which quantifies the presence of suprathermal particles, is not fully captured by such a QL analysis, and typically $\kappa$ remains constant during plasma dynamics. We propose a new QL modeling that goes beyond the limits of a previous approach, realistically assuming that the quasithermal core cannot evolve independently of energetic suprathermals. The case study is done on the electron-cyclotron (EMEC) instability generated by anisotropic bi-Kappa electrons with $A=T_\perp/T_\parallel &gt; 1$ ($\parallel, \perp$ denoting directions with respect to the background magnetic field). The parameter $\kappa$ self-consistently varies through the QL equation of kurtosis (fourth-order moment) coupled with temporal variations of the temperature components, relaxing the constraint on the independence of the low-energy (core) electrons and suprathermal high-energy tails of VDs. The results refine and extend previous approaches. A clear distinction is made between regimes that lead to a decrease or an increase in the $\kappa$ parameter with saturation of the instability. What predominates is a decrease in $\kappa$, i.e., an excess of suprathermalization, which energizes suprathermal electrons due to self-generated wave fluctuations. Additionally, we found that VDs can evolve toward a quasi-Maxwellian shape (as $\kappa$ increases) primarily in regimes with low beta and initial kappa values greater than five. Instability-driven relaxation only partially resolves temperature anisotropy in bi-Kappa electron VDs, as wave fluctuations generally act to further energize suprathermal electrons.</description>

      <title>Discovery and characterisation of two exoplanets orbiting the metal-poor, solar-type star TOI-5788 with TESS, CHEOPS, and HARPS-N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery and characterisation of two transiting exoplanets orbiting the metal-poor, solar-type star TOI-5788. From our analysis of six \textit{TESS} sectors and a dedicated \textit{CHEOPS} programme, we identify an inner planet (TOI-5788~b; $P = 6.340758\pm0.000030\,\si{\day}$) with radius $1.528\pm0.075\,\mathrm{R_\oplus}$ and an outer planet (TOI-5788~c; $P = 16.213362\pm0.000026\,\si{\day}$) with radius $2.272\pm0.039\,\mathrm{R_\oplus}$. We obtained 125 radial-velocity spectra from HARPS-N and constrain the masses of TOI-5788~b and~c as $3.72\pm0.94\,\mathrm{M_\oplus}$ and $6.4\pm1.2\,\mathrm{M_\oplus}$, respectively. Although dynamical analyses indicate that a third planet could exist in a stable orbit between 8 and 14 days, we find no evidence of additional planets. Since the TOI-5788 system is one of the few systems with planets straddling the radius gap, and noting that there are even fewer such systems around metal poor stars, it is a promising system to constrain planet formation theories. We therefore model the interior structures of both planets. We find that TOI-5788~b is consistent with being a rocky planet with almost no envelope, or having an atmosphere of a high mean molecular weight. We find that TOI-5788~c is consistent with both gas-dwarf and water-world hypotheses of mini-Neptune formation. We model the atmospheric evolution history of both planets. Whilst both scenarios are consistent with the atmospheric evolution of TOI-5788~c, the gas-dwarf model is marginally preferred. The results of the atmospheric evolution analysis are not strongly dependent on stellar evolution. This makes the system a promising target to test internal structure and atmospheric evolution models.</description>

      <title>Optical and near-infrared nebular-phase spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi: constraints on the structure of the inner ejecta, progenitor mass, and dust</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type II supernova SN\,2024ggi from 250 and 581 days after the explosion. Comparing the evolution of the [\ion{O}{1}] at 6300, 6363 \text{\AA} doublet normalized to the continuum with spectral models from the literature, we estimate a progenitor star zero-age main-sequence mass ($M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}}$) of $\approx 14$ M$_\odot$. This value is consistent with $M_{\mathrm{ZAMS}}$ reported in the literature from independent methodologies. The nebular spectra are used to study the structure of the inner ejecta. The broad H$\alpha$ line has a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\simeq 3900$ km s$^{-1}$, with small deviations from a symmetric Gaussian profile centred at zero velocity, and the [\ion{O}{1}] doublet is blue-shifted by $\approx -940$ km s$^{-1}$. In the NIR, the nebular spectra reveal double-peaked emission features of \ion{Mg}{1} and [\ion{Fe}{2}] lines between +250 and +319 days, suggesting a bipolar distribution of intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the line-of-sight. Such a double-peaked feature in these NIR lines has not been previously reported. No corresponding asymmetries are observed in the hydrogen lines, suggesting that the asymmetry is mostly confined to intermediate mass and iron peak elements in the innermost core of the supernova ejecta. Additionally, we detect first-overtone carbon monoxide (CO) emission at 2.3,$\mu$m between 250 and 319 days, and a blueshift in the emission lines of H$\alpha$, [\ion{O}{1}], \ion{Mg}{1}], and [\ion{Fe}{2}] in the +581 day optical spectrum, consistent with dust formation in the ejecta.</description>

      <title>Vision-Based CNN Prediction of Sunspot Numbers from SDO/HMI Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sunspot numbers provide the longest continuous record of solar activity and remain a key index for heliophysical research and space-weather applications. Standard sunspot determination relies on visual inspection and algorithmic feature-detection pipelines, both of which involve methodological choices and can be sensitive to image quality and implementation details. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an alternative by learning an end-to-end mapping from solar images to a scalar index, reducing reliance on explicit, handcrafted feature design. Here we present a supervised vision-based regression framework to estimate the daily sunspot number from full-disk continuum images acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We pair daily images from 2011-2024 with the SILSO Version 2.0 daily sunspot number and train a CNN to infer the scalar value at the observation time of each image. On an independent test split, the model achieves R2=0.964, RMSE=9.75, and MAE=6.74, indicating close agreement with SILSO across a wide activity range. Interpretability analyses using Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients show that the network attributions concentrate on sunspot-bearing regions, supporting the physical plausibility of the learned representations. These results demonstrate the feasibility of direct image-to-index estimation for scalable solar monitoring. Future work will explore multimodal fusion with complementary observables (e.g., magnetograms) and standardized cross-cycle benchmarks to assess robustness under changing solar conditions.</description>

      <title>Polarization Diagnostics Applied to Coronal Mass Ejections and the Background Solar Wind</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ratio of radially to tangentially polarized Thomson-scattered white light provides a powerful tool for locating the 3D position of compact structures in the solar corona and inner heliosphere, and the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH) has been designed to take full advantage of this diagnostic capability. Interestingly, this same observable that establishes the position of transient blob-like structures becomes a local measure of the slope of the global falloff of density in the background solar wind. It is thus important to characterize the extent along the line of sight of structures being studied, in order to determine whether they are sufficiently compact for 3D positioning. In this paper, we build from analyses of individual lines of sight to three-dimensional models of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), allowing us to consider how accurately polarization properties of the transient and quiescent solar wind are diagnosed. In this way, we demonstrate the challenges and opportunities presented by PUNCH polarization data for various quantitative diagnostics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae, occurring at the end of massive star evolution, produce heavy elements, including those in the iron peak. Although the explosion mechanism is not yet fully understood, theoretical models can reproduce optical observations and observed elemental abundances. However, many nuclear reaction rates involved in explosive nucleosynthesis have large uncertainties, impacting the reliability of abundance predictions. To address this, we have previously developed a Monte Carlo-based nucleosynthesis code that accounts for reaction rate uncertainties and has been applied to nucleosynthesis processes beyond iron. Our framework is also well suited for studying explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae. In this paper, we investigate 1D explosion models using the "PUSH method", focusing on progenitors with varying metallicities and initial masses around $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 16 M_{\odot}$. Detailed post-process nucleosynthesis calculations and Monte Carlo analyses are used to explore the effects of reaction rate uncertainties and to identify key reaction rates in explosive nucleosynthesis. We find that many reactions have little impact on the production of iron-group nuclei, as these elements are primarily synthesized in the nuclear statistical equilibrium. However, we identify a few "key reactions" that significantly influence the production of radioactive nuclei, which may affect astrophysical observables. In particular, for the production of ${}^{44}$Ti, we confirm that several traditionally studied nuclear reactions have a strong impact. However, determining a single reaction rate is insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.</description>

      <title>The Kinematic Properties of T\.ZO Candidate HV 11417 with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: HV 11417 is a candidate Thorne-\.Zytkow Object, a red supergiant with a neutron star core, located within the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Previous studies have questioned, using Gaia DR2 data, whether HV 11417 was truly located at the distance of the SMC or was instead a foreground star. However, the proper motion measurement uncertainties for HV 11417 in DR2 were high. In this work, we use Gaia DR3 data to show that HV 11417 is very likely to be a true member of the SMC. We further analyze the kinematics of HV 11417 relative to its local environment, and compare it to populations of massive and evolved stars in the SMC. We find HV 11417 has a local transverse velocity of $52\pm15$ km/s, and thus qualifies as a runaway star (v$_\mathrm{loc}\geq$ 30 km/s). This runaway classification does not conclusively prove its nature as a T\.ZO, particularly given results from recent T\.ZO models, but does indicate that HV 11417 experienced a kinematic disruption in its evolution.</description>

      <title>An eclipsing 8.56 minute orbital period mass-transferring binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of ATLAS J101342.5-451656.8 (hereafter ATLAS J1013-4516), an 8.56 minute orbital period mass transferring AM Canum Venaticorum binary with mean Gaia magnitude G=19.51. The system was identified via periodic variability in Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System light curves of Gaia white dwarf candidates. Follow-up spectroscopy with the Large Lenslet Array Magellan Spectrograph reveals a helium dominated accretion disk, while high speed ULTRACAM photometry shows pronounced primary and secondary eclipses. We construct a decade long orbital timing baseline using ATLAS and Gaia survey photometry together with high speed observations from ULTRACAM on the NTT and proto Lightspeed on the Magellan Clay telescope. From this baseline we measure an orbital period derivative Pdot = -1.60 +/- 0.07 x 10^-12 seconds per second. Interpreted in the context of stable mass transfer, the magnitude and sign of Pdot indicate orbital evolution governed by the interplay between gravitational wave driven angular momentum losses and mass transfer, directly probing the donor star structural response to mass loss. Assuming angular momentum loss dominated by gravitational radiation, we constrain the component masses and infer the characteristic gravitational wave strain. We predict a four year Laser Interferometer Space Antenna signal to noise ratio greater than 10, establishing ATLAS J1013-4516 as a strong prospective space based gravitational wave source that probes long term orbital evolution in the mass transferring regime.</description>

      <title>The drastic impact of Eddington-limit induced mass ejections on massive star populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive stars are the key engines of the Universe. However, their evolution and thus their ionizing feedback are still not fully understood. One of the largest gaps in current stellar evolution calculations is the lack of a model for the mass ejections that occur when the stars reach the Eddington limit, such as during an Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) phase. We aim to remedy this situation by providing a physically motivated and empirically calibrated method applicable in any 1D stellar evolution code to approximate the effect of such mass loss on stellar evolution. We employ the 1D stellar evolution code MESA, in which we implement a new mass-loss prescription that is acting when stellar models inflate too much when reaching the Eddington limit. Synthetic massive-star stellar populations using calculated grids of single-star models with this mass loss prescription are compared with the observed populations in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. In combination with already computed grids of binary evolution models, we investigate the impact of binarity on our predictions. Our single-star models reproduce key features of the observed stellar populations, namely (i) the absence of stars located beyond the Humphreys-Davidson limit, (ii) an upper limit of RSG luminosities, (iii) the faintest observed single WR stars, (iv) the absolute number of O-stars, WRs, and RSGs, (v) WO stars in low metallicity environments, and (vi) the positions of LBV stars in the HRD. Our binary population explains at the same time the 70% binary fraction of O-stars and the 40% binary fraction of WR stars. However, our synthetic population also has caveats, such as an overproduction of bright H-free WN stars. Our results show that the effect of Eddington-limit induced mass ejections on the structure and evolution of massive stars can remove tension between predicted and observed massive star populations.</description>

      <title>On the importance of geometry in exoplanet irradiation : Implications for the day-night contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The irradiance received by a spherical body or a planet close to a spherically symmetric source does not follow the point-sized source approximation and the inverse-square variation of irradiation if spherical symmetry is broken. In the penumbral zones of the planet, spherical symmetry of the star reduces to an axial symmetry. Our work aims to put forward a fundamental explanation, using energy conservation, to determine the variation of irradiance in the penumbral zone on a close-in planet where the point-sized source approximation fails. Consequently, we propose a numerical model that accurately predicts the irradiance within the boundaries of the penumbral zone and the fully-illuminated zone. Our analysis also corrects a previous study on exoplanet irradiation that violates energy conservation. We find that night-side illumination partially explains the observed night-side temperatures on the planets considered; this reduces reliance on heat transport models to explain the night-side temperature for the few exemplar rocky close-in planets, namely K2-141 b, 55 Cancri e, TOI-561 b, TOI-431 b, and Kepler-10 b, that are discussed in this work. We provide improved day-night contrast temperatures, considering an airless scenario, and highlight the need for revisiting the heat transport models associated with atmospheric modelling of planets where the night-side illumination is significant.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Galactic Winds in M82 I: the recent starburst and launch of outflow in simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09452v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the launch of the galactic outflow in M82 using hydrodynamic simulations. Employing a sink-particle module, we self-consistently resolve star formation and feedback, avoiding reliance on simplified models. We investigate the effects of stellar feedback mechanisms, gas return from star-forming clouds, and disk mass on the starburst and outflow. Our simulations generate a starburst lasting $\sim25$ Myr, peaking at 20-50 $\rm{M_{\odot},yr^{-1}}$, although the total stellar mass often exceeds M82's estimated value. The outflow develops in two stages: initially, continuous SNe form small bubbles that merge into a superbubble containing warm/hot gas and intermediate- to high-density cool filaments. After $\sim10$ Myr, the superbubble breaks out of the disk, and within $\sim15$ Myr a kpc-scale outflow forms. Cool filaments survive stellar feedback, become entrained in the wind, and stretch to hundreds of parsecs. Transport from the cool ISM is the dominant net contributor to the total mass of the cool phase in the outflow, whereas transfers from hotter phases, such as through condensation or precipitation, provide only a minor net contribution, likely offset by simultaneous transfer from the cool phase back to hotter phases. While the mass loading factor is comparable to M82, the cool gas outflow rate and velocity are lower, with velocities $\sim60\%$ below observed values; warm and hot gas are $\sim25\%$ slower. SN feedback is the primary driver, and gas return significantly influences the starburst and outflow, while other factors are secondary. Stronger clustered SN feedback is likely required to better match observations.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Turbulence at Sub-Electron Scales in the Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of turbulence at sub-electron scales has remained an open question, central to understanding how electrons are heated in the solar wind. This is primarily because spacecraft measurements have been limited to magnetic field fluctuations alone. We resolve this by deriving new high-resolution density fluctuations from spacecraft potential measurements of Parker Solar Probe resolving scales smaller than the electron gyro-radius ($\rho_e$). A systematic comparison of the density and magnetic spectra shows that both steepen near the electron scales. Notably, the density spectrum exhibits slopes close to $-10/3$, while the magnetic spectrum becomes consistently steeper than the density spectrum at scales smaller than $\rho_e$, indicating that the turbulence becomes electrostatic. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions of an electron entropy cascade, which may explain the irreversible dissipation of turbulent energy at sub-$\rho_e$ scales. The magnetic spectrum, however, is not as steep as expected for the electron entropy cascade, which may be due to limited signal-to-noise ratio and the presence of weakly damped electromagnetic fluctuations near $\rho_e$.</description>

      <title>Is the high-energy environment of K2-18b special?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: K2-18b lies near the radius valley that separates super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, marking a key transitional regime in planetary and atmospheric composition. The system offers a valuable opportunity to study how M-dwarf high-energy stellar radiation influences atmospheric stability and the potential for sustaining volatile species, especially important in the context of the upcoming ELT and its ANDES spectrograph. This study characterizes the high-energy environment of K2-18 with X-ray observations from eROSITA, the soft X-ray instrument on the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, Chandra, and XMM-Newton. We derive a representative 0.2-2 keV X-ray flux with an APEC thermal plasma model fitted with the Bayesian X-ray Analysis (BXA). With the observed X-ray flux from the exoplanet host star, we estimate the photoevaporative mass loss of exoplanet K2-18b using the energy-limited model. In addition, we examine the thermal structure of the system based on a hydrodynamic model. In 100 ks XMM-Newton observation we identified K2-18 as a very faint X-ray source with $\mathrm{F_X = 10^{-15}\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, with an activity level of (Lx/Lbol) $\sim 10^{-5}$. A small flare has been detected during the observation. The planet is irradiated by an X-ray flux of $\mathrm{F_{pl,X} = 12\pm3\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. The X-ray flux measurement of K2-18 gives important limitations for atmospheric escape and photochemical modeling of its exoplanets. Despite its near orbit around an M-dwarf star, K2-18b's low activity level environment suggests that it can retain an atmosphere, supporting recent tentative detections of atmospheres.</description>
