      <title>Coupled circularly polarized electromagnetic soliton states in magnetized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between two co-propagating electromagnetic pulses in a magnetized plasma is considered, from first principles, relying on a fluid-Maxwell model. Two circularly polarized wavepackets by same group velocities are considered, characterized by opposite circular polarization, to be identified as left-hand- or right hand circularly polarized (i.e. LCP or RCP, respectively). A multiscale perturbative technique is adopted, leading to a pair of coupled nonlinear Schrodinger-type (NLS) equations for the modulated amplitudes of the respective vector potentials associated with the two pulses. Systematic analysis reveals the existence, in certain frequency bands, of three different types of vector soliton modes: an LCP-bright/RCP-bright coupled soliton pair state, an LCP bright/RCP-dark soliton pair, and an LCP-dark/RCP-bright soliton pair. The value of the magnetic field plays a critical role since it determines the type of vector solitons that may occur in certain frequency bands and, on the other hand, it affects the width of those frequency bands that are characterized by a specific type of vector soliton (type). The magnetic field (strength) thus arises as an order parameter, affecting the existence conditions of each type of solution (in the form of an envelope soliton pair). An exhaustive parametric investigation is presented in terms of frequency bands and in a wide range of magnetic field (strength) values, leading to results that may be applicable in beam-plasma interaction scenarios as well as in space plasmas and in the ionosphere.</description>

      <title>Gauge invariant variational formulations of electromagnetic gyrokinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of gyrokinetics, wherein phase-space coordinate transformations result in a phase-space dimensionality reduction as well as removal of fast time scales, has enabled the simulation of microturbulence in fusion devices. The state-of-the-art gyrokinetic models used in practice are parallel-only models wherein the perpendicular part of the vector potential is neglected. Such models are inherently not gauge invariant. We generalize the work of [Burby, Brizard. Physics Letters A, 383(18):2172-2175] by deriving a sufficient condition on the gyrocentre coordinate transformation which ensures gauge invariance. This leads to a parametrized family of gyrokinetic models for which we motivate a specific choice of parameters that results in a physically meaningful gauge invariant model. Due to gauge invariance this model can be expressed directly in terms of the electromagnetic fields, rather than the potentials, and the gyrokinetic model thereby results in the macroscopic Maxwell's equations. For the linearized model, it is demonstrated that the shear and compressional Alfv\'en waves are present with the correct frequencies. The fast compressional Alfv\'en wave can be removed by making use of a Darwin-like approximation. This approximation breaks gauge invariance, but we find that the field equations are still compatible without the need of a Lagrange multiplier.</description>

      <title>Some observations regarding brackets and dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some ideas relating to a bracket formulation for dissipative systems are considered. The formulation involves a bracket that is analogous to a generalized Poisson bracket, but possesses a symmetric component. Such a bracket is presented for the Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Self-pulsing of Dielectric Barrier Discharges at Low Driving Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the self-pulsing of Dielectric Barrier Discharges (DBDs) at low driving frequencies. In particular, (a) the dependence of current on the product pd of gas pressure p and the gas gap length d, (b) the effects of lossy dielectrics (in resistive discharges) and large dielectric permittivity (in ferroelectrics) on current dynamics, (c) the transition from Townsend to a dynamic Capacitively Coupled Plasma (CCP) discharge with changing pd values, and (d) the transition from Townsend to a high-frequency CCP regime with increasing the driving frequency. A one-dimensional fluid model of Argon plasma is coupled to an equivalent RC circuit for lossy dielectrics. Our results show multiple current pulses per AC period in Townsend and CCP discharge modes which are explained by uncoupled electron-ion transport in the absence of quasineutrality and surface charge deposition at dielectric interfaces. The number of current pulses decreases with an increasing applied frequency when the Townsend discharge transforms into the CCP discharge. The resistive barrier discharge with lossy dielectrics exhibits Townsend and glow modes for the same pd value (7.6 Torr cm) for higher and lower resistances, respectively. Finally,we show that ferroelectric materials can amplify discharge current in DBDs. Similarities between current pulsing in DBD, Trichel pulses in corona discharges, and subnormal oscillations in DC discharges are discussed. 1</description>
