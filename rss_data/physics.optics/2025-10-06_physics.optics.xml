      <title>New Method for Injectable Quinine Quality Assurance Control Using a Multi-Spectral Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Africa is the world region that is most affected by malaria. Among the therapies used, injectable quinine is considered to be one of the effective antimalarial drug, however non-quality assured antimalarials clearly have a strong market penetration across Africa. To overcome this problem, it becomes more and more necessary to set up quantitative and qualitative analysis system for antimalarial quality control. The objective of the present investigation is an attempt to use customized multispectral microscope equipped with UV-Visible lasers for injectable quinine quality assurance control routinely. For that, we have established the calibration curve of quinine solution concentration as a function of area under light intensity histogram crossing the solution. From this calibration curve, we can check the conformity of any injectable quinine according to the pharmacopoeia involved. The proposed technique is a promising alternative for drug quality control routinely.</description>

      <title>Holographic Gaseous Lenses for High-Power Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capabilities of the world's highest energy and peak-power pulsed lasers are limited by optical damage, and further advances in high-intensity laser science will require optics that are substantially more robust than existing components. We describe here the experimental demonstration of off-axis diffractive gaseous lenses capable of withstanding extreme laser fluence and immune to cumulative damage. We used less than 8 mJ of energy from interfering ultraviolet laser pulses to holographically write millimeter-scale diffractive gas lenses into an ozone, oxygen, and carbon-dioxide gas mixture. These lenses allowed us to focus, defocus, and collimate 532-nm nanosecond laser pulses with up to 210 mJ of energy at efficiencies above 50% and fluences up to 35 J/cm$^2$. We also show that the gas lenses have sufficient bandwidth to efficiently diffract 35-fs 800-nm pulses and that beam pointing, divergence, and diffraction efficiency are stable while operating at 10 Hz. These diffractive lenses are simple holograms, and the principles demonstrated here could be extended to other types of optics, suggesting that gaseous optics may enable arbitrary, damage-resistant manipulation of intense light for next-generation ultra-high-power lasers.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic metamaterial time crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically driven optical materials and metamaterials have recently emerged as a promising platform for realizing photonic time crystals (PTCs) -- systems whose optical properties are strongly and periodically modulated on time scales comparable to the optical cycle of light. These time-varying structures are the temporal counterparts of spatial photonic crystals (SPCs), for which a large and periodic dielectric contrast is achieved spatially on wavelength scales. Just as SPCs have revolutionized control over light-matter interactions by engineering the photonic density of states in space, PTCs promise comparable breakthroughs from a fundamentally new perspective: a temporal one. However, harnessing such phenomena at optical frequencies poses severe experimental challenges, as it requires order-unity modulation depths of the optical properties at optical cycle rates, a regime that has remained elusive to date. Here, we report the first optical realization of a photonic time crystal, achieved with a surface plasmon cavity metamaterial operating at Terahertz frequencies. We demonstrate strong (near-unity) and coherent (sub-optical cycle) periodic driving of the plasmonic metamaterial enabled by field-induced dynamical modulation of the carriers' kinetic energy and effective mass -- reaching up to 80% of their rest mass, an exceptionally high value that forms the basis for time-crystalline phenomena with plasmons. Our experimentally informed theory reveals rich physics within the experimentally accessible parameter regime of this system, including parametric amplification and entangled plasmon generation, and establishes a robust new platform for time-domain photonics.</description>

      <title>Impact of nonlinear spectral broadening on the phase noise properties of electro-optic frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electro-optic modulation is an attractive approach for generating flat, stable, and low-noise optical frequency combs with relatively high power per comb line. However, a key limitation of electro-optic combs is the restricted number of comb lines imposed by the available RF source power. To overcome this limitation, a nonlinear spectral broadening stage is typically employed. The phase noise characteristics of an electro-optic comb are well described by the standard phase noise model, which depends on two parameters: the seed laser and the RF source phase noise. A fundamental question that arises is how nonlinear broadening processes affect the phase noise properties of the expanded comb. To address this, we employ coherent detection, digital signal processing, and subspace tracking. Our experimental results show that the nonlinearly broadened comb preserves the standard phase noise model of the input electro-optic comb. In other words, the nonlinear processes neither introduce additional phase noise terms nor amplify the existing contributions from the seed laser and RF source. Hence, nonlinear broadening can be viewed as equivalent to driving the electro-optic comb with a much higher RF modulation power.</description>

      <title>Probing a theoretical framework for a Photonic Extreme Learning Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of computing paradigms alternative to von Neumann architectures has recently fueled significant progress in novel all-optical processing solutions. In this work, we investigate how the coherence properties can be exploited for computing by expanding information onto a higher-dimensional space in the photonic extreme learning machine framework. A theoretical framework is provided based on the transmission matrix formalism, mapping the input plane onto the output camera plane, resulting in the establishment of the connection with complex extreme learning machines and derivation of upper bounds for the hidden space dimensionality as well as the form of the activation functions. Experiments using free-space propagation through a diffusive medium, performed in low-dimensional input space regimes, validate the model and the proposed estimator for the dimensionality. Overall, the framework presented and the findings enclosed have the potential to foster further research in a multitude of directions, from the development of robust general-purpose all-optical hardware to a full-stack integration with optical sensing devices toward edge computing solutions.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Bounds for Off-Axis Illumination in Interferometric and Rotating Coherent Scattering Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent localization microscopy enables three-dimensional localization with nanoscale precision. Previous studies have characterized the fundamental precision limits for on-axis illumination geometries. In this paper, we theoretically analyze 3D particle localization precision under oblique illumination in interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT). We show that (quantum) Cramer-Rao bounds reveal an information gain in the off-axis case, potentially enabling enhanced localization precision. We find that rotating coherent scattering microscopy (ROCS), which employs off-axis illumination, provides worse localization precision than \iscat, despite offering higher spatial resolution. This shows that key metrics, like spatial resolution, are often insufficient to fully characterize a microscopy technique.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast dynamics of coherent exciton-polaritons in van der Waals semiconductor metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling coherent light-matter interactions is a critical step toward next-generation quantum technologies. However, achieving this under ambient temperature conditions remains challenging due to rapid dephasing in optically excited systems. Optical metasurfaces based on quasi-bound states in the continuum have recently emerged as a powerful platform for reaching the strong light-matter coupling regime in flat, subwavelength thickness devices. Here, we investigate ultrafast exciton-polariton dynamics in self-hybridized WS$_2$ thin-film metasurfaces. Using hyperspectral momentum-resolved imaging, we reconstruct the highly anisotropic exciton-polariton dispersion, with a transition from positive to negative effective mass along orthogonal symmetry axes. Femtosecond pump-probe and multidimensional spectroscopy reveal detuning-dependent polariton dynamics with a coherence time up to ~110 fs, and allow direct observation of the coherent dynamics through ultrafast Rabi oscillations with ~45 fs period. We describe this behaviour with a three-eigenstate model that couples the photonic resonance with both bright and dark excitons, extending the conventional two-state picture of strong coupling. Our results establish van der Waals metasurfaces as a promising platform for next-generation polaritonic devices, enabling coherent quantum transfer of matter excitations at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Points, Lasing, and Coherent Perfect Absorption in Floquet Scattering Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically time-varying media, known as photonic time crystals (PTCs), provide a promising platform for observing unconventional wave phenomena. We analyze the scattering of electromagnetic waves from spatially finite PTCs using the multispectral Floquet scattering matrix, which naturally incorporates the frequency-mixing processes intrinsic to such systems. For dispersionless, real, and time-periodic permittivities, this matrix is pseudounitary. Here we demonstrate that this property leads to multiple symmetry-breaking transitions: for increasing driving strength, scattering matrix eigenvalues lying on the unit circle (unbroken symmetry regime) meet at exceptional points (EPs), where they break up into inverse complex conjugate pairs (broken symmetry regime). We identify the symmetry operator associated with these transitions and show that, in time-symmetric systems, it corresponds to the time-reversal operator. Remarkably, at the parametric resonance condition, one eigenvalue vanishes while its partner diverges, signifying simultaneous coherent perfect absorption (CPA) and lasing. Since our approach relies solely on the Floquet scattering matrix, it is not restricted to a specific geometry but instead applies to any periodically time-varying scattering system. To illustrate this universality, we apply our method to a variety of periodically time-modulated structures, including slabs, spheres, and metasurfaces. In particular, we show that using quasi-bound states in the continuum resonances sustained by a metasurface, the CPA and lasing conditions can be attained for a minimal modulation strength of the permittivity. Our results pave the way for engineering time-modulated photonic systems with tailored scattering properties, opening new avenues for dynamic control of light in next-generation optical devices.</description>

      <title>Unraveling longitudinal field mediated versatile Stokes polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stokes polarimetry has been considered as an alluring platform that enables a plethora of applications ranging from single-molecule orientation to deep-space sensing. Existing polarimetry avenues, however, rely primarily on the transversely polarized field reconstruction, thus suffering from several challenges such as multiple time sequenced detections, complex demodulation algorithms, and intricate engineering procedures. To circumvent these challenges, here we first demonstrate a longitudinally polarized field mediated recipe for the realization of efficacious and refined Stokes polarimetry in situ. This is achieved by unraveling the spin-to-orbit momentum conversion under non-paraxial focusing conditions enabling the direct mapping of the polarization ellipse. Leveraging this mechanism, we reveal an analytical solution of polarization ellipse via the local sampling of longitudinal field, in which the robustness can be fairly reinforced by relevant global retrieval based on convolutional neural network. The resultant Stokes polarimetry is shown to simultaneously exhibit in-situ signal acquisition (direct discernment), unparalleled demodulation time (up tomicrosecond level), superior detection efficiency (no need of troublesome design), and ultra-high retrieved accuracy (less than 1%), which is fundamentally inaccessible with traditional polarimetry methods. Our work holds great promise for empowering an allin-one versatile vector polarimeter, which opens up a host of applications relevant to polarization control.</description>

      <title>Polarization Maintaining Large Mode Area Yb Fibers for All Fiber Nanosecond Pulse Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization maintaining (PM), all-fiber amplifiers offer the benefits of alignment free and environmentally stable operation. To achieve high output powers, particularly in pulsed operation, it is necessary to balance the need to reduce deleterious nonlinear effects, often through the use of large mode area (LMA) fibers, with the onset of transverse mode instability whereby higher order modes (HOMs) mix with the desired fundamental mode output. Over the last few years, advances in high HOM loss, ytterbium-doped LMA fibers have enabled continuous wave (CW) output powers up to 5 kW and pulse energies up to 2 mJ in non-PM fibers. In CW operation, LMA PM fibers have shown up to 2 kW of average power. In this contribution, we present all-fiber nanosecond pulsed amplification in a high HOM loss, Yb-doped LMA fiber with a 26 micrometer mode field diameter and 2.4 dB/m of pump absorption at 976 nm, achieving 1 mJ of pulse energy at 1 kW of average power, and 1.5 mJ of pulse energy at 750 W of average power. The polarization extinction ratios were 20 dB or higher and the M2 was near the diffraction limit. We measured the in-pulse to out-of-pulse energy and found 99.9% or more of the measured power remained in-pulse.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional optical non-reciprocity in a multi-mode cavity optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.01337v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical non-reciprocity, a phenomenon that allows unidirectional flow of optical field is pivoted on the time reversal symmetry breaking. The symmetry breaking happens in the cavity optomechanical system (COS) due to non uniform radiation pressure as a result of light-matter interaction, and is crucial in building non-reciprocal optical devices. In our proposed COS, we study the non-reciprocal transport of optical signals across two ports via three optical modes optomechanically coupled to the mechanical excitations of two nano-mechanical resonators (NMRs) under the influence of strong classical drive fields and weak probe fields. By tuning different system parameters, we discover the conversion of reciprocal to non-reciprocal signal transmission. We reveal perfect nonreciprocal transmission of output fields when the effective cavity detuning parameters are near resonant to the NMRs' frequencies. The unidirectional non-reciprocal signal transport is robust to the optomechanical coupling parameters at resonance conditions. Moreover, the cavities' photon loss rates play an inevitable role in the unidirectional flow of signal across the two ports. Bidirectional transmission can be fully controlled by the phase changes associated with the incoming probe and drive fields via two ports. Our scheme may provide a foundation for the compact non-reciprocal communication and quantum information processing, thus enabling new devices that route photons in unconventional ways such as all-optical diodes, optical transistors and optical switches.</description>

      <title>Rotating Isospectral Drums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis I demonstrate that isospectral domains, that is domains of differing geometric shapes that possess identical spectra, do not remain isospectral when subject to uniform rotation. One thus *can* hear the shape of a rotating drum. It is shown that the spectra diverge as $\propto\left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)^2$ similarly to a square but different from a circle, whose degenerate eigenfrequencies split $\propto \left(\frac{\omega}{c}\right)$. The latter two cases are studied analytically and used as test cases for the selection of numerical solution methods. I demonstrate that the presence of a simple medium attenuates the effects of rotation on the spectrum differences. Further I show that the common but linearised augmented wave equation yields eigenmodes with sensible structure for non-physical parameters, whereas a full equation destroys the structure as intended. The full equation is obtained from first principles using Maxwell equations formulated as differential forms and a careful application of the 3+1 foliation of space-time. The differences of the result from literature arXiv:physics/0607016 are highlighted and their effects studied. The equation is treated analytically on simple domains to obtain reference data for numerical analysis. Nodal and modal discretisations of the PDE are tested and a self-written FEM implementation is chosen due to higher precision of the results. As part of the validation process I demonstrate that results of arXiv:physics/0607016 are reproducible. The resulting gyroscopic quadratic eigenvalue problem is linearised into a Hamiltonian/skew-Hamiltonian pencil and a suitable shift operator for the Arnoldi iteration is determined. The resulting formulation is solved using ARPACK.</description>

      <title>Symmetry in magnetoelectric electromagnetism and magnetoelectric meta-atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While in electromagnetism we have space-time symmetry, magnetoelectric (ME) processes are characterized by space-time symmetry breaking. Our goal is to show that quantum vacuum fields with both time reversal and space inversion symmetry breaking (so-called ME fields) can be observed in subwavelength regions of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The sources of ME fields are ME meta-atoms, subwavelength elements made of magnetic insulators, where the dynamical ME behavior is due to modulations and topological coupling of magnetization and electric polarization. The interaction between EM and ME systems occurs through virtual structures, ME virtual photons. Experimentally, ME quantum vacuum states can be detected in a microwave cavity. The topic of these studies concerns fundamental aspects of ME quantum electrodynamics (MEQED).</description>

      <title>Emulation of Coherent Absorption of Quantum Light in a Programmable Linear Photonic Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems, governed by nonunitary evolution, offer powerful tools for manipulating quantum states through engineered loss. A prime example is coherent absorption, where quantum states undergo phase-dependent partial or complete absorption in a lossy medium. Here, we demonstrate a fully programmable implementation of nonunitary transformations that emulate coherent absorption of quantum light using a programmable integrated linear photonic circuit, with loss introduced via coupling to an ancilla mode [Phys. Rev. X 8, 021017; 2018]. Probing the circuit with a single-photon dual-rail state reveals phase-controlled coherent tunability between perfect transmission and perfect absorption. A two-photon NOON state input, by contrast, exhibits switching between deterministic single-photon and probabilistic two-photon absorption. Across a range of input phases and circuit configurations, we observe nonclassical effects such as anti-coalescence and bunching, along with continuous and coherent tuning of output Fock state probability amplitudes. Classical Fisher information analysis reveals phase sensitivity peaks of 0.79 for single-photon states and 3.7 for NOON states, exceeding the shot-noise limit of 2 and approaching the Heisenberg limit of 4. The experiment integrates quantum state generation, programmable photonic circuitry, and photon-number-resolving detection, establishing ancilla-assisted circuits as powerful tools for programmable quantum state engineering, filtering, multiplexed sensing, and nonunitary quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Wavelength Dual-Polarized Lens-Absorber-Coupled Ti/Al Kinetic Inductance Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents Ti/Al bi-layer Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) based on lens-coupled spiral absorbers as the quasi-optical coupling mechanism for millimeter-wavelength radiation detection. From simulations, the lens-coupled absorbers provide a 70% lens aperture efficiency in both polarizations over an octave band with a spiral array absorber and over 10% relative bandwidth with a single spiral. We have fabricated and measured two devices with bare Ti/Al MKIDs: a 3x3 cm chip with 9 pixels to characterize the optical response at 85 GHz of the two variations of the absorber; and a large format demonstrator with 253 spiral-array pixels showing potential towards a large format millimeter-wavelength camera. We find a sensitivity of 1 mK/sqrt{Hz} and a detector yield of 95%.</description>

      <title>Diffractive Magic Cube Network with Super-high Capacity Enabled by Mechanical Reconfiguration</title>

Abstract: Free-space wavefront manipulation devices have emerged as powerful platforms for advanced optical information systems. In response to the challenges posed by the exponential growth of optical information, optical multiplexing and dynamic reconfigurable devices are being actively explored to the enhance system capacity. Among them, coarse-grained mechanically reconfigurable mechanism offers a cost-effective and low-complexity approach for capacity enhancement. However, the channel numbers achieved in current studies are insufficient for practical applications because of inadequate mechanical transformations and suboptimal optimization models. In this article, a diffractive magic cube network (DMCN) is proposed to advance the multiplexing capacity of mechanically reconfigurable system. We utilized the diffractive deep neural network (D2NN) model to jointly optimize the subset of channels generated by the combination of three mechanical operations, permutation, translation, and rotation. The 144-channel holograms, 108-channel single/double focus, 60-channel single/multi-mode OAM beam generation were experimentally demonstrated using diffractive optical elements (DOEs). An equivalent connectivity law was formulated to improve model scalability. Our strategy not only provides a novel paradigm to improve system capacity to super-high level with low crosstalk, but also paves the way for new advancements in optical storage, computing, communication, and photolithography.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Model of Microparticle-Assisted Super-Resolution Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10268v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first three-dimensional theoretical model of microparticle-assisted super-resolution imaging, enabling accurate simulation of virtual image formation. The model reveals that accounting for partial spatial coherence of illumination is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving super-resolution. We also propose a novel illumination strategy based on suppressing the normal component of incident light, which enhances image contrast and resolution. The results establish a consistent wave-optical framework that reproduces experimentally observed subwavelength imaging and clarifies the underlying physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A simple, robust and cost-effective method to achieve dispersion matching in swept source OCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical path length and dispersion matching in both measurement and reference arms of an OCT system is critical for achieving bandwidth-limited axial resolution. To minimize or eliminate dispersion mismatch, most, if not all, fiber-based OCT realisations employ a reference arm configuration that is as closely identical to the measurement arm as possible. This typically includes a collimator, dispersion compensating material (or sometimes a set of lenses), as well as a mirror (or retro-reflector) mounted on a translation stage. However, this solution makes the total instrument cost higher and the setup bulkier than necessary and it also renders the reference arm mechanically unstable. Here, a simple yet robust, low-cost reference arm setup is presented and its ability to compensate for measurement arm dispersion is demonstrated. We use a single-mode fiber cleaved and polished perpendicular to the fiber axis to construct the reference arm. The length and material of the fibre is determined by considering the optical path length and dispersion of the measurement arm. Experimental images demonstrate the operation of the novel reference arm in our Swept-source Optical Coherence Tomography.</description>

      <title>Frequency-stable nanophotonic microcavities via integrated thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Field-deployable integrated photonic devices co-packaged with electronics will enable important applications such as optical interconnects, quantum information processing, precision measurements, spectroscopy, and microwave generation. Significant progress has been made over the past two decades on increasing the functional complexity of photonic chips. However, a critical challenge that remains is the lack of scalable techniques to overcome thermal perturbations arising from the environment and co-packaged electronics. Here, we demonstrate a fully integrated scheme to monitor and stabilize the temperature of a high-Q microresonator on a Si-based chip, which can serve as a photonic frequency reference. Our approach relies on a thin-film metallic resistor placed directly above the microcavity, acting as an integrated resistance thermometer, enabling unique mapping of the cavity's absolute resonance wavelength to the thermometer's electrical resistance. Following a one-time calibration, the microresonator can be accurately and repeatably tuned to any desired absolute resonance wavelength using thermometry alone with a root-mean squared wavelength error of &lt;0.8 pm over a timespan of days. We frequency-lock a distributed feedback (DFB) laser to the microresonator and demonstrate a 48x reduction in its frequency drift, resulting in its center wavelength staying within +-0.5 pm of the mean over the duration of 50 hours in the presence of significant ambient fluctuations, outperforming many commercial DFB and wavelength-locker-based laser systems. Finally, we stabilize a soliton mode-locked Kerr comb without the need for photodetection, paving the way for Kerr-comb-based photonic devices that can potentially operate in the desired mode-locked state indefinitely.</description>

      <title>Detection and characterization of targets in complex media using fingerprint matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When waves propagate through a complex medium, they undergo several scattering events. This phenomenon is detrimental to imaging, as it causes full blurring of the image. Here we describe a method for detecting, localizing and characterizing any scattering target embedded in a complex medium. We introduce a fingerprint operator that contains the specific signature of the target with respect to its environment. When applied to the recorded reflection matrix, it provides a likelihood index of the target state. This state can be the position of the target for localization purposes, its shape for characterization or any other parameter that influences its response. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by performing proof-of-concept ultrasound experiments on elastic spheres buried inside a strongly scattering granular suspension and on lesion markers, which are commonly used to monitor breast tumours, embedded in a foam mimicking soft tissue. Furthermore, we show how the fingerprint operator can be leveraged to characterize the complex medium itself by mapping the fibre architecture within muscle tissue. Our method is broadly applicable to different types of waves beyond ultrasound for which multi-element technology allows a reflection matrix to be measured.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Fourier-domain Quantum Optical Coherence Tomography for a fast tomographic quantum imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using spectrally correlated photon pairs instead of classical laser light and coincidence detection instead of light intensity detection, Quantum Optical Coherence Tomography (Q-OCT) outperforms classical OCT in several experimental terms. It provides twice better axial resolution with the same spectral bandwidth and it is immune to even-order chromatic dispersion, including Group Velocity Dispersion responsible for the bulk of axial resolution degradation in the OCT images. Q-OCT has been performed in the time domain configuration, where one line of the two-dimensional image is acquired by axially translating the mirror in the interferometer's reference arm and measuring the coincidence rate of photons arriving at two single-photon-sensitive detectors. Although successful at producing resolution-doubled and dispersion-cancelled images, it is still relatively slow and cannot compete with its classical counterpart. Here, we experimentally demonstrate Q-OCT in a much faster Fourier-domain configuration, theoretically proposed in 2020, where the reference mirror is fixed and the joint spectrum is acquired by inserting long fibre spools in front of the detectors. We propose two joint spectrum pre-processing algorithms, aimed at compensating resolution-degrading effects within the setup. While the first one targets fibre spool dispersion, an effect specific to this configuration, the other one removes the effects leading to the weakening of even-order dispersion cancellation, the latter impossible to be mitigated in the time-domain alternative. Being additionally contrasted with both the time-domain approach and the conventional OCT in terms of axial resolution, imaging range and multilayer-object imaging, Fourier-domain Q-OCT is shown to be a significant step forward towards a practical and competitive solution in the OCT arena.</description>
