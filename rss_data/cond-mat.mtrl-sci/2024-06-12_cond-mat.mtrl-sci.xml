      <title>Investigations of the Effects of Pressure on the Structural and Electronic Properties of Co$_2$VZ (Z = Al, Be) Full Heusler Alloy: A Comparative Study Using DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the investigations and comparative study of the electronic structure of Co$_2$VZ (Z=Al, Be) Heusler alloys under varying high pressure conditions. The pressure range explored spans from 0.0 GPa to 30.0GPa, with increments of 0.5GPa. The WIEN2K simulation program is used to investigate the effect of pressure on the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of Co$_2$VZ Heusler alloys. The WIEN2K simulation code with WC-GGA and mBJ exchange correlation potentials are used to investigate various features. The results of the WC-GGA exchange correlation potentials are then compared to earlier experimental and theoretical findings employed different exchange correlation potentials. The stability observed in the P-V plot indicates the absence of any structural phase transition from a cubic symmetry structure to another structural phase. The varying slopes observed in the band gap response to increasing pressure in different pressure ranges for studied alloys can be attributed to the predominance of either permittivity or quantum confinement effects.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized DFT calculations for physical properties of novel KVSb half-Heusler compound for spintronic and thermodynamic applicability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the reported study we have investigated the robust phase stability, elasto-mechanical, thermophysical and magnetic properties of KVSb half Heusler compound by implementing density functional theory models in Wien2k simulation package. The dynamic phase stability is computed in phase type I, II &amp; III phase configurations by optimising their energy. It is observed that given compound is more stable in spin-polarised state of phase type I. To explore the electronic band structure, we apply the generalised gradient approximation. The electronic band profile of the Heusler alloy display a half-metallic nature. Moreover, the calculated second-order elastic parameters divulge the ductile nature. To understand the thermodynamical and thermoelectric stability of the alloy at various temperature and pressures ranges we have utilised the Quasi-Harmonic Debye model. The computed value of magnetic moment found in good agreement with Slater-Pauling rule. Our findings confirms that the predicted half Heusler alloy can be used in various spintronics and thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of phase change accommodating hydrogen uptake in bimetallic nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen is a promising alternative to fossil fuel, however storing it efficiently poses challenges. One promising solution is to adsorb hydrogen on solid materials demonstrating quasi-molecular bonding with hydrogen. The hydrogen adsorption energy can be tuned by changing the morphology or stoichiometry of bimetallic nanoparticles. Here we used complementary techniques to unveil the chemical compositional and morphological transformation undergone by PdxNi100-x nanoparticles during H2 adsorption. Our findings reveal NiO-rich shell and Pd-rich core as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray scattering, and electron energy loss spectroscopy. During hydrogen adsorption, which mainly occurs on Pd atoms, the Pd-rich core fragments into small pockets, increasing its surface area. This process is more pronounced for nanoparticles with lower Pd loading, emphasizing the role of NiO. These results shed light on the atomic changes occurring in the PdxNi100-x nanoparticles during hydrogen adsorption and can be applicable on multi-metallic systems to improve hydrogen storage properties.</description>

      <title>Local aging effects in PuB$_{4}$: Growing inhomogeneity and slow dynamics of local-field fluctuations probed by $^{239}$Pu NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of self-irradiation damage can influence many properties of a radioactive material. Actinide materials involving the decay through alpha radiation have been frequently studied using techniques such as transport, thermodynamics, and x-ray diffraction. The use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to study such effects, however, has seen relatively little attention. Here, we use $^{239}$Pu NMR to study the local influence of self-damage in a single crystal of the candidate topological insulator plutonium tetraboride (PuB$_{4}$). We first characterize the anisotropy of the $^{239}$Pu resonance in a single crystal and confirm the local axial site symmetry inferred from previous polycrystalline measurements. Aging effects are then evaluated over the timeframe of six years. We find that, though the static NMR spectra may show a slight modulation in their shape, their field-rotation pattern reveals no change in Pu local site symmetry over time, suggesting that aging has a surprisingly small impact on the spatial distribution of the static hyperfine field. By contrast, aging has a prominent impact on the NMR relaxation processes and signal intensity. Specifically, aging-induced damage manifests itself as an increase in the spin-lattice relaxation time $T_{1}$, an increased distribution of $T_{1}$, and a signal intensity that decreases linearly by 20 % per year. The spin-spin relaxation time $T_{2}$ in the aged sample shows a strong variation across the spectrum as well as a drastic shortening towards lower temperature, suggesting growth of slow fluctuations of the hyperfine field that are linked to radiation-damage-induced inhomogeneity and could be responsible for the signal wipeout that develops over time.</description>

      <title>Additive engineering for Sb$_2$S$_3$ indoor photovoltaics with efficiency exceeding 17%</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) have attracted increasing attention for sustainably powering Internet of Things (IoT) electronics. Sb$_2$S$_3$ is a promising IPV candidate material with a bandgap of ~1.75 eV, which is near the optimal value for indoor energy harvesting. However, the performance of Sb$_2$S$_3$ solar cells is limited by nonradiative recombination, closely associated with the poor-quality absorber films. Additive engineering is an effective strategy to improved the properties of solution-processed films. This work shows that the addition of monoethanolamine (MEA) into the precursor solution allows the nucleation and growth of Sb$_2$S$_3$ films to be controlled, enabling the deposition of high-quality Sb$_2$S$_3$ absorbers with reduced grain boundary density, optimized band positions and increased carrier concentration. Complemented with computations, it is revealed that the incorporation of MEA leads to a more efficient and energetically favorable deposition for enhanced heterogeneous nucleation on the substrate, which increases the grain size and accelerates the deposition rate of Sb$_2$S$_3$ films. Due to suppressed carrier recombination and improved charge-carrier transport in Sb$_2$S$_3$ absorber films, the MEA-modulated Sb$_2$S$_3$ solar cell yields a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.22% under AM1.5G illumination, and an IPV PCE of 17.55% under 1000 lux white light emitting diode (WLED) illumination, which is the highest yet reported for Sb$_2$S$_3$ IPVs. Furthermore, we construct high performance large-area Sb$_2$S$_3$ IPV modules to power IoT wireless sensors, and realize the long-term continuous recording of environmental parameters under WLED illumination in an office. This work highlights the great prospect of Sb$_2$S$_3$ photovoltaics for indoor energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the local bandgap across InxGa1-xAs multiple quantum wells in a metamorphic laser via low-loss EELS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spatially resolved variations in the bandgap energy across multiple InxGa1-xAs quantum wells (QWs) on a GaAs substrate within a metamorphic laser structure. Using high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and low-loss electron energy loss spectroscopy, we present a detailed analysis of the local bandgap energy, indium concentration, and strain distribution within the QWs. Our findings reveal significant inhomogeneities, particularly near the interfaces, in both the strain and indium content, and a bandgap variability across QWs. These results are correlated with density functional theory simulations to further elucidate the interplay between strain, composition, and bandgap energy. This work underscores the importance of spatially resolved analysis in understanding, and optimising, the electronic and optical properties of semiconductor devices. The study suggests that the collective impact of individual QWs might affect the emission and performance of the final device, providing insights for the design of next-generation metamorphic lasers with multiple QWs as the active region.</description>

      <title>Hidden correlations in stochastic photoinduced dynamics of a solid-state electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoexcitation by ultrashort laser pulses plays a crucial role in controlling reaction pathways, creating nonequilibrium material properties, and offering a microscopic view of complex dynamics at the molecular level. The photo response following a laser pulse is, in general, non-identical between multiple exposures due to spatiotemporal fluctuations in a material or the stochastic nature of dynamical pathways. However, most ultrafast experiments using a stroboscopic pump-probe scheme struggle to distinguish intrinsic sample fluctuations from extrinsic apparatus noise, often missing seemingly random deviations from the averaged shot-to-shot response. Leveraging the stability and high photon-flux of time-resolved X-ray micro-diffraction at a synchrotron, we developed a method to quantitatively characterize the shot-to-shot variation of the photoinduced dynamics in a solid-state electrolyte. By analyzing temporal evolutions of the lattice parameter of a single grain in a powder ensemble, we found that the sample responses after different shots contain random fluctuations that are, however, not independent. Instead, there is a correlation between the nonequilibrium lattice trajectories following adjacent laser shots with a characteristic "correlation length" of approximately 1,500 shots, which represents an energy barrier of 0.38~eV for switching the photoinduced pathway, a value interestingly commensurate with the activation energy of lithium ion diffusion. Not only does our nonequilibrium noise correlation spectroscopy provide a new strategy for studying fluctuations that are central to phase transitions in both condensed matter and molecular systems, it also paves the way for discovering hidden correlations and novel metastable states buried in oft-presumed random, uncorrelated fluctuating dynamics.</description>

      <title>A way to identify whether a DFT gap is from right reasons or error cancellations: The case of copper chalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gap opening remains elusive in copper chalcogenides (Cu$_{2}X$, $X$ = S, Se and Te), not least because Hubbard + $U$, hybrid functional and ${GW}$ methods have also failed. In this work, we elucidate that their failure originates from a severe underestimation of the 4$s$-3$d$ orbital splitting of the Cu atom, which leads to a band-order inversion in the presence of an anionic crystal field. As a result, the Fermi energy is pinned due to symmetry, yielding an invariant zero gap. Utilizing the hybrid pseudopotentials to correct the underestimation on the atomic side opens up gaps of experimental magnitude in Cu$_{2}X$, suggesting their predominantly electronic nature. Our work not only clarifies the debate about the Cu$_{2}X$ gap, but also provides a way to identify which of the different methods really captures the physical essence and which is the result of error cancellation.</description>

      <title>Emergent Moir\'e fringes in direct-grown quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasicrystals represent a category of rarely structured solids that challenge traditional periodicity in crystal materials. Recent advancements in the synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials have paved the way for exploring the unique physical properties of these systems. Here, we report on the synthesis of 2D quasicrystals featuring 30{\deg} alternating twist angles between multiple graphene layers, using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Strikingly, we observed periodic Moir\'e patterns in the quasicrystal, a finding that has not been previously reported in traditional alloy-based quasicrystals. The Moir\'e periodicity, varying with the parity of the constituent layers, aligns with the theoretical predictions that suggest a stress cancellation mechanism in force. The emergence of Moir\'e fringes is attributed to the spontaneous mismatched lattice constant in the oriented graphene layers, proving the existence of atomic relaxation. This phenomenon, which has been largely understudied in graphene systems with large twist angles, has now been validated through our use of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Our CVD-grown Moir\'e quasicrystal provides an ideal platform for exploring the unusual physical properties that arise from Moir\'e periodicity within quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Ion Energy Tuning for Enhanced sp3 Carbon Fraction in Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Beam Deposited Diamond-Like Carbon Coatings: a Computational and Experimental Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel high-energy electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion beam deposition (IBD) technique was used to fabricate DLC films at different ion beam energies. The ratios of sp2/sp3 bonding in the DLC coatings were determined by Raman spectroscopy and XPS, with the confirmation of being hydrogen-free due to the lack of photoluminescence (PL) background in the Raman spectra. The results indicate that the sp3 percentage ranges from 45% - 85% for the ECR-IBD fabricated DLC films in this study. Monte-Carlo based SRIM simulation was used to extract the energy and angular distribution of the sputtered particles from the carbon target and correlate it to the highest sp3 fraction in the manufactured ECR-IBD DLCs. This study demonstrates a method of depositing DLC thin films under ambient conditions (room temperature with no post-annealing or additional bias voltage applied) which produces high-sp3 coatings (higher than those traditionally reported for other sputtering methods) suitable for applications where high quality DLC coatings are required.</description>

      <title>Machine learning potential for the Cu-W system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining the excellent thermal and electrical properties of Cu with the high abrasion resistance and thermal stability of W, Cu-W nanoparticle-reinforced metal matrix composites and nano-multilayers (NMLs) are finding applications as brazing fillers and shielding material for plasma and radiation. Due to the large lattice mismatch between fcc Cu and bcc W, these systems have complex interfaces that are beyond the scales suitable for ab initio methods, thus motivating the development of chemically accurate interatomic potentials. Here, a neural network potential (NNP) for Cu-W is developed within the Behler-Parrinello framework using a curated training dataset that captures metallurgically-relevant local atomic environments. The Cu-W NNP accurately predicts (i) the metallurgical properties (elasticity, stacking faults, dislocations, thermodynamic behavior) in elemental Cu and W, (ii) energies and structures of Cu-W intermetallics and solid solutions, and (iii) a range of fcc Cu/bcc W interfaces, and exhibits physically-reasonable behavior for solid W/liquid Cu systems. As will be demonstrated in forthcoming work, this near-ab initio-accurate NNP can be applied to understand complex phenomena involving interface-driven processes and properties in Cu-W composites.</description>

      <title>Pushing an Altermagnet to the Ultimate 2D Limit: Evidence of Symmetry Breaking in Monolayers of GdAlSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets have emerged as a class of materials combining certain ferromagnetic properties with zero net magnetization. This combination is highly promising for spintronics, especially if a material can be brought to a nanoscale size. However, experimental studies of the 2D limit of altermagnets and evolution of their properties with thickness are lacking. Here, we study epitaxial films on silicon of the Weyl altermagnet GdAlSi ranging from more than a hundred unit cells to a single unit cell. The films are synthesized by molecular beam epitaxy and, expectedly, do not show any discernible net magnetic moments. Electron transport studies reveal a remarkable transformation of the electron state with the film thickness. Thick films exhibit negative longitudinal magnetoresistance associated with the chiral anomaly but do not demonstrate altermagnetic properties in electron transport due to symmetry restrictions. In ultrathin films, a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect manifests itself, indicating a non-relativistic spin splitting in the electronic structure. The transformation is associated with crystal symmetry breaking accompanying the 3D-to-2D crossover. The work highlights the role of dimensionality in altermagnetism and provides a platform for studies of altermagnets aiming at ultra-compact spintronics.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram of growth modes in Graphene Growth on Cooper by Vapor Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the atomistic mechanism in graphene growth is crucial for controlling the number of layers or domain sizes to meet practical needs. In this work, focusing on the growth of graphene by chemical vapor deposition on copper substrates, the surface kinetics in the growth are systematically investigated by first-principles calculations. The phase diagram, predicting whether the growth mode is monolayer graphene or bilayer graphene under various experimental conditions, is constructed based on classical nucleation theory. Our phase diagram well illustrates the effect of high hydrogen pressure on bilayer graphene growth and clarifies the mechanism of the most widely used experimental growth approaches. The phase diagram can provide guidance and predictions for experiments and inspires the study of other two-dimensional materials with graphene-like growth mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Localized Orbital Scaling Correction with Linear Response in Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07351v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful tool for quantum-mechanical calculations, but practical calculations suffer systematic errors like incorrect charge densities and total energies in molecular dissociation, underestimated band gaps in bulk materials, and poor energy level alignment at interfaces. These problems are due to delocalization error. The localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) removes delocalization error in molecules effectively, but screening of the Hartree-exchange-correlation response is necessary to correct it in materials. We introduce LOSC with system-dependent linear-response screening (lrLOSC), which effectively corrects delocalization error in semiconductors and insulators. After correcting for electron-phonon effects, the band gaps of eleven test systems are predicted with a mean absolute error of 0.28 eV, comparable to self-consistent $GW$. This method represents a significant step forward in correcting densities and total energies across system sizes and solving the band gap and energy level alignment problems entirely within the DFT framework.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and limitations of the bond polarizability model in modeling of Raman scattering from molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculation of Raman scattering from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations requires accurate modeling of the evolution of the electronic polarizability of the system along its MD trajectory. For large systems, this necessitates the use of atomistic models to represent the dependence of electronic polarizability on atomic coordinates. The bond polarizability model (BPM) is the simplest such model and has been used for modeling the Raman spectra of molecular systems but has not been applied to solid-state systems. Here, we systematically investigate the accuracy and limitations of the BPM parameterized from density functional theory (DFT) results for a series of simple molecules such as CO2, SO2, H2S, H2O, NH3, and CH4, the more complex CH2O, CH3OH and CH3CH2OH and thiophene molecules and the BaTiO3 and CsPbBr3 perovskite solids. We find that BPM can reliably reproduce the overall features of the Raman spectra such as shifts of peak positions. However, with the exception of highly symmetric systems, the assumption of non-interacting bonds limits the quantitative accuracy of the BPM; this assumption also leads to qualitatively inaccurate polarizability evolution and Raman spectra for systems where large deviations from the ground state structure are present.</description>

      <title>Interacting-bath dynamical embedding for capturing non-local electron correlation in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative simulation of electronic structure of solids requires the treatment of local and non-local electron correlations on an equal footing. Dynamical mean-field theory, a widely-used quantum embedding algorithm that assumes local self-energy approximation, is challenging to extend to capture long-range electron correlation. In this work, we present a new formulation of Green's function embedding that, instead of embedding the impurity in non-interacting bath through the hybridization function, derives bath representation with general two-particle interactions in a fully ab initio and systematically improvable manner. The resulting interacting-bath dynamical embedding theory (ibDET) simulates local and non-local self-energies using high-level quantum chemistry solvers, such as the coupled-cluster theory. We demonstrate that ibDET combined with the GW theory (GW+ibDET) achieves good agreements with experimental band structure and photoemission spectra while preserving translational symmetry across a range of semiconducting, insulating, and metallic materials. Furthermore, our approach allows quantifying the role of non-local electron correlation in determining spectral properties of materials and addressing the long-standing debate over the bandwidth narrowing of metallic sodium.</description>

      <title>Cross Validation in Stochastic Analytic Continuation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Analytic Continuation (SAC) of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) imaginary-time correlation function data is a valuable tool in connecting many-body models to experiments. Recent developments of the SAC method have allowed for spectral functions with sharp features, e.g. narrow peaks and divergent edges, to be resolved with unprecedented fidelity. Often times, it is not known what exact sharp features are present a priori, and, due to the ill-posed nature of the analytic continuation problem, multiple spectral representations may be acceptable. In this work, we borrow from the machine learning and statistics literature and implement a cross validation technique to provide an unbiased method to identify the most likely spectrum. We show examples using imaginary-time data generated by QMC simulations and synthetic data generated from artificial spectra. Our procedure, which can be considered a form of "model selection," can be applied to a variety of numerical analytic continuation methods, beyond just SAC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of quantum weight as a fundamental property of quantum many-body systems that is encoded in the ground-state static structure factor and characterizes density fluctuation at long wavelength. We show that quantum weight of three-dimensional electron systems is related by a sum rule to the inverse dielectric function, which describes electron energy loss spectrum. Using this relation, we derive an upper and a lower bound on the quantum weight of real materials in terms of their electron density, static dielectric constant, and plasmon energy. For systems with short-range interactions or Coulomb systems in reduced dimensions, we derive a sum rule relating the quantum weight to the optical conductivity and establish a remarkable connection with the quantum geometry of many-body ground states. Our work highlights quantum weight as a key material parameter that can be experimentally determined.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable Magnetoconductance of Close-Packed CVD Bilayer Graphene Layer Stacking Walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum valley Hall (QVH) domain wall states are a new class of one-dimensional (1D) one-way conductors that are topologically protected in the absence of valley mixing. Development beyond a single QVH channel raises important new questions as to how QVH channels in close spatial proximity interact with each other, and how that interaction may be controlled. Scalable epitaxial bilayer graphene synthesis produces layer stacking wall (LSW) bundles, where QVH channels are bound, providing an excellent platform to study QVH channel interactions. Here we show that distinct strain sources lead to the formation of both well-separated LSWs and close packed LSW bundles. Comparative studies of electronic transport in these two regimes reveal that close-packed LSW bundles support electrically tunable magnetoconductance. The coexistence of different strain sources offers a potential pathway to realize scalable quantum transport platform based on LSWs where electrically tunability enables programmable functionality.</description>

      <title>Half Heusler alloy CoVSn as self-supported electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in electrocatalysis for clean hydrogen fuel generation, the transition from concept to commercialization faces challenges due to the instability of electrocatalysts. This study delves into the exploration of a structurally and mechanically robust half-Heusler alloy, CoVSn, as an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen production. The synthesis of CoVSn was achieved using the arc-melting technique and optimized successfully into a cubic structure - a previously unattained and highly challenging feat. The resulting electrode, cut from the obtained CoVSn pellet, served as a self-supported electrocatalyst and initially generates a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 244 mV. Remarkably, this overpotential decreased uniquely over time, reaches 202 mV after a durability testing of 12 hours, while maintaining its crystal structure integrity after the electrocatalysis process. This progressive enhancement in catalytic activity and structural stability underscores the significance of this research. The synergistic effect between Co and V atoms as pivotal active centers for hydrogen generation was evident, further enhanced by formation of high valance metal sites Co2O3 and V2O3 during the hydrogen evolution reaction. In essence, this study confirms the stability and promise of CoVSn in hydrogen generation, paving the way for exploring additional self-supported ternary intermetallics to enhance water-splitting efficiency.</description>

      <title>Anomalous propagators and the particle-particle channel: Hedin's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hedin's equations provide an elegant route to compute the exact one-body Green's function (or propagator) via the self-consistent iteration of a set of non-linear equations.
  Its first-order approximation, known as $GW$, corresponds to a resummation of ring diagrams and has shown to be extremely successful in physics and chemistry. Systematic improvement is possible, although challenging, via the introduction of vertex corrections.
  Considering anomalous propagators and an external pairing potential, we derive a new self-consistent set of closed equations equivalent to the famous Hedin equations but having as a first-order approximation the particle-particle (pp) $T$-matrix approximation where one performs a resummation of the ladder diagrams.
  This pp version of Hedin's equations offers a way to go systematically beyond the $T$-matrix approximation by accounting for low-order pp vertex corrections.</description>

      <title>High-purity and stable single-photon emission in bilayer WSe$_2$ via phonon-assisted excitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excitation scheme is essential for single-photon sources as it prepares the exciton state, defines the decay dynamics, and influences the spectral diffusion of the emitted single photons. Here, we investigate the impact of different optical excitation strategies on the single-photon emission characteristics of bilayer WSe$_2$ quantum emitters. Under phonon-assisted excitation, we achieve narrow and stable single-photon emission with an excellent purity reaching $ 0.94\pm 0.02\,$. Furthermore, the decay time is reduced by more than an order of magnitude from $(16.65 \pm 2.39)\,$ns for above-band excitation to $(1.33 \pm 0.04)\,$ns for phonon-assisted excitation. Finally, we observe a suppressed spectral wandering along with a two-fold reduction of the spectral linewidth. Our comprehensive investigation highlights the critical role of the excitation method in optimizing the performance of WSe$_2$-based quantum emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-component aggregates are being intensively researched in various fields because of their highly tunable properties and wide applications. Due to the complex configurational space of these systems, research would greatly benefit from a general theoretical framework for the prediction of stable structures, which, however, is largely incomplete at present. Here we propose a general theory for the construction of multi-component icosahedral structures by assembling concentric shells of different chiral and achiral types, consisting of particles of different sizes. By mapping shell sequences into paths in the hexagonal lattice, we establish simple and general rules for building a wide variety of magic icosahedral structures, and we evaluate the optimal size-mismatch between particles in the different shells. Our predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations for different systems.</description>

      <title>From many-body ab initio to effective excitonic models: a versatile mapping approach including environmental embedding effects</title>

Abstract: We present an original multi-state projective diabatization scheme based on the Green's function formalism that allows the systematic mapping of many-body ab initio calculations onto effective excitonic models. This method inherits the ability of the Bethe-Salpeter equation to describe Frenkel molecular excitons and intermolecular charge-transfer states equally well, as well as the possibility for an effective description of environmental effects in a QM/MM framework. The latter is found to be a crucial element in order to obtain accurate model parameters for condensed phases and to ensure their transferability to excitonic models for extended systems. The method is presented through a series of examples illustrating its quality, robustness, and internal consistency.</description>

      <title>Optical and Electrical Properties of Diamond-like-Carbon Coatings Prepared by Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Beam Deposition Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamond-like carbon thin films have emerged as durable, chemically stable optical coatings for many optical and optoelectronics applications due to their hardness, chemical inertness, and optical transparency. This paper presents a novel high-energy electron cyclotron resonance ion beam sputter deposition technique to fabricate pure diamond-like carbon coatings at room temperature. The chemical composition of the deposited coatings including ratios of sp2/sp3 bonding in the thin films were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Results indicate that the sp3 percentage ranges from 45% - 85%. The transmission and reflectance spectra of the coatings were measured from UV to IR ({\lambda}= 185 to 2500 nm) by utilizing a spectrophotometer. The measured spectra were analysed by the Tauc method to determine the optical band gap and Urbach energy and an optical fitting software, which utilizes the model modified by OJL, to extract the refractive index and extinction coefficient. By varying the ion energy, the optical properties were found to be n = 2.30 - 2.51, band gap energy = 0.4 - 0.68 eV, and the Urbach energy = 0.33 - 0.49 eV. This study provides a flexible method for tuning the structural, optical, and electronic properties of diamond-like carbon coatings by controlling the ion energy during deposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photo-doped Mott insulators can exhibit novel photocarrier transport and relaxation dynamics and non-equilibrium phases. However, time-resolved real-space imaging of these processes are still lacking. Here, we use scanning ultrafast electron microscopy (SUEM) to directly visualize the spatial-temporal evolution of photoexcited species in a spin-orbit assisted Mott insulator {\alpha}-RuCl3. At low optical fluences, we observe extremely long hot photocarrier transport time over one nanosecond, almost an order of magnitude longer than any known values in conventional semiconductors. At higher optical fluences, we observe nonlinear features suggesting a photo-induced insulator-to-metal transition, which is unusual in a large-gap Mott insulator. Our results demonstrate the rich physics in a photo-doped Mott insulator that can be extracted from spatial-temporal imaging and showcase the capability of SUEM to sensitively probe photoexcitations in strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Strong Repulsive Lifshitz-van der Waals Forces on Suspended Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding surface forces of two-dimensional (2D) materials is of fundamental importance as they govern molecular dynamics and atomic deposition in nanoscale proximity. Despite recent observations in wetting transparency and remote epitaxy on substrate-supported graphene, very little is known about the many-body effects on their van der Waals (vdW) interactions, such as the role of surrounding vacuum in wettability of suspended 2D monolayers. Here we report on a stark repulsive Lifshitz-van der Waals (vdW) force generated at surfaces of suspended 2D materials, arising from quantum fluctuation coupled with the atomic thickness and birefringence of 2D monolayer. In combination with our theoretical framework taking into account the many-body Lifshitz formulism, we present direct measurement of Lifshitz-vdW repulsion on suspended graphene using atomic force microscopy. We report a repulsive force of up to 1.4 kN/m$^2$ at a separation of 8.8 nm between a gold-coated AFM tip and a sheet of suspended graphene, more than two orders of magnitude greater than the Casimir-Lifshitz repulsion demonstrated in fluids. Our findings suggest that suspended 2D materials are intrinsically repulsive surfaces with substantially lowered wettability. The amplified Lifshitz-vdW repulsion could offer technological opportunities such as molecular actuation and controlled atomic assembly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremal elastic materials here refer to a specific class of elastic materials whose elastic matrices exhibit one or more zero eigenvalues, resulting in soft deformation modes that, in principle, cost no energy. They can be approximated through artificially designed solid microstructures. Extremal elastic materials have exotic bulk wave properties unavailable with conventional solids due to the soft modes, offering unprecedented opportunities for manipulating bulk waves, e.g., acting as phonon polarizers for elastic waves or invisibility cloaks for underwater acoustic waves. Despite their potential, Rayleigh surface waves, crucially linked to bulk wave behaviors of such extremal elastic materials, have largely remained unexplored so far. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the propagation of Rayleigh waves in extremal elastic materials based on continuum theory and verify our findings with designed microstructure metamaterials based on pantographic structures. Dispersion relations and polarizations of Rayleigh waves in extremal elastic materials are derived, and the impact of higher order gradient effects is also investigated by using strain gradient theory. This study provides a continuum model for exploring surface waves in extremal elastic materials and may stimulate applications of extremal elastic materials for controlling surface waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the realization of magnon-based current-free technologies, referred to as magnonics, all-optical control of magnons is an important technique for both fundamental research and practical applications. Magnon-polariton is a coupled state of magnon and photon in a magnetic medium, expected to exhibit magnon-like controllability and photon-like high-speed propagation. While recent studies have observed magnon-polaritons as modulation of incident terahertz waves, the influence of magnon-photon coupling on magnon propagation properties remains unexplored. This study aimed to observe the spatiotemporal dynamics of coherent magnon-polaritons through time-resolved imaging measurements. BiFeO$_3$ was selected as the sample due to its anticipated strong coupling between magnons and photons. The observed dynamics suggest that antiferromagnetic magnons can propagate over long distances, up to hundreds of micrometers, through strong coupling with photons. These results enhance our understanding of the optical control of magnonic systems, thereby paving the way for terahertz opto-magnonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07523v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtually noiseless due to the scarcity of spinful nuclei in the lattice, simple oxides hold promise as hosts of solid-state spin qubits. However, no suitable spin defect has yet been found in these systems. Using high-throughput first-principles calculations, we predict spin defects in calcium oxide with electronic properties remarkably similar to those of the NV center in diamond. These defects are charged complexes where a dopant atom -- Sb, Bi, or I -- occupies the volume vacated by adjacent cation and anion vacancies. The predicted zero phonon line shows that the Bi complex emits in the telecommunication range, and the computed many-body energy levels suggest a viable optical cycle required for qubit initialization. Notably, the high-spin nucleus of each dopant strongly couples to the electron spin, leading to many controllable quantum levels and the emergence of atomic clock-like transitions that are well protected from environmental noise. Specifically, the Hanh-echo coherence time increases beyond seconds at the clock-like transition in the defect with \ch{^{209}Bi}. Our results pave the way to designing quantum states with long coherence times in simple oxides, making them attractive platforms for quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Color centers in diamond are at the forefront of the second quantum revolution. A handful of defects are in use, and finding ones with all the desired properties for quantum applications is arduous. By using high-throughput calculations, we screen 21607 defects in diamond and collect the results in the ADAQ database. Upon exploring this database, we find not only the known defects but also several unexplored defects. Specifically, defects containing sodium stand out as particularly relevant because of their high spins and predicted improved optical properties compared to the NV center. Hence, we studied these in detail, employing high-accuracy theoretical calculations. The single sodium substitutional (Na$\mathrm{_C}$) has various charge states with spin ranging from 0.5 to 1.5, ZPL in the near-infrared, and a high Debye-Waller factor, making it ideal for biological quantum applications. The sodium vacancy (NaV) has a ZPL in the visible region and a potential rare spin-2 ground state. Our results show sodium implantation yields many interesting spin defects that are valuable additions to the arsenal of point defects in diamond studied for quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Multiferroic quantum criticality in (Eu,Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ solid solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the earlier published theory (\textit{Nature Mat}. \textbf{18}, 223--228 (2019)), a comprehensive experimental investigation of multiferroic quantum critical behavior of (Eu,Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ polycrystalline and single crystal samples was performed. Presence of the displacive ferroelectric quantum criticality is revealed through non-classical ($T^2$) temperature scaling of inverse dielectric susceptibility up to 60\,K. With increasing hydrostatic pressure, this ferroelectric quantum criticality is gradually suppressed. Inverse magnetic susceptibility follows classical Curie-Weiss law down to 4 K, but quantum fluctuations belonging to an antiferromagnetic phase transition ($T_{\mathrm{N}} &lt; 0.8$ K) change its scaling below 3 K to $T^{(1.7\pm 0.1)}$ and $T^{(2.1\pm 0.2)}$ for samples containing 29\,\% and 25\,\% of Eu$^{2+}$ ions, respectively. Experimental indications of the coexisting ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic, i.e. multiferroic, quantum fluctuations and qualitative explanation why they could be seen only in the immediate proximity of $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ is given.</description>

      <title>Microwave magnetic excitations in U-type hexaferrite Sr$_4$CoZnFe$_{36}$O$_{60}$ ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microwave (MW) transmission, absorption, and reflection loss spectra of the ferrimagnetic U-type hexaferrite Sr$_4$CoZnFe$_{36}$O$_{60}$ ceramics were studied from 100 MHz to 35 GHz at temperatures between 10 and 390 K. 9 MW magnetic excitations with anomalous behavior near the ferrimagnetic phase transitions were revealed. They also change under the application of weak bias magnetic field (0 - 700 Oe) at room temperature. 6 pure magnetic modes are assigned to dynamics of the magnetic domain walls and inhomogeneous magnetic structure of the ceramics, to the natural ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and to the higher-frequency magnons. 3 modes are considered as the magnetodielectric ones with dominating influence of the magnetic properties on their temperature and field dependences. Presence of the natural FMR in all ferrimagnetic phases proves existence of the non-zero internal magnetization and magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Splitting of the FMR into the two components without magnetic bias was observed in the collinear phase and is attributed to a change of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy during the phase transition. The high-frequency FMR component critically slows down to the phase transition. At room temperature, the FMR splitting and essential suppression of the higher-frequency modes was revealed under the weak bias field (300 - 700 Oe). The highly nonlinear MW response and the FMR splitting are caused by the gradual evolution of the polydomain magnetic structure to a monodomain one. The high number of magnetic excitations observed in the MW region confirms the suitability of using hexaferrite Sr$_4$CoZnFe$_{36}$O$_{60}$ ceramics as MW absorbers, shielding materials and highly tunable filters.</description>

      <title>Predictive power of polynomial machine learning potentials for liquid states in 22 elemental systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polynomial machine learning potentials (MLPs) described by polynomial rotational invariants have been systematically developed for various systems and used in diverse applications in crystalline states. In this study, we systematically investigate the predictive power of the polynomial MLPs for liquid structural properties in 22 elemental systems with diverse chemical bonding properties, including those showing anomalous melting behavior, such as Si, Ge, and Bi. We compare liquid structural properties obtained from molecular dynamics simulations using the density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the polynomial MLPs, and other interatomic potentials in the literature. The current results demonstrate that the polynomial MLPs consistently exhibit high predictive power for liquid structural properties with the same accuracy as that of typical DFT calculations.</description>

      <title>Prediction of stable nanoscale skyrmions in monolayer Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations and atomistic spin simulations, we predict stable isolated skyrmions with a diameter below 10 nm in a monolayer of the two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$, a material of significant experimental interest. A very large Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is observed due to the intrinsic broken inversion symmetry and strong spin-orbit coupling for monolayer Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$. We show that the nearest-neighbor approximation, often used in literature, fails to describe the DMI. The strong DMI together with moderate in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy allows to stabilize nanoscale skyrmions in out-of-plane magnetic fields above $\approx 2$~T. The energy barriers of skyrmions in monolayer Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ are comparable to those of state-of-the-art transition-metal ultra-thin films. We further predict that these nanoscale skyrmions can be stable for hours at temperatures up to 20 K.</description>

      <title>Crystal structure, properties and pressure-induced insulator-metal transition in layered kagome chalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Layered materials with kagome lattice have attracted a lot of attention due to the presence of nontrivial topological bands and correlated electronic states with tunability. In this work, we investigate a unique van der Waals (vdW) material system, $A_{2}M_{3}X_{4}$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs; $M$ = Ni, Pd; $X$ = S, Se), where transition metal kagome lattices, chalcogen honeycomb lattices and alkali metal triangular lattices coexist simultaneously. A notable feature of this material is that each Ni/Pd atom is positioned in the center of four chalcogen atoms, forming a local square-planar environment. This crystal field environment results in a low spin state $S$ = 0 of Ni$^{2+}$/Pd$^{2+}$. A systematic study of the crystal growth, crystal structure, magnetic and transport properties of two representative compounds, Rb$_{2}$Ni$_{3}$S$_{4}$ and Cs$_{2}$Ni$_{3}$Se$_{4}$, has been carried out on powder and single crystal samples. Both compounds exhibit nonmagnetic $p$-type semiconducting behavior, closely related to the particular chemical environment of Ni$^{2+}$ ions and the alkali metal intercalated vdW structure. Additionally, Cs$_{2}$Ni$_{3}$Se$_{4}$ undergoes an insulator-metal transition (IMT) in transport measurements under pressure up to 87.10 GPa without any structural phase transition, while Rb$_{2}$Ni$_{3}$S$_{4}$ persists in its semiconducting behavior.</description>

      <title>CatTSunami: Accelerating Transition State Energy Calculations with Pre-trained Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct access to transition state energies at low computational cost unlocks the possibility of accelerating catalyst discovery. We show that the top performing graph neural network potential trained on the OC20 dataset, a related but different task, is able to find transition states energetically similar (within 0.1 eV) to density functional theory (DFT) 91% of the time with a 28x speedup. This speaks to the generalizability of the models, having never been explicitly trained on reactions, the machine learned potential approximates the potential energy surface well enough to be performant for this auxiliary task. We introduce the Open Catalyst 2020 Nudged Elastic Band (OC20NEB) dataset, which is made of 932 DFT nudged elastic band calculations, to benchmark machine learned model performance on transition state energies. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we replicated a well-known, large reaction network with 61 intermediates and 174 dissociation reactions at DFT resolution (40 meV). In this case of dense NEB enumeration, we realize even more computational cost savings and used just 12 GPU days of compute, where DFT would have taken 52 GPU years, a 1500x speedup. Similar searches for complete reaction networks could become routine using the approach presented here. Finally, we replicated an ammonia synthesis activity volcano and systematically found lower energy configurations of the transition states and intermediates on six stepped unary surfaces. This scalable approach offers a more complete treatment of configurational space to improve and accelerate catalyst discovery.</description>

      <title>Progress in Computational Understanding of Ferroelectric Mechanisms in HfO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the first report of ferroelectricity in nanoscale HfO$_2$-based thin films in 2011, this silicon-compatible binary oxide has quickly garnered intense interest in academia and industry, and continues to do so. Despite its deceivingly simple chemical composition, the ferroelectric physics supported by HfO$_2$ is remarkably complex, arguably rivaling that of perovskite ferroelectrics. Computational investigations, especially those utilizing first-principles density functional theory (DFT), have significantly advanced our understanding of the nature of ferroelectricity in these thin films. In this review, we provide an in-depth discussion of the computational efforts to understand ferroelectric hafnia, comparing various metastable polar phases and examining the critical factors necessary for their stabilization. The intricate nature of HfO$_2$ is intimately related to the complex interplay among diverse structural polymorphs, dopants and their charge-compensating oxygen vacancies, and unconventional switching mechanisms of domains and domain walls, which can sometimes yield conflicting theoretical predictions and theoretical-experimental discrepancies. We also discuss opportunities enabled by machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics and phase-field simulations to go beyond DFT modeling, probing the dynamical properties of ferroelectric HfO$_2$ and tackling pressing issues such as high coercive fields.</description>

      <title>The Spin Point Groups and their Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12784v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin point groups are finite groups whose elements act on both real space and spin space. Among these groups are the magnetic point groups in the case where the real and spin space operations are locked to one another. The magnetic point groups are central to magnetic crystallography for strong spin-orbit coupled systems and the spin point groups generalize these to the intermediate and weak spin-orbit coupled cases. The spin point groups were introduced in the 1960's and enumerated shortly thereafter. In this paper, we complete the theory of spin point groups by presenting an account of these groups and their representation theory. Our main findings are that the so-called nontrivial spin point groups (numbering 598 groups) have co-irreps corresponding exactly to the (co-)irreps of regular or black and white groups and we tabulate this correspondence for each nontrivial group. However a total spin group, comprising the product of a nontrivial group and a spin-only group, has new co-irreps in cases where there is continuous rotational freedom. We provide explicit co-irrep tables for all these instances. We also discuss new forms of spin-only group extending the Litvin-Opechowski classes. To exhibit the usefulness of these groups to physically relevant problems we discuss a number of examples from electronic band structures of altermagnets to magnons.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and magnetic correlations in trilayer nickelate superconductor La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that under pressure trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ (LNO) becomes superconducting below a critical temperature $\sim$20 K, in addition to the infinite-layer and bilayer systems. Motivated by this observation, we explore the effects of electron correlations on its electronic structure and magnetic properties using the advanced DFT+dynamical mean-field theory approach. Our results for the normal-state electronic structure and correlation effects in LNO have much in common with the infinite-layer and bilayer nickelates, with a remarkable site- and orbital-dependent renormalizations of the Ni $3d$ bands and notable incoherence of the Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states, caused by correlation effects. Our analysis of the Fermi surface and magnetic correlations suggests the emergence of competing spin and charge stripe states, implying the importance of in-plane spin fluctuations to explain superconductivity in this material.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Scientific Discovery with Generative Knowledge Extraction, Graph-Based Representation, and Multimodal Intelligent Graph Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), we have transformed a dataset comprising 1,000 scientific papers into an ontological knowledge graph. Through an in-depth structural analysis, we have calculated node degrees, identified communities and connectivities, and evaluated clustering coefficients and betweenness centrality of pivotal nodes, uncovering fascinating knowledge architectures. The graph has an inherently scale-free nature, is highly connected, and can be used for graph reasoning by taking advantage of transitive and isomorphic properties that reveal unprecedented interdisciplinary relationships that can be used to answer queries, identify gaps in knowledge, propose never-before-seen material designs, and predict material behaviors. We compute deep node embeddings for combinatorial node similarity ranking for use in a path sampling strategy links dissimilar concepts that have previously not been related. One comparison revealed structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven's 9th Symphony, highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping. In another example, the algorithm proposed a hierarchical mycelium-based composite based on integrating path sampling with principles extracted from Kandinsky's 'Composition VII' painting. The resulting material integrates an innovative set of concepts that include a balance of chaos/order, adjustable porosity, mechanical strength, and complex patterned chemical functionalization. We uncover other isomorphisms across science, technology and art, revealing a nuanced ontology of immanence that reveal a context-dependent heterarchical interplay of constituents. Graph-based generative AI achieves a far higher degree of novelty, explorative capacity, and technical detail, than conventional approaches and establishes a widely useful framework for innovation by revealing hidden connections.</description>
