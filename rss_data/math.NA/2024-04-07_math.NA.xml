      <title>A general formulation of reweighted least squares fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalized formulation for reweighted least squares approximations. The goal of this article is twofold: firstly, to prove that the solution of such problem can be expressed as a convex combination of certain interpolants when the solution is sought in any finite-dimensional vector space; secondly, to provide a general strategy to iteratively update the weights according to the approximation error and apply it to the spline fitting problem. In the experiments, we provide numerical examples for the case of polynomials and splines spaces. Subsequently, we evaluate the performance of our fitting scheme for spline curve and surface approximation, including adaptive spline constructions.</description>

      <title>Robust finite element solvers for distributed hyperbolic optimal control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose, analyze, and test new robust iterative solvers for systems of linear algebraic equations arising from the space-time finite element discretization of reduced optimality systems defining the approximate solution of hyperbolic distributed, tracking-type optimal control problems with both the standard $L^2$ and the more general energy regularizations. In contrast to the usual time-stepping approach, we discretize the optimality system by space-time continuous piecewise-linear finite element basis functions which are defined on fully unstructured simplicial meshes. If we aim at the asymptotically best approximation of the given desired state $y_d$ by the computed finite element state $y_{\varrho h}$, then the optimal choice of the regularization parameter $\varrho$ is linked to the space-time finite element mesh-size $h$ by the relations $\varrho=h^4$ and $\varrho=h^2$ for the $L^2$ and the energy regularization, respectively. For this setting, we can construct robust (parallel) iterative solvers for the reduced finite element optimality systems. These results can be generalized to variable regularization parameters adapted to the local behavior of the mesh-size that can heavily change in the case of adaptive mesh refinements. The numerical results illustrate the theoretical findings firmly.</description>

      <title>Learning smooth functions in high dimensions: from sparse polynomials to deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning approximations to smooth target functions of many variables from finite sets of pointwise samples is an important task in scientific computing and its many applications in computational science and engineering. Despite well over half a century of research on high-dimensional approximation, this remains a challenging problem. Yet, significant advances have been made in the last decade towards efficient methods for doing this, commencing with so-called sparse polynomial approximation methods and continuing most recently with methods based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In tandem, there have been substantial advances in the relevant approximation theory and analysis of these techniques. In this work, we survey this recent progress. We describe the contemporary motivations for this problem, which stem from parametric models and computational uncertainty quantification; the relevant function classes, namely, classes of infinite-dimensional, Banach-valued, holomorphic functions; fundamental limits of learnability from finite data for these classes; and finally, sparse polynomial and DNN methods for efficiently learning such functions from finite data. For the latter, there is currently a significant gap between the approximation theory of DNNs and the practical performance of deep learning. Aiming to narrow this gap, we develop the topic of practical existence theory, which asserts the existence of dimension-independent DNN architectures and training strategies that achieve provably near-optimal generalization errors in terms of the amount of training data.</description>

      <title>Some observations regarding the RBF-FD approximation accuracy dependence on stencil size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When solving partial differential equations on scattered nodes using the Radial Basis Function-generated Finite Difference (RBF-FD) method, one of the parameters that must be chosen is the stencil size. Focusing on Polyharmonic Spline RBFs with monomial augmentation, we observe that it affects the approximation accuracy in a particularly interesting way - the solution error oscillates under increasing stencil size. We find that we can connect this behaviour with the spatial dependence of the signed approximation error. Based on this observation we are able to introduce a numerical quantity that could indicate whether a given stencil size is locally optimal. This work is an extension of our ICCS 2023 conference paper.</description>

      <title>A mean correction for improved phase-averaging accuracy in oscillatory, multiscale, differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new algorithm to improve the accuracy of numerical phase-averaging in oscillatory, multiscale, differential equations. Phase-averaging is a technique that applies averaging to a mapped variable to remove highly oscillatory linear terms from the differential equation. This retains the main contribution of fast oscillations on the low frequencies without needing to resolve the rapid oscillations themselves. However, this comes at the cost of an averaging error, which we aim to offset with a modified mapping. The new mapping includes a mean correction which encodes an average measure of the nonlinear interactions. This mapping was introduced in Tao (2019) for weak nonlinearity and relied on classical time averaging. Our algorithm extends this work to the case where 1) the nonlinearity is not weak but the linear oscillations are fast and 2) finite averaging windows are applied via a smooth kernel, which has the advantage of retaining low frequencies whilst still eliminating the fastest oscillations. We show that the new algorithm reduces phase errors in the mapped variable for the swinging spring ODE. We also demonstrate accuracy improvements compared to standard phase-averaging in numerical experiments with the one-dimensional Rotating Shallow Water Equations, a useful test case for weather and climate applications. As the mean correction term can be computed in parallel, this new mapping has potential as a more accurate, yet still computationally cheap, coarse propagator for the oscillatory parareal method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a finite-volume based numerical scheme for a nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation which combines ideas from recent numerical schemes for gradient flow equations and nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equations. The equation of interest is a special case of a previously derived and studied system of equations which describes phase separation in ternary mixtures. We prove the scheme is both energy stable and respects the analytical bounds of the solution. Furthermore, we present numerical demonstrations of the theoretical results using both the Flory-Huggins (FH) and Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free-energy potentials.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient NURBS-based isogeometric analysis for coupled nonlinear diffusion-reaction equations with and without advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear diffusion-reaction systems model a multitude of physical phenomena. A common situation is biological development modeling where such systems have been widely used to study spatiotemporal phenomena in cell biology. Systems of coupled diffusion-reaction equations are usually subject to some complicated features directly related to their multiphysics nature. Moreover, the presence of advection is source of numerical instabilities, in general, and adds another challenge to these systems. In this study, we propose a NURBS-based isogeometric analysis (IgA) combined with a second-order Strang operator splitting to deal with the multiphysics nature of the problem. The advection part is treated in a semi-Lagrangian framework and the resulting diffusion-reaction equations are then solved using an efficient time-stepping algorithm based on operator splitting. The accuracy of the method is studied by means of a advection-diffusion-reaction system with analytical solution. To further examine the performance of the new method on complex geometries, the well-known Schnakenberg-Turing problem is considered with and without advection. Finally, a Gray-Scott system on a circular domain is also presented. The results obtained demonstrate the efficiency of our new algorithm to accurately reproduce the solution in the presence of complex patterns on complex geometries. Moreover, the new method clarifies the effect of geometry on Turing patterns.</description>

      <title>A single shooting method with approximate Fr\'{e}chet derivative for computing geodesics on the Stiefel manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows how to use the shooting method, a classical numerical algorithm for solving boundary value problems, to compute the Riemannian distance on the Stiefel manifold $ \mathrm{St}(n,p) $, the set of $ n \times p $ matrices with orthonormal columns. The proposed method is a shooting method in the sense of the classical shooting methods for solving boundary value problems; see, e.g., Stoer and Bulirsch, 1991. The main feature is that we provide an approximate formula for the Fr\'{e}chet derivative of the geodesic involved in our shooting method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the algorithms' accuracy and performance. Comparisons with existing state-of-the-art algorithms for solving the same problem show that our method is competitive and even beats several algorithms in many cases.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error analysis of a space-time hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for the advection-diffusion problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and analyze an a posteriori error estimator for a space-time hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the time-dependent advection-diffusion problem. The residual-based error estimator is proven to be reliable and locally efficient. In the reliability analysis we combine a Peclet-robust coercivity type result and a saturation assumption, while local efficiency analysis is based on using bubble functions. The analysis considers both local space and time adaptivity and is verified by numerical simulations on problems which include boundary and interior layers.</description>

      <title>A robust approach with numerical demonstrations for the inverse scattering problem using a Carleman contraction map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the inverse scattering problem in the domain Omega. The input data, measured outside Omega, involve the waves generated by the interaction of plane waves with various directions and unknown scatterers fully occluded inside Omega. The output of this problem is the spatially dielectric constant of these scatterers. Our approach to solving this problem consists of two primary stages. Initially, we eliminate the unknown dielectric constant from the governing equation, resulting in a system of partial differential equations. Subsequently, we develop the Carleman contraction mapping method to effectively tackle this system. It is noteworthy to highlight this method's robustness. It does not request a precise initial guess of the true solution, and its computational cost is not expensive. Some numerical examples are presented.</description>

      <title>On the order of accuracy of finite-volume schemes on unstructured meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider finite-volume schemes for linear hyperbolic systems with constant coefficients on unstructured meshes. Under the stability assumption, they exhibit the convergence rate between $p$ and $p+1$ where $p$ is the order of the truncation error. Our goal is to explain this effect. The central point of our study is that the truncation error on $(p+1)$-th order polynomials has zero average over the mesh period. This condition is verified for schemes with a polynomial reconstruction, multislope finite-volume methods, 1-exact edge-based schemes, and the flux correction method. We prove that this condition is necessary and, under additional assumptions, sufficient for the $(p+1)$-th order convergence. Furthermore, we apply the multislope method to a high-Reynolds number flow and explain its accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Newton method for solving locally definite multiparameter eigenvalue problems by multiindex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of locally definite multiparameter eigenvalue problems by its signed multiindex. The method has the interpretation of a semismooth Newton method applied to certain functions that have a unique zero. We can therefore show local quadratic convergence, and for certain extreme eigenvalues even global linear convergence of the method. Local definiteness is a weaker condition than right and left definiteness, which is often considered for multiparameter eigenvalue problems. These conditions are naturally satisfied for multiparameter Sturm-Liouville problems that arise when separation of variables can be applied to multidimensional boundary eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <title>Constructive proofs for some semilinear PDEs on $H^2(e^{|x|^2/4},\mathbb{R}^d)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop computer-assisted tools to study semilinear equations of the form \begin{equation*} -\Delta u -\frac{x}{2}\cdot \nabla{u}= f(x,u,\nabla u) ,\quad x\in\mathbb{R}^d. \end{equation*} Such equations appear naturally in several contexts, and in particular when looking for self-similar solutions of parabolic PDEs. We develop a general methodology, allowing us not only to prove the existence of solutions, but also to describe them very precisely. We introduce a spectral approach based on an eigenbasis of $\mathcal{L}:= -\Delta -\frac{x}{2}\cdot \nabla$ in spherical coordinates, together with a quadrature rule allowing to deal with nonlinearities, in order to get accurate approximate solutions. We then use a Newton-Kantorovich argument, in an appropriate weighted Sobolev space, to prove the existence of a nearby exact solution. We apply our approach to nonlinear heat equations, to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations and to a generalised viscous Burgers equation, and obtain both radial and non-radial self-similar profiles.</description>

      <title>Fusing Dictionary Learning and Support Vector Machines for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in this paper the improvement of one-class support vector machines (OC-SVM) through sparse representation techniques for unsupervised anomaly detection. As Dictionary Learning (DL) became recently a common analysis technique that reveals hidden sparse patterns of data, our approach uses this insight to endow unsupervised detection with more control on pattern finding and dimensions. We introduce a new anomaly detection model that unifies the OC-SVM and DL residual functions into a single composite objective, subsequently solved through K-SVD-type iterative algorithms. A closed-form of the alternating K-SVD iteration is explicitly derived for the new composite model and practical implementable schemes are discussed. The standard DL model is adapted for the Dictionary Pair Learning (DPL) context, where the usual sparsity constraints are naturally eliminated. Finally, we extend both objectives to the more general setting that allows the use of kernel functions. The empirical convergence properties of the resulting algorithms are provided and an in-depth analysis of their parametrization is performed while also demonstrating their numerical performance in comparison with existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Newton's method for finding zeros of mappings from a manifold $\mathcal{X}$ into a vector bundle $\mathcal{E}$. In this setting a connection on $\mathcal{E}$ is required to render the Newton equation well defined, and a retraction on $\mathcal{X}$ is needed to compute a Newton update. We discuss local convergence in terms of suitable differentiability concepts, using a Banach space variant of a Riemannian distance. We also carry over an affine covariant damping strategy to our setting. Finally, we discuss two simple applications of our approach, namely, finding fixed points of vector fields and stationary points of functionals.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic weakly over-penalised symmetric interior penalty method for the Stokes equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03822v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate an anisotropic weakly over-penalised symmetric interior penalty method for the Stokes equation {on convex domains}. Our approach is a simple discontinuous Galerkin method similar to the Crouzeix--Raviart finite element method. As our primary contribution, we show a new proof for the consistency term, which allows us to obtain an estimate of the anisotropic consistency error. The key idea of the proof is to apply the relation between the Raviart--Thomas finite element space and a discontinuous space. While inf-sup stable schemes of the discontinuous Galerkin method on shape-regular mesh partitions have been widely discussed, our results show that the Stokes element satisfies the inf-sup condition on anisotropic meshes. Furthermore, we provide an error estimate in an energy norm on anisotropic meshes. In numerical experiments, we compare calculation results for standard and anisotropic mesh partitions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we present a new H(div)-conforming unfitted finite element method for the mixed Poisson problem which is robust in the cut configuration and preserves conservation properties of body-fitted finite element methods. The key is to formulate the divergence-constraint on the active mesh, instead of the physical domain, in order to obtain robustness with respect to cut configurations without the need for a stabilization that pollutes the mass balance. This change in the formulation results in a slight inconsistency, but does not affect the accuracy of the flux variable. By applying post-processings for the scalar variable, in virtue of classical local post-processings in body-fitted methods, we retain optimal convergence rates for both variables and even the superconvergence after post-processing of the scalar variable. We present the method and perform a rigorous a-priori error analysis of the method and discuss several variants and extensions. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A grid-overlay finite difference method for the fractional Laplacian on arbitrary bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A grid-overlay finite difference method is proposed for the numerical approximation of the fractional Laplacian on arbitrary bounded domains. The method uses an unstructured simplicial mesh and an overlay uniform grid for the underlying domain and constructs the approximation based on a uniform-grid finite difference approximation and a data transfer from the unstructured mesh to the uniform grid. The method takes full advantages of both uniform-grid finite difference approximation in efficient matrix-vector multiplication via the fast Fourier transform and unstructured meshes for complex geometries and mesh adaptation. It is shown that its stiffness matrix is similar to a symmetric and positive definite matrix and thus invertible if the data transfer has full column rank and positive column sums. Piecewise linear interpolation is studied as a special example for the data transfer. It is proved that the full column rank and positive column sums of linear interpolation is guaranteed if the spacing of the uniform grid is smaller than or equal to a positive bound proportional to the minimum element height of the unstructured mesh. Moreover, a sparse preconditioner is proposed for the iterative solution of the resulting linear system for the homogeneous Dirichlet problem of the fractional Laplacian. Numerical examples demonstrate that the new method has similar convergence behavior as existing finite difference and finite element methods and that the sparse preconditioning is effective. Furthermore, the new method can readily be incorporated with existing mesh adaptation strategies. Numerical results obtained by combining with the so-called MMPDE moving mesh method are also presented.</description>

      <title>Domain Decomposition Method for Poisson--Boltzmann Equations based on Solvent Excluded Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a domain decomposition method for the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation based on a solvent-excluded surface widely used in computational chemistry. The model relies on a nonlinear equation defined in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a space-dependent dielectric permittivity and an ion-exclusion function that accounts for steric effects. Potential theory arguments transform the nonlinear equation into two coupled equations defined in a bounded domain. Then, the Schwarz decomposition method is used to formulate local problems by decomposing the cavity into overlapping balls and only solving a set of coupled sub-equations in each ball. The main novelty of the proposed method is the introduction of a hybrid linear-nonlinear solver used to solve the equation. A series of numerical experiments are presented to test the method and show the importance of the nonlinear model.</description>

      <title>Backward Reachability Analysis of Perturbed Continuous-Time Linear Systems Using Set Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Backward reachability analysis computes the set of states that reach a target set under the competing influence of control input and disturbances. Depending on their interplay, the backward reachable set either represents all states that can be steered into the target set or all states that cannot avoid entering it -- the corresponding solutions can be used for controller synthesis and safety verification, respectively. A popular technique for backward reachable set computation solves Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations, which scales exponentially with the state dimension due to gridding the state space. In this work, we instead use set propagation techniques to design backward reachability algorithms for linear time-invariant systems. Crucially, the proposed algorithms scale only polynomially with the state dimension. Our numerical examples demonstrate the tightness of the obtained backward reachable sets and show an overwhelming improvement of our proposed algorithms over state-of-the-art methods regarding scalability, as systems with well over a hundred states can now be analyzed.</description>

      <title>Inverting the sum of two singular matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Square matrices of the form $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}} =\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{e}D \mathbf{f}^*$ are considered. An explicit expression for the inverse is given, provided $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}$ and $D$ are invertible with $\text{rank}(\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}) =\text{rank}(\mathbf{A})+\text{rank}(\mathbf{e}D \mathbf{f}^*)$. The inverse is presented in two ways, one that uses singular value decomposition and another that depends directly on the components $\mathbf{A}$, $\mathbf{e}$, $\mathbf{f}$ and $D$. Additionally, a matrix determinant lemma for singular matrices follows from the derivations.</description>

      <title>On the limiting amplitude principle for the wave equation with variable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.10105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove new results on the validity of the limiting amplitude principle (LAP) for the wave equation with nonconstant coefficients, not necessarily in divergence form. Under suitable assumptions on the coefficients and on the source term, we establish the LAP for space dimensions 2 and 3. This result is extended to one space dimension with an appropriate modification. We also quantify the LAP and thus provide estimates for the convergence of the time-domain solution to the frequency-domain solution. Our proofs are based on time-decay results of solutions of some auxiliary problems. The obtained results are illustrated numerically on radially symmetric problems in dimensions 1, 2 and 3.</description>
