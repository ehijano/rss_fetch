      <title>Scaler: Efficient and Effective Cross Flow Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Performance analysis is challenging as different components (e.g.,different libraries, and applications) of a complex system can interact with each other. However, few existing tools focus on understanding such interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel analysis method "Cross Flow Analysis (XFA)" that monitors the interactions/flows across these components. We also built the Scaler profiler that provides a holistic view of the time spent on each component (e.g., library or application) and every API inside each component. This paper proposes multiple new techniques, such as Universal Shadow Table, and Relation-Aware Data Folding. These techniques enable Scaler to achieve low runtime overhead, low memory overhead, and high profiling accuracy. Based on our extensive experimental results, Scaler detects multiple unknown performance issues inside widely-used applications, and therefore will be a useful complement to existing work.

      <title>The Power of Training: How Different Neural Network Setups Influence the Energy Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01851v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work offers a heuristic evaluation of the effects of variations in machine learning training regimes and learning paradigms on the energy consumption of computing, especially HPC hardware with a life-cycle aware perspective. While increasing data availability and innovation in high-performance hardware fuels the training of sophisticated models, it also fosters the fading perception of energy consumption and carbon emission. Therefore, the goal of this work is to raise awareness about the energy impact of general training parameters and processes, from learning rate over batch size to knowledge transfer. Multiple setups with different hyperparameter configurations are evaluated on three different hardware systems. Among many results, we have found out that even with the same model and hardware to reach the same accuracy, improperly set training hyperparameters consume up to 5 times the energy of the optimal setup. We also extensively examined the energy-saving benefits of learning paradigms including recycling knowledge through pretraining and sharing knowledge through multitask training.</description>
