      <title>Density of spectral gap property for positively expansive dynamics and smooth potentials, with applications to the phase transition problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that all uniformly expanding dynamics $f: M \rightarrow M$ have no phase transition with respect to a H\"older continuous potential $\phi : M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, in other words, the topological pressure function $\mathbb{R} \ni t \mapsto P_{top}(f , t\phi)$ is analytical. Moreover, the associated transfer operator $\mathcal{L}_{f , t\phi}$, acting on the space of H\"older continuous functions, has the spectral gap property for $t \in \mathbb{R}$. For dynamics that are topologically conjugate to an expanding map, a full understanding has yet to be achieved. On the one hand, by \cite{KQW21,KQ22}, for such maps and continuous potentials, the associated topological pressure function can behave wildly. On the other hand, by \cite{BF23}, for transitive local diffeomorphisms on the circle and a large class of H\"older continuous potentials, the phase transition does not occur, and the associated transfer operator has the spectral gap property for all parameters $t \in \mathbb{R}$. As a first approach to understanding what happens in high dimensions, in this paper, we study positively expansive local diffeomorphisms. In particular, we show that the associated transfer operator has the spectral gap property for a large class of regular potentials. Moreover, for a class of intermittent skew-products and a large class of regular potentials, we obtain phase transition results analogous to \cite{BF23}.</description>

      <title>Double Hamiltonian Hopf Bifurcation: normalization and normal form non-integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcation is studied, i.e. a generic two-parametric unfolding of a smooth Hamiltonian system with four degrees of freedom which has at the critical value of parameters the equilibrium with two pairs of double non semi-simple pure imaginary eigenvalues $\pm i\omega_1,$ $\pm i\omega_2,$ $\omega_1\ne \omega_2$ under an assumption of absence of strong resonances between $\omega_1,\omega_2$. We derive the normal form of the unfolding, when the ratio $\omega_1/\omega_2$ is irrational and study the truncated normal form of the fourth order. This truncated normal form is the same under the absence of strong resonances. The normal form has two quadratic integrals generating a symplectic periodic action of the abelian group $T^2.$ After reduction by means of these integrals we come to the reduced system with two degrees of freedom that is proven to be non-integrable for almost all values of its coefficients. Integrable such systems are also possible at some special values of coefficients, related examples are presented. Some investigations of this truncated system are presented along with its bifurcations when varying small detuning parameters. As an example of a system where this bifurcation is met, the system derived in \cite{KuLe} is investigated. Its homoclinic solutions are examined numerically when the system parameters correspond to a main equilibrium of the twofold saddle-focus type.</description>

      <title>Attractor learning for spatiotemporally chaotic dynamical systems using echo state networks with transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the predictive capabilities of echo state networks (ESNs) for the generalized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (gKS) equation, an archetypal nonlinear PDE that exhibits spatiotemporal chaos. We introduce a novel methodology that integrates ESNs with transfer learning, aiming to enhance predictive performance across various parameter regimes of the gKS model. Our research focuses on predicting changes in long-term statistical patterns of the gKS model that result from varying the dispersion relation or the length of the spatial domain. We use transfer learning to adapt ESNs to different parameter settings and successfully capture changes in the underlying chaotic attractor.</description>

      <title>Anosov actions: minimality of foliations or suspension action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that an Anosov action of $\mathbb{R}^k$ over a compact manifold $M$ transitive on regular sub-cones satisfies the dichotomy: each stable and unstable leaf is dense or the Anosov action is topologically conjugated to a suspension of a $\mathbb{Z}^k$-Anosov action. This represents an important progress toward addressing Verjovsky's extended conjecture for Anosov actions, as developed by Barbot and Maquera.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we define the so-called square entropy and prove that n-to-1 full zip shift maps are intrinsically ergodic. Furthermore, we show that square entropy characterizes uniform n-to-1 transformations of $(m,l)$-Bernoulli type that are extended Bernoulli transformations.</description>

      <title>A note on multi-transitivity in non-autonomous discrete systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with some stronger forms of transitivity in non-autonomous discrete systems$(f_{ 1,\infty})$ generated by a uniformly convergent sequence of continuous self maps. Firstly, we present two counterexamples to show that Theorem 3.1 obtained by Salman and Das in [Multi-transitivity in nonautonomous discrete systems Topol. Appl. 278(2020)107237] is not true. Then, we introduce and study mildly mixing in non-autonomous discrete systems, which is stronger than mixing. We obtain that multi-transitivity implies Li-Yorke chaos and that mildly mixing implies multi-transitivity, which answer the open problems 1 and 2 in the paper above. Additionally, we give a counterexample which shows that Theorem 2.3 and Theorem 2.4 given by Sharma and Raghav in [On dynamics generated by a uniformly convergent sequence of maps Topol. Appl. 247 (2018)81-90] are both incorrect and give the correct proofs of them. Finally, some counterexamples are constructed justifying that some results related to stronger forms of transitivity which are true for autonomous systems but fail in non-autonomous systems, and establish a sufficient condition under which the results still hold in non-autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Homogeneous Integrable Systems: Free Parameters, Kovalevskaya Exponents, and the Painlev\'e Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates quasi-homogeneous integrable systems by analyzing their Laurent series solutions near movable singularities, motivated by patterns observed in Kovalevskaya exponents of four-dimensional Painlev\'e-type equations. We introduce a parameter space encoding the free coefficients in these expansions and study its deformation under a commuting quasi-homogeneous vector field.
  Within this framework, we derive lower indicial loci from the principal one and establish an arithmetic resonance condition on Kovalevskaya exponents that governs the emergence of fractional powers and the breakdown of the Painlev\'e property. Moreover, we construct a Frobenius manifold structure on the parameter space via the initial value map, which becomes conformal when all weights coincide.
  In the Hamiltonian context, we demonstrate that the induced flow on the parameter space preserves a symplectic form and yields a natural pairing of Kovalevskaya exponents. These findings unify analytic and geometric aspects of quasi-homogeneous integrable systems and offer new insights into their deformation theory and singularity structures.\\ Our results provide a comprehensive framework applicable to the classification and analysis of Painlev\'e-type equations and related integrable models.</description>

      <title>Counting the number of $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$-and $\mathbb{F}_{p}[t]$-fixed points of a discrete dynamical system with applications from arithmetic statistics, III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this follow-up paper, we again inspect a surprising relationship between the set of fixed points of a polynomial map $\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by $\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \in \mathcal{O}_{K}$ or $c, z \in \mathbb{Z}_{p}$ or $c, z \in \mathbb{F}_{p}[t]$ and the coefficient $c$, where $K$ is any number field (not necessarily real) of degree $n &gt; 1$, $p&gt;2$ is any prime integer, and $d&gt;2$ is an integer. As in \cite{BK1,BK2} we again wish to study here counting problems that are inspired by exhilarating advances in arithmetic statistics, and also partly by point-counting results of Narkiewicz on totally complex $K$-periodic points and of Adam-Fares on $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$-periodic points (orbits) in arithmetic dynamics. In doing so, we then first prove that for any given prime $p\geq 3$ and any $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$, the average number of distinct fixed points of any $\varphi_{p^{\ell}, c}$ modulo prime ideal $p\mathcal{O}_{K}$ (modulo $p\mathbb{Z}_{p}$) is bounded (if $\ell \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\setminus\{1, p\}$) or zero or unbounded (if $\ell \in \{1, p\}$) as $c\to \infty$. Motivated further by an $\mathbb{F}_{p}(t)$-periodic point-counting result of Benedetto, we also find that the average number in $\mathbb{F}_{p}[t]$-setting behaves in the same way as in $\mathcal{O}_{K}$-setting. Finally, we then apply counting and statistical results from arithmetic statistics to immediately deduce here several counting and statistical results.</description>

      <title>Indecomposable continua for unbounded itineraries of exponential maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the exponential maps $\E: \C \longrightarrow \C$ defined by $\E(z) = \lambda e^z$, where $\lambda &gt; \frac{1}{e}$. We prove that for itineraries of a certain form, the set of all points sharing the given itinerary, together with the point at infinity, is an indecomposable continuum in the Riemann sphere. These itineraries contain infinitely many blocks of zeros whose lengths increase, and they may be unbounded. We prove that in every such continuum, there exists exactly one point whose $\omega$-limit set contains the repelling fixed point of $\E$. For every other point, its $\omega$-limit set is equal either to the point at infinity, or to the forward orbit of $0$ together with the point at infinity. Thus, we generalize the results of R.~Devaney and X.~Jarque from 2002 concerning indecomposable continua for bounded itineraries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a powerful and general method to provide rigorous and accurate upper and lower bounds for Lyapunov exponents of stochastic flows. Our approach is based on computer-assisted tools, the adjoint method and established results on the ergodicity of diffusion processes. We do not require any structural assumptions on the stochastic system and work under mild hypoellipticity conditions and outside of perturbative regimes. Therefore, our method allows for the treatment of systems that were so far out of reach from existing mathematical tools. We demonstrate our method to exhibit the chaotic nature of four different systems. Finally, we show the robustness of our approach by combining it with continuation methods to produce bounds on Lyapunov exponents over large parameter regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a random dynamical system on $\mathbb{R}^d$, whose dynamics is defined by a stochastic differential equation. The annealed transfer operator associated with such systems is a kernel operator. Given a set of feasible infinitesimal perturbations $P$ to this kernel, with support in a certain compact set, and a specified observable function $\phi: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$, we study which infinitesimal perturbation in $P$ produces the greatest change in expectation of $\phi$. We establish conditions under which the optimal perturbation uniquely exists and present a numerical method to approximate the optimal infinitesimal kernel perturbation. Finally, we numerically illustrate our findings with concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Random walk based snapshot clustering for detecting community dynamics in temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of many dynamical systems that describe relationships or interactions between objects can be effectively modeled by temporal networks, which are typically represented as a sequence of static network snapshots. In this paper, we introduce a novel random walk-based approach that can identify clusters of time-snapshots in which network community structures are stable. This allows us to detect significant structural shifts over time, such as the splitting or merging of communities or their births and deaths. We also provide a low-dimensional representation of entire snapshots, placing those with similar community structure close to each other in the feature space. To validate our approach, we develop an agent-based algorithm that generates synthetic datasets with the desired characteristic properties, enabling thorough testing and benchmarking. We further demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of our technique by testing it on various social dynamics models and real-world datasets and comparing its performance to several state-of-the-art algorithms. Our findings highlight the strength of our approach to correctly capture and analyze the dynamics of complex systems.</description>
