      <title>A Yang-Mills-Dirac Quantum Field Theory Emerging From a Dirac Operator on a Configuration Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting with a Dirac operator on a configuration space of $SU(2)$ gauge connections we consider its fluctuations with inner automorphisms. We show that a certain type of twisted inner fluctuations leads to a Dirac operator whose square gives the Hamiltonian of Yang-Mills quantum field theory coupled to a fermionic sector that consist of one-form fermions. We then show that if a metric exists on the underlying three-dimensional manifold then there exists a change of basis of the configuration space for which the transformed fermionic sector consists of fermions that are no-longer one-forms.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics without Boost-Invariance from Kinetic Theory: From Perfect Fluids to Active Flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the hydrodynamic equations of perfect fluids without boost invariance [1] from kinetic theory. Our approach is to follow the standard derivation of the Vlasov hierarchy based on an a-priori unknown collision functional satisfying certain axiomatic properties consistent with the absence of boost invariance. The kinetic theory treatment allows us to identify various transport coefficients in the hydrodynamic regime. We identify a drift term that effects a relaxation to an equilibrium where detailed balance with the environment with respect to momentum transfer is obtained. We then show how the derivative expansion of the hydrodynamics of flocks can be recovered from boost non-invariant kinetic theory and hydrodynamics. We identify how various coefficients of the former relate to a parameterization of the so-called equation of kinetic state that yields relations between different coefficients, arriving at a symmetry-based understanding as to why certain coefficients in hydrodynamic descriptions of active flocks are naturally of order one, and others, naturally small. When inter-particle forces are expressed in terms of a kinetic theory influence kernel, a coarse-graining scale and resulting derivative expansion emerge in the hydrodynamic limit, allowing us to derive diffusion terms as infrared-relevant operators distilling different parameterizations of microscopic interactions. We conclude by highlighting possible applications.</description>

      <title>Moments and saddles of heavy CFT correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to transform the correlation function into a classical moment-generating function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 = \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into deformed higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit. We further compute tree-level perturbations on saddles in 1/2 BPS Wilson line defect correlators in planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM, making predictions about deformations of families of long operators.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Gravity Compactifications on Negatively Curved Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing the landscape of vacua of higher-dimensional theories of gravity by directly solving the low-energy (semi-)classical equations of motion is notoriously difficult. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of Machine Learning techniques as tools for solving the equations of motion for general warped gravity compactifications. As a proof-of-concept we use Neural Networks to solve the Einstein PDEs on non-trivial three manifolds obtained by filling one or more cusps of hyperbolic manifolds. While in three dimensions an Einstein metric is also locally hyperbolic, the generality and scalability of Machine Learning methods, the availability of explicit families of hyperbolic manifolds in higher dimensions, and the universality of the filling procedure strongly suggest that the methods and code developed in this work can be of broader applicability. Specifically, they can be used to tackle both the geometric problem of numerically constructing novel higher-dimensional negatively curved Einstein metrics, as well as the physical problem of constructing four-dimensional de Sitter compactifications of M-theory on the same manifolds.</description>

      <title>Tantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue there is an interesting triple-scaling limit of quantum gravity, namely when Planck's constant scales to infinity while Newton's constant and the speed of light tend to zero, keeping fixed the gravitational coupling $G_N\,c^{-4}$ and the combination $\hbar\,c$. We refer to this limiting theory as ``tantum gravity'' and describe in this Letter some of its main properties and prospects for physics. Most notably, the laws of black hole thermodynamics survive this limit, which means that puzzles related to black holes and their evaporation could be addressed more easily in tantum gravity than in fully-fledged quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Towards the BBGKY hierarchy: a scheme beyond the Boltzmann equation and application to a weakly confined QCD gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical kinetic theory, the BBGKY hierarchy is an infinite chain of integro-differential equations that describes the full time-reversal-invariant (Liouville) system of interacting (quasi)-particles in terms of $N$-particle distribution functions. In this work, instead of truncating the hierarchy at the lowest level, as is done by the Boltzmann equation, we develop a scheme similar to the relaxation time approximation that is in principle able to account for the entire chain of equations. We then explicitly investigate its truncation at the second level of the BBGKY hierarchy and, within this scheme, study the spectra of conserved operator correlation functions in a gas of weakly confined hadrons. We also discuss how these higher levels account for parts of the operator spectra `deeper in the ultra-violet regime' and compare them to known results derived from the holographic duality.</description>

      <title>Feynman Diagrams from Conformal Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that momentum space Feynman diagrams involving internal massless fields can be cast as conformal integrals. This leads to a classification of all Feynman diagrams into conformal families, labelled by conformal integrals. Computing the conformal integral in each family suffices to compute all the Feynman diagrams in the family exactly. Using known exact results for some conformal integrals, we present the solutions to the other Feynman diagrams in the corresponding families. These are answers to either finite or dimensionally regularized Feynman diagrams to all orders in the regularization parameter.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order Bopp-Podolsky model on the null-plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the null-plane dynamics for a reduced-order version of the higher-derivatives Bopp-Podoslky generalized electrodynamics model. By introducing an auxiliary vector field, we achieve a simpler equivalent version with lower derivatives. The massive and massless modes for the Podolsky gauge field get split into two sectors. We describe the model in terms of light-front coordinates and, by choosing $x^+$ as a natural evolution parameter, proceed to its null-plane dynamics analysis obtaining the whole constraints structure and canonical field equations. After a convenient constraints redefinition, we calculate the Dirac brackets corresponding to the second-class sector. Gauge invariance is preserved and, after elimination of second-class constraints, we obtain a consistent Abelian first-class theory for the reduced-order Bopp-Podolsky model.</description>

      <title>3D Carrollian gravity from 2D Euclidean symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carroll symmetry arises from Poincar\'e symmetry when the speed of light is sent to zero. In this work, we apply the Lie algebra expansion method to find the Carroll versions of different gravity models in three space-time dimensions. Our starting point is the 2D Euclidean AdS algebra along with its flat version. Novel and already known Carrollian algebras, such as the AdS-Carroll and Carroll-Galilei ones are found, and the Chern--Simons gravity theories based on them are constructed. Remarkably, after the expansion, the vanishing cosmological constant limit applied to the 2D Euclidean AdS algebra converts into a non-relativistic limit in three space-time dimensions. We extend our results to Post-Carroll-Newtonian algebras which can be found by expanding a family of 2D Euclidean algebras.</description>

      <title>Note on the local calculation of decoherence of quantum superpositions in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decoherence effect of quantum superposition in de Sitter (dS) spacetime due to the presence of the cosmological horizon. Using the algebraic approach of quantum field theory on curved spacetime, we derive the precise expression for the expected number of entangling particles in the scalar field case. This expression establishes the relation between the decoherence and the local two-point correlation function. Specifically, we analyze the quantum superposition Gendankenexperiment performed by a local observer at the center of dS spacetime. We compute the entangling particle numbers in scalar field, electromagnetic field, and gravitational field scenarios. It is demonstrated that the quantum spatial superposition state can be decohered by emitting entangling particles into the cosmological horizon. Our setup is equivalent to an accelerating observer in 5-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The results for the scalar and electromagnetic cases are consistent with those obtained in Ref.[1], which investigated the decoherence effect from the perspective of an accelerating observer in Minkovski spacetime. However, our result fixes the numerical prefactor of the gravitational decoherence.</description>

      <title>Relative entropy formulation of thermalization process in a Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of the thermalization process in an entropic formulation for the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector outside a Schwarzschild black hole. We derive the late-time dynamics of the detector in the context of open quantum system, and capture the path distinguishability and thermodynamic irreversibility of detector thermalization process by using quantum relative entropy (QRE). We find that beyond the Planckian transition rate, the refined thermalization process in detector Hilbert space can be distinguished by the time behavior of the related QRE. We show that the exotic position-dependent behaviors of the QRE emerge corresponding to different choices of black hole vacua (i.e., the Boulware, Hartle-Hawking, and Unruh vacua). Finally, from a perspective of quantum thermodynamics, we recast the free energy change of the UDW detector undergoing Hawking radiation into an entropic combination form, where the classical Kullback-Leibler divergence and quantum coherence are presented in specific QRE-like forms. With growing Hawking temperature, we find that the consumption rate of quantum coherence is larger than that of its classical counterpart.</description>

      <title>Properties of the wormhole-dominant phase in two-dimensional quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $N \times N$ Hermitian one-matrix model modified by the double-trace interaction. It is known that the coupling for the double-trace interaction can control the weight for the microscopic wormholes if interpreting the matrix model as the lattice model of random surface; tuning the coupling to its critical value, the effect of wormholes become substantial to change the critical behavior of the pure $2$D quantum gravity, which is characterized by a certain positive value of the string susceptibility.
  In the large-$N$ limit, we calculate the continuum limit of the disk amplitude in which the wormhole effects are important. The resulting continuum disk amplitude is the same as that of the pure $2$D quantum gravity. We also introduce the renormalized coupling for the double-trace interaction, and show that the newly introduced renormalized coupling can alter the renormalized bulk cosmological constant effectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the real-time bulk AdS$_3$ two-into-two scattering amplitude of conical defects. This is done through means of a previously developed method of systematic approximation of the monodromy problem for the Virasoro blocks of the four-point HHHH correlator in 2d CFT in the large central charge regime. We find that dialing the external scaling dimension triggers a transition from a scattering phase to an intermediate black hole phase. This transition occurs before the individual heavy operators exceed the BTZ mass gap.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Conformal $BMS_3$ Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An enhanced version of the conformal BMS$_{3}$ algebra is presented. It is shown to emerge from the asymptotic structure of an extension of conformal gravity in 3D by Pope and Townsend that consistently accommodates an additional spin-2 field, once it is endowed with a suitable set of boundary conditions. The canonical generators of the asymptotic symmetries then span a precise nonlinear W$_{(2,2,2,2,1,1,1)}$ algebra, whose central extensions and coefficients of the nonlinear terms are completely determined by the central charge of the Virasoro subalgebra. The wedge algebra corresponds to the conformal group in four dimensions $SO(4,2)$ and therefore, enhanced conformal BMS$_{3}$ can also be regarded as an infinite-dimensional nonlinear extension of the AdS$_{5}$ algebra with nontrivial central extensions. It is worth mentioning that our boundary conditions might be considered as a starting point in order to consistently incorporate either a finite or an infinite number of conformal higher spin fields.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal invariant TQFTs from self-mirror symmetric SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a connection between three-dimensional self-mirror symmetric $\mathcal N=4$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs) and time-reversal invariant topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) arising from universal mass deformations. Focusing on the Abelian case, the ultraviolet (UV) SCFT is characterized by the charge matrix $Q$, while the infrared (IR) TQFT corresponds to an Abelian Chern-Simons theory with level matrix $K=QQ ^T$. We derive constraints on the charge matrix for self-mirror symmetric SCFTs and demonstrate that the Coulomb and Higgs branch Hilbert series of these theories coincide. Additionally, we derive a general formula for the superconformal indices of Abelian $\mathcal N=4$ SCFTs with arbitrary charge matrices. For SCFT with the constrained charge matrix, the superconformal index is argued to exhibit invariance under the inversion of fugacity associated with R-symmetry, providing further evidence of self-mirror symmetry. We explore various properties of time-reversal invariant Abelian Chern-Simons theories in detail and establish their connections to self-mirror symmetry in SCFTs from multiple perspectives. In particular, we introduce a quantity, dubbed Gauss generating function, which is real and thus invariant under complex conjugation for time-reversal symmetric TQFTs, in parallel with the superconformal index, which is invariant under the inversion of R-symmetry fugacity for self-mirror symmetric SCFTs.</description>

      <title>Multiparticle States for the Flat Hologram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the extrapolate dictionary to revisit the spectrum of operators in Celestial CFT. Under the Celestial CFT map, each state in the 4D Hilbert space should map to one in the 2D Hilbert space. This implies that, beyond the familiar single particle states/operators, there should be multiparticle operators appearing in the celestial OPE. We extend the existing flat-space dictionary by constructing composite primaries from both Carrollian and Celestial perspectives. In the process, we demonstrate some subtleties in deriving the Poincar\'e primary condition from the Carrollian limit, clarify the compatibility of principal series representations with highest weight representations and unitarity in Celestial CFT, and discuss how the celestial OPE block expansion emerges from a 2D CFT standpoint.</description>

      <title>Analogue black string in a quantum harmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a scalar particle without self-interaction or backreaction from the space-time background, the dynamics are governed by the Klein-Gordon equation. In this work, we write the exact solution of this equation in the background of a chargeless, static black string in terms of the biconfluent Heun function. In this curious system, we are able to explore what happens if we have negative values for the masses. The eigenvalue problem provides complex energy values for the particle, which may indicate the presence of quasinormal modes. We show a simple quantum system that can imitate the particle in the black string background, whose solutions are also applications of the biconfluent Heun function.</description>

      <title>Tricritical behavior of a relativistic field theory in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tricritical behavior in a class of one-dimensional (1D) field theories that exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking at zero temperature and chemical potential is analyzed. In the Gross-Neveu (GN)-type models of massless fermions the discrete chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. After doping, the symmetry is restored at a critical chemical potential. We investigate the temperature effects on this doped 1D system under an external constant Zeeman magnetic field $B_0$. We find that $B_0$ suppresses the gapless behavior present for certain values of chemical potential and is able to induce a gapless-gapped phase transition at a critical field strength. We also discuss about the consequences of the consideration of inhomogeneous condensates to the tricritical point, within the Ginzburg-Landau expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing the usual setup for holographic duality, where bulk spacetime is described by pseudo-Riemannian geometry, we consider a Riemann-Cartan bulk with non-trivial torsion as a background for an Abelian bulk gauge field dual to $U(1)$ boundary current. Working in the probe limit, we explore how the bulk torsion, which induces spin current at the boundary, affects the conductivity of the boundary theory. We consider standard types of non-minimal couplings between torsion and the electromagnetic field found in the literature, and the results seem to suggest that these torsion couplings are more suitable candidates, compared to the common minimal coupling regime, for a holographic explanation of the existing experimental findings regarding conductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This brief review, intended for high energy and astrophysics researchers, explores the implications of recent theoretical advances in string theory and the Swampland program for understanding bounds on the structure of positive potentials allowed in quantum gravity. This has a bearing on both inflationary models for the early universe as well as the fate of our universe. The paper includes a review of the dS conjecture as well as the TransPlanckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) and its relation to the species scale. We provide evidence for these principles as well as what they may lead to in terms of phenomenological predictions. (Talk presented at Lemaitre Conference 2024)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of an ideal Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) at a vanishing chemical potential, under the influence of quantum gravitational effects, specifically incorporating the Linear-Quadratic Generalized Uncertainty Principle (LQGUP). We analyze the impact of LQGUP on key thermodynamic quantities, including the grand canonical potential, pressure, energy density, entropy, speed of sound, and the bulk viscosity's response to changes in the speed of sound. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to examine the time evolution of the universe's temperature in the presence of LQGUP effects.</description>

      <title>Search for NS 3-form Flux Induced Vacua for the Critical Non-Abelian Vortex String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that the non-Abelian solitonic vortex string in four-dimensional (4D) $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) with gauge group U(2) and $N_f=4$ quark hypermultiplets behaves as a critical superstring. This string propagates in a ten-dimensional space comprising the flat 4D space and an internal Calabi-Yau noncompact threefold, specifically, the conifold. The lowest state of this string is a massless BPS baryon associated with the deformation of the conifold's complex structure modulus, $b$. Previous studies considered deformations of the 10-dimensional background by a nonzero Neveu-Schwarz (NS) 3-form flux, which was interpreted as selecting specific quark masses in 4D SQCD. These deformations and the corresponding back reaction on the metric were analyzed at the leading order at small 3-form flux. In this paper, we first derive the exact potential for the conifold complex structure modulus $b$ generated by the 3-form flux assuming a fixed conifold background. Then we include the back reaction effects and solve the corresponding gravity equations of motion. We show that the resulting potential gives a runaway vacuum. At this runaway vacuum the conifold undergoes degeneration.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and the Switchback Effect in Schwarzschild-de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the causal structure of Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS), including shock wave perturbations, in $D&gt;3$ using reflected null ray trajectories, either through the interior black hole or the exterior de Sitter region. Specifically, we compute the quasinormal mode frequencies in the eikonal, high-frequency, limit, by identifying the `critical time', for arbitrary values of the black hole mass. We emphasize the important role of the static sphere proper time normalization and related boundary conditions. The computed critical times indicate the presence of singularities in the late-time, large mass, scalar field correlator in SdS, which should be resolved by introducing complex geodesics consistent with interior black hole and exterior de Sitter effective thermofield double states. In addition we relate the critical time to a diverging holographic complexity observable and compute the `switchback' delay by adding a pair of shock wave perturbations for arbitrary values of the mass of the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the approach to quantum gravity which is based on the assumption that the short-distance structure of the spacetime is given by a piecewise flat manifold corresponding to a triangulation of a smooth manifold. We then describe the coupling of the Standard Model to this quantum gravity theory and show that the corresponding path integral is finite when the negative power of the product of the edge lengths squared in the path-integral measure is chossen to be grater than 52,5. The implications of this result are discussed, which include a relationship between the effective action and a wavefunction of the universe, the existence of the non-perturbative effective action, the correct value of the cosmological constant and the natural appearence of the Starobinsky inflation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Lattice C-R-T Symmetry: Fractionalization, Anomaly, and Symmetric Mass Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge conjugation (C), mirror reflection (R), and time reversal (T) symmetries, along with internal symmetries, are essential for massless Majorana and Dirac fermions. These symmetries are sufficient to rule out potential fermion bilinear mass terms, thereby establishing a gapless free fermion fixed point phase, pivotal for symmetric mass generation (SMG) transition. In this work, we systematically study the anomaly of C-R-T-internal symmetry in all spacetime dimensions by analyzing the projective representation (i.e. the fractionalization) of the C-R-T-internal symmetry group in the quantum many-body Hilbert space on the lattice. By discovering the fermion-flavor-number-dependent C-R-T-internal symmetry's anomaly structure, we demonstrate an alternative way to derive the minimal flavor number for SMG, which shows consistency with known results from K\"ahler-Dirac fermion or cobordism classification. Our findings reveal that, in general spatial dimensions, either 8 copies of staggered Majorana fermions or 4 copies of staggered Dirac fermions admit SMG. By directly searching for 4-fermion interactions that form commuting stabilizers respecting all symmetry constraints, we can prove the explicit SMG gapping retained a unique ground state in the codespace. Furthermore, we establish the correspondence between the symmetry operators of staggered fermions and free fermions, which is instrumental in facilitating the analysis of symmetry fractionalization at the field theory level.</description>

      <title>Scalar, Vector Perturbations and Effective Hawking Radiation of Cylindrical Black Holes in $f(\mathcal{R})$ and Ricci-Inverse Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates scalar perturbations and quasinormal modes (QNMs) associated with cylindrical black holes constructed within the frameworks of $f(\mathcal{R})$-gravity and Ricci-Inverse ($\mathcal{RI}$) gravity. Moreover, we study the modified Hawking radiation in these black hole solutions and analyze the effects of coupling constants. These modified theories, which extend general relativity by introducing higher-order curvature corrections and additional geometric terms, provide a rich platform for exploring deviations from standard gravitational physics. The study begins by revisiting the cylindrical black holes in these modified gravity theories, where the effective cosmological constants respectively, are represented by $\Lambda_m^{f(\mathcal{R})}$ and $\Lambda_m^{\mathcal{RI}}$ related to the coupling constants unique to each framework. Afterwards, the QNMs, intrinsic damped oscillations of the black hole space-time, are analyzed to probe the stability of the system, with the effective potential $V$ revealing the impact of the modified gravity parameters. Additionally, the thermodynamic properties of the black holes are examined through the lens of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), which introduces quantum corrections to Hawking radiation. The GUP-modified Hawking temperature and entropy are derived, demonstrating significant deviations from classical results and highlighting the quantum gravitational effects in these modified frameworks. By linking QNMs, thermodynamics, and quantum corrections, this work not only deepens the understanding of modified gravity theories but also offers potential observational pathways to test their validity.</description>

      <title>Deep learning optimal molecular scintillators for dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we discuss the relation between the functions that give first integrals of full symmetric Toda system (an important Hamilton system on the space of traceless real symmetric matrices) and the vector fields on the group of orthogonal matrices: it is known that this system is equivalent to an ordinary differential equation on the orthogonal group, and we extend this observation further to its first integrals. As a by-product we describe a representation of the Lie algebra of $B^+(\R)$-invariant functions on the dual space of Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_n(\R)$ (under the canonical Poisson structure) by vector fields on $SO_n(\R)$.</description>

      <title>Update on non-unitary mixing in the recent NO$\nu$A and T2K data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we have used a non-unitary mixing scheme to resolve the tension between NO$\nu$A and T2K data. It is demonstrated that the results of NO$\nu$A and T2K can be explained by the effects by non-unitary mixing arising from $\alpha_{00}$ and $\alpha_{10}$. For $\alpha_{00}$ there is a large overlap between the allowed NO$\nu$A and T2K regions for NH on the $\sin^2\theta_{23}-\delta_{\rm CP}$ plane at $1\,\sigma$. However, the tension still exists. NO$\nu$A rules out unitary mixing at a $3\,\sigma$ level, whereas T2K strongly prefers unitary mixing. For $\alpha_{10}$, the tension can be \textbf{well resolved} with the best-fit point for NH at $|\alpha_{10}|=0.06$ for both experiments.</description>

      <title>Can tensor-scalar induced GWs dominate PTA observations ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observational constraints on small-scale primordial gravitational waves are considerably weaker than those on large scales. We focus on scenarios with significant primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations on small scales, studying the energy density spectrum of the second-order TSIGW. By leveraging current data from CMB, BAO, and PTA, combined with the SNR analysis of LISA, we can investigate how tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves affect observations on various scales, thus constraining the parameter space for primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations. The Bayes factor analysis suggests that TSIGW+PGW might be more likely to dominate current PTA observations compared to SMBHB.</description>

      <title>On the Bonahon--Wong--Yang invariants of pseudo-Anosov maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conjecture (and prove for once-punctured torus bundles) that the Bonahon--Wong--Yang invariants of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms of a punctured surface at roots of unity coincide with the 1-loop invariant of their mapping torus at roots of unity. This explains the topological invariance of the BWY invariants and how their volume conjecture, to all orders, and with exponentially small terms included, follows from the quantum modularity conjecture. Using the numerical methods of Zagier and the first author, we illustrate how to efficiently compute the invariants and their asymptotics to arbitrary order in perturbation theory, using as examples the $LR$ and the $LLR$ pseudo-Anosov monodromies of the once-punctured torus. Finally, we introduce descendant versions of the 1-loop and BWY invariants and conjecture (and numerically check for pseudo-Anosov monodromies of $L/R$-length at most 5) that they are related by a Fourier transform.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Yang--Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out a hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) simulation of the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ Yang--Mills theory in which the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 2-form flat gauge field (the 't~Hooft flux) is explicitly treated as one of dynamical variables. We observe that our HMC algorithm in the $SU(2)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ theory drastically reduces autocorrelation lengths of the topological charge and a physical quantity which couples to slow modes in the conventional HMC simulation of the $SU(2)$ theory. Provided that sufficiently large lattice volumes are available, therefore, the HMC algorithm of the $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ theory could be employed as an alternative for the simulation of the $SU(N)$ Yang--Mills theory, because local observables are expected to be insensitive to the difference between $SU(N)$ and~$SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ in the large volume limit. A possible method to incorporate quarks (fermions in the fundamental representation of~$SU(N)$ with the baryon number~$1/N$) in this framework is also considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse linearised field equations around the Minkowski metric with its standard flat parallel transport in models of Newer GR, that is quadratic actions in terms of nonmetricity tensor. We show that half of the freedom in choosing the model parameters is immediately fixed by asking for reasonable properties of tensors and vectors, defined with respect to spatial rotations, and accurately describe the much more complicated sector of scalars. In particular, we show that, from the teleparallel viewpoint, the model of STEGR with addition of a gradient squared of the metric determinant exhibits three halves new dynamical modes, and not just one like it was previously claimed.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Magnetospheres aroud Kerr Black Holes with a Thin Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a model for stationary and axisymmetric black hole magnetospheres by solving the vacuum Maxwell equations in Kerr backgrounds. The poloidal magnetic field is generated by a toroidal electric current in a thin disk on the equatorial plane with an inner edge, and the poloidal electric field is induced due to the black hole spin. We assume a current distribution whose direction reverses at a radius on the disk. The magnetospheric structure is divided into the inner region and the outer one due to the current reversal. In the inner region, some magnetic field lines connect the black hole and the disk, and others surround the inner edge of the disk. In the outer region, the field lines connect the disk and infinity. We investigate the black hole spin dependence of the magnetospheric structure. In the magnetosphere around the Kerr black hole, the electric fields is generated by the black hole spin. In our model, the charge distribution is induced on the disk and the event horizon. Except near the black hole, the electric field strength is proportional to the black hole spin, while the direction of the electric field remains almost the same regardless of the spin. On the other hand, the electromagnetic field near the event horizon strongly depends on the spin. In the maximally rotating case, the magnetic field lines are expelled from the event horizon and the electric equipotential surface coincides with the horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: U(4) local transformations on the four Weyl spinors forming the isospin doublet of Dirac fermions are assumed as symmetries of the standard model. With the Lorentz transformations considered simultaneously, the symmetry group is enlarged in order to form a closed Lie algebra. In this framework, the chirality mixing gauge components with certain constraints collectively are identified as the Higgs field in the standard model. The scalar-appearance of the gauge-natured Higgs field and its varying coupling constants with the fermions, i.e. the mass-ratio parameters, are also given natural explanation. Additionally, a background of a constant right-handed gauge component is postulated to obtain the symmetry-breaking Higgs potential, which leads to a possible explanation of the parity violation in weak interactions. Further, the new framework provides an alternative perspective to understand the hyper symmetry U(1)Y , as a combination of a simultaneous phase rotation on both the left and right handed fermions and a rotation in the third direction of SU(2)R on the right-handed fermions. At last, a topological term involving the Higgs field is found to exist.</description>

      <title>The phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics in one dimension on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram is key to answering open questions in physics, from states of matter in neutron stars to the early universe. However, classical simulations of QCD face significant computational barriers, such as the sign problem at finite matter densities. Quantum computing offers a promising solution to overcome these challenges. Here, we take an important step toward exploring the QCD phase diagram with quantum devices by preparing thermal states in one-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories. We experimentally simulate the thermal states of SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories at finite densities on a trapped-ion quantum computer using a variational method. This is achieved by introducing two features: Firstly, we add motional ancillae to the existing qubit register to efficiently prepare thermal probability distributions. Secondly, we introduce gauge-invariant measurements to enforce local gauge symmetries. This work marks the first lattice gauge theory quantum simulation of QCD at finite density and temperature for two and three colors, laying the foundation to explore QCD phenomena on quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Topological Leptogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the standard lore, the baryon asymmetry of the present universe is attributed to the leptogenesis from the sterile right-handed neutrino with heavy Majorana mass decaying into the Standard Model's leptons at the very early universe -- called the Majorana fermion's leptogenesis; while the electroweak sphaleron causes baryogenesis at a later time. In this work, we propose a new mechanism, named topological leptogenesis, to explain the lepton asymmetry. Topological leptogenesis replaces some of the sterile neutrinos by introducing a new gapped topological order sector (whose low-energy exhibits topological quantum field theory with long-range entanglement) that can cancel the baryon minus lepton $({\bf B} - {\bf L})$ mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly of the Standard Model. Then the Beyond-the-Standard-Model dark matter consists of topological quantum matter, such that the gapped non-particle excitations of extended line and surface defect with fractionalization and anyon charges can decay into the Standard Model particles. In addition, gravitational leptogenesis can be regarded as an intermediate step (between Majorana particle leptogenesis and topological non-particle leptogenesis) to mediate such decaying processes from the highly entangled gapped topological order excitations.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Parallelism for Fast Feynman Diagrammatics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diagrammatic expansions are a paradigmatic and powerful tool of quantum many-body theory. Their evaluation to high order, e.g., by the Diagrammatic Monte Carlo technique, can provide unbiased results in strongly correlated and challenging regimes. However, calculating a factorial number of terms to acceptable precision remains very costly even for state-of-the-art methods. We achieve a dramatic acceleration of evaluating Feynman's diagrammatic series by use of specialised hardware architecture within the recently introduced combinatorial summation (CoS) framework. We present how exploiting the massive parallelism and concurrency available from GPUs leads to orders of magnitude improvement in computation time even on consumer-grade hardware. This provides a platform for making probes of novel phenomena of strong correlations much more accessible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline a general framework for evaluating the non-perturbative soft functions in the QCD instanton vacuum. In particular, from the soft function we derive the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel, which drives the rapidity evolution of the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions. The resulting CS kernel, when supplemented with the perturbative contribution, agrees well with recent lattice results and some phenomenological parameterizations. Moreover, our CS kernel depends logarithmically on the large quark transverse separation, providing a key constraint on its phenomenological parametrization. Finally, a lattice calculation can be directly compared to our generic results in Euclidean signature, thus providing a new approach for evaluating the soft function and extracting the CS kernel by analytical continuation.</description>

      <title>How does non-metricity affect particle creation and evaporation in bumblebee gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the impact of non-metricity on particle creation and the evaporation process of black holes within the framework of bumblebee gravity. In general lines, we compare black holes in the metric formalism [1] and the metric-affine approach [2]. Initially, we focus on bosonic particle modes to investigate Hawking radiation. Using the Klein-Gordon equation, we compute the Bogoliubov coefficients and derive the Hawking temperature. Subsequently, we examine Hawking radiation as a tunneling process, resolving divergent integrals through the residue method. The analysis is then extended to fermionic particle modes, also within the tunneling framework. Particle creation densities are calculated for both bosonic and fermionic cases. Additionally, greybody bounds are estimated for bosonic and fermionic particles. Finally, we explore the evaporation process, considering the final state of the black holes. In a general panorama, non-metricity in bumblebee gravity raises particle density for bosons while reducing it for fermions, increases greybody factors (for both bosons and fermions), amplifies the emission rate, and accelerates the evaporation process.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Waterfall: a unitary phenomenological model for black hole evaporation with Page curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unitary phenomenological model for black hole evaporation based on the analogy of the laboratory process of spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) \cite{Alsing:2015,Alsing:2016} when the black hole (pump) is allowed to deplete to zero mass. The model incorporates an additional new feature that allows for the interior Hawking partner-particles (idlers) behind the horizon to further generate new Hawking particle pairs of lower energy, one of which remains behind the horizon, and the other that adds to the externally emitted Hawking radiation (signals) outside the horizon. This model produces a Page curve for the evolution of the reduced density matrices for the evaporating black hole internal degrees of freedom entangled with the generated Hawking radiation pairs entangled across the horizon. The Page curve yields an entropy that rises at early times during the evaporation process as Hawking pairs are generated, reaches a peak midway through the evolution, and then decays to zero upon complete evaporation of the black hole. The entire system remains in a pure state at all times undergoing unitary (squeezed state) evolution, with the initial state of the black hole modeled as a bosonic Fock state of large, but finite number $n_{p0}$ of particles. For the final state of the system, the black hole reaches the vacuum state of zero mass, while the external Hawking radiation carries away the total energy of the initial black hole. Inside the horizon there remains $n_{p0}$ Hawking partner-particles of vanishingly small total energy, reminiscent of the "soft-hair" (zero energy) qubit model of Hotta, Nambu and Yamaguchi \cite{Hotta_Nambu_Yamaguchi:2018}, but now from a Hamiltonian for squeezed state generation perspective. The model presented here can be readily extended to encompass arbitrary initial pure states for the black hole, and in falling matter.</description>

      <title>Forecast constraints on the axion-photon coupling from interstellar medium heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In interstellar media characterized by a nonrelativistic plasma of electrons and heavy ions, we study the effect of axion dark matter coupled to photons on the dynamics of an electric field. In particular, we assume the presence of a background magnetic field aligned in a specific direction. We show that there is an energy transfer from the oscillating axion field to photons and then to the plasma induced by forced resonance. This resonance is most prominent for the axion mass $m_{\phi}$ equivalent to the plasma frequency $\omega_p$. Requiring that the heating rate of the interstellar medium caused by the energy transfer does not exceed the observed astrophysical cooling rate, we place forecast constraints on the axion-photon coupling $g$ for several different amplitudes of the background magnetic field $B_0$. By choosing a typical value $B_0=10^{-5}$ G, we find that, for the resonance mass $m_{\phi}=\omega_p$, the upper limit of $g$ can be stronger than those derived from other measurements in the literature. With increased values of $B_0$, it is possible to put more stringent constraints on $g$ for a wider range of the axion mass away from the resonance point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the potential occurrence of a numerical instability in the long-time simulation of black holes using the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura formulation of numerical relativity, even in the simple set-up of a Schwarzschild black hole. Through extensive numerical experiments, we identify that this ``late-time instability'' arises from accumulated violations of the momentum constraint. To address this issue, we propose two modified versions of the so-called conformal covariant Z4 scheme, designed to propagate momentum constraint violations without damping. Our results demonstrate that these alternative formulations, which we refer to as CCZ4' and CCZ3, effectively resolve the late-time numerical instability not only in Schwarzschild spacetimes but also in black hole spacetimes with matter fields. Notably, by preventing damping of the momentum constraint violation, the Hamiltonian constraint damping can be significantly increased, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing long-term evolution in our proposed schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been argued that the action of the Schwinger mechanism in the gauge sector of Quantum Chromodynamics leads to the generation of a gluon mass scale. Within this scenario, the analytic structure of the fundamental vertices is modified by the creation of scalar colored excitations with vanishing mass. In the limit of zero momentum transfer, these terms act as massless poles, providing the required conditions for the infrared stabilization of the gluon propagator, and producing a characteristic displacement to the associated Ward identities. In this article we offer an extensive overview of the salient notions and techniques underlying this dynamical picture. We place particular emphasis on recent developments related to the exact renormalization of the mass, the nonlinear nature of the pole equation, and the key role played by Fredholm's alternatives theorem.</description>

Abstract: This study derives the mass spectrum and entropy of the Brown--Kucha\v{r} dust in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime using the fractional Wheeler--DeWitt (WDW) equation. The generalized fractional WDW equation is formulated using a fractional quantization map, demonstrating a correlation between the fractal mass dimension of the Brown--Kucha\v{r} dust and L\'evy's fractional parameter $\alpha$ of the Riesz fractional quantum operator. These findings may provide new insights into the ramifications of the fractal behavior of cosmic structures in quantum cosmology and quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: We use up to fourth-order charm fluctuations and their correlations with net baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness fluctuations, calculated within the framework of lattice QCD, to study the continuum partial pressure contributions of charmed baryons and mesons. We show that, at and below the chiral crossover temperature, these partial pressures receive enhanced contributions from experimentally unobserved charmed hadrons predicted by the Quark Model. Additionally, we demonstrate that at the chiral crossover, the Hadron Resonance Gas description breaks down, signaling the onset of charm deconfinement. We present evidence for the survival of low-lying non-radial $1S$ and $1P$ hadron-like excitations above the chiral crossover. Finally, we investigate the continuum partial pressure contribution of charm quark-like excitation that emerges at the chiral crossover and calculate its temperature-dependent in-medium mass.</description>

      <title>Probing Loop Quantum Gravity via Kerr Black Hole and EHT Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a study on optical properties and shadow of quantum Schwarzschild black hole appeared in [Ye et al., Phys. Lett. B 851, 138566, (2024)] for a fixed Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$. Following the same approach, we considered its rotating counterpart which is precisely a deformed Kerr metric in Loop Quantum Gravity. The deviation between the quantum-corrected Kerr and Kerr black holes has been investigated by the analysis of horizon structure and null geodesics by assuming a fixed value of $\gamma$. We have proved a theorem dealing with the location of unstable circular null orbits for all metrics of this kind by incorporating the convexity of effective potential of the Kerr black hole. The deviation between the shadows of the quantum-corrected and Kerr black holes has also been studied, and lastly the shadow analysis is incorporated in comparison with the EHT results for M87* and Sgr A* to precisely probe the quantity of deviation due to quantum correction. We have found that the quantum correction significantly reduces the extremal spin value and hence the size of the black hole as compared to Kerr black hole. Moreover, the unstable null orbits for quantum black hole are always smaller than the unstable null orbits for Kerr black hole. Lastly, we found that the quantum correction allows the deformed Kerr black hole to mimic Sgr A* with a higher probability than the Kerr black hole. However, the quantum-corrected Kerr black hole barely mimics M87*.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Hilbert problems, Fredholm determinants, explicit combinatorial expansions, and connection formulas for the general $q$-Painlev\'e III$_3$ tau functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reformulate the $q$-difference linear system corresponding to the $q$-Painlev\'e equation of type $A_7^{(1)'}$ as a Riemann-Hilbert problem on a circle. Then, we consider the Fredholm determinant built from the jump of this Riemann-Hilbert problem and prove that it satisfies bilinear relations equivalent to $P(A_7^{(1)'})$. We also find the minor expansion of this Fredholm determinant in explicit factorized form and prove that it coincides with the Fourier series in $q$-deformed conformal blocks, or partition functions of the pure $5d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory, including the cases with the Chern-Simons term. Finally, we solve the connection problem for these isomonodromic tau functions, finding in this way their global behavior.</description>

      <title>Solving information loss paradox via Euclidean path integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.01005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The information loss paradox associated with black hole Hawking evaporation is an unresolved problem in modern theoretical physics. In this paper, we revisit the entanglement entropy via the Euclidean path integral (EPI) of the quantum state and allow for the branching of semi-classical histories along the Lorentzian evolution. We posit that there exist at least two histories that contribute to EPI, where one is an information-losing history while the other is information-preserving. At early times, the former dominates EPI, while at late times the latter becomes dominant. By so doing we recover the essence of the Page curve and thus the unitarity, albeit with the turning point, i.e., the Page time, much shifted toward the late time. One implication of this modified Page curve is that the entropy bound may thus be violated. We comment on the similarity and difference between our approach and that of the replica wormholes and the island conjecture.</description>

      <title>Coherence revival under the Unruh effect and its metrological advantage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.01358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quantum coherence extraction {between} two accelerating Unruh-DeWitt detectors, coupling to a scalar field in $(3+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. We find that quantum coherence as a nonclassical correlation can be generated through the Markovian evolution of the {detector} system, just like quantum entanglement. However, with growing Unruh temperature, in contrast to monotonously degrading entanglement, we find that quantum coherence exhibits a striking revival phenomenon. For certain detectors' initial state choices, {the} coherence measure will reduce to zero at first {and} then grow to an asymptotic value. We verify such coherence revival by inspecting its metrological advantage on the quantum Fisher information (QFI) enhancement. Since the maximal QFI {bounds} the accuracy of quantum parameter estimation, we conclude that the extracted coherence can be utilized as a physical resource in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>On the Proof of Chiral Symmetry Breaking from Anomaly Matching in QCD-like Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02930v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We critically reconsider the argument based on 't Hooft anomaly matching that aims at proving chiral symmetry breaking in confining four-dimensional QCD-like theories with $N_c&gt;2$ colors and $N_f$ flavors. The main line of reasoning relies on a property of the solutions of the anomaly matching and persistent mass equations called $N_f$-independence. In previous works, the validity of $N_f$-independence was assumed based on qualitative arguments, but it was never proven rigorously. We provide a detailed proof and clarify under which (dynamical) conditions it holds. Our results are valid for a generic spectrum of massless composite fermions including baryons and exotics.</description>

      <title>Constraints on branes' geometry from massive vector KK modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the gauge invariance of massive vector Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes within various 6D brane models. Our analysis reveals that additional constraints on the brane's geometry are essential to maintain the gauge invariance of the massive vector KK modes. However, these conditions are not universally satisfied by brane solutions, leading to loss of gauge invariance. In instances where the brane solutions align with the conditions, we compute the mass spectra of both vector and scalar KK modes, and find some resonances for the KK modes in one of the brane models. Our findings indicate that the presence of a single type of massive scalar KK mode will break the gauge invariance.</description>

      <title>Topologically Stable BPS and Non-BPS States in Supersymmetric $\mathcal{N}=2$ Baby-Skyrme Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supersymmetric baby-Skyrme model is an interesting field theoretical model, and its BPS states have been studied using the usual methods. Here, we propose a novel method to rigorously obtain both topologically stable BPS and non-BPS states in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ baby Skyrme Model. It is observed that the BPS states found using this novel method coincide with the BPS states found using the usual methods. However, we are also able to obtain the non-BPS states, which break all of the supersymmetry of the theory. Furthermore, there exists a one-parameter family of non-BPS solutions that are connected to the half-BPS solutions, where half of the supersymmetry is restored when the parameter is set to zero. The proposed method is general, and we expect that it might be useful for investigating the topologically stable non-BPS states of other theories. Thus, this method could possibly have wide applications for the study of non-BPS states in supersymmetric theories.</description>

      <title>SymTh for non-finite symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) is a convenient tool for studying finite generalized symmetries of a given quantum field theory (QFT). In particular, SymTFTs encode all the symmetry structures and properties, including anomalies. Recently, this tool has been applied for non-finite symmetries as well. In this paper, we take a different route, which consists of considering a free theory rather than a topological field theory in the bulk. We call it Symmetry Theory (SymTh). We study its topological operators together with the free boundary conditions. We also propose a procedure that is analogous to the sandwich construction of SymTFTs and allows us to obtain the physical QFT. We apply this to many examples, ranging from abelian $p$-form symmetries to 2-groups, and the (solvable) case of group-like symmetries in quantum mechanics. Finally, we provide a derivation of the SymTh of $\mathbb Q/ \mathbb Z$ non-invertible symmetries from the dimensional reduction of IIB supergravity on the conifold. In addition, we give an ultraviolet interpretation of the quantum Hall states dressing the non-invertible $\mathbb Q/ \mathbb Z$ topological defects, in terms of branes in the IIB supergravity background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of a state of a relativistic quantum field theory restricted to a spatial subregion $\Omega$. More precisely, we use the Feynman-Vernon influence functional formalism to describe the dynamics of the field theory in the interior of $\Omega$ arising after integrating out the degrees of freedom in the exterior. We show how the influence of the environment gets encoded in a boundary term. Furthermore, we derive a stochastic equation of motion for the field expectation value in the interior. We find that the boundary conditions obtained in this way are energy non-conserving and non-local in space and time. Our results find applications in understanding the emergence of local thermalization in relativistic quantum field theories and the relationship between quantum field theory and relativistic fluid dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Five new families of noncommutative lightcones in 2+1 dimensions are presented as the quantizations of the inequivalent Poisson homogeneous structures that emerge when the lightcone is constructed as a homogeneous space of the SO(2,1) conformal group. Each of these noncommutative lightcones maintains covariance under the action of the respective quantum deformation of the SO(2,1) conformal group. We discuss the role played by SO(2,1) automorphisms in the classification of inequivalent Poisson homogeneous lightcones, as well as the geometric aspects of this construction. The localization properties of the novel quantum lightcones are analyzed and shown to be deeply connected with the geometric features of the Poisson homogeneous spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the double scaling limit of $\beta$-deformed planar N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM), which has been argued to be conformal and integrable. It is a special point in the three-parameter space of double-scaled $\gamma_i$-deformed N = 4 SYM, preserving N = 1 supersymmetry. The Feynman diagrams of the general three-parameter models form a "dynamical fishnet" that is much harder to analyze than the original one-parameter fishnet, where major progress in uncovering the model's integrable structure has been made in recent years. Here we show that by applying N = 1 superspace techniques to the $\beta$-deformed model the dynamical nature of its Feynman graph expansion disappears, and we recover a regular lattice structure of brick wall (honeycomb) type. As a first application, we compute the zero-mode-fixed thermodynamic free energy of this model by applying Zamolodchikov's method of inversion to the supersymmetric brick wall diagrams.</description>

Abstract: We consider the dimensional reduction of N=(2,0) conformal supergravity in six dimensions on a two-torus to N=4 conformal supergravity in four dimensions. At the level of kinematics, the six-dimensional Weyl multiplet is shown to reduce to a mixture of the N=4 Weyl and vector multiplets, which can be reinterpreted as a new off-shell multiplet of N=4 conformal supergravity. Similar multiplets have been constructed in other settings and are referred to as dilaton Weyl multiplets. We derive it here for the first time in a maximally supersymmetric context in four dimensions. Furthermore, we present the non-linear relations between all the six- and four-dimensional bosonic and fermionic fields, that are obtained by comparing the off-shell supersymmetry transformation rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to examine the simulation of integrable quantum systems using quantum computers, it is crucial to first classify Yang-Baxter operators. Hietarinta was among the first to classify constant Yang-Baxter solutions for a two-dimensional local Hilbert space (qubit representation). Including the one produced by the permutation operator, he was able to construct eleven families of invertible solutions. These techniques are effective for 4 by 4 solutions, but they become difficult to use for representations with more dimensions. To get over this limitation, we use algebraic ans\"{a}tze to generate the constant Yang-Baxter solutions in a representation independent way. We employ four distinct algebraic structures that, depending on the qubit representation, replicate 10 of the 11 Hietarinta families. Among the techniques are partition algebras, Clifford algebras, Temperley-Lieb algebras, and a collection of commuting operators. Using these techniques, we do not obtain the $(2,2)$ Hietarinta class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on previous work on de Sitter extremal surfaces anchored at the future boundary, we study no-boundary extremal surfaces in slow-roll inflation models, with perturbations to no-boundary global $dS$ preserving the spatial isometry. While in pure de Sitter space the Euclidean hemisphere gives a real area equalling half de Sitter entropy, the no-boundary extremal surface areas here have nontrivial real and imaginary pieces overall. We evaluate the area integrals in the complex time-plane defining appropriate contours. For the 4-dim case, the real and imaginary finite corrections at leading order in the slow-roll parameter match those in the semiclassical expansion of the Wavefunction (or action), and corroborate the cosmic brane interpretation discussed previously. We also study no-boundary extremal surfaces in other cosmologies including 3-dimensional inflation and Schwarzschild de Sitter spaces with small mass.</description>

Abstract: The vacuum entanglement entropy of a general conformal field theory (CFT) in $d=5$ spacetime dimensions contains a universal term, $F(A)$, which has a complicated and non-local dependence on the geometric details of the region $A$ and the theory. Analogously to the previously known $d=3$ case, we prove that for CFTs in $d=5$ which are holographically dual to Einstein gravity, $F(A)$ is equal to a four-dimensional version of the ``Willmore energy'' associated to a doubled and closed version of the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface of $A$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^5$. This generalized Willmore energy is shown to arise from a conformal-invariant codimension-two functional obtained by evaluating six-dimensional Conformal Gravity on the conically-singular orbifold of the replica trick. The new functional involves an integral over the doubled RT surface of a linear combination of three quartic terms in extrinsic curvatures and is free from ultraviolet divergences by construction. We verify explicitly the validity of our new formula for various entangling regions and argue that, as opposed to the $d=3$ case, $F(A)$ is not globally minimized by a round ball $A=\mathbb{B}^4$. Rather, $F(A)$ can take arbitrarily positive and negative values as a function of $A$. Hence, we conclude that the round ball is not a global minimizer of $F(A)$ for general five-dimensional CFTs.</description>

Abstract: The loop-Amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}^{(L)}_{n}$ is a semialgebraic set in the product of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}_{\mathbb{R}}(2,4)^L$. Recently, many aspects of this geometry for the case of $L=1$ have been elucidated, such as its algebraic and face stratification, its residual arrangement and the existence and uniqueness of the adjoint. This paper extends this analysis to the simplest higher loop case given by the two-loop four-point Amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}^{(2)}_4$.</description>

      <title>Holographic Boundary Conformal Field Theory within Horndeski Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate entanglement islands and the Page curve in the framework of Horndeski gravity on a Karch-Randall braneworld background. In particular, treating the holographic boundary conformal field theory analytically we find that the Horndeski parameters significantly alter the behavior of the Page curve compared to standard general relativity, a feature caused by the nontrivial geometry induced by the Horndeski scalar field. Interestingly enough, the geometry far from the AdS limit plays a more significant role compared to previous studies. This suggests that Horndeski gravity introduces important modifications to the distribution of quantum information in the holographic model. Finally, we claim that holographic consistency can be used reversely to impose constraints on Horndeski gravity itself, providing a new tool for probing the validity of modified gravity theories.</description>

Abstract: Instant Folded Strings (IFSs) are unconventional light strings that emerge when the string coupling increases with time. A particularly intriguing property of IFSs, especially relevant to cosmology, is that they violate the Null Energy Condition (NEC). In this paper, we begin to explore their cosmological effects. We find that NEC violation by IFSs is significantly suppressed in an expanding universe, leading to a universe that resembles our own, comprising matter, radiation, and dark energy. Upon closer examination, these components exhibit subtle, nonstandard traits that could be experimentally tested in the future. Notably, the origin of dark energy stems not only from the potential, as is usually the case, but also from the derivative of the potential with respect to the dilaton. This paves the way for a new approach to realizing inflation within string theory, addressing the Dine-Seiberg problem associated with dilaton stabilization, and perhaps even hinting at a novel mechanism to tackle the cosmological constant problem. Conversely, in a contracting universe, the effects of IFSs are amplified, making bouncing cosmologies a natural and prevalent outcome.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study non-invertible twisted compactification of class $\mathcal S$ theories on $S^1$: we insert a non-invertible symmetry defect at $S^1$ extending along remaining directions and then compactify on $S^1$. We show that the resulting 3d theory is 3d $\mathcal N=4$ sigma model whose target space is a hyperK\"ahler submanifold of Hitchin moduli space, i.e. a $(B,B,B)$ brane. The $(B,B,B)$ brane is the fixed point set on Hitchin moduli space of a finite subgroup of mapping class group of underlying Riemann surface. We describe the $(B,B,B)$ branes as affine varieties and calculate concrete examples of these $(B,B,B)$ branes for type $A_1$, genus $2$ class $\mathcal S$ theory.</description>

      <title>DeWitt wave functions for de Sitter JT gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity in two-dimensional de Sitter space is an intriguing model for cosmological "wave functions of the universe". Its minisuperspace version already contains all physical information. The size of compact slices is parametrized by a scale factor $h &gt; 0$. The dilaton $\phi$ is chosen to have positive values, $\phi &gt; 0$, and interpreted as size of an additional compact slice in a higher-dimensional theory. At the boundaries $h=0$, $\phi=0$, where the volume of the universe vanishes, the curvature is generically singular. According to a conjecture by DeWitt, solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation should vanish at singular loci. Recently, the behaviour of JT wave functions at large field values $h$, $\phi$ has been obtained by means of a path integral over Schwarzian degrees of freedom of a boundary curve. We systematically analyze solutions of the WDW equation with Schwarzian asymptotic behaviour. We find real analytic solutions that vanish on the entire boundary, in agreement with DeWitt's conjecture. Projection to expanding and contracting branches may lead to singularities, which can however be avoided by an appropriate superposition of solutions. Our analysis also illustrates the limitations of semiclassical wave functions.</description>

      <title>The Fuzzball Paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the puzzles that arise in the quantum theory of black holes, and explain how they are resolved in string theory. We review how the Bekenstein entropy is obtained through the count of brane bound states. We describe the fuzzball construction of black hole microstates. These states have no horizon and radiate from their surface like a normal body, so there is no information puzzle. We explain how the semiclassical approximation is violated in gravitational collapse even though curvatures are low at the classical horizon. This violation happens because the collapse leads to a stretching of space that is {\it fast}: light does not have time to travel across the collapsing region to establish the `vecro' correlations needed in the quantum gravitational vacuum. These vecro correlations arise from the existence of virtual fuzzball fluctuations in the gravitational vacuum, and are significant because of the large degeneracy of fuzzball states implied by the Bekenstein entropy. It is plausible that similar effects of fast expansion may be responsible for effects like dark energy and the Early Dark Energy postulated to explain the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Re-parameterization Invariance of FRW Model: Supervariable and BRST Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin BRST) quantization of a (0 + 1)-dimensional cosmological Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model. This quantization leverages the classical infinitesimal and continuous re-parameterization symmetry transformations of the system. To derive the nilpotent re-parameterization invariant BRST-anti-BRST symmetry transformations for the scale factor and corresponding momentum variables present in the cosmological FRW model, we employ the modified Bonora-Tonin supervariable approach (MBTSA) to BRST formalism. Through this approach, we also establish the BRST-anti-BRST invariant Curci-Ferrari (CF)-type restriction for this cosmological re-parameterization invariant model. Further, we obtain the off-shell nilpotent quantum BRST-anti-BRST symmetry transformations for other variables within the model using the (anti-)chiral supervariable approach (ACSA) to BRST formalism. Within the framework of ACSA, the CF-type restriction is demonstrated through two key aspects: (i) the invariance of the coupled Lagrangians under symmetry transformations, and (ii) the absolute anti-commutativity of the conserved BRST-anti-BRST charges. Notably, applying the MBTSA to a physical cosmological system, specifically a one-dimensional one, constitutes a novel contribution to this work. Additionally, in the application of ACSA, we restrict our analysis to (anti-)chiral super expansions of supervariables, leading to the unique observation of the absolute anti-commutativity of the conserved BRST-anti-BRST charges. Moreover, we highlight that the CF-type restriction demonstrates a universal nature, remaining consistent across any re-parameterization invariant models in general D-dimensional spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss topological defect lines in holomorphic vertex operators algebras and superalgebras, in particular Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman Monster VOA $V^\natural$ with central charge $c=24$, and Conway module SVOA $V^{f\natural}$ with $c=12$. First, we consider duality defects in $V^\natural$ for all non-anomalous Fricke elements of the Monster group, and provide a general formula for the corresponding defect McKay-Thompson series. Furthermore, we describe some general properties of the category of defect lines preserving the $N=1$ superVirasoro algebra in $V^{f\natural}$. We argue that, under some mild assumptions, every such defect in $V^{f\natural}$ is associated with a $\mathbb{Z}$-linear map form the Leech lattice to itself. This correspondence establishes a surjective (not injective) ring homomorphism between the Grothendieck ring of the category of topological defects and the ring of Leech lattice endomorphisms. Finally, we speculate about possible generalization of the Moonshine conjectures that include topological defect lines.</description>

      <title>Evolution of entanglement entropy at SU($N$) deconfined quantum critical points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02547v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the enigma of the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) has attracted broad attention across the condensed matter, quantum field theory, and high-energy physics communities, as it is expected to offer a new paradigm in theory, experiment, and numerical simulations that goes beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework of symmetry breaking and phase transitions. However, the nature of DQCP has been controversial. For instance, in the square-lattice spin-1/2 $J$-$Q$ model, believed to realize the DQCP between N\'eel and valence bond solid states, conflicting results, such as first-order versus continuous transition, and critical exponents incompatible with conformal bootstrap bounds, have been reported. The enigma of DQCP is exemplified in its anomalous logarithmic subleading contribution in its entanglement entropy (EE), which was discussed in recent studies. In the current work, we demonstrate that similar anomalous logarithmic behavior persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. We systematically study the quantum EE of square-lattice SU($N$) DQCP spin models. Based on large-scale quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE, we show that for a series of $N$ smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists in the EE, which implies that the previously determined DQCPs in these models do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when $N\ge N_c$ with a finite $N_c$ that we evaluate to lie between $7$ and $8$, the DQCPs are consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the Abelian Higgs field theory with $N$ complex components.</description>

      <title>Insights and guidelines on the Cauchy horizon theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently there has been progress to resolve the issue regarding the non-existence of the Cauchy horizon inside the static, charged, and spherically symmetric black holes. However, when we generically extend the black holes' spacetime, they are not just static but can be dynamical, thus the interior of black holes does not remain the same as the static case when we take into account the dynamical evolution of black holes. Hence, the properties of the Cauchy horizon could behave differently in the dynamical case. Then, our aim in this paper is to provide a few constructive insights and guidelines regarding this issue by revisiting a few examples of the gravitational collapse of spherically symmetric charged black holes using the double-null formalism. Our numerical results demonstrate that the inside of the outer horizon is no longer static even in late time, and the inner apparent horizon exists but is not regular. The inner apparent horizon can be distinguished clearly from the Cauchy horizon. The spherical symmetric property of black holes allows the inner horizon to be defined in two directions, i.e., the differentiation of the areal radius vanishes along either the out-going or the in-going null direction. Moreover, the Cauchy horizon can be generated from a singularity. Finally, we show some examples that the ``hair" which is associated with the matter field on the inner horizon is not important to determine the existence of the Cauchy horizon; rather, the hair on the outer horizon might play an important role on the Cauchy horizon. Therefore, the dynamic properties of the interior of charged black holes could shed light for us to understand deeply about the Cauchy horizon for the extensions of no-Cauchy-horizon theorems.</description>

Abstract: It is pointed out that every renormalizable field theory has a symmetry which is hidden in plain sight. In all practical cases, it is also broken softly, either explicitly or spontaneously. The soft explicit breaking mass terms may be assumed naturally small compared to the scalar mass-squared terms. Implications for extensions of the standard model are discussed. New left-right model of radiative Dirac neutrino mass is proposed.</description>

Abstract: Lattice simulations reveal that the deconfinement-confinement (D-C) phase transition (PT) of the hot pure $SU(N&gt;2)$ Yang-Mills system is first order. This system can be described by a pool of quasigluons moving in the Polyakov loop background, and in this picture, we establish an effective distribution function for quasigluons, which encodes interactions among quasigluons and in particular the confinement effect. With it, we made the first attempt to calculate the confinement bubble wall velocity $v_w$ at the microscopical level, and we obtained a small velocity $v_w\sim 0.04$ using two different approaches, which is qualitatively consistent with others results like holography.</description>

Abstract: We study Hawking radiation and wave scattering of charged scalar fields in a charged $C$-metric black hole background. The conformally invariant wave equation for charged scalar fields can be separated into radial and angular parts, each with five singularities. We first show that the radial and angular equations can be respectively transformed into the general Heun equation, and then we explore exact solutions of the radial Heun equation in terms of the local Heun functions and connection coefficients. Exact behaviors of the asymptotic wave functions are determined without approximations. We further apply the exact results to derive Hawking radiation, quasinormal modes and superradiance.</description>

      <title>Analytic continuations and numerical evaluation of the Appell $F_1$, $F_3$, Lauricella $F_D^{(3)}$ and Lauricella-Saran $F_S^{(3)}$ and their Application to Feynman Integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present our investigation of the study of two variable hypergeometric series, namely Appell $F_{1}$ and $F_{3}$ series, and obtain a comprehensive list of its analytic continuations enough to cover the whole real $(x,y)$ plane, except on their singular loci. We also derive analytic continuations of their 3-variable generalization, the Lauricella $F_{D}^{(3)}$ series and the Lauricella-Saran $F_{S}^{(3)}$ series, leveraging the analytic continuations of $F_{1}$ and $F_{3}$, which ensures that the whole real $(x,y,z)$ space is covered, except on the singular loci of these functions. While these studies are motivated by the frequent occurrence of these multivariable hypergeometric functions in Feynman integral evaluation, they can also be used whenever they appear in other branches of mathematical physics. To facilitate their practical use, we provide four packages: $\texttt{AppellF1.wl}$, $\texttt{AppellF3.wl}$, $\texttt{LauricellaFD.wl}$, and $\texttt{LauricellaSaranFS.wl}$ in $\textit{MATHEMATICA}$. These packages are applicable for generic as well as non-generic values of parameters, keeping in mind their utilities in the evaluation of the Feynman integrals. We explicitly present various physical applications of these packages in the context of Feynman integral evaluation and compare the results using other packages such as $\texttt{FIESTA}$. Upon applying the appropriate conventions for numerical evaluation, we find that the results obtained from our packages are consistent. Various $\textit{Mathematica}$ notebooks demonstrating different numerical results are also provided along with this paper.</description>

      <title>A misleading naming convention: de Sitter `tachyonic' scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the concept of de Sitter (dS) 'tachyonic' scalar fields, characterized by discrete negative squared mass values, and assess their physical significance through a rigorous Wigner-inspired group-theoretical analysis. This perspective demonstrates that such fields, often misinterpreted as inherently unstable due to their mass parameter, are best understood within the framework of unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of the dS group. The discrete mass spectrum arises naturally in this representation framework, offering profound insights into the interplay between dS relativity and quantum field theory. Contrary to their misleading nomenclature, we argue that the 'mass' parameter associated with these fields lacks intrinsic physical relevance, challenging traditional assumptions that link it to physical instability. Instead, any perceived instability originates from mismanagement of the system's inherent gauge invariance rather than the fields themselves. A proper treatment of this gauge symmetry, particularly through the Gupta-Bleuler formalism, restores the expected characteristics of these fields as free quantum entities in a highly symmetric spacetime. This study seeks to dispel misconceptions surrounding dS 'tachyonic' fields, underscoring the importance of precise terminology and robust theoretical tools in addressing their unique properties.</description>

      <title>Electric field induction in quark-gluon plasma due to thermoelectric effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic heavy-ion collisions produce quark-gluon plasma (QGP), which is locally thermalized. Due to electrically charged particles (quarks), QGP exhibits interesting thermoelectric phenomena during its evolution, resulting in an electromagnetic (EM) field in the medium. In this study, for the first time, we estimate the induced electric field in QGP due to the thermoelectric effect. This phenomenon can induce an EM field even in QGP produced by the head-on heavy-ion collision. In peripheral heavy-ion collisions, the presence of a spectator current generates a transient magnetic field at the early stage, which disrupts the isotropy of the induced electric field. For the numerical estimation, we use a quasiparticle-based model that incorporates the lattice quantum chromodynamics equation of state for QGP. The induced electric field is estimated with cooling rates derived from Gubser hydrodynamic flow. Thermoelectric coefficients such as Seebeck, magneto-Seebeck, and Nernst coefficients play a crucial role in determining the induced field. Additionally, we account for the temperature evolution of QGP using different hydrodynamic cooling rates to calculate the transport coefficients. We also estimate the transport coefficients and the induced electric field in the presence of an external time-varying magnetic field, including the quantum effect of Landau quantization, and explore the effects of the intensity and decay parameter of the magnetic field on the induced electric field. Our findings reveal that the space-time profile of the induced electric field is zero at the center and increases as we go away from the center. During the early stages of evolution, the electric field can reach a maximum value of $eE \approx 1~m_\pi^2$, decreasing in strength over time.</description>

      <title>Generating Lattice Non-invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice non-invertible symmetries have rich fusion structures and play important roles in understanding various exotic topological phases. In this paper, we explore methods to generate new lattice non-invertible transformations/symmetries from a given non-invertible seed transformation/symmetry. The new lattice non-invertible symmetry is constructed by composing the seed transformations on different sites or sandwiching a unitary transformation between the transformations on the same sites. In addition to known non-invertible symmetries with fusion algebras of Tambara-Yamagami $\mathbb Z_N\times\mathbb Z_N$ type, we obtain a new non-invertible symmetry in models with $\mathbb Z_N$ dipole symmetries. We name the latter the dipole Kramers-Wannier symmetry because it arises from gauging the dipole symmetry. We further study the dipole Kramers-Wannier symmetry in depth, including its topological defect, its anomaly and its associated generalized Kennedy-Tasaki transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The supertranslation ambiguity of angular momentum is a long-standing problem in general relativity, which arises the puzzle of the angular momentum loss in the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion. The angular momentum loss in gravitational scattering is of order $G^2$ in the linear response theory but of order $G^3$ in the amplitudes-based methods. In this paper, we propose a generic prescription to fix the supertranslation ambiguity in the PM expansion which will uniquely determine the angular momentum loss. The proposal is self-contained and involves only the null infinity data.</description>

      <title>Effects of quantum corrections to Lorentzian vacuum transitions in the presence of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the vacuum transition probabilities taking into account quantum corrections. We first introduce a general method that expands previous works employing the Lorentzian formalism of the Wheeler-De Witt equation by considering higher order terms in the semiclassical expansion. The method presented is applicable in principle to any model in the minisuperspace and up to any desired order in the quantum correction terms. Then, we apply this method to obtain analytical solutions for the probabilities up to second quantum corrections for homogeneous isotropic and anisotropic universes. We use the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric with positive and zero curvature for the isotropic case and the Bianchi III and Kantowski-Sachs metrics for the anisotropic case. Interpreting the results as distribution probabilities of creating universes by vacuum decay with a given size, we found that the general behaviour is that considering up to the second quantum correction leads to an avoidance of the initial singularity. However, we show that this result can only be achieved for the isotropic universe. Furthermore, we also study the effect of anisotropy on the transition probabilities.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounce effect in quantum BTZ black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel thermodynamic phenomenon has been observed in the quantum Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (qBTZ) black hole, utilizing generalized free energy and Kramer escape rate. This phenomenon also reveals the unique property of the quantum black hole. The stochastic thermal motion of various thermodynamic states within the black hole system induces phase transitions, under the influence of generalized free energy which obtained by extending Maxwell's construction. Through the analysis of Kramer escape rate, it is discovered that the qBTZ black hole thermodynamic system exhibits a bounce effect. It originates from the non-monotonicity of entropy in black hole thermodynamic systems. Furthermore, the overall thermodynamic picture of the qBTZ black hole has been obtained under different quantum backreactions.</description>

      <title>Linearized Stability of Harada Thin-Shell Wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Darmois-Israel-Sen junction conditions, and with help of Visser's cut-and-paste method, we study the dynamics of thin-shell wormholes that are made of two conformally Killing gravity (a.k.a Harada gravity) black holes. We check the energy conditions for different values of the new parameter that Harada introduced, as alternative for dark energy. We examine the radial acceleration to reveal the attractive and repulsive characteristics of the thin-shell wormhole throat. We consider the dynamics and stability of the wormhole around the static solutions of the linearized radial perturbations at the wormhole throat. Finally, we determine the regions of stability by applying the concavity test on the ``speed of sound'' as a function in the throat radius and other spacetime parameters, particularly the new Harada parameter.</description>

      <title>Conformal quantum mechanics of causal diamonds: Time evolution, thermality, and instability via path integral functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An observer with a finite lifetime $\mathcal{T}$ perceives the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal state at temperature $T_D = 2 \hbar/(\pi \mathcal{T})$, as a result of being constrained to a double-coned-shaped region known as a causal diamond. In this paper, we explore the emergence of thermality in causal diamonds due to the role played by the symmetries of conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) as a (0+1)-dimensional conformal field theory, within the de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan model and generalizations. In this context, the hyperbolic operator $S$ of the SO(2,1) symmetry of CQM: (i) is the generator of the time evolution of a diamond observer; (ii) its dynamical behavior leads to the predicted thermal nature; and (iii) its associated quantum instability has a Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L = \pi T_D/\hbar$, which is half the upper saturation bound of the information scrambling rate. Our approach is based on a comprehensive framework of path-integral representations of the CQM generators in canonical and microcanonical forms, supplemented by semiclassical arguments. The properties of the operator $S$ are studied with emphasis on an operator duality with the corresponding elliptic operator $R$, using a representation in terms of an effective scale-invariant inverse square potential combined with inverted and ordinary harmonic oscillator potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal diamonds are known to have thermal behavior that can be probed by finite-lifetime observers equipped with energy-scaled detectors. This thermality can be attributed to the time evolution of observers within the causal diamond, governed by one of the conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) symmetry generators: the noncompact hyperbolic operator $S$. In this paper, we show that the unbounded nature of $S$ endows it with a quantum instability, which is a generalization of a similar property exhibited by the inverted harmonic oscillator potential. Our analysis is semiclassical, including a detailed phase-space study of the classical dynamics of $S$ and its dual operator $R$, and a general semiclassical framework yielding basic instability and thermality properties that play a crucial role in the quantum behavior of the theory. For an observer with a finite lifetime $\mathcal{T}$, the detected temperature
  $T_D = 2 \hbar/(\pi \mathcal{T})$ is associated with a Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L = \pi T_D/\hbar$, which is half the upper saturation bound of the information scrambling rate.</description>

      <title>All non-expanding gravitational waves in $D$-dimensional (anti-)de Sitter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a complete, theory-independent classification of $D$-dimensional Kundt spacetimes of Weyl and traceless-Ricci type N. We show that these geometries consist of three invariantly defined subfamilies, namely (generalized) Kundt, pp- and Siklos waves, for each of which we obtain a convenient canonical form. As a byproduct, this also demonstrates that such metrics coincide with the class of non-expanding (A)dS-Kerr-Schild spacetimes. The role of these spacetimes in Einstein's gravity (including minimally coupled $p$-forms and non-linear electrodynamics) as non-expanding gravitational waves in an (anti)-de Sitter background is discussed. Furthermore, applications to extended theories such as Gauss-Bonnet, Lovelock, quadratic and $f(R)$ gravity are also briefly illustrated, as well as the overlap of the obtained metrics with universal and almost-universal spacetimes. In the appendices we additionally settle the issue of the redundancy of certain field equations for all Kundt spacetimes in a theory-independent way, and present various alternative coordinates for the spacetimes studied in the paper.</description>

Abstract: We examine the framework of relativistic spin-hydrodynamics in the context of electron hydrodynamics in graphene. We develop a spin-hydrodynamic model for a (2 + 1)-dimensional system of fermions under the condition of small spin polarization. Our analysis confirms that thermal vorticity, which satisfies the global equilibrium condition, is also a solution to the spin-hydrodynamic equations. Additionally, we calculate the magnetization of the system in global equilibrium and introduce a novel phenomenon - thermovortical magnetization - resulting from thermal vorticity, which can be experimentally observed in graphene.</description>

      <title>A way of decoupling the gravitational bulk field equations of regular braneworld black holes to suppress the bulk singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a methodology for decoupling the bulk gravitational field equations of braneworld black holes to suppress the bulk singularities. Thus, we provide a regular braneworld black hole setup. To achieve this, we apply a Minimal Geometric Deformation (MGD) with respect to a coupling constant $ \alpha $ to the $4D$ Minkowski spacetime embedded in an extra dimension. This results in a gravitational decoupling into a system $ \mathcal{A} $ with equations of motion of order $ \alpha^0 $ and a system $ \mathcal{B} $, related to the so-called Quasi-Einstein equations of order $ \alpha $. This methodology allows for the construction of a regular geometry everywhere. We outline the necessary constraints for eliminating singularities and provide a recipe for solving the equations of motion. Both the warp factor, the scalar field, and the potential obtained are smooth and free from Dirac delta singularities. A control parameter is introduced such that, in the limit $ b \to 0 $, the Randall-Sundrum (RS) setup is recovered, resulting in a transition from a thick brane to a thin brane. The asymptotic behavior of the curvature invariant $ \displaystyle \lim_{y \to \pm \infty} R_{5D}(r,y) $ is positive near the de Sitter core (for small $ r $), asymptotically negative for finite $ r &gt; r_* $, and asymptotically flat at the $4D$ boundary as $ r \to \infty $. Although this work aims to suppress bulk singularities, it is expected that our methodology may be useful for future investigations related to the embedding of gravitational objects within other braneworld contexts.</description>

Abstract: A mechanism is found that explains how matter falling into the future event horizon of a black hole leaves information there, which it sends to the past event horizon, and there it determines how particles are emitted. This way information must be conserved. The mechanism is a calculable gravitational effect. We also show how it is avoided that the "hidden region" of the black hole gets involved, which has been standing out as a problem ever since Hawking found that particles must be emitted. The most striking consequence of our mechanism is that the radiation temperature is not what Hawking calculated, but twice that value. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the hidden region is not there.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Non-Gaussianity from Neutrino Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16033</link>

Abstract: The neutrino mass generation via conventional seesaw mechanism is realized at high scales around $O(10^{14})$GeV and probing new physics of the seesaw scale poses a great challenge. A striking fact is that the neutrino seesaw scale is typically around the cosmological inflation scale. In this work, we propose a framework incorporating inflation and neutrino seesaw in which the inflaton primarily decays into right-handed neutrinos after inflation. This decay process is governed by the inflaton interaction with the right-handed neutrinos that respects the shift symmetry. Under the neutrino seesaw mechanism, fluctuations of the Higgs field can modulate the inflaton decays, contributing to the curvature perturbation. We investigate the induced non-Gaussian signatures and demonstrate that such signatures provides an important means to probe the high-scale neutrino seesaw mechanism.</description>

      <title>Gauge symmetry and partially Lagrangian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the classical field theory whose equations of motion follow from the least action principle, but the class of admissible trajectories is restricted by differential equations. The key element of the proposed construction is the complete gauge symmetry of these additional equations. The unfree variation of the trajectories reduces to the infinitesimal gauge symmetry transformation of the equations restricting the trajectories. We explicitly derive the equations that follow from the requirement that this gauge variation of the action vanishes. The system of equations for conditional extrema is not Lagrangian as such, but it admits an equivalent Hamiltonian formulation with a non-canonical Poisson bracket. The bracket is degenerate, in general. Alternatively, the equations restricting dynamics could be added to the action with Lagrange multipliers with unrestricted variation of the original variables. In this case, we would arrive at the Lagrangian equations for original variables involving Lagrange multipliers and for Lagrange multipliers themselves. In general, these two methods are not equivalent because the multipliers can bring extra degrees of freedom compared to the case of equations derived by unfree variation of the action. We illustrate the general method with two examples. The first example is the particle in a central field with varying trajectories restricted by the equation of conservation of angular momentum. The phase space gets one more dimension, and there is an extra conserved quantity $K$ which is responsible for the precession of trajectories. $K=0$ corresponds to the trajectories of usual Lagrangian dynamics. The second example is the linearized gravity with Einstein-Hilbert action and the class of varying fields is restricted by linearized Nordstr\"om equation. This conditional extrema problem is shown to lead to the linearized Cotton gravity equations.</description>

      <title>Holography dual of accelerating and rotating black hole in Nariai limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate some widely-known holography properties of accelerating and rotating black hole, described by rotating C-metric, especially the case in Nariai limit, which are related to Kerr-CFT correspondence but differs in that the outer horizon will coincide the acceleration horizon and the extremal geometry is described by $dS_{2}$ rather than $AdS_{2}$. In order to achieve this goal we define a regularized Komar mass with physical interpretation of varying the horizon area from massless limit to general case. We also reduce the action to a 2-dimensional JT-type action and discuss some of its properties.</description>
