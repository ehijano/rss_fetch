      <title>Accurate experimental ($p$, $\rho$, $T$) data of the ($CO_{2}$ + $O_{2}$) binary system for the development of models for CCS processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limited availability of accurate experimental data in wide ranges of pressure, temperature, and composition is the main constraining factor for the proper development and assessment of thermodynamic models and equations of state. In the particular case of carbon capture and storage (CCS) processes, there is a clear need for data sets related to the (carbon dioxide + oxygen) mixtures that this work aims to address. This work provides new experimental ($p$, $\rho$, $T$) data for three binary ($CO_{2}$ + $O_{2}$) mixtures with mole fractions of oxygen $x$($O_{2}$) = (0.05, 0.10, and 0.20) mol/mol, in the temperature range $T$ = (250 to 375) K and pressure range $p$ = (0.5 to 13) MPa. The measurements were performed with a high-precision single-sinker densimeter with magnetic suspension coupling. The density data were obtained with estimated expanded relative uncertainties of 0.02% for the highest densities and up to 0.3% for the lowest ones.The results were compared to the corresponding results calculated by the current reference equations of state for this kind of mixtures, namely the EOS-CG (combustion gases) and the GERG-2008 equation of state, respectively. The EOS-CG yields better estimations in density than the GERG-2008 equation of state. The results from the EOS-GC model show no systematic temperature dependence. For the GERG-2008 model, however, this criterion is significantly less fulfilled.</description>

      <title>Modulating Endothermic Singlet Fission by Controlling Radiative Rates in Perylene Dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Endothermic singlet fission (SF), an exciton multiplication process that produces a pair of high-energy triplet excitons (T1T1), is appealing for photovoltaic or photoelectrochemical applications, as it allows the conversion of entropy into electronic or chemical energy. The mechanistic aspects of this process are not entirely known, and strategies for improving the yield of triplets via endothermic SF have not been developed. In this work we provide experimental evidence that in photoexcited dimers of perylene, S1 is initially in equilibrium with 1(T1T1), and that the lifetime of this equilibrium can be controlled through strategic changes in the radiative rate. Through careful molecular design we fine-tune both the degree of endothermicity and excited state lifetimes in four perylene dimers. Using transient absorption and time resolved fluorescence, we reveal that the dimer with the slowest radiative rate constant produces the most prolonged 1(T1T1). However, in the dimers, the annihilation of the 1(T1T1) state results in a single long-lived triplet rather than a pair, and increasing the free triplet yield above 100% would require additional chromophores.</description>

      <title>Transferability of Atom-Based Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning models in chemistry - when based on descriptors of atoms embedded within molecules - face essential challenges in transferring the quality of predictions of local electronic structures and their associated properties across chemical compound space. In the present work, we make use of adversarial validation to elucidate certain intrinsic complications related to machine inferences of unseen chemistry. On this basis, we employ invariant and equivariant neural networks - both trained either exclusively on total molecular energies or a combination of these and data from atomic partitioning schemes - to evaluate how such models scale performance-wise between datasets of fundamentally different functionality and composition. We find the inference of local electronic properties to improve significantly when training models on augmented data that appropriately expose local functional features. However, molecular datasets for training purposes must themselves be sufficiently comprehensive and rich in composition to warrant any generalizations to larger systems, and even then, transferability can still only genuinely manifest if the body of atomic energies available for training purposes exposes the uniqueness of different functional moieties within molecules. We demonstrate this point by comparing machine models trained on atomic partitioning schemes based on the spatial locality of either native atomic or molecular orbitals.</description>

      <title>Entropy Scaling for Diffusion Coefficients in Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy scaling is a powerful technique that has been used successfully for predicting transport properties of pure components over a wide range of states. However, modeling mixture diffusion coefficients by entropy scaling is an unresolved task. We have tackled this issue and present an entropy scaling framework for predicting mixture self-diffusion as well as mutual diffusion in a thermodynamically consistent way. The predictions of the mixture diffusion coefficients are made based on information on the self-diffusion coefficients of the pure components and the infinite dilution diffusion coefficients. This is accomplished using information on the entropy of the mixture, which is taken here from molecular-based equations of state. The framework is flexible and can be applied together with any equation of state. Examples for the application of the new entropy scaling framework for the prediction of diffusion coefficients in mixtures illustrate its impressive performance. It enables predictions a wide range of temperatures and pressures including gaseous, liquid, supercritical, and metastable states - also for strongly non-ideal mixtures.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of mixtures with strongly negative deviations from Raoult's law. XVI. Permittivities and refractive indices for 1-alkanol + di-n-propylamine systems at (293.15-303.15) K. Application of the Kirkwood-Fr\"ohlich model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative permittivities at 1 MHz, $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}$, and refractive indices at the sodium D-line, $n_{\text{D}}$, are reported at 0.1 MPa and at (293.15-303.15) K for the binary systems 1-alkanol + di-n-propylamine (DPA). Their corresponding excess functions are calculated and correlated. For the methanol mixture, positive values of the excess permittivities, $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$, are found. Except at high concentrations of the alcohol in the 1-propanol mixture, the remaining systems show negative values of this property. This fact reveals that the creation of (1-alkanol)-DPA interactions contributes positively to $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$, being this contribution dominant in the methanol mixture. At ${\phi}_1$ (volume fraction) = 0.5, $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$ changes in the sequence: methanol &gt; 1-propanol &gt; 1-butanol &gt; 1-pentanol &lt; 1-heptanol. An analogous variation with the chain length of the 1-alkanol is observed in mixtures such as 1-alkanol + heptane, + cyclohexylamine or + n-hexylamine (HxA). Moreover, for a given 1-alkanol, $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$ is larger for DPA than for HxA mixtures, suggesting that in DPA solutions multimers with parallel alignment of the molecular dipoles are favoured and cyclic multimers are disfavoured when compared to HxA mixtures. The ${(\partial{\varepsilon_{\text{r}}}/\partial T)}_p$ values are higher for the mixtures than for pure 1-alkanols, because (1-alkanol)-DPA interactions are stronger than those between 1-alkanol molecules. Molar refractions indicate that dispersive interactions in DPA systems increase with the chain length of the 1-alkanol and are practically identical to those in HxA solutions. The considered mixtures are treated by means of the Kirkwood-Fr\"ohlich model, reporting the Kirkwood correlation factors and their excess values.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of amide+amine mixtures. 5. Excess molar enthalpies of N,N-dimethylformamide or N,N-dimethylacetamide+N-propylpropan-1-amine, +N-butylbutan-1-amine, +butan-1-amine, or +hexan-1-amine systems. ERAS results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excess molar enthalpies, $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, over the whole composition range have been determined for the liquid mixtures N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) + butan-1-amine (BA), or + hexan-1-amine (HxA), or + N-propylpropan-1-amine (DPA), or N-butylbutan-1-amine (DBA) at 298.15 K and at 0.1 MPa using a BT2.15 calorimeter from Setaram adapted to work in dynamic mode at constant temperature and pressure. All the $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values are positive, indicating that interactions between like molecules are predominant. The replacement of DMF by DMA in systems with a given amine leads to lower $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ results, which have been ascribed to stronger amide-amide interactions in DMF mixtures. The replacement of HxA by DPA in systems with a given amide leads to slightly higher $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values, as interactions between unlike molecules are weaker for the latter. Structural effects in the investigated solutions are also present, since the corresponding excess molar volumes ($V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$), previously determined, are negative or slightly positive. The systems have been characterized in terms of the ERAS model reporting the interaction parameters. The model correctly describes both $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ and $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$. The application of the model suggests that, in the systems under study, solvation effects are of minor importance and that physical interactions are dominant.</description>

      <title>Density, speed of sound, refractive index and relative permittivity of methanol, propan-1-ol or pentan-1-ol + aniline liquid mixtures. Application of the Kirkwood-Fr\"ohlich model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Densities and speeds of sound at a temperature $T$ = 298.15 K, relative permittivities at 1 MHz and refractive indices at the sodium D-line at $T$ = (293.15 K to 303.15 K), all at a pressure p = 0.1 MPa, are reported for liquid mixtures methanol, propan-1-ol or pentan-1-ol + aniline. Excess molar volume ($V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$), excess isentropic compressibility, excess speed of sound, excess refractive index, excess relative permittivity ($\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$) and its temperature derivative are calculated and fitted to Redlich-Kister polynomials. The agreement among the reported data and other literature sources is analysed by comparing $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, $n_{\text{D}}^{\text{E}}$, $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$ and the deviation of the speed of sound from mole-fraction linearity. The positive excess molar internal energies at constant volume ($U_{\text{m,}V}^{\text{E}}$) show the dominance of the breaking of interactions between like molecules in the energy balance on mixing, particularly the breaking of strong dipolar interactions between aniline molecules. This contribution is also dominant for the $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$ values, as they are negative and decrease with the length of the alkan-1-ol chain. Calculations on the concentration-concentration structure factor are consistent with these statements, revealing homocoordination in the studied systems. The $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ are negative, which together with the positive $U_{\text{m,}V}^{\text{E}}$ indicate the existence of important structural effects in the studied mixtures. The application of the Kirkwood-Fr\"ohlich model shows that the average relative orientation of neighbouring dipoles is similar in the mixtures methanol + aniline or + pyridine, in spite of the different character of the predominant interactions in the latter mixture (heterocoordination).</description>

      <title>Alchemical harmonic approximation based potential for all iso-electronic diatomics: Foundational baseline for $\Delta$-machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the alchemical harmonic approximation (AHA) of the absolute electronic energy for all charge-neutral iso-electronic diatomics at some fixed interatomic distance $d_0$. To account for variations in this distance, we combine AHA with the following Ansatz for the electronic binding potential, $E(d)=(E_{u}-E_s)\left(\frac{E_c-E_s}{E_u-E_s} \right)^{\sqrt{d/d_0}}+E_s$, where $E_u$, $E_c$, and $E_s$ correspond to the energies of the united atom, calibration at $d_0$, and sum of infinitely separated atoms, respectively. For any number of electrons, our model covers the entire two-dimensional electronic potential energy surface spanned by distance and difference in nuclear charge. Using data from pbe0/ccpvdz as reference, we present numerical evidence for all neutral diatomics with 8, 10, 12, 14 electrons. We assess the validity of our model by comparison to legacy potentials (Harm. osc., Lennard-Jones, Morse) within the most relevant range of binding (0.7 - 2.5 A), and find comparable accuracy if restricted to one diatomic, and significantly better when extrapolating to the entire iso-electronic series. We have also investigated $\Delta$-learning with our model as baseline. For any given iso-electronic charge neutral diatomic surface, this baseline results in a systematic improvement, effectively reducing training data for reaching chemical accuracy by up to an order of magnitude from $\sim1000$ to $\sim100$. By contrast and with respect to direct learning, using AHA+Morse as a baseline hardly leads to any improvement, and sometimes even deteriorates predictive power. Direct KRR-based extrapolation throughout chemical space converges to an error of $\sim$0.1 Ha when inferring the energy of unseen CO after training on all other iso-electronic diatomics. Our model as a baseline (calibrated to the energy of BF at $d_0 = 1.2$ A) lowers the error to $\sim$0.04 Ha.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the Infrared Absorbance Intensities and Frequencies of Hydrocarbons:A Message Passing Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately and efficiently predicting the infrared (IR) spectra of a molecule can provide insights into the structure-properties relationships of molecular species, which has led to a proliferation of machine learning tools designed for this purpose. However, earlier studies have focused primarily on obtaining normalized IR spectra, which limits their potential for a comprehensive analysis of molecular behavior in the IR range. For instance, to fully understand and predict the optical properties, such as the transparency characteristics, it is necessary to predict the molar absorptivity IR spectra instead. Here, we propose a graph-based communicative message passing neural network (CMPNN) algorithm that can predict both the peak positions and absolute intensities corresponding to density functional theory (DFT) calculated molar absorptivities in the IR domain. By modifying existing spectral loss functions, we show that our method is able to predict with DFT-accuracy level the IR molar absorptivities of a series of hydrocarbons containing up to ten carbon atoms and apply the model to a set of larger molecules. We also compare the predicted spectra with those generated by the direct message passing neural network (DMPNN). The results suggest that both algorithms demonstrate similar predictive capabilities for hydrocarbons, indicating that either model could be effectively used in future research on spectral prediction for such systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the existence of capillary waves propagating along the boundary between miscible co-flowing fluids. We unveil that the interplay between transient interfacial stresses and confinement drives the progressive transition from the well-known inertial regime, characterized by a wavenumber independent of frequency, $k\sim\omega^{0}$, to an unexpected capillary-wave scaling, $k\sim\omega^{2/3}$. This allows us to measure the effective interfacial tension between miscible fluids and its rapid decay on time scales never probed so far, which we rationalize with a model going beyond square gradient theories.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we developed a compositionally transferable machine learning interatomic potential using atomic cluster expansion potential and PBE-D3 method for (NaCl)1-x(MgCl2)x molten salt and we showed that it is possible to fit a robust potential for this pseudo-binary system by only including data from x={0, 1/3, 2/3, 1}. We also assessed the performance of several DFT methods including PBE-D3, PBE-D4, R2SCAN-D4, and R2SCAN-rVV10 on unary NaCl and MgCl2 salts. Our results show that the R2SCAN-D4 method calculates the thermophysical properties of NaCl and MgCl2 with an overall modestly better accuracy compared to the other three methods.</description>

      <title>MiMiC: A High-Performance Framework for Multiscale Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MiMiC is a framework for performing multiscale simulations in which loosely coupled external programs describe individual subsystems at different resolutions and levels of theory. To make it highly efficient and flexible, we adopt an interoperable approach based on a multiple-program multiple-data (MPMD) paradigm, serving as an intermediary responsible for fast data exchange and interactions between the subsystems. The main goal of MiMiC is to avoid interfering with the underlying parallelization of the external programs, including the operability on hybrid architectures (e.g., CPU/GPU), and keep their setup and execution as close as possible to the original. At the moment, MiMiC offers an efficient implementation of electrostatic embedding QM/MM that has demonstrated unprecedented parallel scaling in simulations of large biomolecules using CPMD and GROMACS as QM and MM engines, respectively. However, as it is designed for high flexibility with general multiscale models in mind, it can be straightforwardly extended beyond QM/MM. In this article, we illustrate the software design and the features of the framework, which make it a compelling choice for multiscale simulations in the upcoming era of exascale high-performance computing.</description>

Abstract: Applying an excess entropy scaling formalism to the coarse-grained (CG) dynamics of liquids, we discovered that missing rotational motions during the CG process are responsible for artificially accelerated CG dynamics. In the context of the dynamic representability between the fine-grained (FG) and CG dynamics, this work introduces the well-known Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations to unravel the rotational dynamics underlying FG trajectories, thereby allowing for an indirect evaluation of the effective rotations based only on the translational information at the reduced CG resolution. Since the representability issue in CG modeling limits a direct evaluation of the shear stress appearing in the Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations, we introduce a translational relaxation time as a proxy to employ these relations, and we demonstrate that these relations hold for the ambient conditions studied in our series of work. Additional theoretical links to our previous work are also established. First, we demonstrate that the effective hard sphere radius determined by the classical perturbation theory can approximate the complex hydrodynamic radius value reasonably well. Also, we present a simple derivation of an excess entropy scaling relationship for viscosity by estimating the elliptical integral of molecules. In turn, since the translational and rotational motions at the FG level are correlated to each other, we conclude that the "entropy-free" CG diffusion only depends on the shape of the reference molecule. Our results and analyses impart an alternative way of recovering the FG diffusion from the CG description by coupling the translational and rotational motions at the hydrodynamic level.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence decay of mobile carriers influenced by imperfect quenching at particle surfaces with subdiffusive spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recently presented a quantitative model to explain the particle-size dependence of photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields and revealed that exciton quenching is not diffusion controlled, but limited by surface reactions. However, the exciton decay kinetics has not yet been analyzed using our theoretical model. Here, we study kinetic aspects of the model and show that it should be extended to take into account subdiffusion rather than normal diffusion to maintain consistency with the observed complex decay kinetics; we also show that the PL decay kinetics is nonexponential even when the PL quenching is limited by surface reactions under subdiffusion. Our theoretical analysis of the PL quantum yield and the PL decay kinetics provides a comprehensive picture of mobile charge carriers, immobile polarons, and self-trapped excitons.</description>

      <title>Force-Guided Bridge Matching for Full-Atom Time-Coarsened Dynamics of Peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15126</link>

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is crucial in various fields such as materials science, chemistry, and pharmacology to name a few. Conventional MD software struggles with the balance between time cost and prediction accuracy, which restricts its wider application. Recently, data-driven approaches based on deep generative models have been devised for time-coarsened dynamics, which aim at learning dynamics of diverse molecular systems over a long timestep, enjoying both universality and efficiency. Nevertheless, most current methods are designed solely to learn from the data distribution regardless of the underlying Boltzmann distribution, and the physics priors such as energies and forces are constantly overlooked. In this work, we propose a conditional generative model called Force-guided Bridge Matching (FBM), which learns full-atom time-coarsened dynamics and targets the Boltzmann-constrained distribution. With the guidance of our delicately-designed intermediate force field, FBM leverages favourable physics priors into the generation process, giving rise to enhanced simulations. Experiments on two datasets consisting of peptides verify our superiority in terms of comprehensive metrics and demonstrate transferability to unseen systems.</description>

      <title>Maximizing NMR Sensitivity: A Guide to Receiver Gain Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance is revolutionizing in parallel with the development of methodology and all electronics and hardware around it. The primary objective of such modifications is to make the system more reliable and sensitive. Almost a decade ago, Bruker introduced an Avance NEO console with an extended dynamic range of the receiver gain (RG). The system offered a maximum sensitivity even at very low RG. This feature is handy in the case of hyperpolarization when too much signal can cause clipping of the free induction decay signal. We analyzed the RG profile for our spectrometer's 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei and found nonmonotonous sensitivity behavior characterized by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For example, 13C SNR at RG = 18 is 5.5% higher than SNR at maximum RG = 101 and 51.6% higher than at RG = 20.2. Having found this, we advertise here that other NMR users with any spectrometers should calibrate their SNR vs. RG and find the RG value right for their experiments, as automatic RG adjustment does not know about the actual performance of each system. We offer a tool and strategy for such an optimization and exemplify the benefits of using SNR-adjusted RG value with hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate measurements.</description>
