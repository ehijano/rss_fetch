      <title>Evaluation of Rail Decarbonization Alternatives: Framework and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Northwestern University Freight Rail Infrastructure and Energy Network Decarbonization (NUFRIEND) framework is a comprehensive industry-oriented tool for simulating the deployment of new energy technologies including biofuels, e-fuels, battery-electric, and hydrogen locomotives. By classifying fuel types into two categories based on deployment requirements, the associated optimal charging/fueling facility location and sizing problem are solved with a five-step framework. Life cycle analyses (LCA) and techno-economic analyses (TEA) are used to estimate carbon reduction, capital investments, cost of carbon reduction, and operational impacts, enabling sensitivity analysis with operational and technological parameters. The framework is illustrated on lower-carbon drop-in fuels as well as battery-electric technology deployments for US Eastern and Western Class I railroad networks. Drop-in fuel deployments are modeled as admixtures with diesel in existing locomotives, while battery-electric deployments are shown for varying technology penetration levels and locomotive ranges. When mixed in a 50 percent ratio with diesel, results show biodiesel's capacity to reduce emissions at 36 percent with a cost of 0.13 USD per kilogram of CO2 reduced, while e-fuels offer a 50 percent emissions reduction potential at a cost of 0.22 USD per kilogram of CO2 reduced. Battery-electric results for 50 percent deployment over all ton-miles highlight the value of future innovations in battery energy densities as scenarios assuming 800-mile range locomotives show an estimated emissions reduction of 46 percent with a cost of 0.06 USD per kilogram of CO2 reduced, compared to 16 percent emissions reduction at a cost of 0.11 USD per kilogram of CO2 reduced for 400-mile range locomotives.</description>

      <title>Equity Impacts of Public Transit Network Redesign with Shared Autonomous Mobility Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the equity impacts of integrating shared autonomous mobility services (SAMS) into transit system redesign. Using the Greater Chicago area as a case study, we compare two optimization objectives in multimodal transit network redesign: minimizing total generalized costs (equity-agnostic) versus prioritizing service in low-income areas (equity-focused). We evaluate the achieved accessibility of clustered zones with redesigned transit networks under two objectives, compared to driving and the existing transit network. The transit access gaps across zones and between transit and driving are found to be generally reduced with the introduction of SAMS, but less so with the subsequent improved infrastructure under budget. Differential improvement in equity is seen across suburbs and areas of the city, reflecting the disparity in current transit access and improvement potential. In particular, SAMS bridges the transit access gaps in suburban and city areas currently underserved by transit. The City of Chicago, which is also disproportionately home to vulnerable populations, offers an avenue to improve vertical equity. These findings demonstrate that SAMS can enhance both horizontal and vertical equity in transit systems, particularly when equity is explicitly incorporated into the design objective.</description>

      <title>Optimal Fiducial Marker Placement for Satellite Proximity Operations Using Observability Gramians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates optimal fiducial marker placement on the surface of a satellite performing relative proximity operations with an observer satellite. The absolute and relative translation and attitude equations of motion for the satellite pair are modeled using dual quaternions. The observability of the relative dual quaternion system is analyzed using empirical observability Gramian methods. The optimal placement of a fiducial marker set, in which each marker gives simultaneous optical range and attitude measurements, is determined for the pair of satellites. A geostationary flyby between the observing body (chaser) and desired (target) satellites is numerically simulated and the optimal fiducial placement sets of five and ten on the surface of the desired satellite are solved. It is shown that the optimal solution maximizes the distance between fiducial markers and selects marker locations that are most sensitive to measuring changes in the state during the nonlinear trajectory, despite being visible for less time than other candidate marker locations. Definitions and properties of quaternions and dual quaternions, and parallels between the two, are presented alongside the relative motion model.</description>

      <title>Sensor Placement on a Cantilever Beam Using Observability Gramians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working from an observability characterization based on output energy sensitivity to changes in initial conditions, we derive both analytical and empirical observability Gramian tools for a class of continuum material systems. Using these results, optimal sensor placement is calculated for an Euler-Bernoulli cantilever beam for the following cases: analytical observability for the continuum system and analytical observability for a finite number of modes. Error covariance of an Unscented Kalman Filter is determined for both cases and compared to randomly placed sensors to demonstrate effectiveness of the techniques.</description>

      <title>Smooth Rate Limiter Model for Power System Stability Analysis and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The letter proposes a smooth Rate Limiter (RL) model for power system stability analysis and control. The proposed model enables the effects of derivative bounds to be incorporated into system eigenvalue analysis, while replicating the behavior of conventional non-smooth RLs with high fidelity. In addition, it can be duly modified to enhance the system's dynamic control performance. The behavior of the proposed model is demonstrated through illustrative examples as well as through a simulation of the New York/New England 16-machine 68-bus system.</description>

      <title>Distributed Framework Construction for Affine Formation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In affine formation control problems, the construction of the framework with universal rigidity and affine localizability is a critical prerequisite, but it has not yet been well addressed, especially when additional agents join the formation or link/agent failures emerge. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the problem of constructing affine formation frameworks in three scenarios, including vertex addition, edge deletion and vertex deletion. Our approach starts from the original affine formation and uses geometric methods to locally adjust the structure of the weighted graph to describe the topology, so that the modified framework maintains the universal rigidity and affine localizability. Notably, the developed strategies only utilize local measurements and exhibit distributed characteristics, laying the foundation for applications in multi-agent systems. To demonstrate the compatibility with affine formation control proposals, we present a case study on affine formation tracking in a multi-UAV formation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithms in constructing eligible frameworks in aforementioned scenarios. Moreover, a comparative simulations is also conducted to highlight the low time complexity of our distributed algorithm relative to the centralized optimization-based method.</description>

      <title>Online Fault Tolerance Strategy for Abrupt Reachability Constraint Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a system's constraints change abruptly, the system's reachability safety does no longer sustain. Thus, the system can reach a forbidden/dangerous value. Conventional remedy practically involves online controller redesign (OCR) to re-establish the reachability's compliance with the new constraints, which, however, is usually too slow. There is a need for an online strategy capable of managing runtime changes in reachability constraints. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this topic has not been addressed in the existing literature. In this paper, we propose a fast fault tolerance strategy to recover the system's reachability safety in runtime. Instead of redesigning the system's controller, we propose to change the system's reference state to modify the system's reachability to comply with the new constraints. We frame the reference state search as an optimization problem and employ the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) method as well as the Interior Point Method (IPM) based Newton's method (as a fallback for the KKT method) for fast solution derivation. The optimization also allows more future fault tolerance. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms the conventional OCR method in terms of computational efficiency and success rate. Specifically, the results show that the proposed method finds a solution $10^{2}$ (with the IPM based Newton's method) $\sim 10^{4}$ (with the KKT method) times faster than the OCR method. Additionally, the improvement rate of the success rate of our method over the OCR method is $40.81\%$ without considering the deadline of run time. The success rate remains at $49.44\%$ for the proposed method, while it becomes $0\%$ for the OCR method when a deadline of $1.5 \; seconds$ is imposed.</description>

      <title>A Global Games-Inspired Approach to Multi-Robot Task Allocation for Heterogeneous Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we propose a game-theoretic approach to the multi-robot task allocation problem using the framework of global games. Each task is associated with a global signal, a real-valued number that captures the task execution progress and/or urgency. We propose a linear objective function for each robot in the system, which, for each task, increases with global signal and decreases with the number assigned robots. We provide conditions on the objective function hyperparameters to induce a mixed Nash equilibrium, i.e., solutions where all robots are not assigned to a single task. The resulting algorithm only requires the inversion of a matrix to determine a probability distribution over the robot assignments. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in simulation and provide direction for applications and future work.</description>

      <title>GRAMC: General-purpose and reconfigurable analog matrix computing architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-memory analog matrix computing (AMC) with resistive random-access memory (RRAM) represents a highly promising solution that solves matrix problems in one step. However, the existing AMC circuits each have a specific connection topology to implement a single computing function, lack of the universality as a matrix processor. In this work, we design a reconfigurable AMC macro for general-purpose matrix computations, which is achieved by configuring proper connections between memory array and amplifier circuits. Based on this macro, we develop a hybrid system that incorporates an on-chip write-verify scheme and digital functional modules, to deliver a general-purpose AMC solver for various applications.</description>

      <title>Grasping in Uncertain Environments: A Case Study For Industrial Robotic Recycling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robotic grasping of uncertain objects in uncertain environments is an impactful open challenge for the industries of the future. One such industry is the recycling of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) materials, in which electric devices are disassembled and readied for the recovery of raw materials. Since devices may contain hazardous materials and their disassembly involves heavy manual labor, robotic disassembly is a promising venue. However, since devices may be damaged, dirty and unidentified, robotic disassembly is challenging since object models are unavailable or cannot be relied upon. This case study explores grasping strategies for industrial robotic disassembly of WEEE devices with uncertain vision data. We propose three grippers and appropriate tactile strategies for force-based manipulation that improves grasping robustness. For each proposed gripper, we develop corresponding strategies that can perform effectively in different grasping tasks and leverage the grippers design and unique strengths. Through experiments conducted in lab and factory settings for four different WEEE devices, we demonstrate how object uncertainty may be overcome by tactile sensing and compliant techniques, significantly increasing grasping success rates.</description>

      <title>TRG-planner: Traversal Risk Graph-Based Path Planning in Unstructured Environments for Safe and Efficient Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unstructured environments such as mountains, caves, construction sites, or disaster areas are challenging for autonomous navigation because of terrain irregularities. In particular, it is crucial to plan a path to avoid risky terrain and reach the goal quickly and safely. In this paper, we propose a method for safe and distance-efficient path planning, leveraging Traversal Risk Graph (TRG), a novel graph representation that takes into account geometric traversability of the terrain. TRG nodes represent stability and reachability of the terrain, while edges represent relative traversal risk-weighted path candidates. Additionally, TRG is constructed in a wavefront propagation manner and managed hierarchically, enabling real-time planning even in large-scale environments. Lastly, we formulate a graph optimization problem on TRG that leads the robot to navigate by prioritizing both safe and short paths. Our approach demonstrated superior safety, distance efficiency, and fast processing time compared to the conventional methods. It was also validated in several real-world experiments using a quadrupedal robot. Notably, TRG-planner contributed as the global path planner of an autonomous navigation framework for the DreamSTEP team, which won the Quadruped Robot Challenge at ICRA 2023.

      <title>Evaluating Scenario-based Decision-making for Interactive Autonomous Driving Using Rational Criteria: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) can significantly promote the advances in road transport mobility in terms of safety, reliability, and decarbonization. However, ensuring safety and efficiency in interactive during within dynamic and diverse environments is still a primary barrier to large-scale AV adoption. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as an advanced AI-based approach, enabling AVs to learn decision-making strategies adaptively from data and interactions. DRL strategies are better suited than traditional rule-based methods for handling complex, dynamic, and unpredictable driving environments due to their adaptivity. However, varying driving scenarios present distinct challenges, such as avoiding obstacles on highways and reaching specific exits at intersections, requiring different scenario-specific decision-making algorithms. Many DRL algorithms have been proposed in interactive decision-making. However, a rationale review of these DRL algorithms across various scenarios is lacking. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation is essential to assess these algorithms from multiple perspectives, including those of vehicle users and vehicle manufacturers. This survey reviews the application of DRL algorithms in autonomous driving across typical scenarios, summarizing road features and recent advancements. The scenarios include highways, on-ramp merging, roundabouts, and unsignalized intersections. Furthermore, DRL-based algorithms are evaluated based on five rationale criteria: driving safety, driving efficiency, training efficiency, unselfishness, and interpretability (DDTUI). Each criterion of DDTUI is specifically analyzed in relation to the reviewed algorithms. Finally, the challenges for future DRL-based decision-making algorithms are summarized.</description>

      <title>Bearing-based Simultaneous Localization and Affine Formation Tracking for Fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the bearing-based simultaneous localization and affine formation tracking (SLAFT) control problem for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In the considered problem, only a small set of UAVs, named leaders, can obtain their global positions, and the other UAVs only have access to bearing information relative to their neighbors. To address the problem, we propose novel schemes by integrating the distributed bearing-based self-localization algorithm and the observer-based affine formation tracking controller. The designed localization algorithm estimates the global position by using inter-UAV bearing measurements, and the observer-based controller tracks the desired formation with the estimated positions. A key distinction of our approach is extending the SLAFT control scheme to the bearing-based coordination of nonholonomic UAV systems, where the desired inter-UAV bearings can be time-varying, instead of constant ones assumed in most of the existing results. Two control schemes with different convergence rates are designed to meet desired task requirements under different conditions. The stability analysis of the two schemes for SLAFT control is proved, and numerous simulations are carried out to validate the theoretical analysis.</description>

Abstract: Greenhouse climate control is concerned with maximizing performance in terms of crop yield and resource efficiency. One promising approach is model predictive control (MPC), which leverages a model of the system to optimize the control inputs, while enforcing physical constraints. However, prediction models for greenhouse systems are inherently inaccurate due to the complexity of the real system and the uncertainty in predicted weather profiles. For model-based control approaches such as MPC, this can degrade performance and lead to constraint violations. Existing approaches address uncertainty in the prediction model with robust or stochastic MPC methodology; however, these necessarily reduce crop yield due to conservatism and often bear higher computational loads. In contrast, learning-based control approaches, such as reinforcement learning (RL), can handle uncertainty naturally by leveraging data to improve performance. This work proposes an MPC-based RL control framework to optimize the climate control performance in the presence of prediction uncertainty. The approach employs a parametrized MPC scheme that learns directly from data, in an online fashion, the parametrization of the constraints, prediction model, and optimization cost that minimizes constraint violations and maximizes climate control performance. Simulations show that the approach can learn an MPC controller that significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of constraint violations and efficient crop growth.</description>

Abstract: The indoor environment significantly impacts human health and well-being; enhancing health and reducing energy consumption in these settings is a central research focus. With the advancement of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), recommendation systems and reinforcement learning (RL) have emerged as promising approaches to induce behavioral changes to improve the indoor environment and energy efficiency of buildings. This study aims to employ text mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to thoroughly examine the connections among these approaches in the context of human-building interaction and occupant context-aware support. The study analyzed 27,595 articles from the ScienceDirect database, revealing extensive use of recommendation systems and RL for space optimization, location recommendations, and personalized control suggestions. Furthermore, this review underscores the vast potential for expanding recommender systems and RL applications in buildings and indoor environments. Fields ripe for innovation include predictive maintenance, building-related product recommendation, and optimization of environments tailored for specific needs, such as sleep and productivity enhancements based on user feedback. The study also notes the limitations of the method in capturing subtle academic nuances. Future improvements could involve integrating and fine-tuning pre-trained language models to better interpret complex texts.</description>

      <title>A Complex Frequency-Based Control for Inverter-Based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00448</link>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel control for Inverter-based Resources (IBRs) based on the Complex Frequency (CF) concept. The controller's objective is to maintain a constant CF of the voltage at the terminals of the IBR by adjusting its current reference. This current is imposed based on the well-known power flow equation, the dynamics of which are calculated through the estimation of the CF of the voltages of the adjacent buses. Performance is evaluated by analyzing local variations in frequency and magnitude of the voltage, as well as the response of the system's Center of Inertia (CoI) frequency, and then compared with conventional frequency droop, PI voltage controllers and virtual inertia. The case study utilizes the WSCC 9-bus system and a 1479-bus model of the Irish transmission grid and considers various contingencies and sensitivities such as the impact of limiters, delays, noise, R/X ratio, and EMT dynamics. Results show that the proposed scheme consistently outperforms the conventional controllers, leading to significant improvements in the overall dynamic response of the system.</description>

      <title>Teleoperation of Continuum Instruments: Investigation of Linear vs. Angular Commands through Task-Priority Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of teleoperating continuum instruments for minimally invasive surgery (MIS). We develop and adopt a novel task-priority-based kinematic formulation to quantitatively investigate teleoperation commands for continuum instruments under remote center of motion (RCM) constraints. Using redundancy resolution methods, we investigate the kinematic performance during teleoperation, comparing linear and angular commands within a task-priority scheme. For experimental validation, an instrument module (IM) was designed and integrated with a 7-DoF manipulator.
  Assessments, simulations, and experimental validations demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The experiments involved several tasks: trajectory tracking of the IM tip along multiple paths with varying priorities for linear and angular teleoperation commands, pushing a ball along predefined paths on a silicon board, following a pattern on a pegboard, and guiding the continuum tip through rings on a ring board using a standard surgical kit.</description>
