      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by a $N$-dimension complex vector $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ whose entries are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear spectral problem and by $N$ nonzero complex norming constants. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support on the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the Zakharov-Shabat linear problem for the expectation of the random measure associated to the spectral data. We denote the corresponding solution of the fNLS equation by $\psi_\infty(x,t)$. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R \times \mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Right-invariant Poisson-Nijenhuis Structure on Lie groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the introduction of right-invariant Poisson-Nijenhuis structures on Lie groupoids and their infinitesimal counterparts, also known as structures. A Poisson-Nijenhuis structure refers to a combination of a Poisson structure and a Nijenhuis structure. The paper also presents a mutual correspondence between Poisson-Nijenhuis structures on Lie algebroids and Poisson-Nijenhuis structures on their corresponding Lie groupoids, under certain conditions. This correspondence demonstrates a connection between the infinitesimal and global structures. Finally, the paper concludes with an illustrative example to enhance the understanding of the concepts introduced.</description>

      <title>Okamoto's symmetry on the representation space of the sixth Painlev\'e equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth Painlev\'e equation (PVI) admits dual isomonodromy representations of type $2$-dimensional Fuchsian and $3$-dimensional Birkhoff. Taking the multiplicative middle convolution of a higher Teichm\"uller coordinatization for the Fuchsian monodromy group, we give Okamoto's symmetry $w_2$ of PVI a monodromic realization in the language of cluster $\mathcal{X}$-mutations. The explicit mutation formula is encoded in dual geometric terms of colored equilateral triangulations and star-shaped fat graphs. Moreover, this realization has a known additive analogue through the middle convolution for Fuchsian systems, and dual formulations for both the Birkhoff representation and its Stokes data exist. We give this quadruple of $w_2$-related maps a unified diagrammatic description in purely convolutional terms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scheme for generating weakly lower semi-continuous action functionals corresponding to the Euler-Lagrange equations of Chern-Simons theory is described. Coercivity is deduced for such a functional in appropriate function spaces to prove the existence of a minimizer, which constitutes a solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations of Chern-Simons theory in a relaxed sense. A geometric analysis is also made, especially for the gauge group SU(2), relating connection forms on the bundle to corresponding forms in the dual scheme.</description>

      <title>Exact Solvability Of Entanglement For Arbitrary Initial State in an Infinite-Range Floquet System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sharma and Bhosale [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.014412}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{109}, 014412 (2024)}; \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.064313}{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}] recently introduced an $N$-spin Floquet model with infinite-range Ising interactions. There, we have shown that the model exhibits the signatures of quantum integrability for specific parameter values $J=1,1/2$ and $\tau=\pi/4$. We have found analytically the eigensystem and the time evolution of the unitary operator for finite values of $N$ up to $12$ qubits. We have calculated the reduced density matrix, its eigensystem, time-evolved linear entropy, and the time-evolved concurrence for the initial states $\ket{0,0}$ and $\ket{\pi/2,-\pi/2}$. For the general case $N&gt;12$, we have provided sufficient numerical evidences for the signatures of quantum integrability, such as the degenerate spectrum, the exact periodic nature of entanglement dynamics, and the time-evolved unitary operator. In this paper, we have extended these calculations to arbitrary initial state $\ket{\theta_0,\phi_0}$, such that $\theta_0 \in [0,\pi]$ and $\phi_0 \in [-\pi,\pi]$. Along with that, we have analytically calculated the expression for the average linear entropy for arbitrary initial states. We numerically find that the average value of time-evolved concurrence for arbitrary initial states decreases with $N$, implying the multipartite nature of entanglement. We numerically show that the values $\langle S\rangle/S_{Max} \rightarrow 1$ for Ising strength ($J\neq1,1/2$), while for $J=1$ and $1/2$, it deviates from $1$ for arbitrary initial states even though the thermodynamic limit does not exist in our model. This deviation is shown to be a signature of integrability in earlier studies where the thermodynamic limit exist.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Classical Field Theory with Fractional Operators on $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework on non-local classical field theory using fractional integrodifferential operators. Due to the lack of easily manageable symmetries in traditional fractional calculus and the difficulties that arise in the formalism of multi-fractional calculus over $\mathbb{R}^{\text{D}}$ space, we introduce a set of new fractional operators over the $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ space. The redefined fractional integral operator results in the non-trivial measure canonically. The redefined fractional differential operator can account for the spacetime symmetries for the underlying space $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ with the Lorentzian signature $(+, -, -, - , -)$. We conclude that the field equation for the non-local classical field can be obtained as the consequence of the optimization of the action, considering the non-local variations in the field after defining the non-local Lagrangian density as $\mathcal{L}(\phi_{a}\left(x\right), \mathbb{\eth}^\alpha (\phi_{a}\left(x\right)))$, the function of the symmetric Fractional derivative of the field in the context of the kinetic term, and the field itself.</description>

      <title>Coupling theory of electromagnetic fields with mass transport in non-uniform fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navier-Stokes and Maxwell equations have been invented for fluid dynamics and electromagnetic systems, respectively, for centuries. The development of Navier-Stokes and Maxwell equations for homogeneous materials seems to be mature. However, when there is a phase interface, a coupling theory for the mass transport with the propagation of electromagnetic fields remains an open question. In the current work, we present a fundamental theory for the thermodynamics and the kinetics for mass transport and electromagnetic wave propagation in non-uniform system when an interface is present. We will demonstrate that Maxwell-Ampere equation, Lorenz force, and Gauss' law for magnetic field all have to be modified at the phase interface. We expect that the modified Lorenz force and Maxwell equations will shed light on high-temperature superconductivity, where the coupling of mass effect, such as thermal noise, with electromagnetic fields is necessary.</description>

      <title>Class $\mathcal{S}$ superconformal indices from maximal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new gauging of maximal supergravity in five spacetime dimensions with gauge group containing ISO(5), involving the local scaling symmetry of the metric, and admitting a supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacuum. We show this maximal supergravity to arise by consistent truncation of M-theory on the (non-spherical, non-parallelisable) six-dimensional geometry associated to a stack of $N$ M5-branes wrapped on a smooth Riemann surface. The existence of this truncation allows us to holographically determine the complete, universal spectrum of light operators of the dual four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory of class $\mathcal{S}$. We then compute holographically the superconformal index of the dual field theory at large-$N$, finding perfect agreement with previously known field theory results in specific limits.</description>

      <title>Anyons on M5-Probes of Seifert 3-Orbifolds via Flux Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe that there is a rigorous derivation of (abelian) anyonic quantum states, hence of "topological order", on the 1+2-dimensional fixed locus of M5-probes wrapped over a trivially Seifert-fibered 3-orbifold singularity.
  Similar statements have previously been conjectured by appeal to the unknown dynamics of "coincident" M5-branes, but neglecting effects of flux-quantization that, as we highlight, entail anyonic solitons already in the rigorously tractable case of single M5-brane probes.
  This is possible after globally completing the "self-dual" tensor field on probe M5-branes by flux quantization in the non-abelian cohomology theory called equivariant twistorial Cohomotopy, which is admissible by recent results.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Spencer Cohomologies of D=11 Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the theory of Cartan-Tanaka prolongations with the Molien-Weyl integral formula and Hilbert-Poincar\'e series to compute the Spencer cohomology groups of the $D=11$ Poincar\'e superalgebra $\mathfrak p$, relevant for superspace formulations of $11$-dimensional supergravity in terms of nonholonomic superstructures. This includes novel fermionic Spencer groups, providing with new cohomology classes of $\mathbb Z$-grading $1$ and form number $2$. Using the Hilbert-Poincar\'e series and the Euler characteristic, we also explore Spencer cohomology contributions in higher form numbers. We then propose a new general definition of filtered deformations of graded Lie superalgebras along first-order fermionic directions and investigate such deformations of $\mathfrak p$ that are maximally supersymmetric. In particular, we establish a no-go type theorem for maximally supersymmetric filtered subdeformations of $\mathfrak p$ along timelike (i.e., generic) first-order fermionic directions.</description>

      <title>Physical Vacuum Problems for the Full Compressible Euler Equations: Hadamard-style Local Well-posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript addresses the local well-posedness theories for the dynamics of non-isentropic compressible Euler equations in a physical vacuum. We establish Hadamard-style local well-posedness within suitable weighted Sobolev spaces, demonstrating existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on initial data. Additionally, we provide a priori energy estimates and continuation criteria. These results are applicable to the low-regularity solutions, in the sense that, the pointwise regularities of the free boundaries and the velocity fields restricted to them could merely be $C^{1.5+}$ and $C^{1+}$, respectively.
  This is the first well-posedness result for the full compressible Euler equations in a physical vacuum for space dimensions not restricted to one. The approach is based on the framework of Eulerian coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review 2d CFT in the bootstrap approach, and sketch the known exactly solvable CFTs with no extended chiral symmetry: Liouville theory, (generalized) minimal models, limits thereof, and loop CFTs, including the $O(n)$, Potts and $PSU(n)$ CFTs.
  Exact solvability relies on local conformal symmetry, and on the existence of degenerate fields. We show how these assumptions constrain the spectrum and correlation functions. We discuss how crossing symmetry equations can be solved analytically and/or numerically, leading to analytic expressions for structure constants in terms of the double Gamma function.
  In the case of loop CFTs, we sketch the corresponding statistical models, and derive the relation between statistical and CFT variables. We review the resulting combinatorial description of correlation functions, and discuss what remains to be done for solving the CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the collective dynamics of swarmalators subjected to periodic (sinusoidal) forcing. Although previous research focused on the simplified case of motion in a one-dimensional (1D) periodic domain, we extend this analysis to the more realistic scenario of motion in two and three spatial dimensions with periodic boundary conditions. In doing so, we identify analogues of the 1D states and characterize their dynamics and stability boundaries analytically. Additionally, we investigate the forced swarmalators model with power-law interaction kernels, finding that the analytically tractable model with periodic boundary conditions can reproduce the observed dynamic behaviors of this more complex model.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Correspondence of Non-Hermitian Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-to-complex spectral transitions and the associated spontaneous symmetry breaking of eigenstates are central to non-Hermitian physics, yet their underlying physical mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we resolve the mystery by employing the complex path integral formalism and developing a generalized Gutzwiller trace formula. These methodologies enable us to establish a universal quantum-classical correspondence that precisely links the real or complex nature of individual energy levels to the symmetry properties of their corresponding semiclassical orbits. Specifically, in systems with a general $\eta$-pseudo-Hermitian symmetry, real energy levels are quantized along periodic orbits that preserve the corresponding classical $S_\eta$ symmetry. In contrast, complex conjugate energy levels arise from semiclassical orbits that individually break the $S_\eta$ symmetry but together form $S_\eta$-symmetric pairs. This framework provides a unified explanation for the spectral behaviors in various continuous non-Hermitian models and for the ${PT}$ transition in two-level systems. Our work uncovers the physical mechanism of non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and introduces a new perspective with broad implications for the control and application of non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Torsional Rigidity under Geometric Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the behavior of the torsional rigidity of a precompact domain as the ambient manifold evolves under a geometric flow. Specifically, we derive bounds on torsional rigidity under the Ricci Flow for Heisenberg spaces and homogeneous spheres. Additionally, we establish bounds under the Inverse Mean Curvature Flow for strictly convex, free-boundary, disk-type hypersurfaces within a ball. In this latter case, by extending the analysis to the maximal existence time of the flow, we obtain inequalities of comparison with the flat disk for both volume and torsional rigidity.</description>

      <title>On turbulence for spacetimes with stable trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by understanding the nonlinear gravitational dynamics of spacetimes admitting stably trapped null geodesics, such as ultracompact objects and black string solutions to general relativity, we explore the dynamics of nonlinear scalar waves on a simple (fixed) model geometry with stable trapping. More specifically, we consider the time evolution of solutions to the cubic (defocusing) wave equation on a four-dimensional static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat (horizonless) spacetime admitting a stable photon sphere.
  Our study shows fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear scalar dynamics. The local energy, as well as all local higher-order energies, of solutions to the linear wave equation on our model spacetime can be rigorously proven to remain uniformly bounded and to decay uniformly in time. However, due to the presence of stable trapping, the uniform decay rate is slow. To help elucidate how the slow linear decay affects solutions to the nonlinear wave equation considered, we examine numerical solutions of the latter, restricting to axisymmetric initial data in this work. In contrast to the linear dynamics, we exhibit a family of nonlinear solutions with turbulent behaviour: Within the region of stable trapping, the slow linear decay allows local higher-order energies of the nonlinear solution to grow over the time interval that we numerically evolve, with the growth being induced by a direct energy cascade.
  As a complement to the numerical analysis, we provide a heuristic argument suggesting that, if a similar behaviour occurs for gravitational wave perturbations of the motivating spacetimes in general relativity, it would likely not generically lead to black hole or singularity formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the formation of droplets in the dimer model on a triangular lattice. The droplets in the dimer model are superposition polygons formed as two overlapping configurations of dimers: constant and movable. We demonstrate that specific local energies of dimers and low temperatures lead to the emergence of a macroscopic droplet. The motivation for this study was the phenomenon of the formation of equilibrium droplets under certain conditions in the Ising model within the framework of the Dobrushin-Koteck\'y-Shlosman theory. Due to the deep connections between the Ising model and the dimer model, similar behaviour was expected.</description>

      <title>Towards parameterizing the entanglement body of a qubit pair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method allowing to increase a computational efficiency of evaluation of non-local characteristics of a pair of qubits is described. The method is based on the construction of coordinates on a generic section of 2-qubit's entanglement space $\mathcal{E}_{2\times2}$ represented as the direct product of an ordered 3-dimensional simplex and the double coset $\mathrm{SU(2)}\times\mathrm{SU(2)}{\backslash} {\mathrm{SU(4)}}/ \mathrm{T^3}\,.$ Within this framework, the subset $\mathcal{SE}_{2\times2} \subset\mathcal{E}_{2\times2}$ corresponding to the rank-4 separable 2-qubit states is described as a semialgebraic variety given by a system of 3rd and 4th order polynomial inequalities in eigenvalues of the density matrix, whereas the polynomials coefficients are trigonometric functions defined over a direct product of two regular octahedra.</description>

Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional exclusion dynamics in mild contact with boundary reservoirs. In the diffusive scale, the particles' density evolves as the solution of the heat equation with non-linear Robin boundary conditions. For appropriate choices of the boundary rates, these partial differential equations have more than one stationary solution. We prove the dynamical large deviations principle.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory instability and stability of stationary solutions in the parametrically driven, damped nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We found two stationary solutions of the parametrically driven, damped nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonlinear term proportional to $|\psi(x,t)|^{2 \kappa} \psi(x,t)$ for positive values of $\kappa$. By linearizing the equation around these exact solutions, we derive the corresponding Sturm-Liouville problem. Our analysis reveals that one of the stationary solutions is unstable, while the stability of the other solution depends on the amplitude of the parametric force, damping coefficient, and nonlinearity parameter $\kappa$. An exceptional change of variables facilitates the computation of the stability diagram through numerical solutions of the eigenvalue problem as a specific parameter $\varepsilon$ varies within a bounded interval. For $\kappa &lt;2$ , an {\it oscillatory instability} is predicted analytically and confirmed numerically. Our principal result establishes that for $\kappa \ge 2$, there exists a critical value of $\varepsilon$ beyond which the unstable soliton becomes stable, exhibiting {\it oscillatory stability}.</description>

      <title>Local Statistics in Normal Matrix Models with Merging Singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12263v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the normal matrix model, also known as the two-dimensional one-component plasma at a specific temperature, with merging singularity. As the number $n$ of particles tends to infinity we obtain the limiting local correlation kernel at the singularity, which is related to the parametrix of the Painlev\'e~II equation. The two main tools are Riemann-Hilbert problems and the generalized Christoffel-Darboux identity. The correlation kernel exhibits a novel anisotropic scaling behavior, where the corresponding spacing scale of particles is $n^{-1/3}$ in the direction of merging and $n^{-1/2}$ in the perpendicular direction. In the vicinity at different distances to the merging singularity we also observe Ginibre bulk and edge statistics, as well as the sine-kernel and the universality class corresponding to the elliptic ensemble in the weak non-Hermiticity regime for the local correlation function.</description>

Abstract: For systems of evolutionary partial differential equations the tau-structure is an important notion which originated from the deep relation between integrable systems and quantum field theories. We show that, under a certain non-degeneracy condition, existence of a tau-structure implies integrability. As an example, we apply this principle to provide a new proof of the integrability of the Drinfeld--Sokolov hierarchy associated to an arbitrary Kac--Moody algebra and a choice of a vertex of its Dynkin diagram.</description>

      <title>Optimal relaxation of bump-like solutions of the one-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: REVISED VERSION INCORPORATING THE ERRATUM ON LEMMA 2.1 AND WITH A CORRECTION TO LEMMA 2.8
  In this paper we derive optimal relaxation rates for the Cahn-Hilliard equation on the one-dimensional torus and the line. We consider initial conditions with a finite (but not small) $L^1$-distance to an appropriately defined bump. The result extends the relaxation method developed previously for a single transition layer (the ``kink'') to the case of two transition layers (the ``bump''). As in the previous work, the tools include Nash-type inequalities, duality arguments, and Schauder estimates. For both the kink and the bump, the energy gap is translation invariant and its decay alone cannot specify to which member of the family of minimizers the solution converges. Whereas in the case of the kink, the conserved quantity singles out the longtime limit, in the case of a bump, a new argument is needed. On the torus, we quantify the (initially algebraic and ultimately exponential) convergence to the bump that is the longtime limit; on the line, the bump-like states are merely metastable and we quantify the initial algebraic relaxation behavior.</description>

      <title>Universality of global asymptotics of Jack-deformed random Young diagrams at varying temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes universal formulas describing the global asymptotics of two distinct discrete versions of $\beta$-ensembles in the high, low and fixed temperature regimes. Our results affirmatively answer a question posed by the second author and \'Sniady.
  We first introduce a special class of Jack measures on Young diagrams of arbitrary size, called the ``Jack--Thoma measures'', and prove the LLN and CLT in the three aforementioned limit regimes. In each case, we provide explicit formulas for polynomial observables of the limit shape and Gaussian fluctuations around the limit shape. These formulas have surprising positivity properties and are expressed as sums of weighted lattice paths. Second, we show that the previous formulas are universal: they also describe the limit shape and Gaussian fluctuations for the model of random Young diagrams of a fixed size derived from Jack characters with the approximate factorization property. Finally, in stark contrast with continuous $\beta$-ensembles, we show that the limit shapes at high and low temperatures of our random Young diagrams are one-sided infinite staircase shapes. For the Jack--Plancherel measure, we describe this shape explicitly by relating its local minima with the zeroes of Bessel functions.</description>

Abstract: We develop the deformation theory of instantons on asymptotically conical $Spin(7)$-manifolds where the instanton is asymptotic to a fixed nearly $G_2$-instanton at infinity. By relating the deformation complex with spinors, we identify the space of infinitesimal deformations with the kernel of the twisted negative Dirac operator on the asymptotically conical $Spin(7)$-manifold.
  Finally we apply this theory to describe the deformations of Fairlie-Nuyts-Fubini-Nicolai (FNFN) $Spin(7)$-instantons on $\mathbb{R}^8$, where $\mathbb{R}^8$ is considered to be an asymptotically conical $Spin(7)$-manifold asymptotic to the cone over $S^7$. We calculate the virtual dimension of the moduli space using Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem and the spectrum of the twisted Dirac operator.</description>

We investigate the reverse Faber-Krahn inequality conjectured by S. Fournais and B. Helffer, stating that this eigenvalue is maximized by the disk for a given area. Using the method of level lines, we prove the conjecture for small enough values of the magnetic field (those for which the corresponding eigenfunction in the disk is radial).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tomographic reconstruction of quantum states plays a fundamental role in benchmarking quantum systems and retrieving information from quantum computers. Among the informationally complete sets of quantum measurements the tight ones provide a linear reconstruction formula and minimize the propagation of statistical errors. However, implementing tight measurements in the lab is challenging due to the high number of required measurement projections, involving a series of experimental setup preparations. In this work, we introduce the notion of cyclic tight measurements, that allow us to perform full quantum state tomography while considering only repeated application of a single unitary-based quantum device during the measurement stage process. This type of measurements significantly simplifies the complexity of the experimental setup required to retrieve the quantum state of a physical system. Additionally, we design feasible setup preparation procedure that produce well-approximated cyclic tight measurements, in every finite dimension.</description>

      <title>Quantum versus classical $P$-divisibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $P$-divisibility is a central concept in both classical and quantum non-Markovian processes; in particular, it is strictly related to the notion of information backflow. When restricted to a fixed commutative algebra generated by a complete set of orthogonal projections, any quantum dynamics naturally provides a classical stochastic process. It is indeed well known that a quantum generator gives rise to a $P$-divisible quantum dynamics if and only if all its possible classical reductions give rise to divisible classical stochastic processes. Yet, this property does not hold if one operates a classical reduction of the quantum dynamical maps instead of their generators: as an example, for a unitary dynamics, $P$-divisibility of its classical reduction is inevitably lost, which thus exhibits information backflow. Instead, for some important classes of purely dissipative qubit evolutions, quantum $P$-divisibility always implies classical $P$-divisibility and thus lack of information backflow both in the quantum and classical scenarios. On the contrary, for a wide class of orthogonally covariant qubit dynamics, we show that loss of classical $P$-divisibility can originate from the classical reduction of a purely dissipative $P$-divisible quantum dynamics as in the unitary case. Moreover, such an effect can be interpreted in terms of information backflow, the information coming in being stored in the coherences of the time-evolving quantum state.</description>

      <title>Black holes in the expanding Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The McVittie metric does not describe a physical black hole in an expanding universe because the curvature scalar and pressure at its event horizon are infinite. We show that extending this metric to an inhomogeneous scale factor, which depends on both the time and radial coordinate, removes those infinities by imposing the constancy of the Hubble parameter at the horizon. We also show that the Hubble parameters at the event horizons of all centrally symmetric black holes without accreting matter are equal to the same constant $H_\textrm{hor}=(\Lambda/3)^{1/2}$. Because of this equality and the equivalence to the Kottler metric near the horizon, black holes do not grow with the universe expansion. Black holes with accretion are described by this extension with different values of $H_\textrm{hor}$.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation and aspects of integrability of generalised hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalised Hydrodynamics (GHD) describes the large-scale inhomogeneous dynamics of integrable (or close to integrable) systems in one dimension of space, based on a central equation for the fluid density or quasi-particle density: the GHD equation. We consider a new, general form of the GHD equation: we allow for spatially extended interaction kernels, generalising previous constructions. We show that the GHD equation, in our general form and hence also in its conventional form, is Hamiltonian. This holds also including force terms representing inhomogeneous external potentials coupled to conserved densities. To this end, we introduce a new Poisson bracket on functionals of the fluid density, which is seen as our dynamical field variable. The total energy is the Hamiltonian whose flow under this Poisson bracket generates the GHD equation. The fluid density depends on two (real and spectral) variables so the GHD equation can be seen as a $2+1$-dimensional classical field theory. In its $1+1$-dimensional reduction corresponding to the case without external forces, we further show the system admits an infinite set of conserved quantities that are in involution for our Poisson bracket, hinting at integrability of this field theory.</description>

      <title>Zeitlin's model for axisymmetric 3-D Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zeitlin's model is a spatial discretization for the 2-D Euler equations on the flat 2-torus or the 2-sphere. Contrary to other discretizations, it preserves the underlying geometric structure, namely that the Euler equations describe Riemannian geodesics on a Lie group. Here we show how to extend Zeitlin's approach to the axisymmetric Euler equations on the 3-sphere. It is the first discretization of the 3-D Euler equations that fully preserves the geometric structure, albeit restricted to axisymmetric solutions. Thus, this finite-dimensional model admits Riemannian curvature and Jacobi equations, which are discussed.</description>

      <title>Limiting Spectral Distribution of a Random Commutator Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of a class of random matrices of the form $S_n^{-} = n^{-1}(X_1 X_2^* - X_2 X_1^*)$ where $X_k = \Sigma^{1/2}Z_k$, for $k=1,2$, $Z_k$'s are independent $p\times n$ complex-valued random matrices, and $\Sigma$ is a $p\times p$ positive semi-definite matrix, independent of the $Z_k$'s. We assume that $Z_k$'s have independent entries with zero mean and unit variance. The skew-symmetric/skew-Hermitian matrix $S_n^{-}$ will be referred to as a random commutator matrix associated with the samples $X_1$ and $X_2$. We show that, when the dimension $p$ and sample size $n$ increase simultaneously, so that $p/n \to c \in (0,\infty)$, there exists a limiting spectral distribution (LSD) for $S_n^{-}$, supported on the imaginary axis, under the assumptions that the spectral distribution of $\Sigma$ converges weakly and the entries of $Z_k$'s have moments of sufficiently high order. This nonrandom LSD can be described through its Stieltjes transform, which satisfies a coupled Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur-type functional equations. In the special case when $\Sigma = I_p$, we show that the LSD of $S_n^{-}$ is a mixture of a degenerate distribution at zero (with positive mass if $c &gt; 2$), and a continuous distribution with a symmetric density function supported on a compact interval on the imaginary axis. Moreover, we show that the companion matrix $S_n^{+} = \Sigma_n^\frac{1}{2}(Z_1Z_2^* + Z_2Z_1^*)\Sigma_n^\frac{1}{2}$, under identical assumptions, has an LSD supported on the real line, which can be similarly characterized.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: Classifying Photonic Topology Using the Spectral Localizer and Numerical $K$-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the spectral localizer framework has emerged as an efficient approach to classifying topology in photonic systems featuring local nonlinearities and radiative environments. In nonlinear systems, this framework provides rigorous definitions for concepts like topological solitons and topological dynamics, where a system's occupation induces a local change in its topology due to the nonlinearity. For systems embedded in radiative environments that do not possess a shared bulk spectral gap, this framework enables the identification of local topology and shows that local topological protection is preserved despite the lack of a common gap. However, as the spectral localizer framework is rooted in the mathematics of $C^*$-algebras, and not vector bundles, understanding and using this framework requires developing intuition for a somewhat different set of underlying concepts than those that appear in traditional approaches to classifying material topology. In this tutorial, we introduce the spectral localizer framework from a ground-up perspective, and provide physically motivated arguments for understanding its local topological markers and associated local measure of topological protection. In doing so, we provide numerous examples of the framework's application to a variety of topological classes, including crystalline and higher-order topology. We then show how Maxwell's equations can be reformulated to be compatible with the spectral localizer framework, including the possibility of radiative boundary conditions. To aid in this introduction, we also provide a physics-oriented introduction to multi-operator pseudospectral methods and numerical $K$-theory, two mathematical concepts that form the foundation for the spectral localizer framework.</description>

      <title>Closed orbits of MHD equilibria with orientation-reversing symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a generalisation of the periodic orbit structure often seen in reflection or mirror symmetric MHD equilibria, we consider equilibria with other orientation-reversing symmetries. An example of such a symmetry, which is a not a reflection, is the parity transformation $(x,y,z) \mapsto (-x,-y,-z)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. It is shown under any orientation-reversing isometry, that if the pressure function is assumed to have toroidally nested level sets, then all orbits on the tori are necessarily periodic. The techniques involved are almost entirely topological in nature and give rise to a handy index describing how a diffeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}^3$ alters the poloidal and toroidal curves of an invariant embedded 2-torus.</description>

      <title>Fusion rules and rigidity for weight modules over the simple admissible affine $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal vertex operator superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the categories of weight modules over the simple $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal vertex operator algebras at fractional admissible levels and central charges are rigid (and hence the categories of weight modules are braided ribbon categories) and that the decomposition formulae of fusion products of simple projective modules conjectured by Thomas Creutzig, David Ridout and collaborators hold (including when the decomposition involves summands that are indecomposable yet not simple). In addition to solving this old open problem, we develop new techniques for the construction of intertwining operators by means of integrating screening currents over certain cycles, which are expected to be of independent interest, due to their applicability to many other algebras. In the example of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ these new techniques allow us to give explicit formulae for a logarithmic intertwining operator from a pair of simple projective modules to the projective cover of the tensor unit, namely, the vertex operator algebra as a module over itself.</description>

      <title>Langlands Duality and Invariant Differential Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Langlands duality is one of the most influential topics in mathematical research. It has many different appearances and influential subtopics. Yet there is a topic that until now seems unrelated to the Langlands program. That is the topic of invariant differential operators. That is strange since both items are deeply rooted in Harish-Chandra's representation theory of semisimple Lie groups. In this paper we start building the bridge between the two programs.</description>
