      <title>The properties of supermassive stars in galaxy merger driven direct collapse I: models without rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of the most massive quasars observed at high redshifts requires extreme accretion rates ($&gt;1$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$). Inflows of $10-1000$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ are found in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers, leading to the formation of supermassive discs (SMDs) with high metallicities ($&gt;$ Z$_\odot$). Supermassive stars (SMSs) born in these SMDs could be the progenitors of the most extreme quasars. Here, we study the properties of non-rotating SMSs forming in high metallicity SMDs. Using the stellar evolution code GENEC, we compute numerically the hydrostatic structures of non-rotating SMSs with metallicities $Z=1-10$ Z$_\odot$ by following their evolution under constant accretion at rates $10-1000$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. We determine the final mass of the SMSs, set by the general-relativistic (GR) instability, by applying the relativistic equation of adiabatic pulsations to the hydrostatic structures. We find that non-rotating SMSs with metallicities $Z=1-10$ Z$_\odot$ accreting at rates $10-1000$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ evolve as red supergiant protostars until their final collapse. All the models reach the GR instability during H-burning. The final mass is $\sim10^6$ M$_\odot$, nearly independently of the metallicity and the accretion rate.</description>

      <title>Long-term Fermi observations of Mrk 421: clues for different non-stationary processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the gamma-ray spectral and timing results from the long-term regular observations of Mrk 421 with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard Fermi during 2008 August - 2023 August. We discerned six periods the relatively stronger 0.3-300 GeV activity compared to other time intervals. The baseline brightness level varied on timescales from several months to years during these periods, which was superimposed by shorter-term flares of the different asymmetry associated with various interplay between the light-crossing, particle acceleration and cooling timescales. The source also frequently exhibited two-peak flares, to be triggered by the propagation of forward and reverse shocks after collision between the shells of high-energy plasma, moving with different speeds down the jet. The strongest long-term flaring activity was recorded during 2012 June - 2013 October and 2017 October - 2018 March, when the source was robustly detectable even on intraday timescales. We detected 25 instances of intraday variability and a large number of the flux doubling or halving instances. The source generally showed a lognormal variability in the LAT energy range, explained as an imprinting of the disc nonstationary processes on the jet, proton-initiated hadronic cascades or random fluctuations in the particle acceleration rate. Most of the 0.3-300 GeV spectra were well-fit with a simple power-law model and showed a very broad range of the photon-index from 2.8 down to 1.2, with the mean values of 1.75-1.84 and distribution peaks at 1.73-1.82 during the periods of strong activity. Our spectral study also revealed the features of inverse-Compton upscatter of X-ray photons in the Klein-Nishina regime, relativistic magnetic reconnection, first-order Fermi mechanism within the magnetic field of different confinement efficiencies and stochastic acceleration</description>

      <title>NICER observations of type-I X-ray bursts from the ultra-compact X-ray binary M15 X-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-I X-ray bursts are thermonuclear explosions caused by the unstable burning of accreted material on the surface of neutron stars. We report the detection of seven type-I X-ray bursts from the ultracompact X-ray binary M15 X-2 observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) during its 2022 outburst. We found all the bursts occurred in the soft state and exhibited similar light curve profiles, with no cases of photospheric radius expansion. Time-resolved spectroscopy showed clear deviations from the blackbody model during the first ten seconds of all the bursts. The fits were improved by using the enhanced persistent emission method, which we interpret as evidence of burst-disk interaction. We compared the performance of these models against a neutron star atmosphere model and found it made no significant improvements. After analyzing the burst rise times and fuel composition, we propose that these bursts were powered by the burning of pure helium, confirming the ultracompact nature of the source.</description>

      <title>SN 2021hpr: A Normal Type Ia Supernova Showing Excess Emission in the Early Rising Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present extensive optical observations of a nearby Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), SN 2021hpr, located in the spiral galaxy NGC 3147 at a distance of $\sim$ 45 Mpc. Our observations cover a phase within $\sim 1-2$ days to $\sim 290$ days after the explosion. SN 2021hpr is found to be a spectroscopically normal SN Ia, with an absolute B-band peak magnitude of $M_{max}(B) \approx -19.16 \pm 0.14$ mag and a post-peak decline rate of $\Delta m_{15}(B)= 1.00 \pm 0.01 $ mag. Early-time light curves showed a $\sim 7.0 \%$ excess emission compared to a homogeneously expanding fireball model, likely due to SN ejecta interacting with a companion or immediate circumstellar matter. The optical spectra of SN 2021hpr are overall similar to those of normal SNe Ia, but characterized by prominent detached high-velocity features (HVFs) of Si {\sc ii} and Ca {\sc ii} in the early phase. After examining a small sample of well-observed normal SNe Ia, we find that the HVFs are likely common for the subgroup with early-excess emission. The association of early bump feature with the HVFs could be attributed to density or abundance enhancement at the outer layer of the exploding star, likely as a result of interactions with companion$/$CSM or experiencing more complete burning. Nevertheless, the redshifted Fe {\sc ii} and Ni {\sc ii} lines in the nebular-phase spectra of SN 2021hpr, contrary to the blueshift trend seen in other SNe Ia showing early bump features, indicate its peculiarity in the explosion that remains to be understood.</description>

      <title>Observational evidence for a correlation between the magnetic field of jets and star formation rate in host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion supermassive black holes in the center of active galaxies usually produce ``jets''-collimated bipolar outflows of relativistic particles. Magnetic fields near the black hole event horizon may play a crucial role in the formation of jets/outflows. Both theory and observation indicate that jets/outflows driven by centrally active supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have a feedback effect on the overall properties of the host galaxies. Therefore, the magnetic field is a key ingredient for the formation and evolution of galaxies. Here we report a clear correlation between the magnetic field of jets and star formation rate (SFR) for a large sample of 96 galaxies hosting supermassive black holes, which suggests that the star formation of active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies may be powered by the jets.</description>

      <title>Emergence of cHz Quasi-Periodic Oscillations from low angular momentum flow onto a supermassive black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are very common in black hole accretion systems that are seen from the modulations in luminosity. Many supermassive black hole sources (e.g., RE J1034+396, 1H~0707-495, MCG-6-30-15, 1ES~1927+654, Sgr~A$^*$) have been observed to exhibit QPO-like variability in the range of mHz in different energy bands (e.g., radio, NIR, X-ray). Due to the shorter infalling time, low-angular momentum accretion flows can have resonance close to the black hole, which will raise variability centiHz (cHz) or beyond QPOs for supermassive black holes. In this study, we for the first time show that such resonance conditions can be achieved in simulations of low angular momentum accretion flows onto a black hole. The QPOs could have values beyond $\nu_{\rm QPO}\gtrsim0.1-1\times 10^7M_\odot/M_{\rm BH}\,$cHz and the harmonics have a ratio of 2:1. Hunting down of these cHz QPOs will provide a smoking gun signature for the presence of low-angular momentum accretion flows around black holes (e.g., Sgr~A$^*$, 1ES~1927+654).</description>

      <title>Constraints on the X-ray-to-radio fluence ratio of FRB 20240114A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on multiwavelength observations of FRB 20240114A, a nearby (z=0.13), hyperactive, repeating fast radio burst that was discovered in January 2024. We performed simultaneous observations of the source with the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope, the Thai National Radio Telescope, the Astropeiler Stockert, and the X-ray satellite XMM-Newton in May 2024. On May 23, 2024, we detected 459 bursts from the source using the Ultra-Broad-Band (UBB) receiver of the Effelsberg telescope, covering a frequency range from 1.3 GHz to 6 GHz. All bursts have simultaneous X-ray coverage, which allows us to put stringent constraints on the X-ray-to-radio fluence ratio, $\eta_{x/r}$, of FRB 20240114A. In this work, we focus on the three brightest radio bursts detected during the campaign. The brightest burst exhibits a radio fluence of $1.4\times 10^{-17}$ erg cm$^{-2}$, while the $3\sigma$ upper limit of the 0.2$-$12 keV absorption-corrected X-ray burst fluence lies in the range of $3.4\times 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ to $1.7\times 10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$, depending on the spectral model. Assuming a 10 keV black-body spectrum, the X-ray-to-radio fluence ratio can be constrained to $\eta_{x/r}&lt;1.2\times10^{7}$. A cutoff power law ($\Gamma=1.56$, cutoff at 84 keV) is also considered, physically motivated by the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, which has previously shown X-ray bursts associated with FRB-like radio bursts at a measured X-ray-to-radio fluence ratio of $\eta_{x/r}\sim2.5\times 10^{5}$ (1$-$250 keV). In this scenario, we find that $\eta_{x/r}&lt;2.4\times 10^6$. Our results are consistent with FRB 20240114A being powered by a mechanism similar to that of SGR 1935+2154. We show that future multiwavelength campaigns will be able to improve this limit if sufficiently bright radio bursts are observed with simultaneous X-ray coverage.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave probes of particle dark matter: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02607v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various theories of dark matter predict distinctive astrophysical signatures in gravitational-wave sources that could be observed by ground- and space-based laser interferometers. Different candidates-including axions, dark photons, macroscopic dark matter, WIMPs, and dark-matter spikes-may appear in interferometer data via their coupling to gravity or the Standard Model, altering the measured gravitational-wave strain in distinct ways. Despite their differences, these candidates share two key features: (1) they can be probed through their effects on gravitational waves from inspiraling compact objects, isolated black holes, and neutron stars, or via direct interactions with detectors, and (2) their signatures likely persist far longer than the seconds-long mergers detected today, necessitating new data analysis methods beyond matched filtering. This review outlines these dark matter candidates, their observational signatures, and approaches for their detection.</description>

      <title>Quantitative exploration of the similarity of gamma-ray pulsar light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and apply a methodology based on dynamic time warping (DTW) to compare the whole set of gamma-ray light curves reported in the Third Fermi-Large Area Telescope Pulsar Catalogue. Our method allows us to quantitatively measure the degree of global similarity between two light curves beyond comparing indicators such as how many peaks there are, which is their separation, width, and height. Once the morphology of the light curve is showcased via background subtraction, min-max scaler normalization, and rotations are considered to take into account that phase 0 is arbitrary, the level of detail with which light curves of different pulsars appear is revealed. In many cases their similarity is striking and occurs disregarding any other timing, physical, or spectral property. In particular, some MSPs and young pulsars share detailed light curve morphology.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in massive gravity: Waveforms generated by a particle plunging into a black hole and the excitation of quasinormal modes and quasibound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16538v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the aim of testing massive gravity in the context of black hole physics, we investigate the gravitational radiation emitted by a massive particle plunging into a Schwarzschild black hole from slightly below the innermost stable circular orbit. To do so, we first construct the quasinormal and quasibound resonance spectra of the spin-2 massive field for odd and even parity. Then, we compute the waveforms produced by the plunging particle and study their spectral content. This allows us to highlight and interpret important phenomena in the plunge regime, including (i) the excitation of quasibound states, with particular emphasis on the amplification and slow decay of the post-ringdown phase of the even-parity dipolar mode due to harmonic resonance; (ii) during the adiabatic phase, the waveform emitted by the plunging particle is very well described by the waveform emitted by the particle living on the innermost stable circular orbit, and (iii) the regularized waveforms and their unregularized counterparts constructed from the quasinormal mode spectrum are in excellent agreement. Finally, we construct, for arbitrary directions of observation and, in particular, outside the orbital plane of the plunging particle, the regularized multipolar waveforms, i.e., the waveforms constructed by summing over partial waveforms.</description>

      <title>The temperature and metallicity distributions of the ICM: insights with TNG-Cluster for XRISM-like observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The new era of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy will significantly improve our understanding of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) by providing precise constraints on its underlying physical properties. However, spectral fitting requires reasonable assumptions on the thermal and chemical distributions of the gas. We use the output of TNG-Cluster, the newest addition to the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations, to provide theoretical expectations for the multi-phase nature of the ICM across hundreds of z=0 clusters (M$_{500c}$ = 10$^{14.0-15.3}$ M$_\odot$) based upon a realistic model for galaxy formation and evolution. We create and analyse, in an observer-like manner, end-to-end XRISM/Resolve mock observations towards cluster centres. We then systematically compare the intrinsic properties of the simulated gas with the inferred ones from spectral fitting via a variety of commonly used spectral-emission models. Our analysis suggests that models with a distribution of temperatures, such as bvlognorm and bvgadem, better describe the complex thermal structure of the ICM, as predicted by TNG-Cluster, but incur biases of 0.5-2 keV (16th-84th percentiles). The 1T bvapec is too simplistic for the predicted broad temperature distributions, while a 2T double bvapec model systematically fails to capture the input temperature structure. However, all spectral emission models systematically underestimate the Fe abundance of the central ICM by ~0.1 Solar (~ 20 per cent) primarily due to projection effects. Selecting only strong cool core clusters leads to minor improvements on inference quality, removing the majority of outliers but maintaining similar overall biases and cluster-to-cluster scatter.</description>

      <title>The landscape of binary core-collapse supernova progenitors and the late emergence of Wolf-Rayet winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors are massive stars in multiple systems, and their evolution and final fate are affected by interactions with their companions. These interactions can explain the presence of circumstellar material in many CCSNe, and the inferred low mass in stripped-envelope supernova progenitors. Through binary interactions, stars can gain mass, lose mass, or merge, impacting their final properties. Specific sub-types of binary interaction products have been investigated but few detailed full population models exist. Using {thousands of} detailed simulations with updated prescriptions for binary interactions and winds at Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds metallicities, we follow the evolution of single massive stars, primaries in interacting binaries and coalescence products following common envelope evolution. We also follow the evolution of the surviving secondary star, with a compact companion formed from the evolutionary end of the primary star or alone if the system was disrupted in the first supernova. The endpoints of our simulations map the rich landscape of CCSN progenitors, and provide detailed mass-loss history and progenitor structures. We identify an important evolutionary phase for stripped-envelope supernova progenitors, in which the wind mass-loss rate of stars stripped by binary interaction rapidly increases in their final evolutionary stages, after core helium burning. These strong winds would give rise to a Wolf-Rayet (WR) spectral appearance, though only for a few millennia, in contrast to hundreds of millennia for their more massive WR counterparts. Such lightweight WR stars in binaries can account for observed properties of type Ib/c supernovae.</description>

      <title>Formation of Be star decretion discs through boundary layer effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Be stars are rapidly rotating, with angular frequency around $0.7-0.8$ of their Keplerian break up frequency, as a result of significant accretion during the earlier stellar evolution of a companion star. Material from the equator of the Be star is ejected and forms a decretion disc, although the mechanism for the disc formation has remained elusive. We find one-dimensional steady state decretion disc solutions that smoothly transition from a rapidly rotating star that is in hydrostatic balance. Boundary layer effects in a geometrically thick disc which connects to a rotationally flattened star enable the formation of a decretion disc at stellar spin rates below the break up rate. For a disc with an aspect ratio $H/R\approx 0.1$ at the inner edge, the torque from the disc on the star slows the stellar spin to the observed range and mass ejection continues at a rate consistent with observed decretion rates. The critical rotation rate, to which the star slows down to, decreases as the disc aspect ratio increases. More generally, steady state accretion and decretion disc solutions can be found for all stellar spin rates. The outcome for a particular system depends upon the balance between the decretion rate and any external infall accretion rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern X-ray and gamma-ray observatories time-tag detected photons. The distribution of intervals between successive photons may reveal variations of the flux on time scales too short for direct flux measurement of the mean count rate, provided a sufficient number of photons have been detected cumulatively. We demonstrate this with synthetic data and apply to RXTE data from Cyg X-1.</description>

      <title>Detection of the optical counterpart of the transient ULX NGC300 ULX-1: a nascent black hole - neutron star binary?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The end points of massive star evolution are poorly known, especially those in interacting binary systems containing compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes. Such systems are bright in X-rays, and the most luminous among them are called ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). In this paper, we address the enigmatic NGC 300 ULX-1. It's X-ray activity started in 2010 with the supernova impostor-like event SN 2010da. In the following few years the ULX was powered by persistent super-Eddington accretion but then it dimmed in X-rays. We present the most recent X-ray and optical observations. The Chandra and Swift telescopes confirm that SN 2010da/NGC 300 ULX-1 is not accreting at super-Eddington level anymore. We attribute this switch in accretion regime to the donor star variability and its fast evolution. In order to gain a better understanding of the donor star's nature, we consider its optical light curve on a decade-long time scale and show that the optical counterpart of SN 2010da/NGC 300 ULX-1 dimmed significantly over recent years. The most recent detection in optical by the Gemini telescope reveals that the source is now &gt; 2.5 mag fainter in the r' band compared to the epoch when it was spectroscopically classified as a red supergiant. We discuss the nature of the abrupt changes in the donor star properties, and consider among other possibilities the silent collapse of the donor star into a black hole.</description>

      <title>Shadows aspect of rotating black holes in the Einstein-AdS SU(N)-nonlinear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of the supermassive black holes M87* and Sgr A* by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have opened new avenues for testing gravity theories through black hole shadow observables. These observations offer a means to distinguish between general relativity and modified gravity theories while providing insights into the astrophysical properties of the observed black holes. In this work, we investigate photon orbits and shadow characteristics of rotating black holes within the Einstein-$\mathrm{SU(N)}$ nonlinear sigma model. We first analyze the static, spherically symmetric black hole solution, focusing on its asymptotically Anti-de Sitter behavior and causal structure. The Modified Newman-Janis Algorithm is then applied to obtain the rotating counterpart, followed by an examination of its geometric properties, ergoregions, and causal structure. Utilizing the Lagrangian formalism, we derive the equations of motion for photons and study the resulting black hole shadow on the celestial plane. We explore the dependence of the shadow's size and shape on the black hole parameters $K$ and $N$, imposing constraints using EHT observational data for M87* and Sgr A*. Finally, we analyze the black hole's evaporation rate under different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit: a perspective from local geometrical invariants and matter distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the logarithmic divergence of the deflection angle in the strong deflection limit in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. We propose a novel analytical framework that connects its physical origin to local, coordinate-invariant geometric quantities and properties of the matter distributions. Conventional approaches describe the divergence rate, characterized by the coefficient $\bar{a}$, in terms of coordinate-dependent metric functions. In contrast, our method relates $\bar{a}$ to the components of the Einstein tensor in an orthonormal tetrad adapted to the spacetime symmetry. By employing the Einstein equations, we express $\bar{a}$ in terms of the local values of energy density $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}$ and tangential pressure $\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}$ at the photon sphere with an areal radius $R_{\mathrm{m}}$: \begin{align*} \bar{a}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-8\pi R_{\mathrm{m}}^2\left(\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}\right)}}. \end{align*} This formula clearly shows that, through the combination $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}$, the strong field limit coefficient $\bar{a}$ depends on the local matter distribution. In particular, if the matter fields satisfy $\rho+\Pi=0$, the universal result $\bar{a}=1$ emerges. This finding not only accounts for the behavior observed in the Schwarzschild spacetime but also provides a unified description applicable to a variety of spacetimes, including certain naked singularities and wormholes supported by a massless scalar field. Furthermore, these local properties are reflected in the frequencies of quasinormal modes, suggesting a profound connection between strong gravitational lensing and the dynamical response of gravitational wave signals. Our framework, independent of any specific gravitational theory, serves as a universal tool for testing gravitational theories and interpreting astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Einstein-Maxwell dilaton-axion gravity from the observed quasi-periodic oscillations in black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String-inspired models are often believed to provide an interesting framework for quantum gravity and force unification with promising prospects to resolve issues like dark matter and dark energy which cannot be satisfactorily incorporated within the framework of general relativity (GR). The goal of the present work is to investigate the role of the Einstein-Maxwell dilaton-axion (EMDA) gravity arising in the low energy effective action of the heterotic string theory in explaining astrophysical observations, in particular, the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) observed in the power spectrum of black holes. EMDA gravity has interesting cosmological implications and hence it is worthwhile to explore the footprints of such a theory in available astrophysical observations. This requires one to study the stationary, axi-symmetric black hole solution in EMDA gravity, which corresponds to the Kerr-Sen spacetime. Such black holes are endowed with a dilatonic charge while the rotation is sourced from the axionic field. We investigate the orbital and epicyclic frequencies of matter rotating in the Kerr-Sen spacetime and consider eleven well-studied QPO models in this work. We compare the model dependent QPO frequencies with the available observations of five BH sources, namely, XTE J1550-564, GRS 1915+105, H 143+322, GRO J1655-40 and Sgr A*. Our analysis provides constrains on the spins of the aforesaid black holes which when compared with previous estimates enables us to understand the observationally favored QPO models for each of these sources. Further, from the current data the EMDA scenario cannot be ruled out in favor of general relativity. We comment on the implications and limitations of our finding and how the present constrains compare with the existing literature.</description>

      <title>An SS433 flare caught by TESS. Fast rise times and evidence for a 13 hours quasi-period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SS433 is an exotic Galactic microquasar in which there is a supercritical inflow of matter into a compact object of likely black hole nature. Here I report on an SS433 flare that occurred during a TESS observation of Sector 54 in June of 2022. The flare lasted for about 10 days and culminated in a flux increase by a factor of three relative to quiescence. The unprecedented continuous photometric coverage of the flare afforded by TESS shows that the flux can rise and fall by up to a factor of two within 4 to 7 hours. Furthermore, there is evidence that the flare peaks occur with a quasi-period $P_{\mathrm{QPO}} = 13.3$ hours. The flare can be most naturally explained by accretion rate ($\dot{M}$) variations due to oscillations in the donor star mass loss rate. We estimate $\dot{M}$ variations up to a factor of two with an increase in the photospheric radius of the accretion disk by about the same factor, implying that a transient ``common envelope'' enshrouds the binary system during the flares. If the flares are due to radial pulsations in the donor star envelope then their quasi-period $P_{\mathrm{QPO}}$ could imply a mean density $\left &lt; \rho \right &gt; \sim 18 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3}$ for the donor star, compared to $\left &lt; \rho_{\mathrm{RL}} \right &gt; = 0.7-1 \text{ kg} \text{ m}^{-3}$ for a synchronized Roche-lobe filling donor star. Another SS433 lightcurve from a Sector 80 TESS observation in 2024 hints that there may be an outflow from behind the the donor star.</description>

      <title>Where has all the $r$-process gone? Timescales for GRB-Kilonovae to Enrich their Host Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron star (NS) mergers are currently the only observed source of $r$-process production in the Universe. Yet, it is unclear how much $r$-process mass from these mergers is incorporated into star-forming gas to enrich stars. This is crucial to consider as all other $r$-process mass estimates in the Universe beyond Earth are based on stellar $r$-process abundances. Here, we explore the extent to which merger location and host galaxy properties affect the incorporation of $r$-process elements into star-forming gas, and quantify an ``enrichment" timescale to account for this process. To put this timescale in context, we analyze a population of 12 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with probable associations to $r$-process kilonovae (GRB-KNe) and 74 short GRBs without claimed KNe, including new non-parametric star formation histories for the GRB-KN hosts. We find enrichment timescales for this sample are between $\approx7$ Myr$-1.6$ Gyr, suggesting that environmental enrichment is delayed from NS merger occurrence. Moreover, we find a correlation between the amount of environmental enrichment from a single event and increasing host specific star formation rate (sSFR), and little correlation with stellar mass and GRB galactocentric offset. Environments with low sSFRs ($&lt;10^{-10.5}$ yr$^{-1}$), which comprise 18% of short GRB hosts and the host of GW170817, will have little to no capacity for stellar enrichment. Our results indicate that not all $r$-process from NS mergers is incorporated into newly-forming stars, and instead some remains ``lost" to the CGM or IGM. Future studies should consider these losses to understand the total contribution from NS mergers to the Universe's $r$-process budget.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetry of SN 2023ixf reveals both circumstellar material and helium core to be aspherical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present multi-epoch optical spectropolarimetric and imaging polarimetric observations of the nearby Type II supernova (SN) 2023ixf discovered in M101 at a distance of 6.85 Mpc. The first imaging polarimetric observations were taken +2.33 days (60085.08 MJD) after the explosion, while the last imaging polarimetric data points (+73.19 and +76.19 days) were acquired after the fall from the light curve plateau. At +2.33 days there is strong evidence of circumstellar material (CSM) interaction in the spectra and the light curve. A significant level of intrinsic polarization $p_r = 1.02\pm 0.07 \% $ is seen during this phase which indicates that this CSM is aspherical. We find that the polarization evolves with time toward the interstellar polarization level during the photospheric phase, which suggests that the recombination photosphere is spherically symmetric. There is a jump in polarization ($p_r =0.45 \pm 0.08 \% $ and $p_r =0.62 \pm 0.08 \% $) at +73.19 and +76.19 days when the light curve falls from the plateau. This is a phase where polarimetric data is sensitive to non-spherical inner ejecta or a decrease in optical depth into the single scattering regime. We also present spectropolarimetric data that reveal line (de)polarization during most of the observed epochs. In addition, at +14.50 days we see an ``inverse P Cygni" profile in the H and He line polarization, which clearly indicates the presence of asymmetrically distributed material overlying the photosphere. The overall temporal evolution of polarization is typical for Type II SNe, but the high level of polarization during the rising phase has only been observed in SN 2023ixf.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the GRBSN webtool, an open-source data repository coupled to a web interface that hosts the most complete dataset of GRB-SN associations to date. In contrast to repositories of supernova (SN) or gamma-ray burst (GRB) data, this tool provides a multi-wavelength view of each GRB-SN association. GRBSN allows users to view and interact with plots of the data; search and filter the whole database; and download radio, X-ray, optical/NIR photometric and spectroscopic data related to a GRB-SN association. The web interface code and GRB-SN data are hosted on a public GitHub repository, allowing users to upload their own data, flag missing data and suggest improvements. The GRBSN webtool will be maintained by the Space Science group at University College Dublin, Ireland. As the number of confirmed GRB-SN associations increases in the coming years, the GRBSN webtool will provide a robust framework in which to catalogue these associations and their associated data. The web interface is available at: https://grbsn.watchertelescope.ie.</description>

      <title>Representation Learning for Time-Domain High-Energy Astrophysics: Discovery of Extragalactic Fast X-ray Transient XRT 200515</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel representation learning method for downstream tasks like anomaly detection, unsupervised classification, and similarity searches in high-energy data sets. This enabled the discovery of a new extragalactic fast X-ray transient (FXT) in Chandra archival data, XRT 200515, a needle-in-the-haystack event and the first Chandra FXT of its kind. Recent serendipitous discoveries in X-ray astronomy, including FXTs from binary neutron star mergers and an extragalactic planetary transit candidate, highlight the need for systematic transient searches in X-ray archives. We introduce new event file representations, E-t maps and E-t-dt cubes, that effectively encode both temporal and spectral information, enabling the seamless application of machine learning to variable-length event file time series. Our unsupervised learning approach employs PCA or sparse autoencoders to extract low-dimensional, informative features from these data representations, followed by clustering in the embedding space with DBSCAN. New transients are identified within transient-dominant clusters or through nearest-neighbour searches around known transients, producing a catalogue of 3559 candidates (3447 flares and 112 dips). XRT 200515 exhibits unique temporal and spectral variability, including an intense, hard &lt;10s initial burst, followed by spectral softening in an ~800s oscillating tail. We interpret XRT 200515 as either the first giant magnetar flare observed at low X-ray energies or the first extragalactic Type I X-ray burst from a faint, previously unknown low-mass X-ray binary in the LMC. Our method extends to data sets from other observatories such as XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, Einstein Probe, and upcoming missions like AXIS.</description>

      <title>The birth mass function of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The birth mass function of neutron stars encodes rich information about supernova explosions, double star evolution, and properties of matter under extreme conditions. To date, it has remained poorly constrained by observations, however. Applying probabilistic corrections to account for mass accreted by recycled pulsars in binary systems to mass measurements of 90 neutron stars, we find that the birth masses of neutron stars can be described by a unimodal distribution that smoothly turns on at $1.1 M_{\odot}$, peaks at $1.27 M_{\odot}$, before declining as a steep power law. Such a ``turn-on" power-law distribution is strongly favoured against the widely-adopted empirical double-Gaussian model at the $3 \sigma$ level. The power-law shape may be inherited from the initial mass function of massive stars, but the relative dearth of massive neutron stars implies that single stars with initial masses greater than $\approx 18 M_{\odot}$ do not form neutron stars, in agreement with the absence of massive red supergiant progenitors to supernovae.</description>

      <title>Ultraluminous X-ray sources in Globular Clusters</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the formation, populations, and evolutionary paths of UltraLuminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) within Globular Clusters (GCs). ULXs, characterised by their extreme X-ray luminosities, present a challenge to our understanding of accretion physics and compact object formation. While previous studies have largely focused on field populations, this research examines the unique environment of GCs, where dynamical interactions play a significant role. Using the MOCCA Monte Carlo code, we explore how dynamics influences ULX populations within these dense stellar clusters.
  Our findings reveal that dynamical processes, such as binary hardening and exchanges, can both facilitate and impede ULX formation in GCs. The study explores the impact of parameters including the initial binary fraction, tidal filling, and multiple stellar populations on the evolution of ULXs. We find that non-tidally filling clusters exhibit significantly larger ULX populations compared to tidally filling ones.
  The results indicate that the apparent scarcity of ULXs in GCs may be related to the older stellar populations of GCs relative to the field. Furthermore, the study identifies a population of "escaper" ULXs, which originate in GCs but are ejected and emit X-rays outside the cluster. These escapers may significantly contribute to the observed field ULX population.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional core-collapse supernova models with phenomenological treatment of neutrino flavor conversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform three-dimensional supernova simulations with a phenomenological treatment of neutrino flavor conversions. We show that the explosion energy can increase to as high as ~10^51 erg depending on the critical density for the onset of flavor conversions, due to a significant enhancement of the mean energy of electron antineutrinos. Our results confirm previous studies showing such energetic explosions, but for the first time in three-dimensional configurations. In addition, we predict neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from a nearby supernova explosion aided by flavor conversions. We find that the neutrino event number decreases because of the reduced flux of heavy-lepton neutrinos. In order to detect GWs, next-generation GW telescopes such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope are needed even if the supernova event is located at the Galactic center. These findings show that the neutrino flavor conversions can significantly change supernova dynamics and highlight the importance of further studies on the quantum kinetic equations to determine the conditions of the conversions and their asymptotic states.</description>

      <title>Cascaded Gamma-ray Emission Associated with the KM3NeT Ultra-High-Energy Event KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A neutrino-like event with an energy of $\sim 220 \,{\rm PeV}$ was recently detected by the KM3NeT/ARCA telescope. If this neutrino comes from an astrophysical source, or from the interaction of an ultra-high-energy cosmic ray in the intergalactic medium, the ultra-high-energy gamma rays that are co-produced with the neutrinos will scatter with the extragalactic background light, producing an electromagnetic cascade and resulting in emission at GeV-to-TeV energies. In this paper, we compute the gamma-ray flux from this neutrino source considering various source distances and strengths of the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF). We find that the associated gamma-ray emission could be observed by existing imaging air cherenkov telescopes and air shower gamma-ray observatories, unless the strength of the IGMF is $B\gtrsim 3\times 10^{-13}$ G, or the ultra-high-energy gamma-rays are attenuated inside of the source itself. In the latter case, this source is expected to be radio-loud.</description>

      <title>Detection of molecular clouds in the PeVatron candidate source LHAASO J0341$+$5258 by the Nobeyama 45-m radio telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a new CO observation survey of LHAASO J0341$+$5258 using the Nobeyama Radio Observatory (NRO) 45-m telescope. LHAASO J0341$+$5258 is one of the unidentified ultra-high-energy (UHE; E $&gt;$100 TeV) gamma-ray sources detected by LHAASO. Our CO observations were conducted in February and March 2024, with a total observation time of 36 hours, covering the LHAASO source ($\sim$0.3-0.5 degrees in radius) and its surrounding area (1$\times$1.5 degrees). Within the LHAASO source extent, we identified five compact ($&lt;$ 2 pc) molecular clouds at nearby distances ($&lt;$ 1-4 kpc). These clouds can serve as proton-proton collision targets, producing hadronic gamma rays via neutral pion decays. Based on the hydrogen densities (700-5000 cm$^{-3}$) estimated from our CO observations and archived HI data from the DRAO survey, we derived the total proton energy of $W_p$ (E $&gt;$ 1 TeV) $\sim$ 10$^{45}$ erg to account for the gamma-ray flux. One of the molecular clouds appears to be likely associated with an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star with an extended CO tail, which may indicate some particle acceleration activities. However, the estimated maximum particle energy below 100 TeV makes the AGB-like star unlikely to be a PeVatron site. We conclude that the UHE emission observed in LHAASO J0341$+$5258 could be due to hadronic interactions between the newly discovered molecular clouds and TeV-PeV protons originating from a distant SNR or due to leptonic emission from a pulsar wind nebula candidate, which is reported in our companion X-ray observation paper (DiKerby et al. 2025).</description>

      <title>Discovery of 15 new pulsars at high Galactic Latitudes with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery and timing results of 15 pulsars discovered in a high Galactic latitude survey conducted with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). The survey targeted a region as close as possible to the Galactic Center, encompassing an area near the Galactic Bulge. The newly discovered pulsars consist of eleven normal pulsars and four millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Among the MSPs, three are identified in binary systems with orbital periods of ~3.1, 4.6 and 12.5 days, respectively. We have successfully obtained coherent timing solutions for three of the normal pulsars (PSRs J1745-0059, J1746-0156 and J1800-0059). Furthermore, within our data set we found that four pulsars (three new and one known) show mode-changing and/or subpulse drifting phenomena. Comparing our discoveries with simulations of the Galactic disk and Bulge MSP populations indicates that these new pulsars are most likely located in the disk. Nonetheless, our discoveries demonstrate that deep surveys at high Galactic latitudes have significant potential to enhance our understanding of the MSP population in the direction of the Bulge.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength study for gamma-ray nova V1405 Cas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novae are found to have GeV to TeV gamma-ray emission, which reveals the shock acceleration from the white dwarfs. Recently, V1405 Cas was reported to radiated suspicious gamma-ray by \textit{Fermi}-LAT with low significance ($4.1 \sigma$) after the optical maximum. Radio observations reveal that it is one of the five brightest novae surrounded by low-density ionized gas columns. Here we report continuous search for GeV gamma-ray from \textit{Fermi}-LAT. No gamma-ray were found. For V1405 Cas, the flux level is lower than other well-studied \textit{Fermi} novae, and the gamma-ray maximum appear at $t_{0} + 145$ d. Gamma-ray of V1405 Cas are used to search potential gamma-ray periodicity. No gamma-ray periodicity was found during the time of observation. By comparing multi-wavelength data, the gamma-ray upper limit to optical flux ratio with value at around $10^{-4}$ is obtained to constrain the shock acceleration. Long-term analysis from \textit{Swift}-XRT gets X-ray spectral in the post-shock phase, which indicates that V1405 Cas became a super-soft source. The best-fit black body temperature at the super soft state is 0.11 - 0.19 keV.</description>

      <title>Unraveling alignment pattern in high-energy particles via transverse momentum disbalance analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06114v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hypothesis of the relation between strong azimuthal correlations, known as alignment, in families of hadrons and photons observed in cosmic ray experiments and the selection procedure of the highest-energy particles together with the transverse momentum conservation are tested in the framework of the HYDJET++ model. The results show that the high degree of alignment can appear in nucleus-nucleus interactions at reasonable values of the transverse momentum disbalance of most energetic detected particles.</description>
