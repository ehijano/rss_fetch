      <title>MEmilio -- A high performance Modular EpideMIcs simuLatIOn software for multi-scale and comparative simulations of infectious disease dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epidemic and pandemic preparedness with rapid outbreak response rely on timely, trustworthy evidence. Mathematical models are crucial for supporting timely and reliable evidence generation for public health decision-making with models spanning approaches from compartmental and metapopulation models to detailed agent-based simulations. Yet, the accompanying software ecosystem remains fragmented across model types, spatial resolutions, and computational targets, making models harder to compare, extend, and deploy at scale. Here we present MEmilio, a modular, high-performance framework for epidemic simulation that harmonizes the specification and execution of diverse dynamic epidemiological models within a unified and harmonized architecture. MEmilio couples an efficient C++ simulation core with coherent model descriptions and a user-friendly Python interface, enabling workflows that run on laptops as well as high-performance computing systems. Standardized representations of space, demography, and mobility support straightforward adaptations in resolution and population size, facilitating systematic inter-model comparisons and ensemble studies. The framework integrates readily with established tools for uncertainty quantification and parameter inference, supporting a broad range of applications from scenario exploration to calibration. Finally, strict software-engineering practices, including extensive unit and continuous integration testing, promote robustness and minimize the risk of errors as the framework evolves. By unifying implementations across modeling paradigms, MEmilio aims to lower barriers to reuse and generalize models, enable principled comparisons of implicit assumptions, and accelerate the development of novel approaches that strengthen modeling-based outbreak preparedness.</description>

      <title>Fast Evaluation of Truncated Neumann Series by Low-Product Radix Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Truncated Neumann series $S_k(A)=I+A+\cdots+A^{k-1}$ are used in
  approximate matrix inversion and polynomial preconditioning. In dense
  settings, matrix-matrix products dominate the cost of evaluating $S_k$.
  Naive evaluation needs $k-1$ products, while splitting methods reduce this
  to $O(\log k)$. Repeated squaring, for example, uses $2\log_2 k$
  products, so further gains require higher-radix kernels that extend the
  series by $m$ terms per update. Beyond the known radix-5 kernel, explicit
  higher-radix constructions were not available, and the existence of exact
  rational kernels was unclear.
  We construct radix kernels for $T_m(B)=I+B+\cdots+B^{m-1}$ and use them to
  build faster series algorithms. For radix 9, we derive an exact 3-product
  kernel with rational coefficients, which is the first exact construction
  beyond radix 5. This kernel yields $5\log_9 k=1.58\log_2 k$ products, a
  21% reduction from repeated squaring. For radix 15, numerical optimization
  yields a 4-product kernel that matches the target through degree 14 but
  has nonzero spillover (extra terms) at degrees $\ge 15$. Because spillover
  breaks the standard telescoping update, we introduce a residual-based
  radix-kernel framework that accommodates approximate kernels and retains
  coefficient $(\mu_m+2)/\log_2 m$. Within this framework, radix 15 attains
  $6/\log_2 15\approx 1.54$, the best known asymptotic rate. Numerical
  experiments support the predicted product-count savings and associated
  runtime trends.</description>

      <title>Systematic Analysis of Penalty-Optimised Illumination Design for Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing via the Extendable Framework TVAM AID Using the Core Imaging Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing(TVAM) is a novel manufacturing method that allows for the fast creation of objects of complex geometry in layerless fashion. The process is based on the solidification of photopolymer that occurs when a sufficient threshold dose of light-energy is absorbed. In order to create complex shapes, an illumination plan must be designed to force solidification in some desired areas while leaving other regions liquid. Determining an illumination plan can be considered as an optimisation problem where a variety of objective functionals (penalties) can be used. This work considers a selection of penalty functions and their impact on selected printing metrics; linking the shape of penalty functions to ranges of light-energy dose levels in in-part regions that should be printed and out-of-part regions that should remain liquid. Further, the threshold parameters that are typically used to demarcate minimum light-energy for in-part regions and maximum light-energy for out-of-part regions are investigated systematically as design parameters on both existing and new methods. This enables the characterisation of their effects on some selected printing metrics as well as informed selection for default values. This work is underpinned by a reproducible and extensible framework, TVAM Adaptive Illumination Design(TVAM AID), which makes use of the open-source Core Imaging Library(CIL) that is designed for tomographic imaging with an emphasis on reconstruction. The foundation of TVAM AID which is presented here can hence be easily enhanced by existing functionality in CIL thus lowering the barrier to entry and encouraging use of strategies that already exist for reconstruction optimisation.</description>
