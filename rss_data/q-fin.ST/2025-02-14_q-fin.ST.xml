      <title>Quantifying Cryptocurrency Unpredictability: A Comprehensive Study of Complexity and Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper offers a thorough examination of the univariate predictability in cryptocurrency time-series. By exploiting a combination of complexity measure and model predictions we explore the cryptocurrencies time-series forecasting task focusing on the exchange rate in USD of Litecoin, Binance Coin, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. On one hand, to assess the complexity and the randomness of these time-series, a comparative analysis has been performed using Brownian and colored noises as a benchmark. The results obtained from the Complexity-Entropy causality plane and power density spectrum analysis reveal that cryptocurrency time-series exhibit characteristics closely resembling those of Brownian noise when analyzed in a univariate context. On the other hand, the application of a wide range of statistical, machine and deep learning models for time-series forecasting demonstrates the low predictability of cryptocurrencies. Notably, our analysis reveals that simpler models such as Naive models consistently outperform the more complex machine and deep learning ones in terms of forecasting accuracy across different forecast horizons and time windows. The combined study of complexity and forecasting accuracies highlights the difficulty of predicting the cryptocurrency market. These findings provide valuable insights into the inherent characteristics of the cryptocurrency data and highlight the need to reassess the challenges associated with predicting cryptocurrency's price movements.</description>

      <title>The Efficient Tail Hypothesis: An Extreme Value Perspective on Market Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In econometrics, the Efficient Market Hypothesis posits that asset prices reflect all available information in the market. Several empirical investigations show that market efficiency drops when it undergoes extreme events. Many models for multivariate extremes focus on positive dependence, making them unsuitable for studying extremal dependence in financial markets where data often exhibit both positive and negative extremal dependence. To this end, we construct regular variation models on the entirety of $\mathbb{R}^d$ and develop a bivariate measure for asymmetry in the strength of extremal dependence between adjacent orthants. Our directional tail dependence (DTD) measure allows us to define the Efficient Tail Hypothesis (ETH) -- an analogue of the Efficient Market Hypothesis -- for the extremal behaviour of the market. Asymptotic results for estimators of DTD are described, and we discuss testing of the ETH via permutation-based methods and present novel tools for visualization. Empirical study of China's futures market leads to a rejection of the ETH and we identify potential profitable investment opportunities. To promote the research of microstructure in China's derivatives market, we open-source our high-frequency data, which are being collected continuously from multiple derivative exchanges.</description>
