      <title>The Cosmic Microwave Background: Spectral Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) traveled the cosmos long before it reached our telescopes today. Consequently, it is one of the best probes of fundamental processes in the early Universe that we could hope to observe. The cosmological information is encoded in two distinct ways. First, we can investigate how the CMB photons in one sky-direction are distributed across energy by focusing on information carried by the CMB frequency spectrum. Second, we can compare the flux of CMB photons that we receive from different directions, this time at a fixed frequency, to study the CMB anisotropies. In the past six decades since the serendipitous discovery of the CMB in 1965, cosmologists have advanced both frontiers in terms of theory and observation. In this chapter, I will give a broad-brush overview about how the CMB spectrum forms and evolves throughout cosmic history, mentioning CMB anisotropies only on the side. I will attempt to highlight some of the key theoretical ingredients that allowed us to establish the detailed picture of the Universe we have today. With this, I hope to convince you that, beyond the impressive past successes, the CMB still holds many treasures for us, and will keep generations of scientists busy for the decades to come.</description>

      <title>Press-Schechter Formalism and The PBH Mass Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the primordial black hole (PBH) mass function using the Press-Schechter formalism, particularly using the excursion set approach, which is a powerful statistical method for obtaining the mass functions and modeling the formation of PBHs in the early universe by invoking the concepts like random walks. The excursion set formalism provides a framework for calculating the mass function by tracking the evolution of density fluctuations in the primordial universe and their subsequent collapse into PBHs uponcrossing critical barriers. By applying this theory, we compute the PBH mass function and explore its dependence on key parameters such as the peak mass,standard deviation, and initial PBH fraction. We also incorporate the effects of observational constraints, including microlensing and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements, to place limits on the PBH population across different mass ranges. Our results offer important insights into the role of PBHs as potential dark matter candidates and their contribution to the overall matter content in the universe. The derived mass function provides a basis for further exploration of PBH formation, growth, and their possible detection through gravitational waves and other cosmological signatures.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 2. Code &amp; Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To unlock the vast potential of the CMB trispectrum, we require both robust estimators and efficient computational tools. In this work, we introduce the public code PolySpec: a suite of quartic estimators designed to measure the amplitudes of a wide variety of inflationary templates, including local non-Gaussianity, effective field theory models, direction-dependent trispectra, spinning massive particle exchange, and weak gravitational lensing. PolySpec includes a python/cython implementation of each estimator derived in Paper 1 and has been carefully optimized to ensure efficient use of computational resources. We perform a broad range of validation tests, which demonstrate that the estimator is unbiased and minimum-variance, both in Gaussian and non-Gaussian regimes. In addition, we forecast constraints on various types of trispectra; this highlights the utility of CMB polarization and demonstrates that many models of primordial physics are poorly correlated with the simple templates considered in previous studies. This work lays the foundation for the Planck trispectrum analyses performed in Paper 3.</description>

      <title>JAGB 2.0: Improved Constraints on the J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch-based Hubble Constant from an Expanded Sample of JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) is an overdensity of stars in the near-infrared, attributed to carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars, and recently used as a standard candle for measuring extragalactic distances and the Hubble constant. Using JWST in Cycle 2, we extend JAGB measurements to 6 hosts of 9 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) (NGC 2525, NGC 3147, NGC 3370, NGC 3447, NGC 5468, and NGC 5861), with two at $D \sim 40$ Mpc, all calibrated by the maser host NGC 4258. We investigate the effects of incompleteness and find that we are unable to recover a robust JAGB measurement in one of the two most distant hosts at $R \sim 40$ Mpc, NGC 3147. We compile all JWST JAGB observations in SNe Ia hosts, 15 galaxies hosting 18 SNe Ia, from the SH0ES and CCHP programs and employ all literature measures (mode, mean, median, model). We find no significant mean difference between these distances and those from HST Cepheids, $-0.03\pm0.02$ (stat) $\pm$ 0.05 (sys) mag. We find a difference of 0.11 $\pm$ 0.02 mag between JAGB mode measurements in the CCHP analyses of two fields in NGC 4258, a feature also seen in two SH0ES fields (see field-to-field variations in Li et al. 2024a), indicating significant field-to-field variation of JAGB measurements in NGC 4258 which produce a large absolute calibration uncertainty. Variations are also seen in the shape of the JAGB LF across galaxies so that different measures produce different values of the Hubble constant. We look for but do not (yet) find a standardizing relation between JAGB LF skew or color dependence and the apparent variation. Using the middle result of all JAGB measures to calibrate SNe Ia yields a Hubble constant of $H_0$ = 73.3 $\pm$ 1.4 (stat) $\pm$ 2.0 (sys) km/s/Mpc with the systematic dominated by apparent differences across NGC 4258 calibrating fields or their measures.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Mass Constraints from kSZ Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We forecast neutrino mass constraints using Stage IV CMB and large-scale structure surveys, focusing on kSZ tomography as an independent probe of the growth of cosmic structure. We take into account several realistic factors, including the kSZ optical depth degeneracy. Our baseline setup consists of CMB S4 temperature and polarization (but not lensing) information, DESI BAO, the LSST galaxy power spectrum, and a Planck like $\tau$ prior, yielding $\sigma(\sum m_\nu) = 32\, \rm{meV}$. Adding kSZ tomography improves this by a few percent, while a kSZ optical depth prior can push this improvement to over $15\%$, giving $\sigma(\sum m_\nu) = 27\, \rm{meV}$. When CMB lensing is included in the baseline setup, kSZ does not further improve neutrino mass constraints. We find promising prospects for a scenario combining futuristic CMB and galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Inference with Cosmic Voids and Neural Network Emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic Voids are a promising probe of cosmology for spectroscopic galaxy surveys due to their unique response to cosmological parameters. Their combination with other probes promises to break parameter degeneracies. Due to simplifying assumptions, analytical models for void statistics are only representative of a subset of the full void population. We present a set of neural-based emulators for void summary statistics of watershed voids, which retain more information about the full void population than simplified analytical models. We build emulators for the void size function and void density profiles traced by the halo number density using the Quijote suite of simulations for a broad range of the $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ parameter space. The emulators replace the computation of these statistics from computationally expensive cosmological simulations. We demonstrate the cosmological constraining power of voids using our emulators, which offer orders-of-magnitude acceleration in parameter estimation, capture more cosmological information compared to analytic models, and produce more realistic posteriors compared to Fisher forecasts. We find that the parameters $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ in this Quijote setup can be recovered to $14.4\%$ and $8.4\%$ accuracy respectively using void density profiles; including the additional information in the void size function improves the accuracy on $\sigma_8$ to $6.8\%$. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach to two important variables in the underlying simulations, the resolution, and the inclusion of baryons. We find that our pipeline is robust to variations in resolution, and we show that the posteriors derived from the emulated void statistics are unaffected by the inclusion of baryons with the Magneticum hydrodynamic simulations. This opens up the possibility of a baryon-independent probe of the large-scale structure.</description>

      <title>Black Holes and Higgs Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes, dark energy, and the Higgs field are all currently established, exciting, and mysterious, each in its own way. Cosmological data show that dark energy may evolve with time. The electroweak phase transition during stellar collapse can provide a mechanism via the Higgs field for dark energy to be trapped inside black holes at the time of their formation. Using the Oppenheimer-Snyder model of collapse, we calculate the total matter and dark energy densities in a black hole, to be in the ratio of 2 to 1 at the start of collapse. The solution for the scale factor a(t) is a cycloid with a collapse time of 57 \mu s. If black holes are cosmologically coupled and grow in mass as the universe expands, they can account for the evolution and quantity of the dark energy of the universe.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmic distance duality relation using Type Ia supernovae and BAO observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to utilize the observed ratio of spherically-averaged distance to the sound horizon scale from Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data to test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by comparing the luminosity distances (LDs) obtained from Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) observations with angular diameter distances (ADDs) derived from these ratio measurements, using a cosmological-model-independent method. To match the LDs with the ADDs at the identical redshifts, we employ two methods: a compressed form of the Pantheon sample and a hybrid approach that combines the binning method with an artificial neural network (ANN). The Hubble parameter $H(z)$ at any redshift is reconstructed from the observed Hubble parameter data with the ANN to derive the ADD. To avoid potential biases resulted from the specific prior values of the absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ of SNIa and the sound horizon scale $r_{\rm d}$ from BAO measurements, we introduce the fiducial parameter $\kappa\equiv10^{M_{\rm B} \over 5}\, r_{\rm d}^{3 \over 2} $ and marginalize their impacts by treating them as nuisance parameters with flat prior distributions in our statistical analysis. Subsequently, we update the measurements of ratio of the transverse comoving distance to the sound horizon scale from the latest BAO data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration for CDDR testing. Our results indicate that BAO observation provides a powerful tool for testing the CDDR, independent of both the absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ and sound horizon scale $r_{\rm d}$, as well as any cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Little ado about everything II: an `emergent' dark energy from structure formation to rule cosmic tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [abridged] The $\eta$CDM framework is a new cosmological model aimed to cure some drawbacks of the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario, such as the origin of the accelerated expansion at late times, the cosmic tensions, and the violation of the cosmological principle due to the progressive development of inhomogeneous/anisotropic conditions in the Universe during structure formation. To this purpose, the model adopts a statistical perspective envisaging a stochastic evolution of large-scale patches in the Universe with typical sizes $10-50\, h^{-1}$ Mpc, which is meant to describe the complex gravitational processes leading to the formation of the cosmic web. The stochasticity among different patches is technically rendered via the diverse realizations of a multiplicative noise term (`a little ado') in the cosmological equations, and the overall background evolution of the Universe is then operationally defined as an average over the patch ensemble. In this paper we show that such an ensemble-averaged evolution in $\eta$CDM can be described in terms of a spatially flat cosmology and of an `emergent' dark energy with a time-dependent equation of state, able to originate the cosmic acceleration with the right timing and to solve the coincidence problem. Then we test the $\eta$CDM model against the most recent supernova type-I$a$, baryon acoustic oscillations and structure growth rate datasets, finding an excellent agreement. Remarkably, we demonstrate that $\eta$CDM is able to alleviate simultaneously both the $H_0$ and the $f\sigma_8$ tensions. Finally, we discuss that the Linders' diagnostic test could be helpful to better distinguish $\eta$CDM from the standard scenario in the near future via upcoming galaxy redshift surveys at intermediate redshifts such as those being conducted by the Euclid mission.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the shape of the non-linear matter power spectrum using CMB lensing and cosmic shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconstruct the non-linear matter power spectrum $P(k)$ using a joint analysis of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and lensing of galaxies. This reconstruction is motivated by the $S_8$ tension between early-universe CMB predictions and late-time observables. We use CMB lensing data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope DR6 and cosmic shear data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 release to perform a gravity-only (i.e. no baryonic feedback) fit to $P(k)$ in bins of wave-number, within $\rm{\Lambda CDM}$. We find that with DES cosmic shear data alone, $P(k)$ departs from the early-universe CMB prediction on all scales. The joint fit with CMB lensing is consistent on large scales $k&lt;0.2 \;{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ but shows a $\sim 2 \sigma$ deviation from scale-independence when extending to $k = 10 \;h/\mathrm{Mpc}$. We compare our agnostic $P(k)$ reconstruction to baryonic feedback models and non-standard dark matter models: reasonable variations of both scenarios can recover the shape and amplitude of the suppression. We discuss the advances needed to disentangle these physical effects with a full mapping of $P(k,z)$.</description>

      <title>A comparison of the turbulent dynamo in weakly-collisional and collisional plasmas: from subsonic to supersonic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weakly-collisional plasmas, such as the solar wind or the intra-cluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, evolve in the presence of dynamically strong magnetic fields. The turbulent dynamo can amplify magnetic fields to such levels by converting turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic energy. While extensively studied in collisional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, the weakly-collisional regime has only been explored recently. Here, we determine the properties of the weakly-collisional turbulent dynamo in the exponential ``kinematic" growth phase in both the subsonic and the previously unexplored supersonic regime of turbulence, using hybrid particle-in-cell (HPIC) and MHD simulations. We conduct a large parameter study, fixing the magnetic Reynolds number, Rm = 500, and the initial ratio of the magnetic to kinetic energy, $(E_{\rm{mag}}/E_{\rm{kin}})_{0} = 10^{-10}$, and then vary the kinetic Reynolds number, Re = 500, 50, and 5, for the MHD simulations. In the HPIC runs, only Rm = 500 is controlled, while Re emerges self-consistently from wave-particle interactions. We find that the velocity and magnetic field structures, probability distribution functions, and power spectra of the HPIC runs are similar to that of the MHD dynamo with Re ~ 50-500 and Re ~ 500 in the subsonic and supersonic regimes, respectively. Using MHD scaling relations, we infer $\text{Re}_{\rm inferred}=480^{+170}_{-250}$ and $690^{+360}_{-360}$ in the subsonic and supersonic weakly-collisional plasma, respectively. Overall, we find that the turbulent dynamo shares similar physical properties in both weakly-collisional and collisional plasmas. Our results of the weakly-collisional turbulent dynamo may have relevant applications to the solar wind, weakly-collisional shocks, and the hot ICM.</description>

      <title>The Qz5 Survey (I): How the HI Mass Density of the Universe Evolves With Cosmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report that the neutral hydrogen (HI) mass density of the Universe ($\rho_{HI}$) increases with cosmic time since $z \sim 5$, peaks at $z \sim 3$, and then decreases toward $z \sim 0$. This is the first result of Qz5, our spectroscopic survey of 63 quasars at $z \gtrsim 5$ with VLT/X-SHOOTER and Keck/ESI aimed at characterizing intervening HI gas absorbers at $z \sim 5$. The main feature of Qz5 is the high resolution ($R \sim 7000 - 9000$) of the spectra, which allows us to (1) accurately detect high column density HI gas absorbers in an increasingly neutral intergalactic medium at $z \sim 5$ and (2) determine the reliability of previous $\rho_{HI}$ measurements derived with lower resolution spectroscopy. We find 5 intervening Damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) at $z &gt; 4.5$, which corresponds to the lowest DLA incidence rate ($0.034^{0.05}_{0.02}$) at $z \gtrsim 2$. We also measure the lowest $\rho_{HI}$ at $z \gtrsim 2$ from our sample of DLAs and subDLAs, corresponding to $\rho_{HI} = 0.56^{0.82}_{0.31} \times 10^8~$M$_{\odot}~$Mpc$^{-3}$ at $z \sim 5$. Taking into account our measurements at $z \sim 5$ and systematic biases in the DLA detection rate at lower spectral resolutions, we conclude that $\rho_{HI}$ doubles from $z \sim 5$ to $z \sim 3$. From these results emerges a qualitative agreement between how the cosmic densities of HI gas mass, molecular gas mass, and star-formation rate build up with cosmic time.</description>

Abstract: Recent radiation-thermochemical-magnetohydrodynamic simulations resolved formation of quasar accretion disks from cosmological scales down to ~300 gravitational radii $R_{g}$, arguing they were 'hyper-magnetized' (plasma $\beta\ll1$ supported by toroidal magnetic fields) and distinct from traditional $\alpha$-disks. We extend these, refining to $\approx 3\,R_{g}$ around a $10^{7}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ BH with multi-channel radiation and thermochemistry, and exploring a factor of 1000 range of accretion rates ($\dot{m}\sim0.01-20$). At smaller scales, we see the disks maintain steady accretion, thermalize and self-ionize, and radiation pressure grows in importance, but large deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium and single-phase equations of state are always present. Trans-Alfvenic and highly-supersonic turbulence persists in all cases, and leads to efficient vertical mixing, so radiation pressure saturates at levels comparable to fluctuating magnetic and turbulent pressures even for $\dot{m}\gg1$. The disks also become radiatively inefficient in the inner regions at high $\dot{m}$. The midplane magnetic field remains primarily toroidal at large radii, but at super-Eddington $\dot{m}$ we see occasional transitions to a poloidal-field dominated state associated with outflows and flares. Large-scale magnetocentrifugal and continuum radiation-pressure-driven outflows are weak at $\dot{m}&lt;1$, but can be strong at $\dot{m}\gtrsim1$. In all cases there is a scattering photosphere above the disk extending to $\gtrsim 1000\,R_{g}$ at large $\dot{m}$, and the disk is thick and flared owing to magnetic support (with $H/R$ nearly independent of $\dot{m}$), so the outer disk is strongly illuminated by the inner disk and most of the inner disk continuum scatters or is reprocessed at larger scales, giving apparent emission region sizes as large as $\gtrsim 10^{16}\,{\rm cm}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The model of vacuum energy compensation due to interaction of a scalar field $\phi$ with curvature scalar of the form $\beta R \phi^2 f(\phi) $ is proposed. It is shown that with a simple power form of $f(\phi)$ the exponential expansion, induced by vacuum energy (or what is the same by cosmological constant), is transformed into canonical cosmological evolution of the universe dominated by relativistic matter.</description>

      <title>The dispersion measure and scattering of Fast Radio Bursts: contributions from multi-components, and clues for the intrinsic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous, millisecond-duration transients that offer great potential for probing the universe, yet their physical origins remain unclear. The dispersion measure (DM) and scattering time ($\tau$) distributions provide key insights into FRBs' properties, including source population, redshift, and energy distribution. We use a simplified model of FRB source population and intrinsic Schechter function-like energy distribution, coupled with a thorough assessment of various contributors to dispersion and scattering, to replicate the joint distribution of DM and $\tau$ in the CHIME/FRB catalog. A mixed FRB source population, including both young and old progenitors, is considered. Contributions to the DM and $\tau$ from interstellar medium (ISM), circumgalactic medium (CGM) within host and foreground halos are informed by the IllustrisTNG simulation, while contributions from the Milky Way, intergalactic medium (IGM), and local environmental are estimated by updated models. Using MCMC simulations, we identify optimal model that well reproduce the DM distribution and broadly reproduce the $\tau$ distribution in the CHIME/FRB catalog. Our model suggests that the fraction of FRBs tracing star-formation rate is $\rm{f_{PSFR}=0.58^{+0.16}_{-0.27}}$, while $\rm{log_{10}E_*[erg]=42.27^{+1.17}_{-1.18}}$ and $\gamma=-1.60^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$ in the energy distribution function. Scattering predominantly arises from the circumburst medium or the ISM and CGM of hosts, which cause a DM of $\sim 10\, \rm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$. Using our optimal model, we estimate FRB redshifts with two methods: DM-only and combined DM-$\tau$. Evaluation with 68 localized FRBs reveals an RMS error $0.11-0.12$, and incorporation of $\tau$ has a minor effect. We further argue that the host galaxy properties of localized FRBs could be a potential tool to validate our model in the future.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the massive pristine, neutral gas reservoir of a remarkably bright galaxy at z = 14.179</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At cosmic dawn, the first stars and galaxies are believed to form from and be deeply embedded in clouds of dense, pristine gas. Here we present a study of the JWST/NIRSpec data of the most distant, spectroscopically confirmed galaxy observed to date, JADES-GS-z14-0 (GS-z14 for short), at $z=14.179$, combined with recent far-infrared measurements of the [OIII]-$88\mu$m and [CII]-$158\mu$m line transitions and underlying dust-continuum emission. Based on the observed prominent damped Lyman-$\alpha$ (DLA) absorption profile, we determine a substantial neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) column density, $\log (N_{\rm HI} / {\rm cm^{-2}}) = 22.27^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$, consistent with previous estimates though seemingly at odds with the dynamical and gas mass of the galaxy. Using various independent but complementary approaches, considering the implied neutral gas mass from the DLA measurement, the star-formation rate surface density, and the metal abundance, we demonstrate that the total gas mass of GS-z14 is of the order $\log (M_{\rm gas} / M_\odot) = 9.8\pm 0.3$. This implies a substantial gas mass fraction, $f_{\rm gas} \gtrsim 0.9$ and that the bulk of the interstellar medium (ISM) is in the form of HI. We show that the derived gas mass is fully consistent with the non-detection of [CII]-$158\mu$m, assuming an appropriate scaling to the neutral gas. The low dust-to-gas ratio, $A_V/N_{\rm HI} = (1.3\pm 0.6)\times 10^{-23}$\,mag\,cm$^2$, derived in the line-of-sight through the DLA further indicates that the absorbing gas is more pristine than the central, star-forming regions probed by the [OIII]-$88\mu$m emission. These results highlight the implications for far-infrared line-detection searchers attainable with ALMA and demonstrate that the bright, relatively massive galaxy GS-z14 at $z=14.179$ is deeply embedded in a substantial, pristine HI gas reservoir dominating its baryonic matter content.</description>

      <title>Exploring the link between galaxy assembly and dark matter halo assembly in IllustrisTNG: Insights from the Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employed Mutual Information (MI) analysis to investigate the relationship between galaxy properties and the assembly history of their host dark matter (DM) haloes from the IllustrisTNG simulations. Focusing on central and satellite galaxies with stellar masses between $10^{9} \, - \, 10^{11.5}\, h^{-1} M_\odot$, we examined the correlation between halo assembly time and galaxy assembly time, specific star formation rate (sSFR), color $(g-i)$, and galaxy formation efficiency $F_\star$. Our results indicate a strong correlation between $F_\star$ and the halo assembly time for low-mass central galaxies, suggesting a co-evolutionary relationship. In contrast, sSFR and color $(g-i)$ exhibit weaker correlations with halo assembly time, indicating that additional factors should influence these galaxy properties. Satellite galaxies show negligible correlation between their properties and halo assembly time, highlighting the impact of environmental processes on their evolution. We further extended our analysis to cluster observables, including the magnitude gap, the satellite richness, and the distances to the satellites. Although these cluster properties display weak overall correlations with halo assembly time, the richness consistently increases with stellar mass. This trend suggests that richness is more closely linked to formation history in more massive haloes, where satellite accretion dominates the growth of their host DM haloes. These findings establish $F_\star$ as a more sensitive indicator of halo assembly history than colour $(g-i)$, sSFR, or cluster observables, offering new insights into the complex interplay between galaxy evolution and the hierarchical growth of their host dark matter haloes.</description>

      <title>Consistency Problems of Conformal Killing Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that gravity field equations based on a tensor with rank greater than 2 have consistency problems in the sense that integration constants in the solutions, such as the parameter $m$ in the Schwarzschild metric, do not allow for an interpretation in terms of conserved quantities in the theory. The recently introduced Conformal Killing Gravity, an interesting extension of General Relativity that inherits all the solutions of the latter, and defined with a rank-3 tensor field equation that does not arise from a diffeomorphism-invariant action, is plagued with this problem. In this theory, it is not clear at all how one can define the energy and angular momentum for black hole solutions, or define the analogues of the formulas, such as the quadrupole formula, in the weak field limit for gravitational waves emitted by compact sources.</description>

Abstract: We study the background and perturbations in two classes of $k$-inflation models with the potential characterized by an inflection point. We demonstrate that these models enjoy scaling properties which could be used to redefine input parameters so that the perturbations spectra satisfy correct normalization at the CMB pivot scale. The background and perturbation equations are integrated numerically for two specific models.</description>

      <title>Galaxies in the simulated cosmic web: I. Filament identification and their properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the environment harbouring the majority of galaxies, filaments are thought to play a key role in the co-evolution of galaxies and the cosmic web. In this first part of a series to understand the link between galaxies and filaments through cosmological simulations, we address two major current obstacles on this path: the difficulty of meaningful filament identification, and their poorly constrained properties and internal structure. We use the public EAGLE and TNG100 simulations to build physically motivated filament catalogues with the DisPerSE algorithm, based on the dark matter (DM) field at redshift z = 0 and z = 2, explicitly accounting for the multi-scale nature of filaments and with careful validation of results. Filament widths, lengths, and densities vary by factors ~5-100 in both simulations, highlighting the heterogeneous nature of filaments as a cosmic environment. All filaments are relatively thin, with overdensity profiles of galaxies, DM, and gas dropping to the cosmic mean within &lt;3 Mpc from their spines. Contrary to groups and clusters, filament cores are highly substructure dominated, by as much as ~80 per cent. Filament gas maps reveal rich temperature and density structures that limit the applicability of simple cylindrically symmetric models. EAGLE and TNG100 agree that z = 2 filament spines are traced by overdense cool gas in pressure equilibrium with a &gt;10x hotter envelope. However, significant differences in detail between their predicted gas property maps imply that individual simulations cannot yet describe the baryon structure of filaments with certainty. Finally, we compare our fiducial filament network to one constructed from galaxies. The two differ in many aspects, but the distance of a galaxy to its nearest galaxy-based filament still serves as a statistical proxy for its true environment.</description>

      <title>ADF22-WEB: Detection of a molecular gas reservoir in a massive quiescent galaxy located in a $z\approx3$ proto-cluster core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the molecular gas reservoirs and dust contents in three quiescent galaxies (QGs) located in the core of the $z=3.09$ SSA22 proto-cluster. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we detect CO(3--2) emission in one galaxy, ADF22-QG1, marking the first direct detection of molecular gas in a quiescent galaxy from the early universe. The detected galaxy, ADF22-QG1, has a molecular gas mass of log$M_{\rm H_2}$/M$_\odot = 10.26 \pm 0.07$ assuming a CO-to-H$2$ conversion factor $\alpha_{\rm CO} = 4.4$ (log$M_{\rm H_2}$/M$_\odot = 9.52 \pm 0.07$ for $\alpha_{\rm CO} = 0.8$), corresponding to a gas mass fraction of $f_{\rm gas} \approx 14\%$ (2.5\%). The gas-to-dust ratio $\delta _{\rm gdr}\gtrsim170$ ($\delta_{\rm gdr}\gtrsim30$) for $\alpha_{\rm CO} = 4.4$ ($\alpha_{\rm CO} =0.8$) is also derived for the first time for a QG at the epoch. For the other two galaxies, ADF22-QG2 and ADF22-QG3, non detections of CO(3--2) emission provide upper limits, $f_{\rm gas} \approx 17\%$ (3.1\%) and $f_{\rm gas} \approx 13\%$ (2.4\%), respectively. The inferred gas-consumption history of ADF22-QG1, based on its star-formation history, suggests that (i) dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at $z = 4$--$6$ are plausible progenitors, and (ii) the cessation of gas accretion from cosmic web filaments plays an important role in their evolution to quenched systems. Furthermore, the presence of a detectable molecular gas reservoir in ADF22-QG1 indicates that additional mechanisms, such as morphological quenching, may be required to fully explain its quiescent nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our standard model of the Universe predicts the distribution of dark matter to $1\%$ at the scales needed for upcoming experiments, yet our predictions for how the luminous matter -which has interactions besides gravity- is distributed remain highly uncertain. Understanding how much gas and stars there are in the Universe and where they preferentially live is challenging, and the uncertainty affects how well we can understand the cosmological model itself. For example, it compromises our ability to tell apart different models for dark energy, the mysterious force driving the accelerated expansion of the Universe. In this Essay, I will touch upon many recent developments that suggest we will be able to overcome this limitation before data from new experiments become available. More excitingly, I will describe how our efforts to model luminous and dark matter jointly will create new possibilities for constraining the physics of supermassive black holes, galaxies, and gas over time.</description>

Abstract: We present a study of the weak lensing inferred matter profiles $\Delta\Sigma(R)$ of 698 South Pole Telescope thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect selected and MCMF optically confirmed galaxy clusters in the redshift range $0.25 &lt;z&lt; 0.94$ that have associated weak gravitational lensing shear profiles from the Dark Energy Survey. Rescaling these profiles to account for the mass dependent size and the redshift dependent density produces average rescaled matter profiles $\Delta\Sigma(R/R_\mathrm{200c})/(\rho_\mathrm{crit}R_\mathrm{200c})$ with a lower dispersion than the unscaled $\Delta\Sigma(R)$ versions, indicating a significant degree of self-similarity. Galaxy clusters from hydrodynamical simulations also exhibit matter profiles that suggest a high degree of self-similarity, with RMS variation among the average rescaled matter profiles with redshift and mass falling by a factor of approximately six and 23, respectively, compared to the unscaled average matter profiles. We employed this regularity in a new Bayesian method for weak lensing mass calibration that employs the so-called cluster mass posterior $P(M_\mathrm{200c}|\hat{\zeta}, \hat{\lambda}, z)$, which describes the individual cluster masses given their tSZE and optical observables. We validated the method using realistic mock datasets and present observable-mass relation constraints for the SPT$\times$DES sample. We present new validation tests of the observable-mass relation that indicate the underlying power-law form and scatter are adequate to describe the real cluster sample but that also suggest a redshift variation in the intrinsic scatter of the $\lambda$-mass relation may offer a better description. In addition, the average rescaled matter profiles offer high signal-to-noise ratio constraints on the shape of real cluster matter profiles, which are in good agreement with available hydrodynamical $\Lambda$CDM simulations.</description>

Abstract: We present the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) simulation with a bubble universe scenario around a rotating black hole (BH) in Kerr-AdS$_5$ spacetime to explain recently updated observations of light elements such as the primordial helium abundance. In this scenario, the geometry of the 4D-early Universe is described as a vacuum bubble that undergoes quasi-de Sitter expansion in Kerr-AdS$_5$ spacetime. We find that the BH mass and spin parameter, which show an anti-correlation against the total radiation, are important to resolve the ${}^4{\rm He}$ anomaly. The present results provide clues to finding a connection between the observed results of light-element nucleosynthesis and the scenario of the 4D-bubble universe in AdS$_5$ spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If ultralight boson fields exist, then vacuum misalignment populates them with nonzero relic abundance. For a broad range of particle mass $m$ the field condenses into fuzzy cores in massive galaxies. We use numerical simulations to test this idea, extending previous work (Blum and Teodori 2021) and focusing on ultralight dark matter (ULDM) that makes-up a subdominant fraction of the total dark matter density, consistent with observational constraints. Our simulations mimic galactic halos and explore different initial conditions and levels of sophistication in the modeling of the halo potential. For $m\sim10^{-25}$ eV ULDM cores act as approximate internal mass sheets in strong gravitational lensing, and could first be detected as an $H_0$ bias in cosmography: a scenario we dub AxionH0graphy. The mass sheet degeneracy is broken by finite core radius and by the dynamical displacement of cores from the halo center of mass, which introduce imaging distortions and restrict the $H_0$ bias limit of AxionH0graphy to $m\lesssim5\times10^{-25}$ eV. Cosmological simulations are called for to sharpen the predicted connection between the amplitude of ULDM galactic cores and the ULDM cosmological fraction.</description>

      <title>Estimating Cosmological Parameters and Reconstructing Hubble Constant with Artificial Neural Networks: A Test with covariance matrix and mock H(z)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new approach to estimate the cosmological parameters and reconstruct the Hubble constant. We reconstructed the function from observational Hub?ble data using an Artificial Neural Network. The training data we used are covariance matrix and mock H(z). With the reconstructed H(z), we can get the Hubble constant, and thus do the comparison with the CMB-based measurements. In order to constrain the cosmological parameters, we sampled data points from the reconstructed data and estimated the posterior distribution. Furthermore, we did many comparisons to test the quality of the reconstructed data. Finally, with the result of the test, we propose that the H(z) reconstructed by our artificial neural network can represent the actual distribution of the real observational data, and can be used in further cosmological research.</description>

      <title>Local Primordial Non-Gaussian Bias at the Field Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local primordial non-Gaussianity (LPNG) couples long-wavelength cosmological fluctuations to the short-wavelength behavior of galaxies. This coupling is encoded in bias parameters including $b_{\phi}$ and $b_{\delta\phi}$ at linear and quadratic order in the large-scale biasing framework. We perform the first field-level measurement of $b_{\phi}$ and $b_{\delta\phi}$ using Lagrangian bias and non-linear displacements from N-body simulations. We compare our field level measurements with universality predictions and separate universe results, finding qualitative consistency, but disagreement in detail. We also quantify the information on $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{(\mathrm{loc})}$ available in the field given various assumptions on knowledge of $b_{\phi}$ at fixed initial conditions. We find that it is not possible to precisely constrain $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{(\mathrm{loc})}$ when marginalizing over $b_{\phi} f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{(\mathrm{loc})}$ even at the field level, observing a 2-3X degradation in constraints between a linear and quadratic biasing model on perturbative field-level mocks, suggesting that a $b_{\phi}$ prior is necessary to meaningfully constrain $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{(\mathrm{loc})}$ at the field level even in this idealized scenario. For simulated dark matter halos, the pure $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{(\mathrm{loc})}$ constraints from both linear and quadratic field-level models appear biased when marginalizing over bias parameters including $b_{\phi}$ and $b_{\delta\phi}$ due largely to the $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{(\mathrm{loc})} - b_\phi$ degeneracy. Our results are an important consistency test of the large-scale bias framework for LPNG and highlight the importance of physically motivated priors on LPNG bias parameters for future surveys.</description>

      <title>Multi-axion like description of the dark sector in light of the Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local methods of direct determination of the Hubble constant and $\sigma_8$ seem to conflict with the predictions made from the cosmic microwave background and $\Lambda$CDM. We propose a proof-of-concept model that models portions of the dark sector as several coupled axion-like fields, resulting in both early and late time departures from $\Lambda$CDM. We determine that the model successfully eliminates both the Hubble and $\sigma_8$ tensions, while remaining consistent with both the DESI survey and the BAO sound horizon.</description>

      <title>Studying baryon acoustic oscillations using photometric redshifts from the DESI Legacy Imaging survey DR9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context.The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Survey DR9 (DR9 hereafter), with its extensive dataset of galaxy locations and photometric redshifts, presents an opportunity to study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) in the region covered by the ongoing spectroscopic survey with DESI.
  Aims. We aim to investigate differences between different parts of the DR9 footprint. Furthermore, we want to measure the BAO scale for luminous red galaxies within them. Our selected redshift range of 0.6 to 0.8 corresponds to the bin in which a tension between DESI Y1 and eBOSS was found.
  Methods. We calculated the anisotropic two-point correlation function in a modified binning scheme to detect the BAOs in DR9 data. We then used template fits based on simulations to measure the BAO scale in the imaging data.
  Results. Our analysis reveals the expected correlation function shape in most of the footprint areas, showing a BAO scale consistent with Planck's observations. Aside from identified mask-related data issues in the southern region of the South Galactic Cap, we find a notable variance between the different footprints.
  Conclusions. We find that this variance is consistent with the difference between the DESI Y1 and eBOSS data, and it supports the argument that that tension is caused by sample variance. Additionally, we also uncovered systematic biases not previously accounted for in photometric BAO studies. We emphasize the necessity of adjusting for the systematic shift in the BAO scale associated with typical photometric redshift uncertainties to ensure accurate measurements.</description>

      <title>Is PSR J0514$-$4002E in a PBH-NS binary?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing observations using MeerKAT of the eccentric binary millisecond pulsar, PSR J0514$-$4002E, have unveiled a companion with a mass in the mass gap, ranging from $2.09\, M_\odot$ to $2.71\, M_\odot$. This challenges conventional astrophysical scenarios for black hole formation. In this paper, we present an alternative explanation: PSR J0514$-$4002E could be in a PBH-NS binary, with the companion potentially being a primordial black hole formed during the early Universe's first-order phase transition. The associated stochastic gravitational-wave background generated during this phase transition can account for the observed signal from the pulsar timing array, and the abundance of primordial black holes is consistent with constraints from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Roles of Dark Photons in Axion-induced Electroweak Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By coupling to both the Higgs and electroweak gauge sectors, an axion can generate the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe via electroweak baryogenesis when the axion decay constant lies within the range of approximately $10^5$ and $10^7$GeV, corresponding to axion masses between the MeV and GeV scales. In this work, we explore the intriguing possibility that the axion interacts with a dark sector, particularly with dark photons through anomalous couplings. Notably, axion-coupled dark photons can play multiple roles, including $(i)$ suppressing the branching ratio of axion decay to Standard Model (SM) particles, which would otherwise conflict with the constraints from supernovae explosions, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and neutron star merger events, $(ii)$ serving as a candidate for cold dark matter if they are massive and stable, and $(iii)$ contributing to dark radiation if they are ultralight. The axion decouples from the SM thermal bath when it becomes non-relativistic, facilitating the production of dark matter dark photons through the freeze-in mechanism, while dark radiation dark photons are thermally generated prior to the electroweak phase transition.</description>

      <title>Diversity and universality: evolution of dwarf galaxies with self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter halos with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) experience a unique evolutionary phenomenon, in that their central regions eventually collapse to high density through the runaway gravothermal process after initially forming a large and low-density core. When coupled with orbital evolution, this is expected to naturally produce a large diversity in dark-matter halos' inner mass distribution, potentially explaining the diversity problem of dwarf galaxies. However, it remains unknown how the diversity in SIDM dark-matter halos propagates to the more easily observed luminous matter at the center of the halo, especially the stellar component. In this work, we use idealized N-body simulations with two species of particles (dark matter and stars) to study the response of the stellar properties of field and satellite dwarf galaxies to SIDM evolution and orbital effects on their halos. Galaxies' stellar components, including galaxy size, mass-to-light ratio, and stellar velocity dispersion, display a much larger scatter in SIDM than the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. Importantly, we find signs of universality in the evolution pathways, or "tidal tracks", of SIDM dwarf satellites, which are physically interpretable and potentially parameterizable. This type of tidal-track model can be layered onto larger-scale, cosmological simulations to reconstruct the evolution of populations of SIDM dwarfs in cases where high-resolution simulations of galaxies are otherwise prohibitively expensive.</description>

      <title>Revisiting purely kinetic k-essence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform a dynamical systems study of the purely kinetic k-essence. Although these models have been studied in the past, a full study of the dynamics in the phase space incorporating the stability conditions for theoretical consistency is lacking. Our results confirm in a very rigorous and clear way that these models i) can not explain in a unified way the dark matter and dark energy components of the cosmic fluid and ii) are not adequate to explain the existing observational evidence, in particular the observed amount of cosmic structure.</description>
