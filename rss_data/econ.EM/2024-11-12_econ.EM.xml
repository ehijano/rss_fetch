      <title>Return-forecasting and Volatility-forecasting Power of On-chain Activities in the Cryptocurrency Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the return-forecasting and volatility-forecasting power of intraday on-chain flow data for BTC, ETH, and USDT, and the associated option strategies. First, we find that USDT net inflow into cryptocurrency exchanges positively forecasts future returns of both BTC and ETH, with the strongest effect at the 1-hour frequency. Second, we find that ETH net inflow into cryptocurrency exchanges negatively forecasts future returns of ETH. Third, we find that BTC net inflow into cryptocurrency exchanges does not significantly forecast future returns of BTC. Finally, we confirm that selling 0DTE ETH call options is a profitable trading strategy when the net inflow into cryptocurrency exchanges is high. Our study lends new insights into the emerging literature that studies the on-chain activities and their asset-pricing impact in the cryptocurrency market.</description>

      <title>Beta-Sorted Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beta-sorted portfolios -- portfolios comprised of assets with similar covariation to selected risk factors -- are a popular tool in empirical finance to analyze models of (conditional) expected returns. Despite their widespread use, little is known of their statistical properties in contrast to comparable procedures such as two-pass regressions. We formally investigate the properties of beta-sorted portfolio returns by casting the procedure as a two-step nonparametric estimator with a nonparametric first step and a beta-adaptive portfolios construction. Our framework rationalize the well-known estimation algorithm with precise economic and statistical assumptions on the general data generating process and characterize its key features. We study beta-sorted portfolios for both a single cross-section as well as for aggregation over time (e.g., the grand mean), offering conditions that ensure consistency and asymptotic normality along with new uniform inference procedures allowing for uncertainty quantification and testing of various relevant hypotheses in financial applications. We also highlight some limitations of current empirical practices and discuss what inferences can and cannot be drawn from returns to beta-sorted portfolios for either a single cross-section or across the whole sample. Finally, we illustrate the functionality of our new procedures in an empirical application.</description>

      <title>Endogeneity Corrections in Binary Outcome Models with Nonlinear Transformations: Identification and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For binary outcome models, an endogeneity correction based on nonlinear rank-based transformations is proposed. Identification without external instruments is achieved under one of two assumptions: either the endogenous regressor is a nonlinear function of one component of the error term, conditional on the exogenous regressors, or the dependence between the endogenous and exogenous regressors is nonlinear. Under these conditions, we prove consistency and asymptotic normality. Monte Carlo simulations and an application on German insolvency data illustrate the usefulness of the method.</description>

      <title>Mining Causality: AI-Assisted Search for Instrumental Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The instrumental variables (IVs) method is a leading empirical strategy for causal inference. Finding IVs is a heuristic and creative process, and justifying its validity--especially exclusion restrictions--is largely rhetorical. We propose using large language models (LLMs) to search for new IVs through narratives and counterfactual reasoning, similar to how a human researcher would. The stark difference, however, is that LLMs can dramatically accelerate this process and explore an extremely large search space. We demonstrate how to construct prompts to search for potentially valid IVs. We contend that multi-step and role-playing prompting strategies are effective for simulating the endogenous decision-making processes of economic agents and for navigating language models through the realm of real-world scenarios. We apply our method to three well-known examples in economics: returns to schooling, supply and demand, and peer effects. We then extend our strategy to finding (i) control variables in regression and difference-in-differences and (ii) running variables in regression discontinuity designs.</description>

      <title>Robust Network Targeting with Multiple Nash Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many policy problems involve designing individualized treatment allocation rules to maximize the equilibrium social welfare of interacting agents. Focusing on large-scale simultaneous decision games with strategic complementarities, we develop a method to estimate an optimal treatment allocation rule that is robust to the presence of multiple equilibria. Our approach remains agnostic about changes in the equilibrium selection mechanism under counterfactual policies, and we provide a closed-form expression for the boundary of the set-identified equilibrium outcomes. To address the incompleteness that arises when an equilibrium selection mechanism is not specified, we use the maximin welfare criterion to select a policy, and implement this policy using a greedy algorithm. We establish a performance guarantee for our method by deriving a welfare regret bound, which accounts for sampling uncertainty and the use of the greedy algorithm. We demonstrate our method with an application to the microfinance dataset of Banerjee et al. (2013).</description>

      <title>Econometric Inference for High Dimensional Predictive Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LASSO introduces shrinkage bias into estimated coefficients, which can adversely affect the desirable asymptotic normality and invalidate the standard inferential procedure based on the $t$-statistic. The desparsified LASSO has emerged as a well-known remedy for this issue. In the context of high dimensional predictive regression, the desparsified LASSO faces an additional challenge: the Stambaugh bias arising from nonstationary regressors. To restore the standard inferential procedure, we propose a novel estimator called IVX-desparsified LASSO (XDlasso). XDlasso eliminates the shrinkage bias and the Stambaugh bias simultaneously and does not require prior knowledge about the identities of nonstationary and stationary regressors. We establish the asymptotic properties of XDlasso for hypothesis testing, and our theoretical findings are supported by Monte Carlo simulations. Applying our method to real-world applications from the FRED-MD database -- which includes a rich set of control variables -- we investigate two important empirical questions: (i) the predictability of the U.S. stock returns based on the earnings-price ratio, and (ii) the predictability of the U.S. inflation using the unemployment rate.</description>
