      <title>Pattern Formation in Agent-Based and PDE Models for Evolutionary Games with Payoff-Driven Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial structure can play an important role in the evolution of cooperative behavior and the achievement of collective success of a population. In this paper, we explore the role of random and directed motion on spatial pattern formation and the payoff achieved by populations in both stochastic and deterministic models of spatial populations who engage in social interactions following a hawk-dove game. For the case of purely diffusive motion, both a stochastic spatial model and a partial differential equation model show that Turing patterns can emerge when hawks have a greater movement rate than doves, and in both models hawks and doves see an increase in population size and average payoff as hawk mobility increases. For the case of the payoff-driven motion, the stochastic model shows an overall decrease in population size and average payoff, but the PDE model displays more subtle behavior in this setting and will depend on the relative diffusivities of the two strategies. The PDE model also displays a biologically infeasible short-wave instability in the case of payoff-driven motion and equal diffusivities, indicating that we need to be careful about the mathematical properties of PDE models with payoff-driven directed motion and indicating potential use for nonlocal PDE models for spatial patterns in evolutionary games with directed motion.</description>

      <title>A Compartmental Model for Epidemiology with Human Behavior and Stochastic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a compartmental model for epidemiology wherein the population is split into groups with either comply or refuse to comply with protocols designed to slow the spread of a disease. Parallel to the disease spread, we assume that noncompliance with protocols spreads as a social contagion. We begin by deriving the reproductive ratio for a deterministic version of the model, and use this to fully characterize the local stability of disease free equilibrium points. We then append the deterministic model with stochastic effects, specifically assuming that the transmission rate of the disease and the transmission rate of the social contagion are uncertain. We prove global existence and nonnegativity for our stochastic model. Then using suitably constructed stochastic Lyapunov functions, we analyze the behavior of the stochastic system with respect to certain disease free states. We demonstrate all of our results with numerical simulations.</description>
