      <title>Parallel performance of shared memory parallel spectral deferred corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate parallel performance of parallel spectral deferred corrections, a numerical approach that provides small-scale parallelism for the numerical solution of initial value problems. The scheme is applied to the shallow water equation and uses an IMEX splitting that integrates fast modes implicitly and slow modes explicitly in order to be efficient. We describe parallel $\texttt{OpenMP}$-based implementations of parallel SDC in two well established simulation codes: the finite volume based operational ocean model $\texttt{ICON-O}$ and the spherical harmonics based research code $\texttt{SWEET}$. The implementations are benchmarked on a single node of the JUSUF ($\texttt{SWEET}$) and JUWELS ($\texttt{ICON-O}$) system at J\"ulich Supercomputing Centre. We demonstrate a reduction of time-to-solution across a range of accuracies. For $\texttt{ICON-O}$, we show speedup over the currently used Adams--Bashforth-2 integrator with $\texttt{OpenMP}$ loop parallelization. For $\texttt{SWEET}$, we show speedup over serial spectral deferred corrections and a second order implicit-explicit integrator.</description>

      <title>A microstructure-sensitive electro-chemo-mechanical phase-field model of pitting and stress corrosion cracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An electro-chemo-mechanical phase-field formulation is developed to simulate pitting and stress corrosion in polycrystalline materials. The formulation incorporates dependencies of mechanical properties and corrosion potential on crystallographic orientation. The model considers the formation and charging dynamics of an electric double layer through a new general boundary condition for the solution potential. The potential of the model is demonstrated by simulating corrosion in polycrystalline materials with various grain morphology distributions. The results show that incorporating the underlying microstructure yields more extensive defects, faster defect kinetics, and irregular pit and crack shapes relative to a microstructurally-insensitive homogeneous material scenario.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-high-speed Reproducing Kernel Particle Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the fast-convolving reproducing kernel particle method (FC-RKPM) is introduced. This method is hundreds to millions of times faster than the traditional RKPM for 3D meshfree simulations. In this approach, the meshfree discretizations with RK approximation are expressed in terms of convolution sums. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is then used to efficiently compute the convolutions. Certain modifications to the domain and shape functions are considered to maintain generality for complex geometries and arbitrary boundary conditions. The new method does not need to identify, store, and loop over the neighbors which is one of the bottleneck of the traditional meshfree methods. As a result, the run-times and memory allocations are independent of the number of neighbors and the shape function support size. As a model problem, the method is laid out for a Galerkin weak form of the Poisson problem with the RK approximation, and is verified in 1D, 2D, and 3D. Tables with run-times and allocated memory are presented to compare the performance of FC-RKPM with the traditional method in 3D. The performance is studied for various node numbers, support size, and approximation degree. All the implementation details and the roadmap for software development are also provided. Application of the new method to nonlinear and explicit problems are briefly discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Energy-consistent integration of mechanical systems based on Livens principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we make use of Livens principle (sometimes also referred to as Hamilton-Pontryagin principle) in order to obtain a novel structure-preserving integrator for mechanical systems. In contrast to the canonical Hamiltonian equations of motion, the Euler-Lagrange equations pertaining to Livens principle circumvent the need to invert the mass matrix. This is an essential advantage with respect to singular mass matrices, which can yield severe difficulties for the modelling and simulation of multibody systems. Moreover, Livens principle unifies both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian viewpoints on mechanics. Additionally, the present framework avoids the need to set up the system's Hamiltonian. The novel scheme algorithmically conserves a general energy function and aims at the preservation of momentum maps corresponding to symmetries of the system. We present an extension to mechanical systems subject to holonomic constraints. The performance of the newly devised method is studied in representative examples.</description>

      <title>Conversational Financial Information Retrieval Model (ConFIRM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the exponential growth in large language models (LLMs), leveraging their emergent properties for specialized domains like finance merits exploration. However, regulated fields such as finance pose unique constraints, requiring domain-optimized frameworks. We present ConFIRM, an LLM-based conversational financial information retrieval model tailored for query intent classification and knowledge base labeling.
  ConFIRM comprises two modules:
  1) a method to synthesize finance domain-specific question-answer pairs, and
  2) evaluation of parameter efficient fine-tuning approaches for the query classification task. We generate a dataset of over 4000 samples, assessing accuracy on a separate test set.
  ConFIRM achieved over 90% accuracy, essential for regulatory compliance. ConFIRM provides a data-efficient solution to extract precise query intent for financial dialog systems.</description>
