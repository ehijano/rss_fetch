      <title>On bicrossed product of fusion categories and exact factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a matched pair of fusion rings and fusion categories, generalizing the one for groups. Using this concept, we define the bicrossed product of fusion rings and fusion categories and we construct exact factorizations for them. This concept generalizes the bicrossed product, also known as external Zappa-Sz\'ep product, of groups. We also show that every exact factorization of fusion rings can be presented as a bicrossed product. With this characterization, we describe the adjoint subcategory and universal grading group of an exact factorization of fusion categories. We give explicit fusion rules and associativity constraints for examples of fusion categories arising as a bicrossed product of combinations of Tambara-Yamagami categories and pointed fusion categories. These examples are new to the best of the knowledge of the authors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Automorphism Groups of Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum automorphism group for hypergraphs, which turns out to generalize the quantum automorphism group of Bichon for classical graphs. Further, we show that our quantum automorphism group acts on hypergraph C*-algebras as recently defined. In particular, this action generalizes the one on graph C*-algebras by Schmidt-Weber in 2018.</description>

      <title>Tetrahedron equation and Schur functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tetrahedron equation introduced by Zamolodchikov is a three-dimensional generalization of the Yang-Baxter equation. Several types of solutions to the tetrahedron equation that have connections to quantum groups can be viewed as $q$-oscillator valued vertex models with matrix elements of the $L$-operators given by generators of the $q$-oscillator algebra acting on the Fock space. Using one of the $q=0$-oscillator valued vertex models introduced by Bazhanov-Sergeev, we introduce a family of partition functions that admits an explicit algebraic presentation using Schur functions. Our construction is based on the three-dimensional realization of the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra provided by Kuniba-Okado-Maruyama. Furthermore, we investigate an inhomogeneous generalization of the three-dimensional lattice model. We show that the inhomogeneous analog of (a certain subclass of) partition functions can be expressed as loop elementary symmetric functions.</description>

      <title>Torus knots and generalized Schr\"oder paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We relate invariants of torus knots to the counts of a class of lattice paths, which we call generalized Schr\"oder paths. We determine generating functions of such paths, located in a region determined by a type of a torus knot under consideration, and show that they encode colored HOMFLY-PT polynomials of this knot. The generators of uncolored HOMFLY-PT homology correspond to a basic set of such paths. Invoking the knots-quivers correspondence, we express generating functions of such paths as quiver generating series, and also relate them to quadruply-graded knot homology. Furthermore, we determine corresponding A-polynomials, which provide algebraic equations and recursion relations for generating functions of generalized Schr\"oder paths. The lattice paths of our interest explicitly enumerate BPS states associated to knots via brane constructions.</description>

      <title>Fibre functors and reconstruction of Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main objective of the present paper is to present a version of the Tannaka-Krein type reconstruction Theorems: If $F:B\to C$ is an exact faithful monoidal functor of tensor categories, one would like to realize $B$ as category of representations of a braided Hopf algebra $H(F)$ in $C$. We prove that this is the case iff $B$ has the additional structure of a monoidal $C$-module category compatible with $F$, which equivalently means that $F$ admits a monoidal section. For Hopf algebras, this reduces to a version of the Radford projection theorem. The Hopf algebra is constructed through the relative coend for module categories. We expect this basic result to have a wide range of applications, in particular in the absence of fibre functors, and we give some applications. One particular motivation was the logarithmic Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian discrete Toda chains and related lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have derived a non-abelian analog for the two-dimensional discrete Toda lattice which possesses solutions in terms of quasideterminants and admits Lax pairs of different forms. Its connection with non-abelian analogs for several well-known (1+1) and one-dimensional lattices is discussed. In particular, we consider a non-commutative analog of the scheme: discrete Toda equations $\rightarrow$ Somos-$N$ sequences $\rightarrow$ discrete Painlev\'e equations.</description>
