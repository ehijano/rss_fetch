      <title>Synchronization in the complexified Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an $N$-oscillators complexified Kuramoto model. When the coupling strength $\lambda$ is strong, sufficient conditions for various types of synchronization are established for general $N \geq 2$. On the other hand, we analyze the case when the coupling strength is weak. For $N=2$, when the coupling strength is below a critical coupling strength $\lambda_c$, we show that periodic orbits emerge near each equilibrium point, and hence full phase-locking state exists. This phenomenon significantly differentiates the complexified Kuramoto model from the real Kuramoto system, as synchronization never occurs when $\lambda&lt;\lambda_c$ in the latter. For $N=3$, we demonstrate that if the natural frequencies are in arithmetic progression, non-trivial synchronization states can be achieved for certain initial conditions even when the coupling strength is weak. In particular, we characterize the critical coupling strength ($\lambda/\lambda_c = 0.85218915...$) such that a semistable equilibrium point in the real Kuramoto model bifurcates into a pair of stable and unstable equilibria, marking a new phenomenon in complexified Kuramoto models.</description>

      <title>Measurability of Multifractal Topological Entropy and Its Role in Multifractal Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider definitions including $(q, \vartheta)$-Bowen topological entropy and $(q, \vartheta)$-packing topological entropy. We systematically explore their properties and measurability and analyze the relationship between $(q, \vartheta)$-packing topological entropy and topological entropy on level sets. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the domain of $(q, \vartheta)$-packing topological entropy encompasses the domain of the multifractal spectrum of local entropies, providing new perspectives and tools for multifractal analysis.</description>

      <title>Entropies and Pressures for Nonautonomous Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\boldsymbol{X}=\{X_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ be a sequence of compact metric spaces $X_{k}$ and $\boldsymbol{T}=\{T_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ a sequence of continuous mappings $T_{k}: X_{k} \to X_{k+1}$. The pair $(\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{T})$ is called a nonautonomous dynamical system.
  In this paper, we study measure-theoretic entropies and pressures, Bowen and packing topological entropies and pressures on $(\boldsymbol{X},\boldsymbol{T})$, and we prove that they are invariant under equiconjugacies of nonautonomous dynamical systems. By establishing Billingsley type theorems for Bowen and packing topological pressures, we obtain their variational principles, that is, given a non-empty compact subset $K \subset X_{0}$ and an equicontinuous sequence $\boldsymbol{f}= \{f_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ of functions $f_k : X_k\to \mathbb{R}$. we have that $$ P^{\mathrm{B}}(\boldsymbol{T},\boldsymbol{f},K)=\sup\{\underline{P}_{\mu}(\boldsymbol{T},\boldsymbol{f}): \mu \in M(X_{0}), \mu(K)=1\}, $$ and for $\|\boldsymbol{f}\|&lt;+\infty$ and $P^{\mathrm{P}}(\boldsymbol{T},\boldsymbol{f},K)&gt;\|\boldsymbol{f}\|$, $$ P^{\mathrm{P}}(\boldsymbol{T},\boldsymbol{f},K)=\sup\{\overline{P}_{\mu}(\boldsymbol{T},\boldsymbol{f}): \mu \in M(X_{0}), \mu(K)=1\}, $$ where $\underline{P}_{\mu} $ and $\overline{P}_{\mu} $, $P^{\mathrm{B}}$ and $P^{\mathrm{P}}$ denote measure-theoretic lower and upper pressures, Bowen and packing topological pressure, respectively. The Billingsley type theorems and variational principles for Bowen and packing topological entropies are direct consequences of the ones for Bowen and packing topological pressures.</description>

      <title>Decomposable and essentially univariate mass-action systems: Extensions of the deficiency one theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical and extended deficiency one theorems by Feinberg apply to reaction networks with mass-action kinetics that have independent linkage classes or subnetworks, each with a deficiency of at most one and exactly one terminal strong component. The theorems assume the existence of a positive equilibrium and guarantee the existence of a unique positive equilibrium in every stoichiometric compatibility class.
  In our work, we use the $\textit{monomial dependency}$ which extends the concept of deficiency. First, we provide a dependency one theorem for parametrized systems of polynomial equations that are essentially univariate and decomposable. As our main result, we present a corresponding theorem for mass-action systems, which permits subnetworks with arbitrary deficiency and arbitrary number of terminal strong components. Finally, to complete the picture, we derive the extended deficiency one theorem as a special case of our more general dependency one theorem.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning of the Evolution Operator Enables Forecasting of Out-of-Training Dynamics in Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a deep learning emulator for chaotic systems can forecast phenomena absent from training data. Using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and beta-plane turbulence models, we evaluate the emulator through scenarios probing the fundamental phenomena of both systems: forecasting spontaneous relaminarisation, capturing initialisation of arbitrary chaotic states, zero-shot prediction of dynamics with parameter values outside of the training range, and characterisation of dynamical statistics from artificially restricted training datasets. Our results show that deep learning emulators can uncover emergent behaviours and rare events in complex systems by learning underlying mathematical rules, rather than merely mimicking observed patterns.</description>

Abstract: We establish a coboundary condition for a sequence of ergodic sums (i.e.~Birkhoff partial sums) to be almost surely uniformly distributed mod $1$. Applications are given when the sequence is generated by a Gibbs-Markov map. In particular, we show that for almost every real number, the sequence of denominators of the convergents of its continued fraction expansion satisfies Benford's law.</description>

      <title>Approximation of the Koopman operator via Bernstein polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02438v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Koopman operator approach provides a powerful linear description of nonlinear dynamical systems in terms of the evolution of observables. While the operator is typically infinite-dimensional, it is crucial to develop finite-dimensional approximation methods and characterize the related approximation errors with upper bounds, preferably expressed in the uniform norm. In this paper, we depart from the traditional use of orthogonal projection or truncation, and propose a novel method based on Bernstein polynomial approximation. Considering a basis of Bernstein polynomials, we construct a matrix approximation of the Koopman operator in a computationally effective way. Building on results of approximation theory, we characterize the rates of convergence and the upper bounds of the error in various contexts including the cases of univariate and multivariate systems, and continuous and differentiable observables. The obtained bounds are expressed in the uniform norm in terms of the modulus of continuity of the observables. Finally, the method is extended to a data-driven setting through a proper change of coordinates. Numerical experiments show that the method is robust to noise and demonstrates good performance for trajectory prediction.</description>

      <title>Multiple correlations of spectra for higher rank Anosov representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe multiple correlations of Jordan and Cartan spectra for any finite number of Anosov representations of a finitely generated group. This extends our previous work on correlations of length and displacement spectra for rank one convex cocompact representations. Examples include correlations of the Hilbert length spectra for convex projective structures on a closed surface as well as correlations of eigenvalue gaps and singular value gaps for Hitchin representations. We relate the correlation problem to the counting problem for Jordan and Cartan projections of an Anosov subgroup with respect to a family of carefully chosen truncated {\it hypertubes}, rather than in tubes as in our previous work. Hypertubes go to infinity in a linear subspace of directions, while tubes go to infinity in a single direction and this feature presents a novel difficulty in this higher rank correlation problem.</description>

      <title>Refined moves for structure-preserving isomorphism of graph C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.03714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formalize eight different notions of isomorphism among (unital) graph C*-algebras, and initiate the study of which of these notions may be described geometrically as generated by moves. We propose a list of seven types of moves that we conjecture has the property that the collection of moves respecting one of six notions of isomorphism indeed generate that notion, in the sense that two graphs are equivalent in that sense if and only if one may transform one into another using only these kinds of moves.
  We carefully establish invariance properties of each move on our list, and prove a collection of generation results supporting our conjecture with an emphasis on the gauge simple case. In two of the six cases, we may prove the conjecture in full generality, and in two we can show it for all graphs defining gauge simple C*-algebras. In the two remaining cases we can show the conjecture for all graphs defining gauge simple C*-algebras provided that they are either finite or have at most one vertex allowing a path back to itself.</description>

      <title>On Milnor and Tjurina numbers of foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the Milnor and Tjurina numbers of a singular foliation $\mathcal{F}$, in the complex plane, with respect to a balanced divisor of separatrices $\mathcal{B}$ for $\mathcal{F}$. For that, we associate with $\mathcal{F}$ a new number called the $\chi$-number and we prove that it is a $C^{1}$ invariant for holomorphic foliations. We compute the polar excess number of $\mathcal{F}$ with respect to a balanced divisor of separatrices $\mathcal{B}$ for $\mathcal{F}$, via the Milnor number of the foliation, the multiplicity of some hamiltonian foliations along the separatrices in the support of $\mathcal{B}$ and the $\chi$-number of $\mathcal{F}$. On the other hand, we generalize, in the plane case and the formal context, the well-known result of G\'omez-Mont given in the holomorphic context, which establishes the equality between the GSV-index of the foliation and the difference between the Tjurina number of the foliation and the Tjurina number of a set of separatrices of $\mathcal{F}$. Finally, we state numerical relationships between some classic indices, as Baum-Bott, Camacho-Sad, and variational indices of a singular foliation and its Milnor and Tjurina numbers; and we obtain a bound for the sum of Milnor numbers of the local separatrices of a holomorphic foliation on the complex projective plane.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Imputation with Foundation Inference Models for Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) serve as models for a vast number of natural and social phenomena. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on the classical problem of imputing missing time series data, whose underlying dynamics are assumed to be determined by ODEs. Specifically, we revisit ideas from amortized inference and neural operators, and propose a novel supervised learning framework for zero-shot time series imputation, through parametric functions satisfying some (hidden) ODEs. Our proposal consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over the space of ODE solutions, observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we generate a large, synthetic dataset of (hidden) ODE solutions, along with their noisy and sparse observations. Second, a neural recognition model that is trained offline, to map the generated time series onto the spaces of initial conditions and time derivatives of the (hidden) ODE solutions, which we then integrate to impute the missing data. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) recognition model can perform zero-shot imputation across 63 distinct time series with missing values, each sampled from widely different dynamical systems. Likewise, we demonstrate that it can perform zero-shot imputation of missing high-dimensional data in 10 vastly different settings, spanning human motion, air quality, traffic and electricity studies, as well as Navier-Stokes simulations -- without requiring any fine-tuning. What is more, our proposal often outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which are trained on the target datasets.
  Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials are available online.</description>

      <title>Neural Context Flows for Meta-Learning of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02154v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) often struggle to adapt to new dynamic behaviors caused by parameter changes in the underlying physical system, even when these dynamics are similar to previously observed behaviors. This problem becomes more challenging when the changing parameters are unobserved, meaning their value or influence cannot be directly measured when collecting data. To address this issue, we introduce Neural Context Flow (NCF), a robust and interpretable Meta-Learning framework that includes uncertainty estimation. NCF uses Taylor expansion to enable contextual self-modulation, allowing context vectors to influence dynamics from other domains while also modulating themselves. After establishing theoretical guarantees, we empirically test NCF and compare it to related adaptation methods. Our results show that NCF achieves state-of-the-art Out-of-Distribution performance on 5 out of 6 linear and non-linear benchmark problems. Through extensive experiments, we explore the flexible model architecture of NCF and the encoded representations within the learned context vectors. Our findings highlight the potential implications of NCF for foundational models in the physical sciences, offering a promising approach to improving the adaptability and generalization of NODEs in various scientific applications. Our code is openly available at https://github.com/ddrous/ncflow.</description>

      <title>Constructing Linear Operators Using Classical Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a methodology for generating linear operators that approximately represent nonlinear systems of perturbed ordinary differential equations. This is done through the application of classical perturbation theory via the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e expansion, followed by an extension of the space of configuration that guarantees the linear representation of the expanded system of differential equations. To ensure that such a linear representation exists, this paper uses polynomial basis functions. Pseudo-code describing the implementation of the proposed method is listed. The method is applied to the Duffing oscillator as well as to the J2 problem, with and without atmospheric drag, both analyzed using an osculating formulation. Additionally, conditions on the osculating Keplerian elements that produce low-eccentricity frozen orbits are presented, and a modification of the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method is proposed to enable the generation of linear operators that dynamically adapt to changes in the frequency of the motion. Finally, the proposed method is compared with alternatives in the literature.</description>
