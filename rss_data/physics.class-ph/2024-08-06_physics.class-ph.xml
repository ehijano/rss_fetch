      <title>miniBLAST: a novel experimental setup for laboratory testing of structures under blast loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel experimental setup called miniBLAST, which enables systematic and repeatable laboratory tests of structures subjected to blast loads. The explosive source is based on the discharge of high electrical loads on a thin conductor, producing repeatable blast-type shock waves of controlled intensity. Conducting blast experiments under safe laboratory conditions offers significant advantages over large-scale experiments, which are expensive, require specialized personnel, are limited in number, and face repeatability issues.
  In this work, we provide a comprehensive description of the setup's design rationale and technical characteristics. Moreover, we place particular emphasis on the installation phases, safety, and metrology. The explosive source is analyzed and the signature of blast shock waves is retrieved. Finally, we present an example of a masonry wall subjected to blast loads of varying intensity. We then report its dynamic response in three dimensions and at different time instances.
  This new experimental setup offers a cost-effective, safe, and repeatable method to study structural dynamics under blast loads, with results that can be upscaled to real structures. It also aids in evaluating numerical models and lays the groundwork for further investigations into blast effects and mitigation.</description>

      <title>Magnetodynamics of few-nanoparticle chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the understanding and application of nanoparticle assemblies driven by external fields. Although these systems can exhibit marked transitions in behavior compared to non-interacting counterparts, it has often proven challenging to connect their dynamics with underlying physical mechanisms or even to verifiably establish their structure under realistic experimental conditions. We have studied colloidal iron oxide nanoparticles that assemble into ordered, few-particle linear chains under the influence of oscillating and pulsed magnetic fields. Cryo-EM has been used to flash freeze and image the structures formed by oscillatory drive fields, and magnetic relaxometry has been used to extract the multiple time constants associated with magnetic switching of the short chains. Armed with the physical structure from cryo-EM and the field-dependent switching times from magnetic measurements, we have conducted extensive micromagnetic simulations, revealing probable mechanisms for each time constant regime spanning $10^{9}$ in time and how switching develops from individual particles to entire chains. These types of magnetic nanomaterials have great potential for biomedical technologies, particularly magnetic particle imaging and hyperthermia, and rigorous elucidation of their physics will hasten their optimization.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Complexity: Machine Learning Insights into Chaotic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce new machine-learning techniques for analyzing chaotic dynamical systems. The primary objectives of the study include the development of a new and simple method for calculating the Lyapunov exponent using only two trajectory data points unlike traditional methods that require an averaging procedure, the exploration of phase transition graphs from regular periodic to chaotic dynamics to identify "almost integrable" trajectories where conserved quantities deviate from whole numbers, and the identification of "integrable regions" within chaotic trajectories. These methods are applied and tested on two dynamical systems: "Two objects moving on a rod" and the "Henon-Heiles" systems.</description>

      <title>Space-time symmetry and nonreciprocal parametric resonance in mechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear mechanical systems with time-modulated parameters can harbor oscillations with amplitudes that grow or decay exponentially with time due to the phenomenon of parametric resonance. While the resonance properties of individual oscillators are well understood, those of systems of coupled oscillators remain challenging to characterize. Here, we determine the parametric resonance conditions for time-modulated mechanical systems by exploiting the internal symmetries arising from the real-valued and symplectic nature of classical mechanics. We also determine how these conditions are further constrained when the system exhibits external symmetries. In particular, we analyze systems with space-time symmetry where the system remains invariant after a combination of discrete translation in both space and time. For such systems, we identify a combined space-time translation operator that provides more information about the dynamics of the system than the Floquet operator does, and use it to derive conditions for one-way amplification of traveling waves. Our exact theoretical framework based on symmetries enables the design of exotic responses such as nonreciprocal transport and one-way amplification in dynamic mechanical metamaterials, and is generalizable to all physical systems that obey space-time symmetry.</description>

      <title>Relativistic theory of the viscosity of fluids across the entire energy spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement mechanism of viscosity. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory provides a new analytical formula which reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with various estimates for hot dense matter and the QGP-type fluid.</description>
