      <title>A smart city model for an intelligent traffic light decision system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A smart city is a framework that uses information and communication technologies to improve public safety, quality of life, transportation and energy efficiency. A big share of these technologies has intelligent networks consisting of connected objects and devices that transmit data using wireless technology and cloud-based solutions. These technologies and their applications can receive, analyze and manage data in real-time to help citizens and municipalities make better decisions to improve quality of life. Also, pairing devices and data with already existing physical infrastructure can cut costs and significantly improve sustainability. The main focus of this work is managing traffic flows in urban transport networks regarding minimizing traffic congestion and improving air quality. The main goal of the proposed models is to provide a good starting point for the future development of smart city models and their implementation in urban areas that show significant congestion and air quality problems.</description>

      <title>A Synthetic Theory of Socio-Epistemic Structuration: Capital, Ideology, and Agency in the Age of Digital Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a synthetic theory of socio-epistemic structuration to understand the reproduction of inequality in contemporary societies. I argue that social reality is not only determined by material structures and social networks but is fundamentally shaped by the epistemic frameworks -- ideologies, narratives, and attributions of agency -- that mediate actors' engagement with their environment. The theory integrates findings from critical race theory, network sociology, social capital studies, historical sociology, and analyses of emerging AI agency. I analyze how structures (from the ``racial contract'' to Facebook networks) and epistemic frameworks (from racist ideology to personal culture) mutually reinforce one another, creating resilient yet unequal life trajectories. Using data from large-scale experiments like the Moving to Opportunity and social network analyses, I demonstrate that exposure to diverse environments and social capital is a necessary but insufficient condition for social mobility; epistemic friction, manifested as `friending bias' and persistent cultural frameworks, systematically limits the benefits of such exposure. I conclude that a public and methodologically reflexive sociology must focus on unpacking and challenging these epistemic structures, recognizing the theoretical capacity of subaltern publics (``reverse tutelage'') and developing new methods to disentangle the complex interplay of homophily, contagion, and structural causation in a world of big data.</description>

      <title>Technology innovation in evolutionary green transition: environmental quality and economic sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an evolutionary model to study the transition toward green technology under the influence of innovation. Clean and dirty technologies are selected according to their profitability under an environmental tax, which depends on the overall pollution level. Pollution itself evolves dynamically: it results from the emissions of the two types of producers, naturally decays, and is reduced through the implementation of the current abatement technology. The regulator collects tax revenues and allocates them between the implementation of the existing abatement technology and its innovation, which increases the stock of knowledge and thereby enhances abatement effectiveness. From a static perspective, we show the existence of steady states, both with homogeneous populations of clean or dirty producers and with heterogeneous populations where both technologies coexist. We discuss the mechanisms through which these steady states emerge and how they may evolve into one another. From a dynamical perspective, we characterize the resulting scenarios, showing how innovation can foster a green transition if coupled with a suitable level of taxation. At the same time, we investigate how improper environmental policies may also produce unintended outcomes, such as environmental deterioration, reversion to dirty technology, or economic unsustainability.</description>

      <title>Construct to Commitment: The Effect of Narratives on Economic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how government-led narratives through mass media evolve from construct, a mechanism for framing expectations, into commitment, a sustainable pillar for growth. We propose the "Narratives-Construct-Commitment (NCC)" framework outlining the mechanism and institutionalization of narratives, and formalize it as a dynamic Bayesian game. Using the Innovation-Driven Development Strategy (2016) as a case study, we identify the narrative shock from high-frequency financial data and trace its impact using local projection method. By shaping expectations, credible narratives institutionalize investment incentives, channel resources into R\&amp;D, and facilitate sustained improvements in total factor productivity (TFP). Our findings strive to provide insights into the New Quality Productive Forces initiative, highlighting the role of narratives in transforming vision into tangible economic growth.</description>

      <title>Ideological polarization in static networks: A multidimensional approach for opinion alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization, defined as the emergence of sharply divided groups with opposing and often extreme views, is an increasingly prominent feature of modern societies. While many studies analyze this phenomenon in the context of single issues, such as public opinion on abortion or immigration, this approach overlooks that political and social attitudes rarely develop in isolation. Instead, many issues are interconnected, shaped by overarching ideological frameworks that guide interpretations and position-taking across multiple topics. These frameworks produce coherent yet polarized worldviews that reinforce group boundaries. In this work, we propose and study a multi-topic opinion dynamics model that captures these interdependencies. Each issue is represented as a separate dimension in a shared opinion space, allowing us to model not only attitudes toward individual topics but also the structure of ideological alignment across them. A central feature is topic correlation, which enables us to explore how polarization emerges when opinions on one issue influence attitudes on others. The model also incorporates homophily, a mechanism where individuals are more likely to interact with those similar to themselves. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of the model by identifying its most relevant fixed points, supported by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. We then examine how the multidimensional opinion space shapes the emergence and stability of polarization, and apply the model to empirical data from the American National Election Studies, interpreting observed opinion patterns within our framework.</description>

      <title>A physical approach to qualia and the emergence of conscious observers in qualia space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I propose that qualia are physical because they are directly observable, and revisit the contentious link between consciousness and quantum measurements from a new perspective -- one that does not rely on observers or wave function collapse but instead treats physical measurements as fundamental in a sense resonant with Wheeler's it-from-bit. Building on a mathematical definition of measurement space in physics, I reinterpret it as a model of qualia, effectively equating the measurement problem of quantum mechanics with the hard problem of consciousness. The resulting framework falls within panpsychism, and offers potential solutions to the combination problem. Moreover, some of the mathematical structure of measurement spaces, taken for granted in physics, needs justification for qualia, suggesting that the apparent solidity of physical reality is deeply rooted in how humans process information.</description>

      <title>Mining higher-order triadic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14997v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems often involve higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have so far been mostly neglected. In this article, we propose {the Triadic Perceptron Model (TPM)} that demonstrates that triadic interactions can modulate the mutual information between the dynamical state of two linked nodes. Leveraging this result, we formulate the Triadic Interaction Mining (TRIM) algorithm to extract triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data, finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions that are often ignored, yet can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to climate.</description>
