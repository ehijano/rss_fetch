      <title>New Identity for Cayley's First Hyperdeterminant with Applications to Symmetric Tensors and Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a new formula for computing Cayley's first hyperdeterminant in terms of the Levi-Civita symbol is given. It is then shown that this formula can be used to compute the hyperdeterminant of symmetric hypermatrices in polynomial time with respect to their order (assuming fixed side length). Applications to the quantum entanglement of bosons are then discussed. Additionally, in order to obtain the fast calculation of the hyperdeterminant on symmetric hypermatrices, hypermatrix generalizations of elimination and duplication matrices are defined, and explicit formulas for them are derived in the appendix of this article.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Quantum Support Vector Classifiers and Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the performance of Quantum Support Vector Classifiers (QSVCs) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) in comparison to classical models for machine learning tasks. By evaluating these models on the Iris and MNIST-PCA datasets, we find that quantum models tend to outperform classical approaches as the problem complexity increases. While QSVCs generally provide more consistent results, QNNs exhibit superior performance in higher-complexity tasks due to their increased quantum load. Additionally, we analyze the impact of hyperparameter tuning, showing that feature maps and ansatz configurations significantly influence model accuracy. We also compare the PennyLane and Qiskit frameworks, concluding that Qiskit provides better optimization and efficiency for our implementation. These findings highlight the potential of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) for complex classification problems and provide insights into model selection and optimization strategies</description>

      <title>QGShap: Quantum Acceleration for Faithful GNN Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become indispensable in critical domains such as drug discovery, social network analysis, and recommendation systems, yet their black-box nature hinders deployment in scenarios requiring transparency and accountability. While Shapley value-based methods offer mathematically principled explanations by quantifying each component's contribution to predictions, computing exact values requires evaluating $2^n$ coalitions (or aggregating over $n!$ permutations), which is intractable for real-world graphs. Existing approximation strategies sacrifice either fidelity or efficiency, limiting their practical utility. We introduce QGShap, a quantum computing approach that leverages amplitude amplification to achieve quadratic speedups in coalition evaluation while maintaining exact Shapley computation. Unlike classical sampling or surrogate methods, our approach provides fully faithful explanations without approximation trade-offs for tractable graph sizes. We conduct empirical evaluations on synthetic graph datasets, demonstrating that QGShap achieves consistently high fidelity and explanation accuracy, matching or exceeding the performance of classical methods across all evaluation metrics. These results collectively demonstrate that QGShap not only preserves exact Shapley faithfulness but also delivers interpretable, stable, and structurally consistent explanations that align with the underlying graph reasoning of GNNs. The implementation of QGShap is available at https://github.com/smlab-niser/qgshap.</description>

      <title>Generating redundantly encoded resource states for photonic quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-based quantum computing relies on the generation of large entangled cluster states that act as a universal resource on which logical circuits can be imprinted and executed through local measurements. A number of strategies for constructing sufficiently large photonic cluster states propose fusing many smaller resource states generated by a series of quantum emitters. However, the fusion process is inherently probabilistic with a 50% success probability in standard guise. A recent proposal has shown that, in the limit of low loss, the probability of achieving successful fusion may be boosted to near unity by redundantly encoding the vertices of linear graph states using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states [Quantum 7, 992 (2023)]. Here we present a protocol for deterministically generating redundantly encoded photonic resource states using single quantum emitters, and study the impact of protocol errors and photonic losses on the generated resource states and type-II photonic fusion. Our work provides a route for efficiently constructing complex entangled photonic qubit states for photonic quantum computing and quantum repeaters.</description>

      <title>Many-body symmetry-protected zero boundary modes of synthetic photo-magnonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological classification of insulators and superconductors, the "ten-fold way", is grounded on fermionic many-body symmetries and has had a dramatic impact on many fields of physics. Therefore, it seems equally important to investigate a similar approach for bosons as tightly analogous to the fermionic prototype as possible. There are, however, several obstacles coming from the fundamental physical differences between fermions and bosons. Here, we propose a potentially optimal way forward: a theory of free boson topology (topological classification and bulk-boundary correspondence) protected by bosonic many-body symmetry operations, namely, squeezing transformations, particle number, and bosonic time reversal. We identify two symmetry classes that are topologically non-trivial in one dimension. They include key models like the bosonic Kitaev chain, protected by a squeezing symmetry within our framework, and the celebrated bosonic SSH model, protected by a squeezing symmetry and particle number. To provide a robust experimental platform for testing our theory, we introduce a new quantum meta-material: photo-magnonic crystals. They consist of arrays of interconnected photo-magnonic cavities. They are remarkable for their experimental flexibility and natural affinity for displaying band topological physics at microwave frequencies. We engineer a many-body symmetry-protected topological photo-magnonic chain with boundary modes mandated by a Pfaffian invariant. Using an electromagnetic finite-element modelling, we simulate its reflection and transmission and identify experimental signatures of its boundary modes. The experimental tuning of the crystal to its symmetry-protected topological phase is also addressed. Our modelling of the photo-magnonic chain provides a thorough blueprint for its experimental realisation and the unambiguous observation of its exotic physics.</description>

      <title>The Pound-Drever-Hall Method for Superconducting-Qubit Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling quantum computers to large sizes requires the implementation of many parallel qubit readouts. Here we present an ultrastable superconducting-qubit readout method using the multi-tone self-phase-referenced Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique, originally developed for use with optical cavities. In this work, we benchmark PDH readout of a single transmon qubit, using room-temperature heterodyne detection of all tones to reconstruct the PDH signal. We demonstrate that PDH qubit readout is insensitive to microwave phase drift, displaying $0.73^\circ$ phase stability over 2 hours, and capable of single-shot readout in the presence of phase errors exceeding the phase shift induced by the qubit state. We show that the PDH sideband tones do not cause unwanted measurement-induced state transitions for a transmon qubit, leading to a potential signal enhancement of at least $14$~dB over traditional heterodyne readout.</description>

      <title>Classical Thermometry of Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealers are emerging as programmable, dynamical experimental platforms for probing strongly correlated spin systems. Yet key thermal assumptions, chiefly a Gibbs-distributed output ensemble, remain unverified in the large-scale regime. Here, we experimentally and quantitatively assess Gibbs sampling fidelity across system sizes spanning over three orders of magnitude. We explore a wide parameter space of coupling strengths, system sizes, annealing times, and D-wave hardware architectures. We find that the naively assumed scaling law for the effective temperature requires a non-negligible, coupling-independent offset that is robust across machines and parameter regimes, quantifying residual non-thermal effects that still conform to an effective Gibbs description. These non-idealities are further reflected in a systematic discrepancy between the physical temperature inferred from the sampled ensemble and the nominal cryogenic temperature of the device. Our results systematically assess the viability of quantum annealers as experimental platforms for probing classical thermodynamics, correct previous assumptions, and provide a physically grounded thermometry framework to benchmark these machines for future thermodynamic experiments.</description>

      <title>Magic of the Well: assessing quantum resources of fluid dynamics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum resource requirements of a dataset generated from simulations of two-dimensional, periodic, incompressible shear flow, aimed at training machine learning models. By measuring entanglement and non-stabilizerness on MPS-encoded functions, we estimate the computational complexity encountered by a stabilizer or a tensor network solver applied to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations across different flow regimes. Our analysis reveals that, under specific initial conditions, the shear width identifies a transition between resource-efficient and resource-intensive regimes for non-trivial evolution. Furthermore, we find that the two resources qualitatively track each other in time, and that the mesh resolution along with the sign structure play a crucial role in determining the resource content of the encoded state. These findings offer useful guidelines for the development of scalable, quantum-inspired approaches to fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>In Situ Quantum Analog Pulse Characterization via Structured Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog quantum simulators can directly emulate time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics, enabling the exploration of diverse physical phenomena such as phase transitions, quench dynamics, and non-equilibrium processes. Realizing accurate analog simulations requires high-fidelity time-dependent pulse control, yet existing calibration schemes are tailored to digital gate characterization and cannot be readily extended to learn continuous pulse trajectories. We present a characterization algorithm for in situ learning of pulse trajectories by extending the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) framework to analyze time-dependent pulses. By combining QSP with a logical-level analog-digital mapping paradigm, our method reconstructs a smooth pulse directly from queries of the time-ordered propagator, without requiring mid-circuit measurements or additional evolution. Unlike conventional Trotterization-based methods, our approach avoids unscalable performance degradation arising from accumulated local truncation errors as the logical-level segmentation increases. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracy with strong efficiency and robustness against SPAM as well as depolarizing errors, providing a lightweight and optimal validation protocol for analog quantum simulators capable of detecting major hardware faults.</description>

      <title>Excess work in counterdiabatic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many years have passed since the conception of the quintessential method of shortcut to adiabaticity known as counterdiabatic driving (or transitionless quantum driving). Yet, this method appears to be energetically cost-free and thus continually challenges the task of quantifying the amount of energy it demands to be accomplished. This paper proposes that the energy cost of controlling a closed quantum system using the counterdiabatic method can also be assessed using the instantaneous excess work during the process and related quantities, as the time-averaged excess work. Starting from the Mandelstam-Tamm bound for driven dynamics, we have shown that the speed-up of counterdiabatic driving is linked with the spreading of energy between the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian, which is necessarily accompanied by transitions between these eigenstates. Nonetheless, although excess work can be used to quantify energetically these transitions, it is well known that the excess work is zero throughout the entire process under counterdiabatic driving. To recover the excess work as an energetic cost quantifier for counterdiabatic driving, we will propose a different interpretation of the parameters of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, leading to an excess work different from zero. We have illustrated our findings with the Landau-Zener model.</description>

      <title>Sketch Tomography: Hybridizing Classical Shadow and Matrix Product State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Sketch Tomography, an efficient procedure for quantum state tomography based on the classical shadow protocol used for quantum observable estimations. The procedure applies to the case where the ground truth quantum state is a matrix product state (MPS). The density matrix of the ground truth state admits a tensor train ansatz as a result of the MPS assumption, and we estimate the tensor components of the ansatz through a series of observable estimations, thus outputting an approximation of the density matrix. The procedure is provably convergent with a sample complexity that scales quadratically in the system size. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that the procedure outputs an accurate approximation to the quantum state. For observable estimation tasks involving moderately large subsystems, we show that our procedure gives rise to a more accurate estimation than the classical shadow protocol. We also show that sketch tomography is more accurate in observable estimation than quantum states trained from the maximum likelihood estimation formulation.</description>

      <title>Quench dynamics of the quantum XXZ chain with staggered interactions: Exact results and simulations on digital quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quench dynamics in the quantum $S=1/2$ XXZ antiferromagnetic chain with staggered and anisotropic interactions in the flat-band limit. Our quench protocol interchanges the odd- and even-bond strengths of a fully dimerized chain, enabling us to derive exact time-dependent states for arbitrary even system sizes by working in the Bell basis. We obtain closed-form, size-independent expressions for the von Neumann and second-order R\'enyi entanglement entropies. We further calculate exact Loschmidt echoes and the corresponding return rate functions across various anisotropies and system sizes, and identify Loschmidt zeros in finite chains. Our analysis reveals the precise conditions on the anisotropy parameter that govern the periodicity of the dynamical observables. In addition to the analytic study, we perform two types of numerical experiments on IBM-Q quantum devices. First, we use the Hadamard test to estimate the Bell-basis expansion coefficients and reconstruct the dynamical states, achieving accurate entanglement entropies and the Loschmidt echo for small systems. Second, we implement Trotter-error-free time-evolution circuits combined with randomized Pauli measurements. Post-processing via statistical correlations and classical shadows yields reliable estimates of the second-order R\'enyi entanglement entropy and the Loschmidt echo, showing satisfactory agreement with exact results.</description>

      <title>Hybridized-Mode Parametric Amplifier in Kinetic-Inductance Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric amplification is essential for quantum measurement, enabling the amplification of weak microwave signals with minimal added noise. While Josephson-junction-based amplifiers have become standard in superconducting quantum circuits, their magnetic sensitivity, limited saturation power, and sub-kelvin operating requirements motivate the development of alternative nonlinear platforms. Here we demonstrate a two-mode kinetic-inductance parametric amplifier based on a pair of capacitively coupled Kerr-nonlinear resonators fabricated from NbTiN and NbN thin films. The distributed Kerr nonlinearity of these materials enables nondegenerate four-wave-mixing amplification with gains approaching 40 dB, gain-bandwidth products up to 6.9 MHz, and 1-dB compression powers two to three orders of magnitude higher than those of state-of-the-art Josephson amplifiers. A coupled-mode theoretical model accurately captures the pump-induced modification of the hybridized modes and quantitatively reproduces the observed signal and idler responses. The NbN device exhibits a significantly larger Kerr coefficient and superior gain-bandwidth performance, highlighting the advantages of high-kinetic-inductance materials. Our results establish coupled kinetic-inductance resonators as a robust platform for broadband, high-power, and magnetically resilient quantum-limited amplification, offering a scalable route for advanced readout in superconducting qubits, spin ensembles, quantum dots, and other microwave-quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Engineering photonic dispersion relation and atomic dynamics in waveguide QED setup via long-range hoppings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-trivial dispersion relations engineered in photonic waveguide for the precise control of atomic dynamics has recently attracted considerable attention. Here, we study a system in which atoms are coupled to one-dimensional coupled-resonator waveguides with long-range hoppings. By carefully engineering the jth-order nearest neighbor (JNN) hoppings between resonators, we construct linear dispersion relations with the chiral characteristic. To quantify the degree of linearity, we analyze the propagation fidelities of Gaussian wave packets in these waveguides. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such coupled-resonator waveguides can serve as versatile platforms for enabling directional atomic radiation and absorption. Beyond linear dispersion relations, more general forms, including quadratic and cubic relations, can also be achieved through tailored JNN-hoppings. Our study thus provides a unified framework for simulating atom-environment couplings with arbitrary dispersion relations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Encrypted Control of Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encrypted control has been extensively studied to ensure the confidentiality of system states and control inputs for networked control systems. This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources.</description>

      <title>Beyond Lindblad Dynamics: Rigorous Guarantees for Thermal and Ground State Preservation under System Bath Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish new theoretical results demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of system bath interaction models for quantum thermal and ground state preparation. Unlike existing analyses, which relies on the weak coupling Lindblad limit and require $O(\epsilon)$ coupling strengths for $\epsilon$ accuracy, leading to slow mixing, we rigorously show that accurate state preparation remains possible far beyond this regime. In particular, even when the cumulative coupling strength remains constant rather than vanishing, the induced quantum channel still approximately fixes the target state. Our proof introduces new techniques for controlling all orders of the Dyson expansion and for analyzing the associated multidimensional operator Fourier transforms. These bounds substantially improve upon prior results, and numerical simulations on the TFIM and Hubbard models further confirm the robustness of the system bath interaction framework across both weak and strong coupling regimes.</description>

      <title>Complex Wigner entropy and Fisher control of negativity in an oval quantum billiard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a complex-entropy framework for Wigner negativity and apply it to avoided crossings in an oval quantum billiard. For a real Wigner function the Gibbs--Shannon functional becomes complex; its imaginary part, proportional to the Wigner-negative volume, serves as an entropy-like measure of phase-space nonclassicality. A sign-resolved decomposition separates the total negative weight from its phase-space distribution and defines a negative-channel Fisher information that quantifies how sensitively the negative lobe reshapes as a control parameter is varied. This structure yields a Cauchy--Schwarz bound that limits how rapidly the imaginary entropy, and hence the Wigner negativity, can change with the parameter. In the oval billiard, avoided crossings display enhanced negativity and an amplified negative-channel Fisher response, providing a clear phase-space signature of mode hybridization. The construction is generic and extends to other wave-chaotic and mesoscopic systems with phase-space representations.</description>

      <title>Edge bits in average symmetry protected topological mixed state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge bit in an average symmetry protected topological (ASPT) mixed state is studied. The state is protected by one strong $Z_2$ and one weak (average) $Z_2$ symmetries. As analogous objects of pure symmetry protected topological (SPT) states, the ASPT possesses edge bits. In particular, the analogous operator response exists, that is, symmetry fractionalization. The fractionalization preserves the presence of the ASPT in the bulk, and the fractionalized edge operators acting on the edge bits of the ASPT. %analogous to the ones in the pure SPTs. In this work, based on the cluster model and by employing Choi mapping, we discuss generic features of the edge bits and numerically clarify the behavior of the edge bits and their robustness for varying decoherence and perturbative interactions. By using an operator-space mutual information (OSMI), we track the flow of quantum correlations between the two edges. Remarkably, even in the ASPT regime, a finite portion of the initial edge-to-edge correlation survives.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hash Function Based on Spectral Properties of Graphs and Discrete Walker Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Quantum Graph Hash (QGH-256), a novel quantum spectral hashing algorithm that generates high-entropy fingerprints from message-induced graphs. Each input message is mapped to a weighted graph via a discrete random walk on an n X n toroidal grid, where the walk dynamics determine the edge weights. Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is then used to extract the phase spectrum of the graph Laplacian. Unlike standard QPE settings, the phase estimation is performed with respect to a superposition state (a uniform superposition over all node basis states) rather than an eigenvector, ensuring that all eigencomponents contribute to the resulting spectrum. This yields spectral features that distinguish even co-spectral but non-isomorphic message-induced graphs. The final spectral fingerprint is converted into a 256-bit digest, producing a compact representation of the input. As the fingerprint encodes both spectral and dynamical properties of the message-induced graph, the resulting hash exhibits strong sensitivity to input perturbations and provides a structurally rich foundation for post-quantum hashing. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we implement QGH-256 on a 4 X 4 toroidal grid, chosen empirically: smaller grids exhibit collisions, whereas larger grids significantly increase execution time. The entire pipeline is implemented in Qiskit, and we use a seeded statevector simulator to obtain stable, noise-free results.</description>

      <title>Energy-Scaled Zero-Noise Extrapolation for Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes, an approach to hardware-efficient quantum error correction, is limited by the finite squeezing capabilities of current experimental platforms. To circumvent this hardware demand, we introduce Energy-Scaled Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ES-ZNE), a quantum error mitigation protocol that uses the mean photon number of the GKP code as a tunable effective noise parameter. The protocol measures logical observables at a series of accessible finite energies and extrapolates the results to the ideal, infinite-energy limit using an ansatz based on the code's asymptotic error scaling. Through simulating a GKP qubit under a pure-loss channel, we demonstrate that ES-ZNE successfully mitigates finite-energy errors, recovering the ideal expectation values (within numerical uncertainty) in the shallow-noise regime. Furthermore, by computationally removing artifacts arising from the finite-energy encoding, our method characterizes the intrinsic performance of the ideal GKP code, revealing a sharp error threshold beyond which the code's corrective power diminishes. These results establish ES-ZNE as a practical, software-based strategy for enhancing the performance of near-term bosonic quantum processors, trading sampling overhead for demanding physical resources like high squeezing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communication protocols seek to leverage the unique properties of quantum systems for coordination or communication tasks, usually with guarantees of security or anonymity that exceed what is possible classically. One promising domain of application is elections, where strong such guarantees are essential to ensure legitimacy. We experimentally implement a recently proposed election protocol from Centrone et al. such that no one, including a potential central authority, can know the preferred candidate of any voter other than themself. We conduct a four-party election, generating and distributing four-partite GHZ states with $\approx 89\%$ fidelity and successfully recording voters' intentions $\approx 87\%$ of the time.</description>

      <title>Direct Equivalence between Dynamics of Quantum Walks and Coupled Classical Oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous time quantum walks on exponentially large, sparse graphs form a powerful paradigm for quantum computing: On the one hand, they can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer. On the other hand, they are themselves BQP-complete, providing an alternative framework for thinking about quantum computing -- a perspective which has indeed led to a number of novel algorithms and oracle problems. Recently, simulating the dynamics of a system of harmonic oscillators (that is, masses and springs) was set forth as another BQP-complete problem defined on exponentially large, sparse graphs. In this work, we establish a direct and transparent mapping between these two classes of problems. As compared to linking the two classes of problems via their BQP-completeness, our mapping has several desirable features: It is transparent, in that it respects the structure of the problem, including the geometry of the underlying graph, initialization, read-out, and efficient oracle access, resulting in low overhead in terms of both space and time; it allows to map also between restricted subsets of instances of both problems which are not BQP-complete; it provides a recipe to directly translate any quantum algorithm designed in the quantum walk paradigm to harmonic oscillators (and vice versa); and finally, it provides an alternative, transparent way to prove BQP-completeness of the harmonic oscillator problem by mapping it to BQP-completeness construction for the quantum walk problem (or vice versa).</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Computing with Fan-Out Operations and Qudits: the Case of Distributed Global Gates (a Preliminary Study)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much recent work on distributed quantum computing have focused on the use of entangled pairs and distributed two qubit gates. But there has also been work on efficient schemes for achieving multipartite entanglement between nodes in a single shot, removing the need to generate multipartite entangled states using many entangled pairs. This paper looks at how multipartite entanglement resources (e.g., GHZ states) can be useful for distributed fan-out operations; we also consider the use of qudits of dimension four for distributed quantum circuit compression. In particular, we consider how such fan-out operations and qudits can be used to implement circuits which are challenging for distributed quantum computation, involving pairwise qubit interactions, i.e., what has been called global gates (a.k.a. global M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gates). Such gates have been explored to possibly yield more efficient computations via reduced circuit depth, and can be carried out efficiently in some types of quantum hardware (e.g., trapped-ion quantum computers); we consider this as an exploration of an ``extreme'' case for distribution given the global qubit-qubit interactions. We also conclude with some implications for future work on quantum circuit compilation and quantum data centre design.</description>

      <title>Sympathetic Cooling of Levitated Optomechanics through Nonreciprocal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optomechanical cooling of levitated nanoparticles has become an essential topic in modern quantum physics, providing a platform for exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena and high-precision sensing. However, conventional cavity-assisted cooling is fundamentally constrained by cavity dissipation and environmental noise, limiting the attainable minimum temperature. In this work, we propose a non-Hermitian optomechanical cooling scheme through nonreciprocal coupling between two levitated nanoparticles, where one particle is directly cooled by an optical cavity and the other is cooled indirectly through a non-Hermitian interaction. Both analytical solutions and numerical simulations reveal that increasing nonreciprocity enhances directional energy transfer, enabling the target particle to reach a lower phonon occupation than is achievable in conventional cavity cooling. This study demonstrates a new cooling mechanism driven by non-Hermitian interactions, offering theoretical guidance for realizing controllable energy flow and deep cooling in levitated optomechanical systems, and paving the way for future developments in quantum control and sensing technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifiers of stationarity, classicality, purity and vorticity are derived from phase-space differential geometrical structures within the Weyl-Wigner framework, after which they are related to the hyperbolic stability of classical and quantum-modified Hamiltonian (non-linear) equations of motion. By examining the equilibrium regime produced by such an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations, a correspondence between Wigner flow properties and hyperbolic stability boundaries in the phase-space is identified. Explicit analytical expressions for equilibrium-stability parameters are obtained for quantum Gaussian ensembles, wherein information quantifiers driven by Wigner currents are identified. Illustrated by an application to a Harper-like system, the results provide a self-contained analysis for identifying the influence of quantum fluctuations associated to the emergence of phase-space vorticity in order to quantify equilibrium and stability properties of Hamiltonian non-linear dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental metrological limits of temperature sensing in open quantum systems remain largely unresolved, particularly regarding the role of non-Gaussian quantum resources. In this letter, we establish analytic bounds on the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for temperature estimation using non-Gaussian states undergoing dissipative bosonic evolution. By focusing on the short-time regime governed by a time-local master equation, we derive precise scaling laws that elucidate when and how non-Gaussian probes decisively outperform Gaussian states under identical energy constraints. Our analysis uncovers a distinct linear-in-time QFI enhancement unique to Fock states, in contrast to the inherently weaker, quadratic scaling of Gaussian probes. These theoretical insights are substantiated through exact numerical simulations and mapped onto experimentally accessible platforms such as circuit QED. Our results not only clarify the quantum thermometric advantage of non-Gaussianity but also chart a realistic pathway toward harnessing it in noisy quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: The Quantum Max-$d$-Cut ($d$-QMC) problem is a special instance of a $2$-local Hamiltonian problem, representing the quantum analog of the classical Max-$d$-Cut problem. The $d$-QMC problem seeks the largest eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian defined on a graph with $n$ vertices, where edges correspond to swap operators acting on $(\mathbb{C}^d)^{\otimes n}$. In recent years, progress has been made by investigating the algebraic structure of the $d$-QMC Hamiltonian. Building on this approach, this article solves the $d$-QMC problem for complete tripartite graphs for small local dimensions, $d \le 3$.</description>

      <title>Widefield Quantum Sensor for Vector Magnetic Field Imaging of Micromagnetic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many spintronic, magnetic-memory, and neuromorphic devices rely on spatially varying magnetic fields. Quantitatively imaging these fields with full vector information over extended areas remains a major challenge. Existing probes either offer nanoscale resolution at the cost of slow scanning, or widefield imaging with limited vector sensitivity or material constraints. Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond promises to bridge this gap, but a practical camera-based vector magnetometry implementation on relevant microstructures has not been demonstrated. Here we adapt a commercial widefield microscope to implement a camera-compatible pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance protocol to reconstruct stray-field vectors from microscale devices. By resolving the Zeeman shifts of the four NV orientations, we reconstruct the stray-field vector generated by microfabricated permalloy structures that host multiple stable remanent states. Our implementation achieves a spatial resolution of $\approx 0.52 ~\mu\mathrm{m}$ across an $83~\mu\mathrm{m} \times 83~\mu\mathrm{m}$ field of view and a peak sensitivity of $ (828 \pm 142)~\mathrm{nT\,Hz^{-1}}$, with acquisition times of only a few minutes. These results establish pulsed widefield NV magnetometry on standard microscopes as a practical and scalable tool for routine vector-resolved imaging of complex magnetic devices.</description>

      <title>An end-to-end quantum algorithm for nonlinear fluid dynamics with bounded quantum advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a cornerstone of classical scientific computing, and there is growing interest in whether quantum computers can accelerate such simulations. To date, the existing proposals for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for CFD have almost exclusively been based on the Carleman embedding method, used to encode nonlinearities on a quantum computer. In this work, we begin by showing that these proposals suffer from a range of severe bottlenecks that negate conjectured quantum advantages: lack of convergence of the Carleman method, prohibitive time-stepping requirements, unfavorable condition number scaling, and inefficient data extraction. With these roadblocks clearly identified, we develop a novel algorithm for the incompressible lattice Boltzmann equation that circumvents these obstacles, and then provide a detailed analysis of our algorithm, including all potential sources of algorithmic complexity, as well as gate count estimates. We find that for an end-to-end problem, a modest quantum advantage may be preserved for selected observables in the high-error-tolerance regime. We lower bound the Reynolds number scaling of our quantum algorithm in dimension $D$ at Kolmogorov microscale resolution with $O(\mathrm{Re}^{\frac{3}{4}(1+\frac{D}{2})} \times q_M)$, where $q_M$ is a multiplicative overhead for data extraction with $q_M = O(\mathrm{Re}^{\frac{3}{8}})$ for the drag force. This upper bounds the scaling improvement over classical algorithms by $O(\mathrm{Re}^{\frac{3D}{8}})$. However, our numerical investigations suggest a lower speedup, with a scaling estimate of $O(\mathrm{Re}^{1.936} \times q_M)$ for $D=2$. Our results give robust evidence that small, but nontrivial, quantum advantages can be achieved in the context of CFD, and motivate the need for additional rigorous end-to-end quantum algorithm development.</description>

      <title>Metrological Sensitivity beyond Gaussian Limits with Cubic Phase States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cubic phase states provide the essential non-Gaussian resource for continuous-variable quantum computing. We show that they also offer significant potential for quantum metrology, surpassing the phase-sensing sensitivity of all Gaussian states at equal average photon number. Optimal sensitivity requires only moderate initial squeezing, and the non-Gaussian advantage remains robust against loss and detection noise. We identify optimal measurement strategies and show that several experimentally relevant preparation schemes surpass Gaussian limits, in some cases reaching the sensitivity of cubic phase states. Our results establish cubic phase states as a promising resource for quantum-enhanced precision measurements beyond Gaussian limits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Searching for the Longest Segment and the Largest Empty Rectangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we consider the problem of searching for the Largest empty rectangle in a 2D map, and the one-dimensional version of the problem is the problem of searching for the largest empty segment. We present a quantum algorithm for the Largest Empty Square problem and the Largest Empty Rectangle of a fixed width $d$ for $n\times n$-rectangular map. Query complexity of the algorithm is $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ for the square case, and $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{d})$ for the rectangle with a fixed width $d$ case, respectively. At the same time, the lower bounds for the classical case are $\Omega(n^2)$, and $\Omega(nd)$, respectively. The Quantum algorithm for the one-dimensional version of the problem has $O(\sqrt{n}\log n\log\log n)$ query complexity. The quantum lower bound for the problem is $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ which is almost equal to the upper bound up to a log factor. The classical lower bound is $\Omega(n)$. So, we obtain the quadratic speed-up for the problem.</description>

      <title>Solution of the Electric Field Integral Equation Using a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Scheme: Investigation of Accuracy and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional classical solvers are commonly used for solving matrix equation systems resulting from the discretization of SIEs in computational electromagnetics (CEM). However, the memory requirement would become a bottleneck for classical computing as the electromagentic problems become much larger. As an alternative, quantum computing has a natural "parallelization" advantage with much lower storage complexity due to the superposition and entanglement in quantum mechanics. Even though several quantum algorithms have been applied for the SIEs-based methods in the literature, the size of the matrix equation systems solvable using them is still limited. In this work, we use a hybrid quantum-classical scheme to solve the EFIE for analyzing electromagentic scattering from three-dimensional (3D) perfect electrically conducting objects with arbitrary shapes in CEM for the first time. Instead of directly solving the original EFIE matrix equation system using the quantum algorithms, the hybrid scheme first designs the preconditioned linear system and then uses a double-layer iterative strategy for its solution, where the external iteration layer builds subspace matrix equation systems with smaller dimension and the internal iteration layer solves the smaller systems using the quantum algorithms. Two representative quantum algorithms, HHL and VQLS, are considered in this work, which are executed on the quantum simulator and quantum computer platforms. We present the theoretical time complexity analysis of the hybrid quantum-classical scheme and perform numerical experiments to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid scheme. The results show that the computational complexity of the hybrid VQLS-classical scheme is lower than the conventional fast solvers in classical computing, which indicates the hybrid scheme is more promising for analyzing large-scale electromagnetic problems.</description>

      <title>Density of states of quantum systems from free probability theory: a brief overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a brief overview of approaches for calculating the density of states of quantum systems and random matrix Hamiltonians using the tools of free probability theory. For a given Hamiltonian of a quantum system or a generic random matrix Hamiltonian, which can be written as a sum of two non-commutating operators, one can obtain an expression for the density of states of the Hamiltonian from the known density of states of the two component operators by assuming that these operators are mutually free and by using the free additive convolution. In many examples of interacting quantum systems and random matrix models, this procedure is known to provide a reasonably accurate approximation to the exact numerical density of states. We review some of the examples that are known in the literature where this procedure works very well, and also discuss some of the limitations of this method in situations where the free probability approximation fails to provide a sufficiently accurate description of the exact density of states. Subsequently, we describe a perturbation scheme that can be developed from the subordination formulas for the Cauchy transform of the density of states and use it to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the density of states in various models, such as the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensemble and the Anderson model with on-site disorder.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Impact of Device Imperfections on Electron Shuttling in SiMOS devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive theoretical and experimental work has established high-fidelity electron shuttling in Si/SiGe systems, whereas demonstrations in Si/SiO2 (SiMOS) remain at an early stage. To help address this, we perform full 3D simulations of conveyor-belt charge shuttling in a realistic SiMOS device, building on earlier 2D modelling. We solve the Poisson and time-dependent Schrodinger equations for varying shuttling speeds and gate voltages, focusing on potential pitfalls of typical SiMOS devices such as oxide-interface roughness, gate fabrication imperfections, and charge defects along the transport path. The simulations reveal that for low clavier-gate voltages, the additional oxide screening in multi-layer gate architectures causes conveyor-belt shuttling to collapse to the bucket-brigade mode, inducing considerable orbital excitation in the process. Increasing the confinement restores conveyor-belt operation, which we find to be robust against interface roughness, gate misalignment, and charge defects buried in the oxide. However, our results indicate that defects located at the Si/SiO2-interface can induce considerable orbital excitation. For lower conveyor gate biases, positive defects in the transport channel can even capture passing electrons. Hence we identify key challenges and find operating regimes for reliable charge transport in SiMOS architectures.</description>

      <title>Polylogarithmic-Depth Quantum Algorithm for Simulating the Extended Hubbard Model on a Two-Dimensional Lattice Using the Fast Multipole Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03898v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended Hubbard model on a two-dimensional lattice captures key physical phenomena, but is challenging to simulate due to the presence of long-range interactions. In this work, we present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution of this model. Our approach, inspired by the fast multipole method, approximates pairwise interactions by interactions between hierarchical levels of coarse-graining boxes. We discuss how to leverage recent advances in two-dimensional neutral atom quantum computing, supporting non-local operations such as long-range gates and shuttling. The resulting circuit depth for a single Trotter step scales polylogarithmically with system size.</description>

      <title>Experimental Quantum Electronic Voting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information protocols offer significant advantages in properties such as security, anonymity, and privacy for communication and computing tasks. An application where guaranteeing the highest possible security and privacy is critical for democratic societies is electronic voting. As computational power continues to evolve, classical voting schemes may become increasingly vulnerable to information leakage. In this work, we present the experimental demonstration of an information-theoretically secure and efficient electronic voting protocol that, crucially, does not rely on election authorities, leveraging the unique properties of quantum states. Our experiment is based on a high-performance source of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and realizes a proof-of-principle implementation of the protocol in two scenarios: a configuration with four voters and two candidates employing privacy enhancement techniques and an election scenario supporting up to eight voters and sixteen candidates. The latter is particularly well-suited for secure board-level elections within organizations or small-scale governmental contexts.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Stochastic Optimization for Energy Systems under Uncertainty: Joint Chance Constraints with Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty is fundamental in modern power systems, where renewable generation and fluctuating demand make stochastic optimization indispensable. The chance constrained unit commitment problem (UCP) captures this uncertainty but rapidly becomes computationally challenging as the number of scenarios grows. Quantum computing has been proposed as a potential route to overcome such scaling barriers. In this work, we evaluate the applicability of quantum annealing platforms to the chance constrained UCP. Focusing on a scenario approximation, we reformulated the problem as a mixed integer linear program and solved it using DWave hybrid quantum classical solver alongside Gurobi. The hybrid solver proved competitive under strict runtime limits for large scenario sets (15,000 in our experiments), while Gurobi remained superior on smaller cases. QUBO reformulations were also tested, but current annealers cannot accommodate stochastic UCPs due to hardware limits, and deterministic cases suffered from embedding overhead. Our study delineates where chance constrained UCPs can already be addressed with hybrid quantum classical methods, and where current quantum annealers remain fundamentally limited.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Collapse: Coupling Quantum States to Classical Bits with quasi-probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a formulation of quantum measurement within a modified framework of frames, in which a quantum system - a single qubit - is directly coupled to a classical measurement bit. The qubit is represented as a positive probability distribution over two classical bits, a and a', denoted by p(aa'). The measurement apparatus is described by a classical bit $\alpha = \pm 1$, initialized in the pure distribution $p(\alpha) = \frac{1}{2}(1 + \alpha)$. The measurement interaction is modeled by a quasi-bistochastic process $ S(bb'\beta \mid aa'\alpha)$ - a bistochastic map that may include negative transition probabilities, while acting on an entirely positive state space. When this process acts on the joint initial state $p(aa')p(\alpha)$, it produces a collapsed state $p(bb'\mid\beta)$, yielding the measurement outcome $\beta$ with the correct quantum-mechanical probability $p(\beta)$. This approach bypasses the von Neumann chain of infinite couplings by treating the measurement register classically, while capturing the nonclassical nature of measurement through the quasi-bistochastic structure of the interaction.</description>

      <title>Phase-space open-systems dynamics of second-order nonlinear interactions with pulsed quantum light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical description of broadband, multimode quantum pulses undergoing a second-order $\chi^{(2)}$-nonlinear interaction can be quite intricate, due to the large dimensionality of the underlying phase space. However, in many cases only a few broadband (temporal) modes are relevant before and after the nonlinear interaction. Here we present an efficient framework to calculate the relation between the quantum states at the input and output of a nonlinear element in their respective relevant modes. Since the number of relevant input and output modes may differ, resulting in an open quantum system, we introduce the generalized Bloch-Messiah decomposition (GBMD), reducing the description to an equal number of input and output modes. The GBMD enables us to calculate the multimode Wigner function of the output state by convolving the rescaled Wigner function of the reduced input quantum pulse with a multivariate Gaussian phase-space function. We expand on this result by considering two examples input states: A Fock state in a single broadband mode and a two-mode squeezed vacuum, both in the THz-frequency regime, up-converted to a single output broadband mode of optical frequencies. We investigate the effect, the convolution and thermalization due to entanglement breakage have on the output Wigner function by calculating the von Neumann entropy of the output Wigner function. The methods presented here can be used to optimize the amplification or frequency conversion of broadband quantum states, opening an avenue to the generation and characterization of optical quantum states on ultrafast time scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a subclass of a general $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric Hamiltonian obeying anti-commutation relation with its conjugate, a Hermitian basis is found that spans the bi-orthonormal energy eigenvectors. Using the modified projectors constructed from these eigenvectors, the generalized density matrix of the $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric evolution is calculated, and subsequently, ergotropy for a closed system is obtained. The $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric system, in an open system scenario, is studied to understand ergotropy under different regimes of non-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian. The consistency of the three laws of thermodynamics for the $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric system in an open system scenario is also analyzed.</description>

Abstract: We develop an image theory for the recently proposed single-bounce quantum gravimeter. Free fall and quantum bounce of a matter wave-packet are described through decompositions over a basis of continuous energies. This leads to a much clearer interpretation of the origin of quantum interferences, associated to semi-classical estimations. We then give new tools to explore the space of parameters, and discuss the expected accuracy of the free-fall acceleration measurement.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Detection with Rotationally Covariant Measurements - From Compton Scattering to Lemonade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate and efficient detection of quantum entanglement remains a central challenge in quantum information science. In this work, we study the detection of entanglement of polarized photons for measurement devices that are solely specified by rotational symmetry. We derive explicit positive operator valued measures (POVMs) showing that from a quantum information perspective any such setting is classified by one real measurable parameter r. In Particular, we give a POVM formulation of the Klein--Nishina formula for Compton scattering of polarized photons. We provide an SDP-based entanglement certification method that operates on the full measured statistics and gives tight bounds, also considering semi-device independent scenarios. Furthermore, we show that, while Bell violations are impossible with rotationally covariant measurements, EPR steering can still be certified under one-sided symmetry constraints. Finally, we present a rotationally covariant showcase experiment, analyzing the scattering of polarized optical light in a selection of soft drinks. Our results suggest that lemonade-based detectors are suitable for entanglement detection.</description>

      <title>Fully quantum theory of strong-field driven tunable entangled multi-photon states in HHG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum high-harmonic generation (HHG) is a growing field of research with capabilities of providing high photon-number entangled states of light. However, there is an open debate regarding the theory level required for correctly describing the quantum aspects of HHG emission, such as squeezing or entanglement. Previous approaches have employed non-interacting classical ensembles of trajectories, or perturbation theory utilizing the classical trajectories as a starting point, missing out key entanglement features. In this Letter, we develop a full quantum theory for entanglement measures in HHG solving exactly the light-matter interaction Hamiltonian and employ it for evaluating the entanglement between emitted photons of different harmonics. For the first time, we reach qualitative agreement of theory with recent experiments showing that the R entanglement parameter decreases with increasing laser power for below-threshold harmonics. Our results indicate that fine-tuning the laser power could enhance HHG entanglement features, which are observed to oscillate with the driving power and exhibit local non-classical maxima structures. Similarly, our theory predicts that the oscillatory behavior of entanglement observed for below-threshold harmonics also appears for entanglement involving above-threshold harmonics. We also show that the long-range behavior of driven electronic trajectories can qualitatively change the resulting entanglement. Lastly, we show that focal averaging over classical degrees of freedom, which has thus far been ignored in quantum HHG theories, plays a key role in entanglement measures and can change the qualitative behavior of observables. Our work establishes the state-of-the art in exploring entanglement features in HHG, and paves way for analysis and engineering of 'truly-quantum' multi-photon states in the XUV and ultrafast regime for more complex matter systems.</description>

      <title>TARA Test-by-Adaptive-Ranks for Quantum Anomaly Detection with Conformal Prediction Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) security fundamentally relies on the ability to distinguish genuine quantum correlations from classical eavesdropper simulations, yet existing certification methods lack rigorous statistical guarantees under finite-sample conditions and adversarial scenarios. We introduce TARA (Test by Adaptive Ranks), a novel framework combining conformal prediction with sequential martingale testing for quantum anomaly detection that provides distribution-free validity guarantees. TARA offers two complementary approaches. TARA k, based on Kolmogorov Smirnov calibration against local hidden variable (LHV) null distributions, achieving ROC AUC = 0.96 for quantum-classical discrimination. And TARA-m, employing betting martingales for streaming detection with anytime valid type I error control that enables real time monitoring of quantum channels. We establish theoretical guarantees proving that under (context conditional) exchangeability, conformal p-values remain uniformly distributed even for strongly contextual quantum data, confirming that quantum contextuality does not break conformal prediction validity a result with implications beyond quantum certification to any application of distribution-free methods to nonclassical data. Extensive validation on both IBM Torino (superconducting, CHSH = 2.725) and IonQ Forte Enterprise (trapped ion, CHSH = 2.716) quantum processors demonstrates cross-platform robustness, achieving 36% security margins above the classical CHSH bound of 2. Critically, our framework reveals a methodological concern affecting quantum certification more broadly: same-distribution calibration can inflate detection performance by up to 44 percentage points compared to proper cross-distribution calibration, suggesting that prior quantum certification studies using standard train test splits may have systematically overestimated adversarial robustness.</description>

      <title>Thermalization from quenching in coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a finite-time protocol that thermalizes a quantum harmonic oscillator, initially in its ground state, without requiring a macroscopic bath. The method uses a second oscillator as an effective environment and implements sudden quenches of the oscillator frequencies and coupling. Owing to the Gaussian nature of the dynamics, the thermalization condition reduces to three solvable equations, yielding exact analytic solutions for a dense discrete set of temperatures and numerical solutions in all other cases. Any target temperature can be approximated with arbitrary precision, with a trade-off between speed and accuracy. The simplicity of the protocol makes it a promising tool for rapid, controlled thermalization in quantum thermodynamics experiments and state preparation.</description>

      <title>Closing the problem of which causal structures of up to six total nodes have a classical-quantum gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of Bell that there exist quantum correlations that cannot be reproduced classically is one of the most important in the foundations of quantum mechanics, as well as having practical implications. Bell's result was originally proven in a simple bipartite causal structure, but analogous results have also been shown in further causal structures. Here we study the only causal structure with six or fewer nodes in which the question of whether or not there exist quantum correlations that cannot be achieved classically was open. In this causal structure we show that such quantum correlations exist using a method that involves imposing additional restrictions on the correlations. This hence completes the picture of which causal structures of up to six nodes support non-classical quantum correlations. We also provide further illustrations of our method using other causal structures.</description>

      <title>A portable LED-based diamond magnetometer for outreach and teaching labs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a compact, low-cost version of an NV center diamond magnetometer which replaces the standard green laser with a high-power LED. This modification improves safety, reduces cost, and allows the green excitation and red photoluminescence to be viewed directly during demonstrations. The device is simple to assemble and suitable for outreach activities and undergraduate laboratories. We show that it can produce ODMR spectra and respond to nearby magnetic objects, with a sensitivity on the order of 1 $\mu$T/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. Supplementary material provides details of the construction and suggestions for student investigations to support use in teaching laboratories.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Theory of the Ultrafast Optical Response of 2D-Quantum-Confined Semiconductors at Elevated Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An excitonic approach to the ultrafast optical response of confined semiconductors at elevated densities below the Mott transition is presented. The theory is valid from the coherent regime, where coherent excitonic transitions and biexcitons dominate, to the incoherent regime, where excitonic occupations dominate. Numerical simulations of the $1s$ exciton dynamics during intense circularly polarized pump pulses in two different Coulomb-interaction regimes are performed for two-dimensional semiconductors: Moderate Coulomb interaction is compared with dominating Coulomb interaction with respect to the light-matter interaction strength. The different many-body contributions are disentangled and it is found, that excitonic Rabi oscillations in the Coulomb-dominated regime are considerably less strong. By also comparing circular and linear excitation in a MoSe$_2$ monolayer, it is found, that linear excitation creates a regime, where excitonic Rabi oscillations are almost completely suppressed.</description>

      <title>A2G-QFL: Adaptive Aggregation with Two Gains in Quantum Federated learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) deployed over quantum enabled and heterogeneous classical networks faces significant performance degradation due to uneven client quality, stochastic teleportation fidelity, device instability, and geometric mismatch between local and global models. Classical aggregation rules assume euclidean topology and uniform communication reliability, limiting their suitability for emerging quantum federated systems. This paper introduces A2G (Adaptive Aggregation with Two Gains), a dual gain framework that jointly regulates geometric blending through a geometry gain and modulates client importance using a QoS gain derived from teleportation fidelity, latency, and instability. We develop the A2G update rule, establish convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded variance assumptions, and show that A2G recovers FedAvg, QoS aware averaging, and manifold based aggregation as special cases. Experiments on a quantum classical hybrid testbed demonstrate improved stability and higher accuracy under heterogeneous and noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Modulated Electron Lattice and d-Wave Superconductivity in Cuprates: A Phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework for high-$T_c$ cuprates in which a short-range modulation of the electronic charge density couples to a $d$-wave superconducting condensate. The resulting modulated electron lattice (MEL) state is distinct from long-range static charge density wave order: it is short range, partially phase coherent, and linked to superconducting coherence. A preferred wave vector $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ reciprocal lattice units along the Cu-O bond direction emerges from the interplay between a momentum-dependent susceptibility and bond-stretching phonons, consistent with neutron and x-ray data on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ and related cuprates. The GL free energy contains coupled $d$-wave superconducting and charge sectors with parameters constrained by optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$. We identify an MEL enhancement window in doping, temperature, MEL correlation length, and disorder where a coherence linked modulation enhances the superfluid stiffness. Classical Monte Carlo simulations yield an in-plane stiffness enhancement of order ten percent, which we treat as a qualitative prediction to be tested by self-consistent Bogoliubov de Gennes calculations. The MEL framework yields falsifiable experimental signatures. For scanning tunneling spectroscopy in Bi-based cuprates we highlight two predictions: the Fourier-transformed local density of states should exhibit a $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ peak whose spectral weight sharpens as superconducting phase coherence develops below $T_c$, in contrast to static charge scenarios, and the local gap magnitude $\Delta(r)$ should correlate positively with the local MEL amplitude. The framework implies correlations between MEL correlation length, superfluid stiffness, disorder, and vortex pinning, and organizes cuprate observations into testable STM/STS predictions.</description>

      <title>Stretched Exponential Scaling of Parity-Restricted Energy Gaps in a Random Transverse-Field Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of a quantum annealing algorithm requires a polynomial scaling of the energy gap. Recently it was shown that a two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice with nearest-neighbor $\pm J$ random coupling has a polynomial energy gap in the symmetric subspace of the parity operator [Nature 631, 749-754 (2024)], indicating the efficient preparation of its ground states by quantum annealing. However, it is not clear if this result can be generalized to other spin glass models with continuous or biased randomness. Here we prove that under general independent and identical distributions (i.i.d.) of the exchange energies, the energy gap of a one-dimensional random transverse-field Ising model follows a stretched exponential scaling even in the parity-restricted subspace. We discuss the implication of this result to quantum annealing problems.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in coherent conveyor-mode spin qubit shuttling are paving the way for large-scale quantum computing platforms with qubit connectivity achieved by spin qubit shuttles. We developed a simulation tool to investigate numerically the impact of device imperfections on the spin-coherence of conveyor-mode shuttling in Si/SiGe. We simulate the quantum evolution of a mobile electron spin-qubit under the influence of sparse and singly charged point defects placed in the Si/SiGe heterostructure in close proximity to the shuttle lane. We consider different locations of a single charge defect with respect to the center of the shuttle lane, multiple orbital states of the electron in the shuttle with $g$-factor differences between the orbital levels, and orbital relaxation induced by electron-phonon interaction. With this simulation framework, we identify the critical defect density of charged point defects in the heterostructure for conveyor-mode spin qubit shuttle devices and quantify the impact of a single defect on the coherence of a qubit.</description>

      <title>Optimizing two-qubit gates for ultracold fermions in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold neutral atoms in optical lattices are a promising platform for simulating the behavior of complex materials and implementing quantum gates. We optimize collision gates for fermionic Lithium atoms confined in a double-well potential, controlling the laser amplitude and keeping its relative phase constant. We obtain high-fidelity gates based on a one-dimensional confinement simulation. Our approach extends beyond earlier Fermi-Hubbard simulations by capturing a momentum dependence in the interaction energy. This leads to a higher interaction strength when atoms begin in separate subwells compared to the same subwell. This momentum dependence might limit the gate fidelity under realistic experimental conditions, but also enables tailored applications in quantum chemistry and quantum simulation by optimizing gates for each of these cases separately.</description>

      <title>More is uncorrelated: Tuning the local correlations of SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard systems via controlled symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold-atom experiments based on alkali-like atoms provide us with a tool to experimentally realize Hubbard models with a large number $N$ of components. The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking.
  We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles complementing conventional estimates with the inter-flavor mutual information. We prove that these correlations have classical nature and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation.
  We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing offers powerful new approaches for modeling complex social phenomena. Here, we propose and demonstrate quantum simulations of opinion dynamics, leveraging quantum superposition, measurement-induced state collapse, and entanglement to model realistic psychological and social processes. Specifically, we develop quantum models of opinion dynamics, solving exactly and simulating on IBM Quantum hardware. Our results, based on quantum devices and validated with practical quantum circuits, illustrate how quantum effects can enhance understanding of consensus formation, polarization, and collective decision-making. These findings pave the way for further exploration into quantum-enhanced social modeling, highlighting the potential of near-term quantum computers for simulating collective behavior in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Laser-induced modulation of conductance in graphene with magnetic barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how electrons move across a graphene sheet when it encounters two magnetic barriers with a region in between that is continuously driven by laser light. Rather than acting as a static obstacle, this illuminated middle section becomes a Floquet cavity that opens new transport channels through controlled photon absorption and emission. By combining Floquet theory with the transfer matrix method, we track electron transmission through both the main energy band and the emerging photon-assisted sidebands. We find that the laser does more than modify the potential--it reshapes how electrons interact between the magnetic barriers, enabling a switch from ordinary transmission to transport dominated by photon exchange. Because the magnetic field and the optical drive are applied to separate sections of the device, the system supports interference between cyclotron-filtered motion and discrete photon-pumping channels, producing Fano resonances and angle-dependent transmission zeros that cannot appear in double magnetic or double laser barrier systems alone. Under well-defined conditions, the distance between the magnetic barriers controls the coupling between Floquet channels, allowing highly tunable resonances and even perfect transmission, despite strong magnetic confinement. We also observe that low-energy carriers are efficiently blocked by the magnetic regions, while conductance steadily rises with energy until it reaches a clear saturation plateau. This hybrid design provides a versatile way to steer graphene electrons by balancing optical pumping and magnetic momentum filtering.</description>

      <title>Non-radiative energy transfer between boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride and other 2D materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boron vacancies ($V_B^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as a promising platform for two-dimensional quantum sensors capable of operating at atomic-scale proximity. However, the mechanisms responsible for photoluminescence quenching in thin hBN sensing layers when placed in contact with absorptive materials remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we investigate non-radiative F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between $V_B^-$ centers and either monolayer graphene or 2D semiconductors. Strikingly, we find that the FRET rate is negligible for hBN sensing layers thicker than 3 nm, highlighting the potential of $V_B^-$ centers for integration into ultra-thin quantum sensors within van der Waals heterostructures. Furthermore, we experimentally extract the intrinsic radiative decay rate of $V_B^-$ defects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amid the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology 2025 (IYQ 2025), a significant portion of global funding has been dedicated to various quantum initiatives, with over 30 countries announcing their respective quantum strategies. Within the Southeast Asia context, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines have launched their respective quantum strategies and roadmaps. Meanwhile, six out of eleven Southeast Asia countries have expressed interest in formulating a regional quantum ecosystem to pursue a set of common goals. Quantum technologies, though still in their infancy within the second quantum revolution, have advanced rapidly in recent years. Due to their dual-use nature, quantum technologies are considered emerging and disruptive, often raising concerns from the cybersecurity perspective. While several discussions regarding Malaysia's quantum initiative and strategy are ongoing, it is vital to broaden the conversation and position Malaysia within the regional ecosystem. This paper provides an overview of Malaysia's quantum landscape and a summary of the regional initiatives since the establishment of Southeast Asia Quantum Network. We then analyse Malaysia's strengths in quantum research and provide four recommendations to strengthen the regional ecosystem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum Markov semigroups on bosonic Fock space and identify a broad class of infinite-dimensional dissipative evolutions that exhibit instantaneous Sobolev-regularization. Motivated by stability problems in quantum computation, we show that for certain Lindblad operators that are polynomials of creation and annihilation operators, the resulting dynamics immediately transform any initial state into one with finite expectation in all powers of the number operator. A key application is in the bosonic cat code, where we obtain explicit estimates in the trace norm for the speed of convergence. These estimates sharpen existing perturbative bounds at both short and long times, offering new analytic tools for assessing stability and error suppression in bosonic quantum information processing. For example, we improve the strong exponential convergence of the (shifted) $2$-photon dissipation to its fixed point to the uniform topology.</description>

      <title>Contrary Inferences for Classical Histories within the Consistent Histories Formulation of Quantum Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15893v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the histories formulation of quantum theory, sets of coarse-grained histories that are consistent obey the classical probability rules. It has been argued that these sets can describe the quasi-classical behaviour of closed quantum systems, e.g. Omnes (Rev. Mod. Phys. 64(2), 339, 1992) and Hartle (Les Houches1992). Most physical scenarios admit multiple different consistent sets and one can view each of these as a separate context. Using propositions from different consistent sets to make inferences leads to paradoxes such as contrary inferences, first noted by Kent (Phys. Rev. Lett. 78(15), 2874, 1997). In this contribution, we use the consistent histories to describe a quasi-classical and macroscopic system to show that paradoxes involving contextuality persist even in the quasi-classical limit. This is distinctively different from the contextuality of standard quantum theory, where the contextuality paradoxes do not persist in the quasi-classical limit. Specifically, we consider different consistent sets for the arrival time problem of a (quasi-classical) ball in an infinite square well. For this setting, we construct two different consistent sets. We find the probabilities that each consistent set assigns to the simple question of whether the ball ever crossed the middle of the interval. We show that one consistent set concludes with certainty that the ball crossed it while the other consistent set concludes with certainty that it did not. Our results point to the need for constraints on the histories sets, additional to the consistency condition, to recover the correct quasi-classical limit in this formalism and lead to the motto "all consistent sets are equal", but "some consistent sets are more equal than others".</description>

Abstract: Evolutions under non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry can be considered unitary under appropriate choices of inner products, facilitated by the so-called metric operator. While it is understood that the choice of the metric operator has no bearing on the description of the system, in this work, we show that this choice does dictate the entanglement structure of the system. We show that the partial trace of the Hermitized density matrix gives the correct representation of the reduced subsystem, and based on such operations, we elucidate the metric dependency of the reduced dynamics and consequently the observable dependence of the subsystem decomposition. We use a non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum walk as a toy model to study this metric dependency, where we use the internal (coin state) as the subsystem of interest and study the coin-position entanglement and non-Markovianity of the coin dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The notion of probability plays a crucial role in quantum mechanics. It appears in quantum mechanics as the Born rule. In modern mathematics which describes quantum mechanics, however, probability theory means nothing other than measure theory, and therefore any operational characterization of the notion of probability is still missing in quantum mechanics. In our former works [K. Tadaki, arXiv:1804.10174], based on the toolkit of algorithmic randomness, we presented a refinement of the Born rule, called the principle of typicality, for specifying the property of results of measurements in an operational way. In this paper, we make an application of our framework to the argument of local realism versus quantum mechanics for refining it, in order to demonstrate how properly our framework works in practical problems in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Phase error rate estimation in QKD with imperfect detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17349v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a finite-size security proof of the decoy-state BB84 QKD protocol against coherent attacks, using entropic uncertainty relations, for imperfect detectors. We apply this result to the case of detectors with imperfectly characterized basis-efficiency mismatch. Our proof works by obtaining a suitable bound on the phase error rate, without requiring any new modifications to the protocol steps or hardware. It is applicable to imperfectly characterized detectors, and only requires the maximum relative difference in detection efficiencies and dark count rates of the detectors to be characterized. Moreover, our proof allows Eve to choose detector efficiencies and dark count rates in their allowed ranges in each round, thereby addressing an important problem of detector side channels. We prove security in the variable-length framework, where users are allowed to adaptively determine the length of key to be produced, and number of bits to be used for error-correction, based on observations made during the protocol. We quantitatively demonstrate the effect of basis-efficiency mismatch by applying our results to the decoy-state BB84 protocol.</description>

      <title>Emergent Liouvillian exceptional points from exact principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08100v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge of interest in exceptional points in open quantum systems. The natural approach in this area has been the use of Markovian master equations. While the resulting Liouvillian EPs have been seen in a variety of systems and have been associated to numerous exotic effects, it is an open question whether such degeneracies and their peculiarities can persist beyond the validity of master equations. In this work, taking the example of a dissipative double-quantum-dot system, we show that exact Heisenberg equations governing system and bath dynamics exhibit the same EPs as the corresponding master equations. To highlight the importance of this finding, we prove that the paradigmatic property associated to EPs - critical damping, persists well beyond the validity of master equations. Our results demonstrate that Liouvillian EPs can arise from underlying fundamental exact principles, rather than merely as a consequence of approximations involved in deriving master equations.</description>

Abstract: Free electrons are a widespread and universal source of electromagnetic fields. The past decades witnessed ever-growing control over many aspects of electron-generated radiation, from the incoherent emission produced by X-ray tubes to the exceptional brilliance of free-electron lasers. Reduced to the elementary process of quantized energy exchange between individual electrons and the electromagnetic field, electron beams may facilitate future sources of tunable quantum light. However, the quantum features of such radiation are tied to the correlation of the particles, calling for the joint electronic and photonic state to be explored for further applications. Here, we demonstrate the coherent parametric generation of non-classical states of light by free electrons. We show that the quantized electron energy loss heralds the number of photons generated in a dielectric waveguide. In Hanbury-Brown-Twiss measurements, an electron-heralded single-photon state is revealed via antibunching intensity correlations, while two-quantum energy losses of individual electrons yield pronounced two-photon coincidences. The approach facilitates the tailored preparation of higher-number Fock and other optical quantum states based on controlled interactions with free-electron beams.</description>

      <title>Coherent Control of Photon Correlations in Trapped Ion Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the spontaneous emission from independent emitters provides spatially uncorrelated photons - a typical manifestation of quantum randomness, the interference of the coherent scattering leads to a well-defined intensity pattern - a feature described by linear optics. We here demonstrate experimentally how the interplay between the two mechanisms in large systems of quantum emitters leads to spatial variations of photon correlations. The implementation with trapped ion crystals in free space allows us to observe the anti-correlation between photon rates and variance of the photon number distributions in chains of up to 18 ions. For smaller crystals of four ions, the transition from a sub-Poissonian to a super-Poissonian variance of the photon number in the scattered light is reported. For higher numbers of scatterers, the photon statistics still display a strong deviation from the fully incoherent scattering case. Our results illustrate how the interference of coherent scattering, combined with spontaneous emission, provides a control mechanism for the light statistics.</description>

      <title>Oracle Separations for the Quantum-Classical Polynomial Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum-classical polynomial hierarchy, QCPH, which is the class of languages solvable by a constant number of alternating classical quantifiers followed by a quantum verifier. Our main result is that QCPH is infinite relative to a random oracle (previously, this was not even known relative to any oracle). We further prove that higher levels of PH are not contained in lower levels of QCPH relative to a random oracle; this is a strengthening of the somewhat recent result that PH is infinite relative to a random oracle (Rossman, Servedio, and Tan 2016).
  The oracle separation requires lower bounding a certain type of low-depth alternating circuit with some quantum gates. To establish this, we give a new switching lemma for quantum algorithms which may be of independent interest. Our lemma says that for any $d$, if we apply a random restriction to a function $f$ with quantum query complexity $\mathrm{Q}(f)\le n^{1/3}$, the restricted function becomes exponentially close (in terms of $d$) to a depth-$d$ decision tree. Our switching lemma works even in a "worst-case" sense, in that only the indices to be restricted are random; the values they are restricted to are chosen adversarially. Moreover, the switching lemma also works for polynomial degree in place of quantum query complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08356v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Bell test experiment using momentum-entangled atom pairs of different masses, specifically metastable helium isotopes 3He* and 4He*, though the method extends to other atom species. Entanglement is generated via collisions, after which the quantum states are manipulated using two independent atom interferometers, enabling precise phase control over each species. Numerical simulations predict a significant violation of Bell's inequality under realistic conditions. This proposal opens a new paradigm to study the intersection of quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) advancements over the past few years have had an unprecedented and revolutionary impact across everyday application areas. Its significance also extends to technical challenges within science and engineering, including the nascent field of quantum computing (QC). The counterintuitive nature and high-dimensional mathematics of QC make it a prime candidate for AI's data-driven learning capabilities, and in fact, many of QC's biggest scaling challenges may ultimately rest on developments in AI. However, bringing leading techniques from AI to QC requires drawing on disparate expertise from arguably two of the most advanced and esoteric areas of computer science. Here we aim to encourage this cross-pollination by reviewing how state-of-the-art AI techniques are already advancing challenges across the hardware and software stack needed to develop useful QC - from device design to applications. We then close by examining its future opportunities and obstacles in this space.</description>

Abstract: The comb-like spectrum added to laser light by an electro-optic modulator (EOM) finds use in a wide range of applications, including coherent optical communication, atomic spectroscopy, and laser frequency and phase stabilization. In some cases a sideband-free optical frequency shift is preferred, such as in laser offset locking using an optical cavity, single-photon frequency shifting, and laser range finding. Approaches to obtaining an optical frequency offset (OFO) involve trade-offs between shift range, conversion gain, and suppression of spurious sidebands. Here we demonstrate an OFO of continuous-wave 871 nm laser light by serrodyne modulation using a fiber EOM and radio-frequency (RF) tones from a commercial RF system on a chip (RFSoC) to achieve shifts of 40 to 800 MHz with &gt; 15 dB suppression of spurious sidebands and &lt; 1.5 dB conversion loss. We also observe a smoothly varying conversion gain. The utility of this tool is demonstrated by continuously shifting the offset of a cavity-locked laser from 50 to 1600 MHz, a capability useful in spectroscopy of unknown optical transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise control of nuclear spin states is crucial for a wide range of quantum technology applications. Here, we propose a fast and robust single-qubit gate in $^{87}$Sr, utilizing the concept of optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER). ONER exploits the interaction between the quadrupole moment of a nucleus and the electric field gradient generated by its electronic environment, enabling spin level transitions via amplitude-modulated laser light. We investigate the hyperfine structure of the 5s$^2$~$^1S_{0}\rightarrow{}$~5s5p~$^3P_1$ optical transition in neutral $^{87}$Sr, and identify the magnetic field strengths and laser parameters necessary to drive spin transitions between the $m_I$ = -9/2 and $m_I$ = -5/2 hyperfine levels in the ground state. Our simulations show that ONER could enable faster spin operations compared to the state-of-the-art oscillations in this 'atomic qubit'. Moreover, we show that spin-flip operations exceeding 99.9\% fidelity can be performed even in the presence of typical noise sources. These results pave the way for significant advances in nuclear spin control, opening new possibilities for quantum memories and other quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: I investigate the problem of optimally discriminating between two open quantum dynamical processes in a single-shot scenario, with the goal of minimizing the error probability of identification. This task involves optimising both the input state -- potentially entangled with an ancillary system that remains isolated from the dynamics -- and the time at which the resulting time-dependent quantum channels, induced by the two distinct dynamical maps, becomes most distinguishable. To illustrate the complexity and richness of this problem, I focus on Pauli dynamical maps and their associated families of time-dependent Pauli channels. I identify a regime in which separable strategies require waiting indefinitely for the dynamics to reach the stationary state, whereas entangled input states enable optimal discrimination at a finite time, with a strict reduction in error probability. These results highlight the crucial interplay between entanglement and timing in enhancing the distinguishability of quantum dynamical processes.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Markov Chain Distribution within Quantum Walk Circuit Subspace</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are algorithms for sampling probability distributions, commonly applied to the Boltzmann distribution in physical and chemical models such as protein folding and the Ising model. These methods enable exploration of such systems by sampling their most probable states. However, sampling multidimensional and multimodal distributions with MCMC requires substantial computational resources, leading to the development of techniques aimed at improving sampling efficiency. In this context, quantum computing, with its potential to accelerate classical methods, emerges as a promising solution to the sampling problem. In this work, we present the design of a new circuit based on the Discrete Quantum Walk (DQW) algorithm to perform MCMC sampling over a desired distributions. Simulation results show convergence behavior in the superposition of the quantum register that encodes the target distribution. This design is further refined to increase convergence speed and, consequently, the scalability of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer-Accelerated Quantum Many-Body Ground-State Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the stabilizer formalism, in particular highly-entangled stabilizer states, can be used to describe the emergence of many-body shape collectivity from individual constituents, in a symmetry-preserving and classically efficient way. The method that we adopt is based on determining an optimal separation of the Hamiltonian into a stabilizer component and a residual part inducing non-stabilizerness. The corresponding stabilizer ground state is efficiently prepared using techniques of graph states and stabilizer tableaux. We demonstrate this technique in context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, a fully-connected spin system presenting a second order phase transition from spherical to deformed state. The resulting stabilizer ground state is found to capture to a large extent both bi-partite and collective multi-partite entanglement features of the exact solution in the region of large deformation. We also explore several methods for injecting non-stabilizerness into the system, including ADAPT-VQE, and imaginary-time evolution (ITE) techniques. Stabilizer ground states are found to accelerate ITE convergence due to a larger overlap with the exact ground state. While further investigations are required, the present work suggests that collective features may be associated with high but simple large-scale entanglement which can be captured by stabilizer states, while the interplay with single-particle motion may be responsible for inducing non-stabilizerness. This study motivates applications of the proposed approach to more realistic quantum many-body systems, whose stabilizer ground states can be used in combinations with powerful classical many-body techniques and/or quantum methods.</description>

      <title>A Circuit-QED Lattice System with Flexible Connectivity and Gapped Flat Bands for Photon-Mediated Spin Models</title>

Abstract: Quantum spin models are ubiquitous in solid-state physics, but classical simulation of them remains extremely challenging. Experimental testbed systems with a variety of spin-spin interactions and measurement channels are therefore needed. One promising potential route to such testbeds is provided by microwave-photon-mediated interactions between superconducting qubits, where native strong light-matter coupling enables significant interactions even for virtual-photon-mediated processes. In this approach, the spin-model connectivity is set by the photonic mode structure, rather than the spatial structure of the qubit. Lattices of coplanar-waveguide (CPW) resonators have been demonstrated to allow extremely flexible connectivities and can therefore host a huge variety of photon-mediated spin models. However, large-scale CPW lattices with non-trivial band structures have never before been successfully combined with superconducting qubits. Here we present the first such device featuring a quasi-1D CPW lattice with multiple transmon qubits. We demonstrate that superconducting-qubit readout and diagnostic techniques can be generalized to this highly multimode environment and observe the effective qubit-qubit interaction mediated by the bands of the resonator lattice. This device completes the toolkit needed to realize CPW lattices with qubits in one or two Euclidean dimensions, or negatively-curved hyperbolic space, and paves the way to driven-dissipative spin models with a large variety of connectivities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superposed coherent states are central to quantum technologies, yet their reliable identification remains a challenge, especially in noisy or resource-constrained settings. We introduce a novel, directly measurable criterion for detecting cat-like features in quantum states, rooted in the concept of nonlinear squeezing. This approach bypasses the need for full state tomography and reveals structure where fidelity fails. The numerical results confirm its robustness under loss and its potential for experimental implementation. The method naturally generalizes to more exotic superpositions, including multiheaded cat states.</description>

Abstract: Unitary quantum gates constitute the building blocks of Quantum Computing in the circuit paradigm. In this work, we engineer a locally driven two-qubit Hamiltonian whose instantaneous ground-state dynamics generates the controlled-NOT (CNOT) quantum gate. In practice, quantum gates have to be implemented in finite-time, hence non-adiabatic and external noise effects debilitate gate fidelities. Here, we show that counterdiabatic control can restore gate performance with near perfect fidelities even in open quantum systems subject to decoherence.</description>

      <title>Acquisition of Delocalized Information via Classical and Quantum Carriers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the information-theoretic power of spatial superposition by analyzing tasks in which information is locally encoded at multiple distant sites and must be acquired by a single information carrier, such as a particle. Within an operational framework, we systematically compare the statistical correlations that can be generated in such tasks using classical particles, quantum particles in spatial superposition, and more general "second-order interference" resources. We bound classical strategies via convex polytopes and present a study of their symmetry, demonstrating that the vertices are inherently connected to K-juntas as defined in the classical theory of Boolean functions, while their facet inequalities are in one-to-one correspondence with oracle games. We then analyze the violation of the "fingerprinting inequality" achievable by the use of one quantum particle, and we study the dependence of this violation on the dimension d of the particle's internal degree of freedom. In particular, we show that the case of d = 2 can achieve a higher violation of the inequality than the previously investigated case of d = 1. We also provide analytic and numerical evidence that this violation cannot be further increased for larger d &gt; 2. Finally, we find that both quantum and any other (generalized) second-order interference models exhibit the same asymptotic scaling in violating the fingerprinting inequality. Our results thereby further articulate quantum interference and spatial superposition as a resource for information processing.</description>

      <title>Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements</title>

Abstract: The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping L\"uders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical nuclear electric resonance (ONER) was recently proposed as a fast and robust single-qubit gate mechanism in $^{87}$Sr. Here, we demonstrate through numerical simulations that ONER can be extended to single-qudit control, addressing multiple one-level hyperfine transitions within the ten-dimensional nuclear-spin manifold. We identify suitable operating regimes and show that ONER enables high-fidelity spin manipulations, with simulated $\pi$-gate fidelities exceeding 99.9\%, while maintaining coherence under realistic parameter fluctuations. These results establish a proof-of-principle for optical qudit control in $^{87}$Sr and delineate practical parameter ranges for future experiments, highlighting ONER as a promising pathway toward high-dimensional quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum communication, quantum state transfer from one location to another in a quantum network plays a prominent role, where the impact of noise could be crucial. The idea of state transfer can be fruitfully associated with quantum walk on graphs. We investigate the consequences of non-Markovian quantum noises on periodicity and state transfer induced by a discrete-time quantum walk on graphs, governed by the Grover coin operator. Different bipartite graphs, such as the path graph, cycle graph, star graph, and complete bipartite graph, present periodicity and state transfer in a discrete-time quantum walk depending on the topology of the graph. We investigate the effect of quantum non-Markovian dephasing noises, particularly quantum non-Markovian Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) and modified non-Markovian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Noise (OUN) on state transfer and periodicity. We demonstrate how the RTN and OUN noises allow state transfer and periodicity for a finite number of steps in a quantum walk. Our investigation brings out the feasibility of state transfer in a noisy environment.</description>

      <title>What's my phase again? Computing the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude of quadratic bosonic evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadratic bosonic Hamiltonians and their associated unitary transformations form a fundamental class of operations in quantum optics, modelling key processes such as squeezing, displacement, and beam-splitting. Their Heisenberg-picture dynamics simplifies to linear (or possibly affine) transformations on quadrature operators, enabling efficient analysis and decomposition into optical gate sets using matrix operations. However, this formalism discards a phase, which, while often neglected, is essential for a complete unitary characterization. We present efficient methods to recover this phase directly from the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude of the unitary, using calculations that scale polynomially with the number of modes and avoid Fock space manipulations. We reduce the general problem for time-dependent Hamiltonians to integration, and provide analytical results for key cases including time-independent Hamiltonians which are positive definite, passive, active, or single-mode. Finally, we show that our results can be easily used to obtain the phase associated with any Gaussian state, be it mixed or pure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the typical implementation of a quantum error-correcting code, each stabilizer is measured by entangling one or more ancilla qubits with the data qubits and measuring the ancilla qubits to deduce the value of the stabilizer. Recently, the dynamic circuit approach has been introduced, in which stabilizers are measured without ancilla qubits. Here, we demonstrate that dynamic circuits are particularly useful for the Floquet code. Our dynamic circuit increases the timelike distance of the code, automatically removes leakage, and both significantly increases the threshold and lowers the logical error rate compared to the standard ancilla-based circuit. At a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, we estimate a nearly $3\times$ reduction in the number of qubits required to reach a $10^{-12}$ logical error rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general theory to treat periodic solids with quantum-chemistry methods. It relies on two main developments: 1) the modeling of a solid as a Clifford torus which is a torus that is both periodic and flat and 2) the introduction of a periodic gaussian basis set that is compatible with the topology of the Clifford torus. We illustrate our approach by calculating the ground-state energy of a periodic chain of hydrogen atoms within both Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster theory. We demonstrate that our approach yields the correct ground-state energy in the thermodynamic limit by comparing it to the ground-state energy of a ring of hydrogen atoms in the same limit. Since equivalent ring-like calculations for three-dimensional solids are impossible, our approach is an excellent alternative to perform quantum-chemistry calculations of solids. Our Clifford formalism can be seamlessly combined with current implementations of quantum-chemistry methods designed for atoms and molecules to make them applicable to solids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg lattice under facilitation conditions can feature kinetic constraints, leading to ballistic and nonergodic behavior at different detuning intensities. Here, we demonstrate that a resonant driving field can achieve effects similar to those under facilitation conditions. We focus on the relaxation dynamics of spin clusters in a periodically driven Rydberg spin lattice. Through an effective Hamiltonian for the domain walls of the spin cluster, it is shown that when the driving frequency is resonant with the Rydberg interaction, the spin cluster exhibits ballistic expansion with half the spreading rate compared to the case of facilitation conditions. However, near the resonant point, the spin cluster displays confinement behavior of the Bloch-like oscillations. These results demonstrate the rich dynamic behaviors in the driven Rydberg spin lattices and may find applications in quantum state manipulation.</description>

Abstract: In this exploratory numerical study, we assess the suitability of Quantum Linear Solvers (QLSs) toward providing a quantum advantage for Networks-based Linear System Problems (NLSPs). NLSPs naturally arise from graphs, and are of importance as they are connected to real-world applications. The achievable advantage with a QLS for an NLSP depends on the interplay between the scaling of condition number and sparsity of matrices associated with the graph family considered, as well as system size growth. We analyze 50 graph families and identify that within the scope of our study, only 4% of them exhibit prospects for an exponential advantage with the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm relative to an efficient classical solver (best graphs), while about 20% of them show a polynomial advantage (better graphs). Furthermore, we report that some graph families graduate from offering no advantage with HHL to promising a polynomial advantage with improved algorithms such as the Childs-Kothari-Somma algorithm, while some other graph families exhibit futile exponential advantage. We introduce a unified graph superfamily and show the existence of infinite best and better graphs in it. We also conjecture the conditions under which one may visually examine a graph family and guess the prospects for an advantage. Finally, we very briefly touch upon some practical issues that may arise even if the aforementioned graph theoretic requirements are satisfied, including quantum hardware challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12341v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we give a new completion of Chen's windowed-QFT lattice algorithm~\citep{chen2024quantum}. This extra step, called Step~$9^\dagger$, replaces the domain extension stage in Steps~8--9. The published Step~9 calls an amplitude periodicity lemma, yet its hypotheses break in the presence of affine offsets $\boldsymbol{v}^*$. Our analysis finds a basic conflict between two design constraints. The lattice problem asks for high spectral resolution, so the method prefers wide time windows. The quadratic phase error of the state prefers narrow time windows. Assumption~A5 packages the spectral concentration and near-uniformity properties that we require from the front end. Under~A5, a direct $\mathbb{Z}_M^n$ Fourier transform of the chirp-corrected coordinate state produces samples $\boldsymbol{u}$ that satisfy $\langle \boldsymbol{b}, \boldsymbol{u} \rangle \equiv 0 \pmod{Q}$ with probability $1-\mathrm{negl}(n)$ and are nearly uniform on the dual hyperplane $\{\boldsymbol{u} : \langle \boldsymbol{b}, \boldsymbol{u} \rangle \equiv 0 \pmod{Q}\}$. The new procedure does not require internal access to control wires. It uses the normalization $b_1=-1$ to apply a center-referenced phase correction directly on the first coordinate register. The scaling parameter $D$ ensures that this physical operation can be implemented by arithmetic on $X_1$ alone and does not read the hidden loop index. For Chen's complex-Gaussian Karst-wave window, we isolate a parameter regime, formalized in Assumption~A5, in which a polynomial retuning of the parameters gives a one-dimensional envelope for the loop index with width $\sigma_J \asymp Q\log n$.</description>

      <title>Radiation of "breathing" vortex electron packets in magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21195v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a vortex electron with an orbital angular momentum (OAM) enters a magnetic field, its quantum state is described with a nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian (NSLG) state rather than with a stationary Landau state. A key feature of these NSLG states is oscillations of the electron wave packet's root-mean-square (r.m.s.) radius, similar to betatron oscillations. Classically, such an oscillating charge distribution is expected to emit photons. This raises a critical question: does this radiation carry away OAM, leading to a loss of the electron's vorticity? To investigate this, we solve Maxwell's equations using the charge and current densities derived from an electron in the NSLG state. We calculate the total radiated power and the angular momentum of the emitted field, quantifying the rate at which a vortex electron loses its energy and OAM while propagating in a longitudinal magnetic field. We find both the radiated power and the angular momentum losses to be negligible indicating that linear accelerators (linacs) appear to be a prominent tool for maintaining vorticity of relativistic vortex electrons and other charged particles, at least in the quasi-classical approximation.</description>

      <title>Barnett Effect-Induced Nonreciprocal Entanglement and Gaussian interferometric power in Magnomechanics with Optical Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25389</link>

Abstract: Nonreciprocity is a powerful tool in quantum technologies. It allows signals to be sent in one direction but not the other. In this article, we propose a method for achieving non-reciprocal entanglement and Gaussian interferometric power (GIP) via the Barnett effect. The YIG is coupled to a microwave cavity that interacts with an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Due to the Barnett effect, giant nonreciprocal entanglement can emerge. By fine-tuning the cavity detuning, the GIP can exhibits nonreciprocal behavior. All entanglements with ideal nonreciprocity can be achieved by tuning the photon frequency detuning, appropriately choosing the cavity-magnon coupling regime, the nonlinear gain, and the phase shift of the OPA. Interestingly, the amount of entanglement nonreciprocity and its resilience to thermal occupation are remarkably enhanced by increasing the gain of the OPA. This nonreciprocity can be significantly enhanced even at relatively high temperatures. Our research offers a pathway for the realization of nonreciprocal single-phonon devices, with potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum communication. This proposed scheme could pave the way for the development of novel nonreciprocal devices that remain robust under thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chip Co-Design for Fidelity and Entanglement Preservation: Architecture, Modeling, and QGHNN Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a superconducting quantum chip architecture designed to simultaneously preserve entanglement and readout fidelity, addressing one of the key trade-offs in the development of scalable quantum hardware. In conventional quantum circuits, strong qubit qubit coupling enhances entanglement but often leads to undesired crosstalk, dephasing, and reduced measurement fidelity. To mitigate these effects, we propose a hybrid multiqubit configuration consisting of nine transmon qubits organized into interior and exterior groups, interconnected via a flux tunable qubit and a network of distributed resonators. The interior qubits along with tunable qubit form an entanglement core, while the exterior qubits operate in the dispersive regime under large detuning to enable readout. The degree of entanglement can be dynamically tuned by adjusting the coupling between the central tunable qubit and the interior qubits. The total Hamiltonian includes all significant coupling contributions, encompassing effective exchange interactions among interior and exterior qubits, as well as their mediated couplings through interface resonators. By numerically solving the complete Hamiltonian alongside the Lindblad master equation, the system dynamics are characterized, allowing evaluation of both spectroscopic features and separation fidelity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design maintains strong entanglement by creating the avoided-crossing region while sustaining measurement fidelity around 0.995 under realistic noise conditions. These findings confirm that entanglement strength and readout fidelity can be co-optimized within a single, reconfigurable architecture, establishing a viable route toward high-performance and scalable superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Tractable Infinite-Horizon Stochastic Model Predictive Control for Quantum Filtering via Eigenstate Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model predictive control has shown potential to enhance the robustness of quantum control systems. In this work, we propose a tractable Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) framework for finite-dimensional quantum systems under continuous-time measurement and quantum filtering. Using the almost-sure eigenstate reduction of quantum trajectories, we prove that the infinite-horizon stochastic objective collapses to a fidelity term that is computable in closed form from the one-step averaged state. Consequently, the online SMPC step requires only deterministic propagation of the filter and a terminal fidelity evaluation. An advantage of this method is that it eliminates per-horizon Monte Carlo scenario sampling and significantly reduces computational load while retaining the essential stochastic dynamics. We establish equivalence and mean-square stability guarantees, and validate the approach on multi-level and Ising-type systems, demonstrating favorable scalability compared to sampling-based SMPC.</description>

      <title>Emulation Capacity between Idempotent Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the optimal rates of emulation (also called interconversion) between quantum channels. When the source and the target channels are idempotent, we give a single-letter expression for the zero-error emulation capacity in terms of structural properties of the range of the two channels. This expression shows that channel emulation is not reversible for general idempotent channels. Furthermore, we establish a strong converse rate that matches with the zero-error emulation capacity when the source or the target channel is either an identity or a completely dephasing channel.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Parametric Amplifiers: Resonator Design and Role in Qubit Readout</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting parametric amplifiers (SPAs) are critical components for ultralow-noise qubit readout in quantum computing, addressing the critical challenge of amplifying weak quantum signals without introducing noise that degrades coherence and computational fidelity. Unlike classical amplifiers, SPAs can achieve or closely approach quantum-limited performance, specifically the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) of half a photon of added noise for phase-preserving amplification. The core principle of SPAs relies on parametric amplification, where energy is transferred from a strong pump tone to a weak input signal through non-dissipative nonlinear mixing processes. This is enabled by intrinsic nonlinearities in superconducting materials, primarily kinetic inductance in thin films (e.g., NbTiN, Al) and, more significantly, the Josephson effect in Josephson junctions. These nonlinear elements facilitate frequency mixing (three-wave or four-wave mixing) and can operate in phase-preserving or phase-sensitive amplification modes, with the latter allowing for noise squeezing below the SQL. This chapter emphasizes the significant role of resonator design in determining critical SPA performance metrics such as gain, bandwidth, and noise characteristics. It details both lumped-element (LC) and distributed-element (coplanar waveguide, CPW) resonators, discussing their unique properties, suitability for different frequency ranges, and the importance of achieving high-quality factors (Q) for efficient energy storage and minimal loss. A practical design and simulation of a meandered quarterwavelength CPW resonator coupled to a feed line is presented, illustrating how precise control over geometric parameters optimizes resonant frequency, coupling strength, and quality factor for high-fidelity qubit state discrimination.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Qubit Gates Robust to Parameter Fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art single-qubit gates on superconducting transmon qubits can achieve the fidelities required for error-corrected computations. However, parameter fluctuations due to qubit instabilities, environmental changes, and control inaccuracies make it difficult to maintain this performance. To mitigate the effects of these parameter variations, we numerically derive gates robust to amplitude and frequency errors using gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE). We analyze how fluctuations in qubit frequency, drive amplitude, and coherence affect gate performance over time. The robust pulses suppress coherent errors from drive amplitude drifts over 15 times more than a Gaussian pulse with derivative removal by adiabatic gate (DRAG) corrections. Furthermore, the robust gates, originally designed to compensate for quasi-static errors, also demonstrate resilience to stochastic, time-dependent noise, which is reflected in the dephasing time. They suppress added errors during increases in dephasing by up to 1.7 times more than DRAG.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Quantum Granular Computing with Effect-Based Granules, Algebraic Properties and Reference Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops the foundations of Quantum Granular Computing (QGC), extending classical granular computing including fuzzy, rough, and shadowed granules to the quantum regime. Quantum granules are modeled as effects on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, so granular memberships are given by Born probabilities. This operator theoretic viewpoint provides a common language for sharp (projective) and soft (nonprojective) granules and embeds granulation directly into the standard formalism of quantum information theory. We establish foundational results for effect based quantum granules, including normalization and monotonicity properties, the emergence of Boolean islands from commuting families, granular refinement under Luders updates, and the evolution of granules under quantum channels via the adjoint channel in the Heisenberg picture. We connect QGC with quantum detection and estimation theory by interpreting the effect operators realizing Helstrom minimum error measurement for binary state discrimination as Helstrom type decision granules, i.e., soft quantum counterparts of Bayes optimal decision regions. Building on these results, we introduce Quantum Granular Decision Systems (QGDS) with three reference architectures that specify how quantum granules can be defined, learned, and integrated with classical components while remaining compatible with near term quantum hardware. Case studies on qubit granulation, two qubit parity effects, and Helstrom style soft decisions illustrate how QGC reproduces fuzzy like graded memberships and smooth decision boundaries while exploiting noncommutativity, contextuality, and entanglement. The framework thus provides a unified and mathematically grounded basis for operator valued granules in quantum information processing, granular reasoning, and intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Robust hyperentanglement self testing</title>

Abstract: Hyperentanglement, which refers to entanglement encoded in two or more independent degrees of freedom (DOFs), is a valuable resource for the future high-capacity quantum network. Certifying hyperentanglement sources work as intended is critical for the hyperentanglement-based quantum information tasks. Self testing is the strongest certification method for quantum state and measurement under minimal assumptions, even without any knowledge of the devices' inner workings. However, the existing self testing protocols all focus on one-DOF entanglement, which cannot self test the multi-DOF entanglement. In the paper, we propose a hyperentanglement self testing framework. We take the self testing for the polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states as an example. The self testing is based on the violation of two-dimension CHSH test in each DOF independently. The two-step swap isometry circuits are proposed for self testing the entanglement in spatial-mode and polarization DOFs, respectively. All the sixteen polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states can be self tested. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework has three advantages. First, it is a general hyperentanglement self testing framework, and can be extended to self test multi-DOF hyperentanglement and multipartite hyperentanglement. Second, it can provide the robust hyperentanglement self testing and establish the relation between the lower bound of fidelity and the imperfect violation of Bell-like inequality in each DOF. Third, it is feasible with current experimental technology. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework provides a promising way to certify complex hyperentanglement sources, and has potential application in future high-capacity quantum network.</description>

      <title>Inner structure of the many-body localization transition and the fulfillment of the Harris criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We treat the disordered Heisenberg model in 1D as the standard model of many-body localization (MBL). Two new and independent order parameters stemming solely from the half-chain von Neumann entanglement entropy $S_{\textrm{vN}}$ are introduced to probe the eigenstate phase transition in this model. From the symmetry-endowed entropy decomposition, they are the probability distribution deviation $|d(p_n)|$ and the von Neumann entropy $S_{\textrm{vN}}^{n}(D_n\!=\!\mbox{max})$ of the maximally dimensional symmetry subdivision. The finite-size scaling reveals that $\{p_n\}$ drives the localization transition, preceded by a thermalization breakdown transition governed by $\{S_{\textrm{vN}}^{n}\}$. For the noninteracting case, these transitions coincide, but in the interacting circumstance they separate. Such separability creates an intermediate phase regime and discriminates between the Anderson and MBL transitions. One obstacle whose solution eludes the community to date concerns the violation of the Harris criterion in most numerical investigations of MBL. Upon elucidating the mutually independent measures comprising $S_{\textrm{vN}}$, it becomes clear that the previous studies may lack the resolution to pinpoint thus potentially overlook the crucial internal structure of the transition. We show that after this necessary decomposition, the universal critical exponents for both transitions of $|d(p_n)|$ and $S_{\textrm{vN}}^{n}(D_n\!=\!\mbox{max})$ fulfill the Harris criterion: $\nu\approx2\ (\nu\approx1.5)$ for quench (quasirandom) disorder. Our work puts forth symmetry combined with entanglement as an organization principle for the generic eigenstate matter and phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain's synaptic network, characterized by parallel connections and feedback loops, drives interaction pathways between neurons through a large system with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This system is best modeled by the graph C*-algebra of the underlying directed graph, the Toeplitz-Cuntz-Krieger (TCK) algebra, which captures the diversity of path-structured flow connectivity. Equipped with the gauge action, the TCK algebra defines an {\em algebraic quantum system}, and here we demonstrate that its thermodynamic properties provide a natural framework for describing the dynamic mappings of potential flow pathways within the network. Specifically, the KMS states of this system represent the stationary distributions of a non-Markovian stochastic process with memory decay, capturing how influence propagates along exponentially weighted paths, and yield global statistical measures of neuronal interactions. Applied to the {\em C. elegans} synaptic network, our framework reveals that neurolocomotor neurons emerge as the primary hubs of incoming path-structured flow at inverse temperatures where the entropy of KMS states peaks. This finding aligns with experimental evidence of the foundational role of locomotion in {\em C. elegans} behavior, suggesting that functional centrality may arise from the topological embedding of neurons rather than solely from local physiological properties. Our results highlight the potential of algebraic quantum methods and graph algebras to uncover patterns of functional organization in complex systems and neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Spin-Depairing-Induced Exceptional Fermionic Superfluidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</description>

      <title>Towards a test of the Born rule in high-energy collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07510v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider how the Born rule, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, can be tested for particles created on the shortest timescales ($\sim10^{-25}\,\mathrm{s}$) currently accessible at high-energy colliders. We focus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation probabilities, which offer a particularly clean experimental signal, and which can be described by a simple hidden-variables model of two-state systems proposed by Bell. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation values for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, along with anomalies in ensemble averages, which may then be constrained by experiment. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the current-voltage characteristics of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain under irradiation by arbitrarily polarized light, demonstrating its potential as a light-controlled rectifier. Irradiation of light induces anisotropy in the system, enabling directional current flow and active control of rectification behavior. Our analysis demonstrates that, under optimized light parameters, the rectification efficiency can exceed 90\%. Moreover, the direction of rectification-whether positive or negative-can be precisely controlled by varying the polarization of the light, highlighting the potential for external optical control of electronic behavior. The effect of light irradiation is incorporated using the Floquet-Bloch ansatz combined with the minimal coupling scheme, while charge transport is computed through the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism within the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker framework.</description>

      <title>Thermal nature of the causal diamond horizon: A hidden property of the inertial propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the novel idea proposed by T.~Padmanabhan in \textit{Phys.\ Rev.\ D 100, 045024 (2019)}, we develop a method to uncover the hidden thermal properties of the inertial Feynman propagator in Minkowski spacetime in a causally consistent manner. This, in turn, enables a coherent interpretation based on future-directed propagation. In our approach, the Fourier transform is implemented following the convention used in the analysis of vacuum fluctuations. As a result, future-directed propagation across causal horizons can be consistently interpreted, from the perspective of an observer confined to a causally disconnected region, as the emission of scalar quanta at the past horizon and their absorption at the future horizon. Moreover, we find that the ratio between emission and absorption processes reproduces the characteristic Boltzmann factor of a thermal ensemble. We first apply this analysis to a causal diamond of length $2\alpha$, performing a detailed study of the near-horizon geometry and thereby obtaining the temperature associated with the thermal behavior of the Minkowski vacuum as perceived by an observer with finite lifetime $2\alpha$. For completeness, we also apply the method to the right Rindler wedge, recovering the well-known Unruh temperature, $T = a/(2\pi)$. Our results demonstrate that thermality can emerge directly from causal structure, independently of acceleration or gravity, with causal diamonds encoding intrinsic thermodynamic behavior in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Distances between pure quantum states induced by a distance matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the help of a given distance matrix of size $n$, we construct an infinite family of distances $d_p$ (where $p \geq 2$) on the complex projective space $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ modelling the space of pure states of an $n$-level quantum system. The construction can be seen as providing a natural way to isometrically embed any given finite metric space into the space of pure quantum states 'spanned' upon it. In order to show that the maps $d_p$ are indeed distance functions -- in particular, that they satisfy the triangle inequality -- we employ methods of analysis, multilinear algebra and convex geometry, obtaining a nontrivial auxiliary convexity result in the process. The paper significantly extends earlier work, resolving an important question about the geometry of quantum state space imposed by the quantum Wasserstein distances and solidifying the foundation for applications of distances $d_p$ in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>High fidelity CNOT gates in photonic integrated circuits using composite segmented directional couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated photonic circuits are a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing, but their performance is often constrained by component sensitivity to fabrication imperfections. Directional couplers, which are crucial building blocks for integrated quantum logic gates, are particularly prone to such limitations, with strong dependence on geometric and spectral parameters which reduces gate fidelity. Here, we demonstrate that composite segmented directional couplers (CSDC) offer a fabrication-tolerant alternative that enhances gate fidelity without active tuning. We design and fabricate a fully integrated photonic controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate using both uniform and composite coupler variants and compare their performance via simulation, classical characterization, and quantum two-photon interference. The composite design reduces the average error probability by nearly a factor of two and decreases variability fivefold. The residual error is primarily limited by photon indistinguishability. Classical matrix reconstruction confirms improved agreement with the ideal CNOT operation. These results establish CSDCs as compact, passive, and foundry-compatible building blocks for robust scalable quantum photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphism invariant tensor networks for 3d gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks prepare states that share many features of states in quantum gravity. However, standard constructions are not diffeomorphism invariant and do not support an algebra of non-commuting area operators. Recently, analogues of both problems were addressed in a tensor network discretization of topological field theories (TFT) with finite or compact gauge groups. Here, we extend this work towards gravity by generalizing to gauge groups that are discrete or continuous, compact or non-compact. Applied to $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \times \text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Chern-Simons theory, our construction can be interpreted as building states of three dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant. Our tensor networks prepare states that satisfy the constraints of Chern-Simons theory. In metric variables, this implies that the states we construct satisfy the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and momentum constraints, and so are diffeomorphism invariant.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear magnetization dynamics as a route to nonreciprocal phases, spin superfluidity, and analogue gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identification of platforms with independently tunable nonlinearity and non-Hermiticity promises a quantitative route to far-from-equilibrium universality across many-body systems. Here we show that a conventional ferromagnetic multilayer realizes this paradigm: balancing a dc drive against Gilbert damping stabilizes a chiral spin-superfluid limit cycle that spontaneously breaks spacetime-translation symmetry. The resulting superflow is intrinsically nonreciprocal: long-wavelength magnons of opposite chirality acquire asymmetric dispersions and propagate direction-selectively, realizing a spin-superfluid diode. This asymmetry is flow-borne - it reflects broken Galilean invariance and requires neither structural asymmetry nor finely tuned gain-loss balance. Linearized dynamics in the comoving superfluid frame are intrinsically pseudo-Hermitian and, in the long-wavelength sector, can be mapped to a (1+1)D wave equation on curved spacetime. Spatial modulation of the drive enables the generation of sonic horizons that parametrically squeeze magnons and produce Hawking-like particle-hole emission. Our results establish a tabletop route from nonlinear dissipative-driven magnetization dynamics to nonreciprocal transport, nonequilibrium phase transitions, and analogue-gravity kinematics.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Aspect of Information: The Physical Reality of Asymmetric "Distance"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to satisfy a canonical condition, its time evolution exactly coincides with an m-geodesic on the statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This identification provides a direct physical realization of a geometric concept in information geometry. It implies that purely random processes evolve along informationally straight trajectories, analogous to geodesics in general relativity. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) plays a fundamental physical role, offering a concrete step toward an equivalence principle for information.</description>

      <title>High-Sensitivity NV Ensemble Imaging via AOD-Based Raster Scanning and Photodetection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a technique based on an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond capable of imaging magnetic fields with high spatio-temporal resolution. A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization, analogous to pulsed ODMR technique, while the microwave field remains continuously on resonance with the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microelectrode in a conductive medium with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. This approach enables flexible spatial sampling and with our diamond achieves nT$\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$ per pixel sensitivity, making it well suited for detecting weak, dynamic magnetic fields in biological and other complex systems.</description>
