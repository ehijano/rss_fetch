      <title>An EKR Theorem for the Cartesian Product of Complete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado theorem states that for $r \leq \frac{n}{2}$, the largest intersecting family of $r$-subsets of $[n]$ is given by fixing a common element in all subsets, which trivially ensures pairwise intersection. We investigate this property for families of independent sets in the Cartesian product of complete graphs, $K_n \times K_m$. Using a novel extension of Katona's cycle method, we prove $K_n \times K_m$ is $r$-EKR when $1 \leq r \leq \frac{\min(m,n)}{2}$, demonstrating the Holroyd--Talbot conjecture holds for this class of well-covered graphs.</description>

      <title>Computing fault-tolerant metric dimension of graphs using their primary subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metric dimension of a graph is the cardinality of a minimum resolving set, which is the set of vertices such that the distance representations of every vertex with respect to that set are unique. A fault-tolerant metric basis is a resolving set with a minimum cardinality that continues to resolve the graph even after the removal of any one of its vertices. The fault-tolerant metric dimension is the cardinality of such a fault-tolerant metric basis. In this article, we investigate the fault-tolerant metric dimension of graphs formed through the point-attaching process of primary subgraphs. This process involves connecting smaller subgraphs to specific vertices of a base graph, resulting in a more complex structure. By analyzing the distance properties and connectivity patterns, we establish explicit formulae for the fault-tolerant resolving sets of these composite graphs. Furthermore, we extend our results to specific graph products, such as rooted products. For these products, we determine the fault-tolerant metric dimension in terms of the fault-tolerant metric dimension of the primary subgraphs. Our findings demonstrate how the fault-tolerant dimension is influenced by the structural characteristics of the primary subgraphs and the attaching vertices. These results have potential applications in network design, error correction, and distributed systems, where robustness against vertex failures is crucial.</description>

      <title>Matchings in Matroids over Abelian Groups, III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an abelian group $G$, a \emph{matching} is a bijection $f\colon A\to B$ between finite subsets $A,B\subseteq G$ such that $a+f(a)\notin A$ for all $a\in A$. We say that $G$ has the \emph{matching property} if every pair of finite subsets $A,B\subseteq G$ with $|A|=|B|$ and $0\notin B$ admits such a matching. This paper develops matroidal analogues of classical results on group matchings. By embedding matroid ground sets in $G$, we introduce base matchings between matroid bases, recovering the group-theoretic setting in the uniform case, and derive structural and combinatorial criteria for their existence. Our methods blend techniques from matroid theory, group theory, and additive number theory. Our main focus is on paving matroids, a class conjectured to constitute asymptotically almost all matroids. We prove symmetric self-matchability for all paving matroids, extend asymmetric results via the hyperplane-nullity parameter, and connect stressed hyperplanes to matchability through relaxation, bridging paving and uniform matroids. This paper continues a line of research initiated in [3,4], yet is written to be self-contained and may be read independently.</description>

      <title>Distribution of statistics on separable permutations restricted by a flat POP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding distributions of statistics in pattern-avoiding permutations has attracted significant attention in the literature. In particular, Chen, Kitaev, and Zhang derived functional equations for the joint distributions of any subset of classical minima and maxima statistics, as well as for the joint distributions of ascents and descents in separable permutations. Meanwhile, partially ordered patterns (POPs) have also been extensively studied. Notably, so-called flat POPs played a key role, via the notion of shape-Wilf-equivalence, in proving a conjecture on pattern-avoiding permutations.
  In this paper, we study flat POP-avoiding separable permutations, where the maximum element in a flat POP receives the largest label. Avoiding such a POP imposes restrictions on the position of the maximum element in a separable permutation, forcing it to be positioned to the left. We establish a system of functional equations describing the joint distribution of six classical statistics in the most general case, extending the work of Chen, Kitaev, and Zhang.
  As a specialization, when the POP has length 3, we recover a joint distribution result of Han and Kitaev on permutations avoiding classical patterns of length 3. As another specialization, for the flat POP of length 4, we derive an explicit rational generating function that captures the distribution of six statistics, with a numerator containing 100 monomials and a denominator containing 19 monomials.</description>

      <title>On Laplacian and Signless Laplacian Permanental Polynomials of Some Well-known Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The permanent of an $n \times n$ matrix $M = (m_{ij})$ is defined as $\mathrm{per}(M) = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \prod_{i=1}^n m_{i,\sigma(i)}$, where $S_n$ denotes the symmetric group on $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. The permanental polynomial of $M$, is defined by $\psi(M;x) = \mathrm{per}(xI_n - M)$. We study two fundamental variants: the Laplacian permanental polynomial $\psi(L(G);x)$ and signless Laplacian permanental polynomial $\psi(Q(G);x)$ of a graph $G$. A graph is said to be {determined} by its (signless) Laplacian permanental polynomial if no other non-isomorphic graph shares the same polynomial. A graph is combinedly determined when isomorphism is guaranteed by the equality of both polynomials. Characterizing which graphs are determined by their(signless) Laplacian permanental polynomials is an interesting problem. This paper investigates the permanental characterization problem for several families of starlike graphs, including: spider graphs (tree), coconut tree, perfect binary tree, corona product of $C_m$ and $K_n$, and $\bar K_n$ for various values of $m$ and $n$. We establish which of these graphs are determined by their Laplacian or signless Laplacian permanental polynomials, and which require both polynomials for complete characterization. We emphasize that in this manuscript, we have considered a few techniques to compute the permanental polynomial of matrices and their propagation.</description>

      <title>Ideally Connected Cographs and Chordal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For distinct vertices $u,v$ in a graph $G$, let $\kappa_G(u,v)$ denote the maximum number of internally disjoint $u$-$v$ paths in $G$. Then, $\kappa_G(u,v) \leq \min\{ \mbox{deg}_G(u), \mbox{deg}_G(v) \}$. If equality is attained for every pair of vertices in $G$, then $G$ is called ideally connected. In this paper, we characterize the ideally connected graphs in two well-known graph classes: the cographs and the chordal graphs. We show that the ideally connected cographs are precisely the $2K_2$-free cographs, and the ideally connected chordal graphs are precisely the threshold graphs, the graphs that can be constructed from the single-vertex graph by repeatedly adding either an isolated vertex or a dominating vertex.</description>

      <title>Spectra of Corona Products of Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two types of corona products for simple directed graphs are introduced, extending the classical notions from the undirected setting: the vertex-corona and the arc-corona. Their structural and spectral properties are investigated through the use of digraph coronals, with particular emphasis on the adjacency, Laplacian, and signless Laplacian spectra. Finally, the coronals corresponding to these three matrices are computed for several families of digraphs.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic 4-AP avoidance in 2-colorings of Z/pZ for primes 5 &lt;= p &lt;= 997</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 2-colorings of Z/pZ that avoid monochromatic 4-term arithmetic progressions for every step d with p not dividing d. We completely classify all primes 5 &lt;= p &lt;= 997: such a coloring exists if and only if p is in {5, 7, 11}. For larger primes, nonexistence is consistent with lower bounds of Wolf and Lu--Peng on the number of monochromatic 4-APs in 2-colorings of Z_p. When solutions exist, the minimal period equals p, and we enumerate them up to dihedral symmetries and a global color swap. The proofs combine residue-class checks with small structural observations and SAT certificates for nonexistence (DRAT-verified). All scripts and proof logs are provided for exact reproduction.</description>

      <title>On Intersection and Co-maximal Hypergraph of $\mathbb{Z}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study the intersection hypergraph $\tilde{\Gamma}_\mathcal{H}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$ and co-maximal hypergraph $Co_\mathcal{H}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$ on the subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_n$. We prove that the intersection and co-maximal hypergraph of a finite abelian group are isomorphic. Hence, we focus on $\tilde{\Gamma}_\mathcal{H}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$ and examine some of the structural properties, viz., diameter, girth and chromatic number of $\tilde{\Gamma}_\mathcal{H}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$. Also, we provide characterizations for hypertrees, star structures of $\tilde{\Gamma}_\mathcal{H}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$, and investigate the planarity and non-planarity of $\tilde{\Gamma}_\mathcal{H}(\mathbb{Z}_n)$.</description>

      <title>The Story of Sunflowers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sunflowers, or $\Delta$-systems, are a fundamental concept in combinatorics introduced by Erd\H{o}s and Rado in their paper: {\em Intersection theorems for systems of sets}, J. Lond. Math. Soc. (1) {\bf 35} (1960), 85--90. A sunflower is a collection of sets where all pairs have the same intersection. This paper explores the wide-ranging applications of sunflowers in computer science and combinatorics. We discuss recent progress towards the sunflower conjecture and present a short elementary proof of the best known bounds for the robust sunflower lemma.</description>

Abstract: We give a bijection between the point-hyperplane antiflags of $V(n, 2)$ and the non-singular points of $V(2n, 2)$ with respect to a hyperbolic quadric. With the help of this bijection, we give a description of the strongly regular graph $NO^+(2n, 2)$ in $V(2n, 2)$. We also describe a graph in $V(2n, 2)$ that was recently defined by Stanley and Takeda in $V(n, 2)$.</description>

      <title>On 3-Connected Cubic Planar Graphs and their Strong Embeddings on Orientable Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the strong embedding of a 3-connected planar graph $G$ on the sphere is unique, $G$ can have different inequivalent strong embeddings on a surface of positive genus. If $G$ is cubic, then the strong embeddings of $G$ on the projective plane, the torus and the Klein bottle each are in one-to-one correspondence with certain subgraphs of the dual graph $G^\ast$. Here, we exploit this characterisation and show that two strong embeddings of $G$ on the projective plane, the torus or the Klein bottle are isomorphic if and only if the corresponding subgraphs of $G^{\ast}$ are contained in the same orbit under $\mathrm{Aut}(G^{\ast})$. This allows us to construct a data base containing all isomorphism classes of strong embeddings on the projective plane, the torus and the Klein bottle of all 3-connected cubic planar graphs with up to 22 vertices. Moreover, we establish that cyclically 4-edge connected cubic planar graphs can be strongly embedded on orientable surfaces of positive genera. We use this to show that a 3-connected cubic planar graph has no strong embedding on orientable surfaces of positive genera if and only if it is the dual of an Apollonian network.</description>

      <title>Approximations of the strict order property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe that the definition of Shelah's classical $\mathrm{NSOP}_{n}$ hierarchy for first-order theories, for integers $n \geq 3$, can be restated so that it extends to the case where $n$ is replaced with any real number $r \geq 3$. Using this observation, we define a potentially larger family of properties $\mathrm{NSOP}_{r}$ for real numbers $r \geq 3$. Motivated by the question of whether the integer-valued and real-valued hierarchies are distinct, we translate these hierarchies into the setting of hereditary classes, obtaining a new real-valued quantity of independent combinatorial interest, $\mathfrak{o}(\mathcal{H})$, associated with any hereditary class $\mathcal{H}$. We show that, when $\mathcal{H}$ is defined by a finite family of forbidden weakly embedded substructures, $\mathfrak{o}(\mathcal{H})$ is an integer.
  While Malliaris implicitly showed that the properties $\mathrm{NSOP}_{n}$ are equivalent to closure under helix maps between graphs, both our observation that the properties $\mathrm{NSOP}_{n}$ can be restated so that $n$ can be replaced with any real number at least $3$, and our result that $\mathfrak{o}(\mathcal{H})$ is an integer when $\mathcal{H}$ is a hereditary class defined by a finite family of forbidden weakly embedded substructures, are even exhibited by a special class of helix maps, the interval helix maps. These are helix maps that respect the direction of edges, and whose regions are disjoint unions of linearly ordered sets without any edges between them. Toward showing the conjectural claim that $\mathfrak{o}(\mathcal{H})$ is not an integer in general, and therefore that the real-valued $\mathrm{NSOP}_{r}$ hierarchy is distinct from the integer-valued $\mathrm{NSOP}_{n}$ hierarchy at the level of hereditary classes, we show that the statement that $\mathfrak{o}(\mathcal{H})$ is an integer in general cannot be exhibited by interval helix maps.</description>

      <title>A sum rule for derangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a sum rule for derangements. Three different proofs are provided. The first one involves integral representations and the second one relies on the Hermite identity for the integer part of the product of an integer by a real number. The third one, which, unlike the previous ones, is not based on induction, proceeds directly from a recurrence relation for the number of derangements.</description>

      <title>The Serre depth of Stanley--Reisner Rings and the depth of their symbolic powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an invariant, called the Serre depth, from the perspective of combinatorial commutative algebra. In this paper, we establish several properties of an analogue of the depth of Stanley--Reisner rings. In particular, we relate the Serre depth both to the minimal free resolution of a Stanley--Reisner ring and to that of its Alexander dual. Also, we establish an analogue of a known result that describes the depth of Stanley--Reisner rings in terms of skeletons. Moreover, we study the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ and the depth on the symbolic powers of Stanley--Reisner ideals. It had been an open question whether the depth of the symbolic powers of Stanley--Reisner ideals satisfies a non-increasing property, but Nguyen and Trung provided a negative answer. We construct an example that the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ and the depth do not satisfy this property and its second symbolic power is Cohen--Macaulay. Moreover, we prove that the sequence of the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ on the symbolic powers is convergent and that its limit coincides with the minimum value. Finally, we study the Serre depth on edge and cover ideals. Whether the depth on symbolic powers of edge ideals satisfies a non-increasing property has remained an open question. We address a related problem and show that the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ on edge ideals of any well-covered graph satisfies a non-increasing property. In addition, we prove that the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ on the cover ideals of any graph also satisfies a non-increasing property. Moreover, we determine the Serre depth on edge ideals of very well-covered graphs.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Drmota-Verwee's effective Erdos-Wintner theorem for Zeckendorf expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the effective Erdos-Wintner theorem for Zeckendorf expansions. Drmota and the author obtained a uniform Kolmogorov bound whose error involves $T\sum_{j&gt;L-2h}|f(F_j)|$, which assumes absolute convergence of the linear tail $\sum_j f(F_j)$. We remove this assumption. Grouping the transfer matrices in pairs and working to second order on the logarithm of the product, after extracting the common linear phase along the dominant direction, yields a quadratic tail $T^2\sum_{j&gt;L-2h} f(F_j)^2$, or, in a flexible variant, the split tail $T\sum_{|f(F_j)|&gt;1/T}|f(F_j)| + T^2\sum_{|f(F_j)|\le 1/T} f(F_j)^2$. Either form requires only $\sum f(F_j)^2&lt;\infty$.</description>

Abstract: We show that a one-ended, locally finite, measurable graph on a standard probability space admits a measurable one-ended spanning subtree if and only if it is measure-hyperfinite. This answers a question posed by Bowen, Poulin, and Zomback and extends recent results of Tim\'ar and Conley, Gaboriau, Marks, and Tucker-Drob.</description>

      <title>($\mathfrak{S}_p \times \mathfrak{S}_q$)-Invariant Graphical Parking Functions</title>

Abstract: Graphical parking functions, or $G$-parking functions, are a generalization of classical parking functions which depend on a connected multigraph $G$ having a distinguished root vertex. Gaydarov and Hopkins characterized the relationship between $G$-parking functions and another vector-dependent generalization of parking functions, the $\boldsymbol{u}$-parking functions. The crucial component of their result was their classification of all graphs $G$ whose $G$-parking functions are invariant under action by the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$, where $n+1$ is the order of $G$. In this work, we present a 2-dimensional analogue of Gaydarov and Hopkins' results by characterizing the overlap between $G$-parking functions and 2-dimensional $\boldsymbol{U}$-parking functions, i.e., pairs of integer sequences whose order statistics are bounded by certain weights along lattice paths in the plane. Our key result is a total classification of all $G$ whose set of $G$-parking functions is $(\mathfrak{S}_p \times \mathfrak{S}_q)$-invariant, where $p+q+1$ is the order of $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\sigma$ be a primitive substitution on an alphabet $\mathcal{A}$, and let $\mathcal{W}_n$ be the set of words of length $n$ determined by $\sigma$ (i.e., $w \in \mathcal{W}_n$ if $w$ is a subword of $\sigma^k(a)$ for some $a \in \mathcal{A}$ and $k \geq 1$). It is known that the corresponding substitution dynamical system is loosely Kronecker (also known as zero-entropy loosely Bernoulli), so the diameter of $\mathcal{W}_n$ in the edit distance is $o(n)$. We improve this upper bound to $O(n/\sqrt{\log n})$. The main challenge is handling the case where $\sigma$ is non-uniform; a better bound is available for the uniform case. Finally, we show that for the Thue--Morse substitution, the diameter of $\mathcal{W}_n$ is at least $\sqrt {n/6} - 1$.</description>

      <title>Minimal codes from hypersurfaces in even characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02278v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The setting of projective systems can be used to study the parameters of a projective linear code $\mathcal{C}$. This can be done by considering the intersections of the point set $\Omega$ defined by the columns of a generating matrix for $\mathcal{C}$ with the hyperplanes of a projective space. In particular, $\mathcal{C}$ is minimal if $\Omega$ is cutting, i.e., every hyperplane is spanned by its intersection with $\Omega$. Minimal linear codes have important applications for secret sharing schemes and secure two-party computation. In this article we first investigate the properties of some algebraic hypersurfaces $\mathcal{V}_{\varepsilon}^r$ related to certain quasi-Hermitian varieties of $\mathrm{PG}(r,q^2)$, with $q=2^e$, $e&gt;1$ odd. These varieties give rise to a new infinite family of linear codes which are minimal except for $r=3$ and $e\equiv 1 \pmod 4$. In the case $r \in \{3,4\}$, we exhibit codes having at most 6 non-zero weights whose we provide the complete list. As a byproduct, we obtain $(r+1)$-dimensional codes with just $3$ non-zero weights. We point out that linear codes with few weights are also important in authentication codes and association schemes. In the last part of the paper we consider an extension of the notion of being cutting with respect to subspaces other than hyperplanes and introduce the definition of cutting gap in order to characterize and measure what happens when this property is not satisfied. Finally, we then apply these notions to Hermitian codes and to the codes related to $\mathcal{V}_\varepsilon^r$ discussed before.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of Even-Valent Graphs on Riemann Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using connections to random matrix theory and orthogonal polynomials, we develop a framework for obtaining explicit closed-form formulae for the number, $\mathscr{N}_{g}(2\nu,j)$, of connected $2\nu$-valent labeled graphs with $j$ vertices that can be embedded on a compact Riemann surface of minimal genus $g$. We also derive formulae for their two-legged counterparts $\mathcal{N}_{g}(2\nu,j)$. Our method recovers the known explicit results for graphs embedded on the plane and the torus, and extends them to all genera $g \geq 2$. In earlier work, Ercolani, Lega, and Tippings (2023) showed that $\mathscr{N}_{g}(2\nu,j)$ and $\mathcal{N}_{g}(2\nu,j)$ admit structural expressions as linear combinations of, respectively, $3g-2$ and $3g$ Gauss hypergeometric functions ${}_2F_1$, but with coefficients left undetermined. The framework developed here provides a systematic procedure to compute these coefficients, thereby turning the structural expressions into fully explicit formulae for $\mathscr{N}_{g}(2\nu,j)$ and $\mathcal{N}_{g}(2\nu,j)$ as functions of both $j$ and $\nu$. Detailed results are given for $g=2,3,$ and $4$, and the framework extends naturally to all $g \geq 5$ with increasing computational effort. This closes the fixed genus combinatorics for even-valent graphs.</description>

      <title>The Erd\H{o}s-Rado Sunflower Problem for Vector Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The famous Erd\H{o}s-Rado sunflower conjecture suggests that an $s$-sun\-flower-free family of $k$-element sets has size at most $(Cs)^k$ for some absolute constant $C$. In this note, we investigate the analog problem for $k$-spaces over the field with $q$ elements. For $s \geq k+1$, we show that the largest $s$-sunflower-free family $\mathcal{F}$ satisfies
  \[
  1 \leq |\mathcal{F}| / q^{(s-1) \binom{k+1}{2} - k} \leq (q/(q-1))^k.
  \] For $s \leq k$, we show that
  \[
  q^{-\binom{k+1}{2}} \leq |\mathcal{F}| / q^{(s-1) \binom{k+1}{2} - k} \leq (q/(q-1))^k.
  \] Our lower bounds rely on an iterative construction that uses lifted maximum rank-distance (MRD) codes.</description>

Abstract: We show that a smooth $d$-manifold $M$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb R^d$ if it admits a Lyapunov-Reeb function, i.e., a smooth map $f:M\to\mathbb R$ that is proper, lower-bounded, and has a unique critical point. By constructing such functions, we prove that the moduli spaces of self-avoiding polygonal linkages and configurations are diffeomorphic to Euclidean spaces. This resolves the Refined Carpenter's Rule Problem and confirms a conjecture proposed by Gonz\'{a}lez and Sedano-Mendoza. Furthermore, we describe foliation structures of these moduli spaces via level sets of Lyapunov-Reeb functions and develop algorithms for related problems.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ denote a finite field with $q$ elements. Let $n,k$ denote integers with $n&gt;2k\geq 6$. Let $V$ denote a vector space over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ that has dimension $n$. The vertex set of the Grassmann graph $J_q(n,k)$ consists of the $k$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. Two vertices of $J_q(n,k)$ are adjacent whenever their intersection has dimension $k-1$. Let $\partial$ denote the path-length distance function of $J_q(n,k)$. Pick a vertex $y$. In this paper we define three types of edges in $X$, namely type $0$, type $+$, and type $-$; for adjacent vertices $w,z$ such that $\partial(w,y)=\partial(z,y)$, the type of the edge $wz$ depends on the subspaces $w+z,w,z,w\cap z$ and their intersections with $y$. Pick a vertex $x$ such that $1&lt;\partial(x,y)&lt;k$. Let $\Gamma(x)$ denote the local graph of $x$ in $J_q(n,k)$. Our general goal is to count the number of edges in $\Gamma(x)$ for each type. Consider a two-vertex stabilizer $\text{Stab}(x,y)$ in $GL(V)$; it is known that the $\text{Stab}(x,y)$-action on $\Gamma(x)$ has five orbits. Pick two orbits $\mathcal{O},\mathcal{N}$ that are not necessarily distinct; for a given $w\in \mathcal{O}$, we find the number of vertices in $z\in \mathcal{N}$ such that the edge $wz$ has (i) type $0$, (ii) type $+$, (iii) type $-$. To find these numbers, we use many results that involve a projective geometry $P_q(n)$, which is the set of all subspaces of $V$.</description>

      <title>Representation theory for polymatroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of representations of (discrete) polymatroids over tracts in terms of Pl\"ucker coordinates and suitable Pl\"ucker relations. As special cases, we recover polymatroids themselves as polymatroid representations over the Krasner hyperfield K and M-convex functions as polymatroid representations over the tropical hyperfield.
  We introduce and study several useful operations for polymatroid representations, such as translation and refined notions of minors and duality which have better properties than the existing definitions; for example, deletion and contraction become dual operations (up to translation) in our setting. We also prove an idempotency principle which asserts that polymatroids which are not translates of matroids are representable only over tracts that are idempotent in a certain specific sense (in particular -1 = 1).
  The space of all representations of a polymatroid J, which we call the thin Schubert cell of J, is represented by an algebraic object called {universal tract of J. When we restrict to just the 3-term Pl\"ucker relations, we obtain the weak thin Schubert cell, and passing to torus orbits yields the realization space. These are represented by the universal pasture and the foundation of J, respectively. We exhibit a canonical bijection between the universal tract and the universal pasture, which is new even in the case of matroids, and we show that the foundation of a polymatroid is generated by cross ratios. We also describe a (possibly incomplete) list of multiplicative relations between cross ratios.
  Thin Schubert cells and realization spaces are canonically embedded in certain tori. Over idempotent tracts, we show that thin Schubert cells contain a canonical torus orbit and split naturally as a product of the realization space with this distinguished torus.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian polynomials and matroids over triangular hyperfields 1: Topological aspects</title>

Abstract: Lorentzian polynomials serve as a bridge between continuous and discrete convexity, connecting analysis and combinatorics. In this article, we study the topology of the space $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ of Lorentzian polynomials on $J$ modulo $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$, which is nonempty if and only if $J$ is the set of bases of a polymatroid. We prove that $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ is a manifold with boundary of dimension equal to the Tutte rank of $J$, and more precisely, that it is homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball with the Dressian of $J$ removed from its boundary. Furthermore, we show that $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ is homeomorphic to the thin Schubert cell $\textrm{Gr}_J(\mathbb{T}_q)$ of $J$ over the triangular hyperfield $\mathbb{T}_q$, introduced by Viro in the context of tropical geometry and Maslov dequantization, for any $q&gt;0$. This identification enables us to apply the representation theory of polymatroids developed in a companion paper, as well as earlier work by the first and fourth authors on foundations of matroids, to give a simple explicit description of $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ up to homeomorphism in several key cases. Our results show that $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ always admits a compactification homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball. They can also be used to answer a question of Br\"and\'en in the negative by showing that the closure of $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ within the space of all polynomials modulo $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ is not homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball in general. In addition, we introduce the Hausdorff compactification of the space of rescaling classes of Lorentzian polynomials and show that the Chow quotient of a complex Grassmannian maps naturally to this compactification. This provides a geometric framework that connects the asymptotic structure of the space of Lorentzian polynomials with classical constructions in algebraic geometry.</description>

Abstract: Building upon the work of Berglund (2018), we establish a method for constructing subsets $B \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{mk}$ such that $B$ does not contain any $k$-term cyclic arithmetic progressions mod $mk$, where $m,k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ with $k \geq 3$. This construction thereby provides concrete lower bounds for the maximum size of such subsets. Additionally, it allows us to tightly bound specific chromatic numbers $\chi(mk,k)$ of $\mathbb{Z}_{mk}$ and helps increase the lower bounds of certain cyclic Van der Waerden numbers $W_{c}(k,r)$, originally introduced by Burkert and Johnson (2011) as a way of bounding the standard Van der Waerden numbers $W(k,r)$ from below for $r \geq 2$.</description>

Abstract: Let $D(G)$ be the distance matrix of a simple connected graph $G$. The Hadamard product $D(G)~\circ~ D(G)$ is called the squared distance matrix of $G$, and is denoted by $\Delta(G)$. A simple connected graph is called a starlike block graph if it has a central cut vertex, and each of its blocks is a complete graph. Let $ \mathcal{S}(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_b)$ be the starlike block graph with blocks $K_{n_1+1}, K_{n_2+1}, \ldots, K_{n_b+1} $ on $n=1 + \sum_{i=1}^b n_i$ vertices. In this article, we compute the determinant of $\Delta( \mathcal{S}(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_b))$ and find its inverse as a rank-one perturbation of a positive semidefinite Laplacian-like matrix $\mathcal{L}$ with rank $n-1$. We also investigate the inertia of $\Delta( \mathcal{S}(n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_b))$. Furthermore, for a fixed value of $ n $ and $ b $, we determine the extremal graphs that uniquely attain the maximum and minimum spectral radius of the squared distance matrix for starlike block graphs on $ n $ vertices and $ b $ blocks.</description>

      <title>On the Identity and Group Problems for Complex Heisenberg Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Identity Problem, the problem of determining if a finitely generated semigroup of matrices contains the identity matrix; see Problem 3 (Chapter 10.3) in ``Unsolved Problems in Mathematical Systems and Control Theory'' by Blondel and Megretski (2004). This fundamental problem is known to be undecidable for $\mathbb{Z}^{4 \times 4}$ and decidable for $\mathbb{Z}^{2 \times 2}$. The Identity Problem has been recently shown to be in polynomial time by Dong for the Heisenberg group over complex numbers in any fixed dimension with the use of Lie algebra and the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. We develop alternative proof techniques for the problem making a step forward towards more general problems such as the Membership Problem. Using our techniques we also show that the problem of determining if a given set of Heisenberg matrices generates a group can be decided in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Bangle functions are the generic basis for cluster algebras from punctured surfaces with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any possibly-punctured surface with non-empty boundary $\mathbf{\Sigma}=(\Sigma, \mathbb{M}, \mathbb{P})$, and any tagged triangulation $T$ of $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ in the sense of Fomin--Shapiro--Thurston, the coefficient-free bangle functions of Musiker--Schiffler--Williams coincide with the coefficient-free generic Caldero--Chapoton functions arising from the Jacobian algebra of the quiver with potential $(Q(T), W(T))$ associated to $T$ by Cerulli Irelli and the second author.
  When the set of boundary marked points $\mathbb{M}$ has at least two elements, Schr\"oer and the first two authors have shown, relying heavily on results of Mills, Muller and Qin, that the generic coefficient-free Caldero-Chapoton functions form a basis of the coefficient-free (upper) cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{\Sigma})=\mathcal{U}(\mathbf{\Sigma})$. So, the set of bangle functions proposed by Musiker--Schiffler--Williams over ten years ago is indeed a basis.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial flats and Schubert varieties of subspace arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lattice of flats $\mathcal L_M$ of a matroid $M$ is combinatorially well-behaved and, when $M$ is realizable, admits a geometric model in the form of a "Schubert variety of hyperplane arrangement". In contrast, the lattice of flats of a polymatroid exhibits many combinatorial pathologies and admits no similar geometric model.
  We address this situation by defining the lattice $\mathcal L_P$ of "combinatorial flats" of a polymatroid $P$. Combinatorially, $\mathcal L_P$ exhibits good behavior analogous to that of $\mathcal L_M$: it is graded, determines $P$ when $P$ is simple, and is top-heavy. When $P$ is realizable over a field of characteristic 0, we show that $\mathcal L_P$ is modeled by "the Schubert variety of a subspace arrangement".
  Our work generalizes a number of results of Ardila-Boocher and Huh-Wang on Schubert varieties of hyperplane arrangements; however, the geometry of Schubert varieties of subspace arrangements is noticeably more complicated than that of Schubert varieties of hyperplane arrangements. Many natural questions remain open.</description>

      <title>Learning the symmetric group: large from small</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning explorations can make significant inroads into solving difficult problems in pure mathematics. One advantage of this approach is that mathematical datasets do not suffer from noise, but a challenge is the amount of data required to train these models and that this data can be computationally expensive to generate. Key challenges further comprise difficulty in a posteriori interpretation of statistical models and the implementation of deep and abstract mathematical problems.
  We propose a method for scalable tasks, by which models trained on simpler versions of a task can then generalize to the full task. Specifically, we demonstrate that a transformer neural-network trained on predicting permutations from words formed by general transpositions in the symmetric group $S_{10}$ can generalize to the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with near 100\% accuracy. We also show that $S_{10}$ generalizes to $S_{16}$ with similar performance if we only use adjacent transpositions. We employ identity augmentation as a key tool to manage variable word lengths, and partitioned windows for training on adjacent transpositions. Finally we compare variations of the method used and discuss potential challenges with extending the method to other tasks.</description>

      <title>The $\mathbb{S}_n$-equivariant Chow polynomial of the Braid matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the generating function for the $\mathbb{S}_n$-equivariant Chow polynomials of the braid matroid $B_n$, using a modular interpretation of this polynomial recently given by Devkota, Robotis, and Zahariuc. We also give a new modular interpretation of the numerical Chow polynomial of $B_n$ in terms of a certain moduli space of genus-zero relative stable maps to $\mathbb{P}^1$.</description>

      <title>On a magneto-spectral invariant on finite graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a magneto-spectral invariant for finite graphs. This invariant vanishes on trees and is maximized by complete graphs. We compute this invariant for cycles, complete graphs, wheel graphs and suspensions of trees and derive various lower and upper bounds. We discuss the behaviour of this invariant under various graph operations and investigate relations to the spectral gap.</description>

      <title>On the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture in Characteristics $\ell \equiv 3\pmod{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a prime $p$, the $p$-adic Littlewood Conjecture stands as a well-known arithmetic variant of the celebrated Littlewood Conjecture in Diophantine Approximation. In the same way as the latter, it admits a natural function field analogue depending on the choice of an irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ with coefficients in a field $\mathbb{K}$. This analogue is referred to as the $P(t)$-adic Littlewood Conjecture ($P(t)$-LC for short).
  $P(t)$-LC is proved to fail for any choice of irreducible polynomial $P(t)$ over any ground field $\mathbb{K}$ with characteristic $ \ell \equiv 3\pmod{4}$. The counterexample refuting it is shown to present a local arithmetic obstruction emerging from the fact that -1 is not a quadratic residue modulo a prime $\ell\equiv 3\pmod{4}$.
  The theory developed elucidates and generalises all previous approaches towards refuting the conjecture. They were all based on the computer-assisted method initiated by Adiceam, Nesharim and Lunnon (2021) which has been able to establish that $P(t)$-LC fails in some small characteristics (essentially up to 11). This computer-assisted method is, however, unable to provide a general statement as it relies on ad hoc computer verifications which, provided they terminate, refute $P(t)$--LC in a given characteristic. This limitation is overcome by exhibiting an arithmetic obstruction to the validity of $P(t)$--LC in infinitely many characteristics.
  The existence of arithmetic obstructions within the context of $P(t)$--LC leaves the remaining case of odd characteristics $ \ell\equiv 1\pmod{4}$ dependent on their determination. This is shown to hold in an effective and explicit way.</description>

      <title>Parities in random Latin squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a Latin square, every row can be interpreted as a permutation, and therefore has a parity (even or odd). We prove that in a uniformly random $n\times n$ Latin square, the $n$ row parities are very well approximated by a sequence of $n$ independent unbiased coin flips: for example, the total variation error of this approximation tends to zero as $n\to\infty$. This resolves a conjecture of Cameron. In fact, we prove a generalisation of Cameron's conjecture for the joint distribution of the row parities, column parities and symbol parities (the latter are defined by the symmetry between rows, columns and symbols of a Latin square).
  Along the way, we introduce several general techniques for the study of random Latin squares, including a new re-randomisation technique via `stable intercalate switchings', and a new approximation theorem comparing random Latin squares with a certain independent model.</description>

      <title>4-uniform Maker-Breaker and Maker-Maker games are PSPACE-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two positional games where two players take turns picking a previously unpicked vertex of a hypergraph $H$. We say a player fills an edge of $H$ if that player has picked all the vertices of that edge. In the Maker-Maker game, whoever first fills an edge wins, or we get a draw if no edge is filled. In the Maker-Breaker game, the first player aims at filling an edge while the second player aims at preventing the first player from filling an edge. We show that, for both games, deciding whether the first player has a winning strategy is a PSPACE-complete problem even when restricted to 4-uniform hypergraphs. For the Maker-Maker game, this improves on a previous result for hypergraphs of rank 4. For the Maker-Breaker game, this improves on a previous result for 5-uniform hypergraphs, and closes the complexity gap as the problem for hypergraphs of rank 3 is known to be solvable in polynomial time.</description>
