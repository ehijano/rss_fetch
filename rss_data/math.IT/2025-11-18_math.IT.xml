      <title>Guessing Decoding of Short Blocklength Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future beyond-5G and 6G systems demand ultra-reliable, low-latency communication with short blocklengths, motivating the development of universal decoding algorithms. Guessing decoding, which infers the noise or codeword candidate in order of decreasing (exact or approximate) likelihood, offers a universal framework applicable to short codes. In this paper, we present a unified treatment of two prominent recent families of guessing decoding: guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) and guessing codeword decoding (GCD). For each, we (i) present algorithmic implementations and ordering strategies; (ii) prove maximum-likelihood (ML) optimality under appropriate stopping criteria; (iii) derive saddle-point approximations for the average number of queries; and (iv) validate theoretical predictions with simulations. We further analyze the performance degradation due to limited search budgets relative to ML performance, compare key metrics (worst-case and average complexity, hardware considerations), and highlight how advances in one approach transfer naturally to the other. Our results clarify the operating regimes where GRAND and GCD demonstrate superior performance. This work provides both theoretical insights and practical guidelines for deploying universal guessing decoders in next-generation short-blocklength communications.</description>

      <title>Tight Lower Bounds on the Bandwidth Cost of MDS Convertible Codes in the Split Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in erasure coding for distributed storage systems have demonstrated that adapting redundancy to varying disk failure rates can lead to substantial storage savings. Such adaptation requires code conversion, wherein data encoded under an initial $[k^I + r^I, k^I]$ code is transformed into data encoded under a final $[k^F + r^F, k^F]$ code - an operation that can be resource-intensive. Convertible codes are a class of codes designed to facilitate this transformation efficiently while preserving desirable properties such as the MDS property. In this work, we investigate the fundamental limits on the bandwidth cost of conversion (total amount of data transferred between the storage nodes during conversion) for systematic MDS convertible codes. Specifically, we study the subclass of conversions known as the split regime (a single initial codeword is converted into multiple final codewords).
  In this setting, prior to this work, the best known lower bounds on the bandwidth cost of conversion for all parameters were derived by Maturana and Rashmi under certain uniformity assumptions on the number of symbols downloaded from each node. Further, these bounds were shown to be tight for the parameter regime where $r^F \geq k^F$ or $r^I \leq r^F$. In this work, we derive lower bounds on the bandwidth cost of systematic MDS convertible codes for all parameters in the split regime without the uniformity assumption. Moreover, our bounds are tight for the broader parameter regime where $r^F \geq k^F$ or $r^I \leq k^F$. Subsequently, our bounds also partially resolve the conjecture proposed by Maturana and Rashmi. We employ a novel information-theoretic framework, which assumes only that the initial and final codes are systematic and does not rely on any linearity assumptions or the aforementioned uniformity assumptions.</description>

      <title>Integration of Navigation and Remote Sensing in LEO Satellite Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations are becoming a cornerstone of next-generation satellite networks, enabling worldwide high-precision navigation and high-quality remote sensing. This paper proposes a novel dual-function LEO satellite constellation frame structure that effectively integrating navigation and remote sensing. Then, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB)-based positioning, velocity measurement, and timing (PVT) error and the signal-to-ambiguity-interference-noise ratio (SAINR) are derived as performance metrics for navigation and remote sensing, respectively. Based on it, a joint beamforming design is proposed by minimizing the average weighted PVT error for navigation user equipments (UEs) while ensuring SAINR requirement for remote sensing. Simulation results validate the proposed multi-satellite cooperative beamforming design, demonstrating its effectiveness as an integrated solution for next-generation multi-function LEO satellite constellations.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-Enabled Superheterodyne Transmitter With Decoupled Harmonic-Free Signal Generation and Precoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of programmable metasurfaces (PM) from passive beamforming to active information transmission marks a paradigm shift for next-generation wireless systems. However, this transition is hindered by fundamental limitations in conventional metasurface transmitter architectures, including restricted modulation orders, symbol-level spatial inconsistency, and significant harmonic interference. These issues stem from the intrinsic coupling between baseband signal processing and radio-frequency beamforming in monolithic designs reliant on simplistic switching mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel metasurface-enabled superheterodyne architecture (MSA) that fundamentally decouples these functionalities. The MSA introduces a dual-stage up-conversion process, comprising a digital up-conversion module for in-phase/quadrature modulation and baseband-to-intermediate frequency conversion, a precoder module for precoding, and a custom-designed magnitude-phase-decoupled metasurface that acts as a reconfigurable reflective mixer array. This decoupling of harmonic-free waveform generation from spatial precoding overcomes the critical drawbacks of existing approaches. Experimental results from a 5.8 GHz proof-of-concept prototype system validate the MSA's superior performance. The system generates spatially isotropic constellations for arbitrary-order QAM modulations, ensures consistent time-frequency signatures for applications like Doppler-spoofing, and achieves data rates up to 20 Mbps within a linear operating region that minimizes nonlinear distortion. The capability of employing spatial diversity and multi-stream interference cancellation has been demonstrated for the first time in a PM-based transmitter.</description>

      <title>Leave-One-Out Learning with Log-Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study batch learning with log-loss in the individual setting, where the outcome sequence is deterministic. Because empirical statistics are not directly applicable in this regime, obtaining regret guarantees for batch learning has long posed a fundamental challenge. We propose a natural criterion based on leave-one-out regret and analyze its minimax value for several hypothesis classes. For the multinomial simplex over $m$ symbols, we show that the minimax regret is $\frac{m-1}{N} + o\!\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)$, and compare it to the stochastic realizable case where it is $\frac{m-1}{2N} + o\!\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)$. More generally, we prove that every hypothesis class of VC dimension $d$ is learnable in the individual batch-learning problem, with regret at most $\frac{d\log(N)}{N} + o\!\left(\frac{\log(N)}{N}\right)$, and we establish matching lower bounds for certain classes. We further derive additional upper bounds that depend on structural properties of the hypothesis class. These results establish, for the first time, that universal batch learning with log-loss is possible in the individual setting.</description>

      <title>Finite-Horizon Quickest Change Detection Balancing Latency with False Alarm Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite-horizon variant of the quickest change detection (QCD) problem that is of relevance to learning in non-stationary environments is studied. The metric characterizing false alarms is the probability of a false alarm occurring before the horizon ends. The metric that characterizes the delay is \emph{latency}, which is the smallest value such that the probability that detection delay exceeds this value is upper bounded to a predetermined latency level. The objective is to minimize the latency (at a given latency level), while maintaining a low false alarm probability. Under the pre-specified latency and false alarm levels, a universal lower bound on the latency, which any change detection procedure needs to satisfy, is derived. Change detectors are then developed, which are order-optimal in terms of the horizon. The case where the pre- and post-change distributions are known is considered first, and then the results are generalized to the non-parametric case when they are unknown except that they are sub-Gaussian with different means. Simulations are provided to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit Beamforming and Reflection Optimization for Beyond Diagonal RIS Aided Multi-Cell MIMO Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will rely on ultra-dense multi-cell deployment to meet the high rate and connectivity demands. However, frequency reuse leads to severe inter-cell interference, particularly for cell-edge users, which limits the communication performance. To overcome this challenge, we investigate a beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) aided multi-cell multi-user downlink MIMO communication system, where a BD-RIS is deployed to enhance desired signals and suppress both intra-cell and inter-cell interference.We formulate the joint optimization problem of the transmit beamforming matrices at the BSs and the BD-RIS reflection matrix to maximize the weighted sum rate of all users, subject to the challenging unitary constraint of the BD-RIS reflection matrix and transmit power constraints at the BSs. To tackle this non-convex and difficult problem, we apply the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) method to transform the problem into an equivalent tractable form, and propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm to iteratively update the transmit beamforming and BD-RIS reflection using Lagrange duality theory and manifold optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed design over various benchmark schemes, and provide useful practical insights on the BD-RIS deployment strategy for multi-cell systems.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity of Pixel Antenna based MIMO Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pixel antenna is a promising technology to enhance the wireless communication data rate by adaptively reconfiguring each antenna's radiation pattern via a so-called antenna coding technique which controls the states of switches connected to multiple pixel ports. This paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system where both the transmitter and the receiver are equipped with multiple pixel antennas. We aim to characterize the fundamental capacity limit of this MIMO system by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the antenna coders at both the transmitter and the receiver. This problem is a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) which is non-convex and particularly challenging to solve due to the binary-valued optimization variables corresponding to the antenna coders. We first propose an exhaustive search based method to obtain the optimal solution to this problem, which corresponds to the fundamental capacity limit. Then, we propose a branch-and-bound based iterative algorithm aiming to find a high-quality suboptimal solution with lower complexity than exhaustive search as the number of pixel ports becomes large. Finally, we devise an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm with polynomial complexity. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve a flexible trade-off between performance and complexity. Moreover, equipping the transceivers with pixel antennas can enhance the achievable rate of MIMO communications.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic Dimension Property of Twisted Goppa Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a large-scale computational study on the dimensional properties of twisted Goppa codes. Through the systematic analysis of over 50,000 parameter sets, we uncover a remarkable deterministic regularity: the actual dimension k of a twisted Goppa code is uniquely determined by a set of macro-parameters (q,m,t,b,u). Specifically, when the order of the finite field q, the extension degree m, the degree t of the Goppa polynomial, the translation parameter b of the automorphism, and the order u of the transformation are fixed, the dimension k of the generated code remains constant.</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware Transfer Reinforcement Learning for Sustainable Beam Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel and sustainable approach for improving beam selection in 5G and beyond networks using transfer learning and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Traditional RL-based beam selection models require extensive training time and computational resources, particularly when deployed in diverse environments with varying propagation characteristics posing a major challenge for scalability and energy efficiency. To address this, we propose modeling the environment as a point cloud, where each point represents the locations of gNodeBs (gNBs) and surrounding scatterers. By computing the Chamfer distance between point clouds, structurally similar environments can be efficiently identified, enabling the reuse of pre-trained models through transfer learning. This methodology leads to a 16x reduction in training time and computational overhead, directly contributing to energy efficiency. By minimizing the need for retraining in each new deployment, our approach significantly lowers power consumption and supports the development of green and sustainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in wireless systems. Furthermore, it accelerates time-to-deployment, reduces carbon emissions associated with training, and enhances the viability of deploying AI-driven communication systems at the edge. Simulation results confirm that our approach maintains high performance while drastically cutting energy costs, demonstrating the potential of transfer learning to enable scalable, adaptive, and environmentally conscious RL-based beam selection strategies in dynamic and diverse propagation environments.</description>

      <title>Forgetting-MarI: LLM Unlearning via Marginal Information Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI models are trained on ever-expanding datasets, the ability to remove the influence of specific data from trained models has become essential for privacy protection and regulatory compliance. Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art unlearning methods, delivering reliable forgetting and better preserved general model performance across diverse benchmarks. This advancement represents an important step toward making AI systems more controllable and compliant with privacy and copyright regulations without compromising their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Computation-aware Energy-harvesting Federated Learning: Cyclic Scheduling with Selective Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a powerful paradigm for distributed learning, but its increasing complexity leads to significant energy consumption from client-side computations for training models. In particular, the challenge is critical in energy-harvesting FL (EHFL) systems where participation availability of each device oscillates due to limited energy. To address this, we propose FedBacys, a battery-aware EHFL framework using cyclic client participation based on users' battery levels. By clustering clients and scheduling them sequentially, FedBacys minimizes redundant computations, reduces system-wide energy usage, and improves learning stability. We also introduce FedBacys-Odd, a more energy-efficient variant that allows clients to participate selectively, further reducing energy costs without compromising performance. We provide a convergence analysis for our framework and demonstrate its superior energy efficiency and robustness compared to existing algorithms through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>QMA Complete Quantum-Enhanced Kyber: Provable Security Through CHSH Nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) must secure large-scale communication systems against quantum adversaries where classical hardness alone is insufficient and purely quantum schemes remain impractical. Lattice-based key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) such as CRYSTALS-Kyber provide efficient quantum-resistant primitives but rely solely on computational hardness assumptions that are susceptible to hybrid classical-quantum attacks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the first Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)-certified Kyber protocol, which embeds quantum non-locality verification directly within the key exchange phase. The proposed design integrates CHSH entanglement tests using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs to yield measurable quantum advantage values exceeding classical correlation limits, thereby coupling information--theoretic quantum guarantees with lattice-based computational security. Formal reductions demonstrate that any polynomial-time adversary breaking the proposed KEM must either solve the Module Learning With Errors (Module-LWE) problem or a Quantum Merlin-Arthur (QMA)-complete instance of the 2-local Hamiltonian problem, under the standard complexity assumption QMA $\subset$ NP. The construction remains fully compatible with the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform, preserving chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) security and Kyber's efficiency profile. The resulting CHSH-augmented Kyber scheme therefore establishes a mathematically rigorous, hybrid post-quantum framework that unifies lattice cryptography and quantum non-locality to achieve verifiable, composable, and forward-secure key agreement.</description>

      <title>Approximate Message Passing for Quantum State Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is an indispensable tool for characterizing many-body quantum systems. However, due to the exponential scaling cost of the protocol with system size, many approaches have been developed for quantum states with specific structure, such as low-rank states. In this paper, we show how approximate message passing (AMP), a compressed sensing technique, can be used to perform low-rank QST. AMP provides asymptotically optimal performance guarantees for large systems, which suggests its utility for QST. We discuss the design challenges that come with applying AMP to QST, and show that by properly designing the AMP algorithm, we can reduce the reconstruction infidelity by over an order of magnitude compared to existing approaches to low-rank QST. We also performed tomographic experiments on IBM Kingston and considered the effect of device noise on the reliability of the predicted fidelity of state preparation.

      <title>On the Fundamental Limits of LLMs at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have benefited enormously from scaling, yet these gains are bounded by five fundamental limitations: (1) hallucination, (2) context compression, (3) reasoning degradation, (4) retrieval fragility, and (5) multimodal misalignment. While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention.</description>

      <title>The correlated matching decoder for the 4.8.8 color code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color codes present distinct advantages for fault-tolerant quantum computing, such as high encoding rates and the transversal implementation of Clifford gates. However, existing matching-based decoders for the color codes such as the restricted decoder (Kubica and Delfosse, 2023), suffer from limited decoding performance. Inspired by the global decoding insight of the unified decoder (Benhemou et al., 2023), this paper introduces a correlated decoder for the 4.8.8 color code, which improves upon the conventional restricted decoder by leveraging correlations between restricted lattices, and is derived by mapping the correlated matching decoder for the surface code onto the color code lattice. Analytical and numerical results show that the correlated decoder achieves higher thresholds than the restricted and unified decoders, while matching the performance of the unified decoder at very low physical error rates. Under the code capacity and phenomenological noise models, the estimated thresholds for the color code against bit-flip error are 10.38% and 3.13%, respectively. Furthermore, by applying the surface-color code mapping, the thresholds of 16.62% and 3.52% are obtained for the surface code against depolarizing noise.</description>

      <title>Restart Belief: A General Quantum LDPC Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hardware-friendly quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) decoders are commonly built upon belief propagation (BP) processing. Yet, quantum degeneracy often prevents BP from achieving reliable convergence. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose the restart belief (RB) decoder, an iterative BP-based algorithm inspired by branch-and-bound optimization principles. From our analysis we find that the RB decoder represents both the fastest and most accurate decoding algorithm applicable to QLDPC codes to date, conceived with the explicit goal of approaching error correction up to the code distance.</description>

      <title>Taming Barren Plateaus in Arbitrary Parameterized Quantum Circuits Without Sacrificing Expressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms based on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have enabled a wide range of applications on near-term quantum devices. However, existing PQC architectures face several challenges, among which the ``barren plateaus" phenomenon is particularly prominent. In such cases, the loss function concentrates exponentially with increasing system size, thereby hindering effective parameter optimization. To address this challenge, we propose a general and hardware-efficient method for eliminating barren plateaus in an arbitrary PQC. Specifically, our approach achieves this by inserting a layer of easily implementable quantum channels into the original PQC, each channel requiring only one ancilla qubit and four additional gates, yielding a modified PQC (MPQC) that is provably at least as expressive as the original PQC and, under mild assumptions, is guaranteed to be free from barren plateaus. Furthermore, by appropriately adjusting the structure of MPQCs, we rigorously prove that any parameter in the original PQC can be made trainable. Importantly, the absence of barren plateaus in MPQCs is robust against realistic noise, making our approach directly applicable to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Numerically, we demonstrate the practicality of our method by modifying a commonly used PQC for thermal-state preparation. The results show that {barren plateaus are effectively eliminated} in this class of circuits with up to 100 qubits and 2400 layers, whereas the original ansatz suffers from severe gradient vanishing.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Tensor Network-Based Viewpoint for Modeling and Analysis of Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification is a critical challenge in machine learning. While neural networks are highly versatile and capable of learning complex patterns, they often lack interpretability due to their ``black box'' nature. On the other hand, probabilistic ``white box'' models, though interpretable, often suffer from a significant performance gap when compared to neural networks. To address this, we propose a novel quantum physics-based ``white box'' method that offers both accurate uncertainty quantification and enhanced interpretability. By mapping the kernel mean embedding (KME) of a time series data vector to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), we construct a tensor network-inspired 1D spin chain Hamiltonian, with the KME as one of its eigen-functions or eigen-modes. We then solve the associated Schr{\"o}dinger equation and apply perturbation theory to quantify uncertainty, thereby improving the interpretability of tasks performed with the quantum tensor network-based model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology, compared to state-of-the-art ``white box" models, in change point detection and time series clustering, providing insights into the uncertainties associated with decision-making throughout the process.</description>

      <title>Support Recovery in One-bit Compressed Sensing with Near-Optimal Measurements and Sublinear Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of support recovery in one-bit compressed sensing (1bCS) aim to recover the support of a signal $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$, denoted as supp$(x)$, from the observation $y=\text{sign}(Ax)$, where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is a sensing matrix and $|\text{supp}(x)|\leq k, k \ll n$. Under this setting, most preexisting works have a recovery runtime $\Omega(n)$. In this paper, we propose two schemes that have sublinear $o(n)$ runtime. (1): For the universal exact support recovery, a scheme of $m=O(k^2\log(n/k)\log n)$ measurements and runtime $D=O(km)$. For the universal $\epsilon$-approximate support recovery, the same scheme with $m=O(k\epsilon^{-1}\log(n/k)\log n)$ and runtime $D=O(\epsilon^{-1}m)$, improving the runtime significantly with an extra $O(\log n)$ factor in the number of measurements compared to the current optimal (Matsumoto et al., 2023). (2): For the probabilistic exact support recovery in the sublinear regime, a scheme of $m:=O(k\frac{\log k}{\log\log k}\log n)$ measurements and runtime $O(m)$, with vanishing error probability, improving the recent result of Yang et al., 2025.</description>

      <title>A Practical Validation of RIS Detection and Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communication is a key enabling technology for next-generation wireless communication networks, allowing for the reshaping of wireless channels without requiring traditional radio frequency (RF) active components. While their passive nature makes RISs highly attractive, it also presents a challenge: RISs cannot actively identify themselves to user equipments (UEs). Recently, a new method has been proposed to detect and identify RISs by letting them modulate their identities in the signals reflected from their surfaces. In this letter, we first propose a new and simpler modulation method for RISs and then validate the concept of RIS detection and identification (RIS-ID) using a real-world experimental setup. The obtained results validate the RIS-ID concept and show the effectiveness of our proposed modulation method over different operating scenarios and systems settings.</description>

      <title>Moderate-length lifted quantum Tanner codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce new families of quantum Tanner codes, a class of quantum codes that first appeared in the work of Leverrier and Z\'emor (FOCS 2022). These codes are built from two classical Tanner codes, for which the underlying graphs are extracted from coverings of 2D geometrical complexes, and the local linear codes are tensor-products of cyclic or double-circulant linear codes. The advantage of code lifting is that, for any lift of odd index $t$ of an $[[n,k,d]]$-code, we can adapt the study of the transfer homomorphism arising in cellular homology to describe symmetries of its logical operators and to establish that its dimension is lower bounded by $k$, and its distance is upper bounded by $t\cdot d$. Moreover, when the dimension of the lifted code is equal to $k$, its distance is lower bounded by $d$. These parameter bounds also apply to the previous methods of code lifting of Gu\'emard (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2025). Finally, We present several explicit families, and identify instances of moderate length quantum codes which are degenerate, have low check weight, and whose distance surpasses the square root of the code length. Among them, we report the existence of a $[[96,2,12]]$-code whose distance growth saturates our bound, and for which half of the checks are of weight 8 and the other half of weight 4.</description>

      <title>Absolutely Maximal Entanglement in Continuous Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore absolutely maximal entanglement (AME) and k-uniformity in continuous-variable (CV) quantum systems, and show that-unlike in qudit systems-such entanglement is readily realizable in both Gaussian and non-Gaussian quantum states of multiple modes. We demonstrate that Gaussian CV cluster states are generically AME, rederiving the results of [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 070501 (2009)] from a generalized stabilizer formalism, and provide explicit constructions based on Cauchy, Vandermonde, totally positive, and real-block-code generator matrices. We further extend AME properties to a family of non-Gaussian states constructed from discrete Zak basis states that incorporate grid states (a.k.a., Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states) as non-Gaussian resources. Realizations of CV AME states enable open-destination multi-party CV teleportation, CV quantum secret sharing, CV majority-agreed key distribution, perfect-tensor networks on arbitrary geometries, and multi-unitary circuits. Our extension to non-Gaussian AME states may further provide robustness to Gaussian noise and benefits to quantum CV information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The implementation of the conjugate gradient (CG) method for massive MIMO detection is computationally challenging, especially for a large number of users and correlated channels. In this paper, we propose a low computational complexity CG detection from a finite-precision perspective. First, we develop a finite-precision CG (FP-CG) detection to mitigate the computational bottleneck of each CG iteration and provide the attainable accuracy, convergence, and computational complexity analysis to reveal the impact of finite-precision arithmetic. A practical heuristic is presented to select suitable precisions. Then, to further reduce the number of iterations, we propose a joint finite-precision and block-Jacobi preconditioned CG (FP-BJ-CG) detection. The corresponding performance analysis is also provided. Finally, simulation results validate the theoretical insights and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed detection.</description>

      <title>Graph topology estimation of power grids using pairwise mutual information of time series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topology of a power grid is estimated using an information theoretic approach. By modeling the grid as a graph and using voltage magnitude data of individual nodes in the grid, the mutual information between pairs of nodes is computed using different approximation methods. Using the well-known Chow-Liu algorithm, a maximum spanning tree based on mutual information is computed to estimate the power grid topology. This manuscript explores the application of this method to different datasets and explores the domain of applicability. The data quality, precision, time windows, frequency and the method for calculating the mutual information are varied to see the effect on the successful reconstruction of the graph and it's leaf nodes. Success is shown for IEEE networks generated with MATPOWER and data generated using GridLAB-D. The algorithm is then cross-validated on IEEE networks.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum Chernoff bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the task of distinguishing whether a quantum system is prepared in a state from one of several sets of quantum states. Assuming their convexity and stability under tensor product, we prove that the optimal error exponent for discrimination is precisely given by the regularized quantum Chernoff divergence between the sets, thereby establishing a generalized quantum Chernoff bound for the discrimination of multiple sets of quantum states. This extends the classical and quantum Chernoff bounds to the general setting of composite and correlated quantum hypotheses. Furthermore, leveraging minimax theorems, we show that discriminating between sets of quantum states is no harder than discriminating between their worst-case elements in terms of error probability. This implies the existence of an optimal state-agnostic test that achieves the minimum error probability for all states in the sets, matching the performance of the optimal state-dependent test for the most difficult pair of states. We provide explicit characterizations of the optimal state-agnostic test in the binary composite case. Finally, we show that the maximum overlap between a pure state and a set of free states, a quantity that frequently arises in quantum resource theories, is equal to the quantum Chernoff divergence between the sets, thereby providing an operational interpretation of this quantity in the context of symmetric hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Credible Uncertainty Quantification under Noise and System Model Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State estimators often provide self-assessed uncertainty metrics, such as covariance matrices, whose credibility is critical for downstream tasks. However, these self-assessments can be misleading due to underlying modeling violations like noise model mismatch (NMM) or system model misspecification (SMM). This letter addresses this problem by developing a unified, multi-metric framework that integrates noncredibility index (NCI), negative log-likelihood (NLL), and energy score (ES) metrics, featuring an empirical location test (ELT) to detect system model bias and a directional probing technique that uses the metrics' asymmetric sensitivities to distinguish NMM from SMM. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the proposed method achieves excellent diagnosis accuracy (80-100%) and significantly outperforms single-metric diagnosis methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated on a real-world UWB positioning dataset.
