      <title>EUCLID: Photometric redshift calibration with self-organising maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euclid survey aims to trace the evolution of cosmic structures up to redshift $z$ $\sim$ 3 and beyond. Its success depends critically on obtaining highly accurate mean redshifts for ensembles of galaxies $n(z)$ in all tomographic bins, essential for deriving robust cosmological constraints. However, photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) suffer from systematic biases arising from various sources of uncertainty. To address these challenges, we utilised self-organising maps (SOMs) with mock samples resembling the Euclid Wide Survey (EWS), to validate Euclid's uncertainty requirement of $|\Delta\langle z \rangle| = \langle z_{\text{est}} \rangle - \langle z \rangle \leq 0.002 (1+z)$ per tomographic bin, assuming DR3-level data. We observe that defining the redshift tomography using the mean spectroscopic redshift (spec-$z$) per SOM cell, results in none of the ten tomographic redshift bins satisfying the requirement. In contrast, the redshift tomography on the photo-$z$s of the EWS-like sample yields superior results, with eight out of ten bins [$0 &lt; z\leq 2.5$] meeting the Euclid requirement. To enhance the realism of our study, we morph our calibration sample to mimic the C3R2 survey in incremental steps. In this context, a maximum of six out of ten bins meet the requirement, strongly advocating the adoption of a redshift tomography defined by the photo-$z$s of individual galaxies rather than the commonly used mean spec-$z$ of SOM cells. To examine the impact on the expected biases for $\Omega_{\text{m}}$, $\sigma_{8}$, and $\Delta w_{0}$ measured by Euclid, we perform a Fisher forecast for cosmic shear only, based on our redshift uncertainties. Here, we find that even under an evaluation of the uncertainty where the impact of the redshift bias is substantial, most absolute biases remain below 0.1$\sigma$ in the idealised scenario and below 0.3$\sigma$ in the more realistic case.</description>

      <title>Position drift with Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proper motion (also known as position drift) field of extragalactic sources at cosmological distances across our sky can be used to measure the acceleration of the Solar System through the aberration effect. If measured very precisely, the signal would also hold cosmological information, for instance about bulk flows of distant sources or the presence of tensor modes. In the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, the acceleration of the Solar System is by far the dominant contributor to the position drift signal for sources at cosmological distances, and the measurement is therefore expected to yield a constant spheroidal dipole across redshifts as long as convergence to the cosmic restframe has been reached. The aim of this paper is to test this hypothesis. We analyze data from the cosmic reference frame dataset of Gaia data release 3 focusing on constraining the dipole and quadrupole in the position drift signal, with an emphasis on redshift dependence of the signal as a consistency test of the $\Lambda$CDM model. The spheroidal dipole that we find is in mild tension, at the level of $2-3\sigma$, with the constant-in-redshift signature expected from the local acceleration of the Solar System. We also find significant quadrupole components, that however do not have any significant evolution with redshift. The most straightforward interpretation of these findings is (unknown) systematic errors related to the Gaia instrumentation, but a cosmological origin is a possibility. Our analysis remains inconclusive on the cause of the redshift dependence of the dipole and warrants further investigations with upcoming data releases. We discuss possible implications of our results and highlight the importance of proper motion measurements for rest frame determinations in cosmology. In our discussion, we highlight interesting avenues for doing cosmology with Gaia data.</description>

      <title>Visualising relativistic effects in redshift space distortions of large scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observing large scale structure in redshift space gives rise to the well known redshift space distortions whereby a spherical distribution of galaxies is distorted into an ellipsoid along the line of sight of the observer. This effect is important on linear scales and so can be thought of as a Newtonian correction to the density perturbation even though their physical origin is in the Doppler effect. On larger scales subtler aspects of the Doppler and gravitational redshift effects give rise to further distortions in redshift space. These further contort objects beyond an ellipsoidal compression, into shapes with broken line-of-sight symmetry such as an egg- or bean-like shapes. In this paper, we aim to qualitatively picture how large over-dense regions, including clusters or superclusters, and under-dense regions, such as voids, undergoing infall or outflow respectively, become distorted in redshift space when higher-order relativistic effects are taken into account. This will contribute when analysing structure in real space such as stacking voids which are no longer radially symmetric when these effects are included.</description>

      <title>Human vs. machine -- 1:3. Joint analysis of classical and ML-based summary statistics of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to compress and more easily interpret Lyman-$\alpha$ forest (Ly$\alpha$F) datasets, summary statistics, e.g. the power spectrum, are commonly used. However, such summaries unavoidably lose some information, weakening the constraining power on parameters of interest. Recently, machine learning (ML)-based summary approaches have been proposed as an alternative to human-defined statistical measures. This raises a question: can ML-based summaries contain the full information captured by traditional statistics, and vice versa? In this study, we apply three human-defined techniques and one ML-based approach to summarize mock Ly$\alpha$F data from hydrodynamical simulations and infer two thermal parameters of the intergalactic medium, assuming a power-law temperature-density relation. We introduce a metric for measuring the improvement in the figure of merit when combining two summaries. Consequently, we demonstrate that the ML-based summary approach not only contains almost all of the information from the human-defined statistics, but also that it provides significantly stronger constraints by a ratio of better than 1:3 in terms of the posterior volume on the temperature-density relation parameters.</description>

      <title>High Frequency Peak Radio Sources from the AT20G Catalogue and Their Radio Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sample of high-frequency peaker (HFP) candidates was formed from the AT20G catalog radio sources with spectral indices of the optically thick emission region $\alpha_{below}$ exceeding +0.5. A study of the spectral properties of the sources in the sample, which included 269 radio sources, was performed. The spectra of the sources were constructed and the spectral indices below $\alpha_{below}$ and above the peak $\alpha_{above}$, the peak frequency $\nu_{obs}$, the flux density at the peak frequency $S_{peak}$, and the peak half-width in the radio spectrum were determined. Analysis of the spectra showed that the sample is fairly homogeneous and consists of HFPs with $\nu_{obs}&gt;5$ GHz. Most sources (67%) do not have data at frequencies below 0.8 GHz. 187 sources have ultra-inverted spectra ($\alpha_{below}&gt;$+0.7), which is 3.2% of all sources in the AT20G catalog and 70% of radio sources in our sample. Optical identification of radio sources in the sample showed that 70% of the hosts are quasars. The sample consists of compact objects with radio luminosity at 20 GHz in the range of $10^{23}$-$10^{30}$ W/Hz, angular sizes of emitting regions of radio sources are 0.002-0.25 mas, projected linear sizes are from 0.2 to 30 pc. The dependence of the peak frequencies of radio sources on their angular sizes is in good agreement with that previously discovered for CSS and GPS sources.</description>

      <title>Constraints on cosmological parameters and CMB first acoustic peak in conformal Killing gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the frame of conformal Killing gravity cosmology, we performed a Bayesian analysis on two different datasets of Baryonic Acoustic oscillations (DESI and SDSS DR16) and on two datasets of SNeIa (Pantheon+ and Union3). The results for H0 and Omega_M in a spatially flat FRW background are consistent with the Lambda-CDM scenario. We obtain a non-negligible negative value for the novel density of dark sector, Omega_D, and its relevance in the evolution of the cosmological observables thus finding quantitatively what its contribution is on real data to match the standard scenario. The results confirm the dynamical character of dark energy. We also calculate the deceleration parameter q0 and the present time dark energy equation of state parameter w0: the latter belongs to the quintessence regime. The evaluation of the first acoustic peak of CMB places it extraordinarily near to the best value provided by the Planck collaboration. In this scenario, we can conclude that late time and early time data can be successfully matched under the same standard.</description>

      <title>Creating a Universe from Nothing as an Alternative to the Cosmological Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the cosmological Robertson-Walker geometry required of the cosmological principle both the Weyl tensor $C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ and the Bach tensor $W^{\mu\nu}=[2\nabla_{\kappa}\nabla_{\lambda}-R_{\lambda\kappa}]C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ vanish. In general, in perturbations around the cosmological background neither of the fluctuating $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ or $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ would vanish. However, it is possible for $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ to vanish even as $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ does not. In this paper we construct an explicit model in which this is the case. The model consists of a tensor gravitational wave
  fluctuating around a background with a constant negative 3-curvature. The model is exactly solvable and consists purely of geometric quantities with no matter fields at all (i.e., $G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $W^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta W^{\mu\nu}=0$, where $G^{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor). The model can thus be created out of nothing, with creating a universe from nothing thus being an alternative principle to the cosmological principle. The fluctuating gravitational wave contributes to the temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background in a calculable manner, for which we provide a simple analytic way of treating spatial modes that is based on the use of a spatial mode addition theorem. In addition, we provide a treatment of the anisotropy that is based on properties of bandwidth limited functions.</description>

      <title>Leptophilic dark matter in $U(1)_{L_{i}-L_{j}}$ models: a solution to the Fermi-LAT Galactic Center Excess consistent with cosmological and laboratory observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle origin of dark matter (DM) remains elusive despite decades of direct, indirect, and collider searches. Several groups have reported a $\gamma$-ray excess toward the Galactic Centre, commonly referred to as the Galactic Centre Excess (GCE). Its spectrum is consistent with annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) of mass $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ GeV and a thermal-relic cross section. Although many concrete WIMP models reproduce the GCE spectrum, most are now excluded by direct detection experiments that are approaching the neutrino floor. We investigate a class of anomaly-free extensions of the Standard Model featuring gauged differences of lepton number, $U(1)_{L_i-L_j}$, and gauged baryon minus lepton number, $U(1)_{B-L}$. We show that these models can reproduce the GCE while remaining compatible with the observed relic abundance. We then impose collider and direct detection constraints, accounting for both tree-level and loop-induced kinetic mixing. The $L_\mu-L_e$ model gives the best fit to the GCE: a DM mass of $m_\chi\sim 40-50$ GeV remains consistent with the muon and electron magnetic moment anomalies, $(g-2)_{\mu,e}$, as well as current collider and direct detection limits, for mediator masses in the range $m_{A'}\sim 70-86$ GeV and a DM-mediator coupling of $(1-5)\times10^{-2}$. By contrast, the $L_e-L_\tau$ and $L_\mu-L_\tau$ models yield poorer fits; satisfying both the relic density and experimental bounds forces the DM mass to lie very close to resonance (i.e., approximately half the mediator mass). Finally, while the $B-L$ model also matches the GCE well, its parameter space is almost entirely ruled out by strong direct detection limits, except for the narrow resonance region where $m_\chi$ should be equal to $m_{A'}/2$ requiring a fine-tuning at the few-percent level.</description>

      <title>Luminous Mid-IR Selected Obscured Quasars at Cosmic Noon in SDSS Stripe82 II: Spectroscopic Diversity and Broad H$\alpha$ Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multiwavelength spectroscopic survey of 23 luminous mid-infrared-selected Type-2 quasars at redshifts z = 0.88 to 3.49. The targets were selected in the SDSS Stripe 82 field based on their bright WISE W4 detections (flux &gt; 5 mJy) and extremely faint or red optical counterparts (e.g., r &gt; 23 or r - W4 &gt; 8.4), designed to identify heavily obscured quasars. Deep near-infrared (Gemini/GNIRS) and optical (Keck/LRIS and KCWI) spectroscopy confirm 23 out of 24 candidates as Type-2 quasars in this redshift range, including 12 objects at z &gt; 2. The spectra exhibit strong rest-frame UV and optical emission lines (Ly-alpha, C IV, [O III], H-alpha) with a wide range of line widths, indicating significant spectral diversity. Approximately one-third of the sample (8 of 23) shows broad H-alpha emission (FWHM &gt; 2000 km/s) despite their Type-2 classification, while the rest have only narrow lines (FWHM &lt; 2000 km/s) characteristic of classical obscured quasars. Notably, these broad-line Type-2 quasars share similar spectral energy distributions with the JWST-discovered "little red dot" (LRD) AGNs, suggesting that our sample could be lower-redshift analogues of the heavily obscured broad-line AGNs uncovered by JWST. We also find that the [O III] 5007 angstrom emission is relatively weak for their high bolometric luminosities, deviating from trends seen in lower-redshift Type-2 QSOs. A new composite spectrum for Type-2 QSOs is built using our sample. Overall, our results demonstrate that mid-IR selection efficiently uncovers a diverse population of obscured quasars and that spectroscopic follow-up is crucial for revealing their true nature. This study provides new insights into heavily obscured SMBH growth at cosmic noon and bridges the gap to the obscured AGN populations now being revealed by JWST.</description>

      <title>New high-frequency gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions in the early Universe are a well-motivated source of gravitational waves (GWs). In this Letter, we identify a previously overlooked GW production mechanism: gravitational transition radiation, arising from graviton emission by particles whose mass changes as they pass through expanding bubble walls. Unlike conventional sources such as bubble collisions or sound waves, this mechanism operates at the microscopic scale set by the Lorentz-contracted wall thickness, leading to GW emission at significantly higher frequencies. The resulting spectrum features a distinctive shape with a peak frequency redshifting to $f_{\rm peak}\sim \gamma_w T_0\sim \gamma_w\times 10^{10}\,{\rm Hz}$ where $\gamma_w$ is the Lorentz boost factor of the wall velocity and $T_0$ is the current temperature of the Universe. This mechanism is generic and is expected to operate similarly for domain walls and other relativistic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Memoirs of mass accretion: probing the edges of intracluster light in simulated galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffuse starlight extending throughout massive galaxy clusters, known as intracluster light (ICL), has the potential to be read as a memoir of mass accretion: informative, individual, and yet imperfect. Here, we combine dark matter-only zoom-in simulations from the Symphony suite with the Nimbus "star-tagging" model of the stellar halo to assess how much information about the mass assembly of an individual galaxy cluster can be gleaned from idealized measurements of ICL outskirts. We show that the edges of a cluster's stellar profile -- the primary (Rsp*1) and secondary (Rsp*2) stellar "splashback" radii -- are sensitive to both continuous mass accretion histories and discrete merger events, making them potentially powerful probes of a cluster's past. We find that Rsp*1 strongly correlates with the cluster's mass ~1 dynamical time ago, while Rsp*2 traces more recent mass accretion history to a slightly lesser degree. In combination, these features can further distinguish between clusters that have and have not undergone a major merger within the past dynamical time. We use both to predict realistic cluster mass accretion histories with the MultiCAM framework. These outer ICL features are significantly more sensitive to mass accretion and merger histories than the stellar mass gap and halo concentration, and perform comparably to the commonly used X-ray-based tracer of relaxedness, x_off. While our analysis is idealized, the relevant ICL features are potentially detectable in next-generation deep imaging of nearby clusters. This work highlights the promise of ICL measurements and lays the groundwork for more detailed forecasts of their power.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of the ultra-high-energy neutrino flux by dark matter scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A flux of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos is generally expected to be produced by astrophysical sources at cosmological distances and to reach Earth. In this paper, we investigate the impact of neutrino scattering with dark matter (DM) particles in both the intergalactic medium and the Milky Way on the total flux, energy spectrum, and arrival directions of UHE neutrinos. We emphasize the complementarity of neutrino detectors at different latitudes to probe the anisotropy in the flux at Earth due to the attenuation of the neutrino flux in the Milky Way dark matter halo. We also discuss that, with mild astrophysical assumptions, limits on the DM-$\nu$ scattering cross section can be placed even if the neutrino sources are unknown. Finally, we explore all this phenomenology with the recent UHE neutrino event KM3230213A, and place the corresponding limits in the DM-$\nu$ scattering cross-section.</description>

      <title>X-ray Halos of Early-Type Galaxies with AGN Feedback and Accretion from a Circumgalactic Medium: models and observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The knowledge of the X-ray properties of the hot gas halos of early-type galaxies has significantly advanced in the past years, for large and homogeneously investigated samples. We compare these results with the X-ray properties of an exploratory set of gas evolution models in realistic early-type galaxies, produced with our high-resolution 2D hydrodynamical code MACER that includes AGN feedback and accretion from a circumgalactic medium. The model X-ray emission and absorption are integrated along the line of sight, to obtain maps of the surface brightness Sigma_X and temperature Tx. The X-ray diagnostics considered are the luminosity and average temperature for the whole galaxy (Lx and &lt;Tx&gt;) and within 5 optical effective radii (Lx5 and &lt;Tx5&gt;), and the circularized profiles Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R). The values for Lx, Lx5, &lt;Tx&gt;, and &lt;Tx5&gt; compare very well with those observed. The Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R) also present qualitative similarities with those of the representative galaxy NGC5129, and of ETGs with the most commonly observed shape for Tx(R): Sigma_X(R) matches the observed profile over many optical effective radii Re, and Tx(R) reproduces the characteristic bump that peaks at R=(1 - 3)Re. Inside the peak position, Tx(R) declines towards the center, but the explored models are systematically hotter by ~30%; possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. Interestingly, Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R) as large as observed outside of R~Re are reproduced only with significant accretion from a circumgalactic medium, highlighting its importance.</description>

      <title>Renzo's rule revisited: A statistical study of galaxies' baryon - dark matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic statistical analysis of an informal astrophysical phenomenon known as Renzo's rule (or Sancisi's law), which states that "for any feature in a galaxy's luminosity profile, there is a corresponding feature in the rotation curve, and vice versa." This is often posed as a challenge for the standard LCDM model while supporting alternative theories such as MOND. Indeed, we identify clear features in the dwarf spiral NGC 1560 -- a prime example for Renzo's rule -- and find correlation statistics which support Renzo's rule with a slight preference for MOND over LCDM halo fits. However, a broader analysis on galaxies in the SPARC database reveals an excess of features in rotation curves that lack clear baryonic counterparts, with correlation statistics deviating up to $3\sigma$ on average from that predicted by both MOND and LCDM haloes, challenging the validity of Renzo's rule. Thus we do not find clear evidence for Renzo's rule in present galaxy data overall. We additionally perform mock tests, which show that a definitive test of Renzo's rule is primarily limited by the lack of clearly resolved baryonic features in current galaxy data.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the scalar-induced one-loop correction to the power spectrum of tensor perturbations produced during single-field slow-roll inflation. We find that the correction is given by the square of the product of the slow-roll parameter and the tree-level scalar power spectrum. We also discuss the implications of the logarithmic contribution.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Disruption of Axion Minihalos by Multiple Stellar Encounters in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If QCD axion dark matter formed post-inflation, axion miniclusters emerged from isocurvature fluctuations and later merged hierarchically into minihalos. These minihalos, potentially disrupted by stellar encounters in the Milky Way, affect axion detectability. We extend prior analyses by more accurately incorporating multiple stellar encounters and dynamical relaxation timescales, simulating minihalo orbits in the Galactic potential.
  Our results show stellar interactions are more destructive than previously estimated, reducing minihalo mass retention at the solar system to ~30%, compared to earlier estimates of ~60%. This enhanced loss arises from cumulative energy injections when relaxation periods between stellar encounters are accounted for.
  The altered minihalo mass function implies a larger fraction of axion dark matter occupies inter-minihalo space, potentially increasing the local axion density and improving haloscope detection prospects. This work highlights the significance of detailed modeling of stellar disruptions in shaping the axion dark matter distribution.</description>

      <title>Probing the cosmic baryon distribution and the impact of AGN feedback with FRBs in CROCODILE simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12741v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Missing Baryon problem using Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) to trace cosmic baryons. Our CROCODILE simulations, performed with the GADGET3/4-OSAKA smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, include star formation, supernova (SN) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. We generate light cones from large-scale structure simulations to compute gas density profiles and dispersion measures (DMs) measurable by FRBs. Our results show that AGN feedback reduces central gas densities in halos, reshaping the boundary between the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and intergalactic medium (IGM). Zoom-in simulations reveal that AGN feedback significantly modulates the DM contributions from foreground halos along different sightlines. Using the DM-redshift (DM-z) relation up to z=1, we constrain the diffuse baryon mass fraction at z = 1 to f_diff = 0.865 (+0.101, -0.165) (fiducial) and f_diff = 0.856 (+0.101, -0.162) (NoBH), which include contributions from both IGM (f_IGM) and halos (f_Halos), serving as upper limits. We further separate and quantify the redshift evolution of f_CGM, f_IGM, and f_diff using both phase-based and structure-based definitions. From an observational perspective, we also distinguish the line-of-sight averaged quantity &lt; f_{diff,obs} &gt; from the intrinsic redshift-evolving f_diff(z), reflecting the statistical nature of FRB-based measurements. Our study provides a framework for understanding baryon distribution across cosmic structures, FRB host galaxies, and the role of AGN in shaping foreground DM contributions.</description>

      <title>Cluster Lensing Mass Inversion (CLUMI+): Combining Dynamics and Weak Lensing around Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present CLUMI+, a self-consistent, multiprobe methodology for reconstructing the mass distribution in and around galaxy clusters by combining gravitational lensing and dynamical observations. Building on the joint likelihood framework of K. Umetsu (2013), CLUMI+ integrates weak-lensing shear and magnification data with projected escape velocity measurements in the cluster infall region, yielding tighter constraints on the gravitational potential without relying on equilibrium assumptions. The mass distribution is modeled using a flexible, piecewise-defined convergence profile that characterizes the azimuthally averaged surface mass density within the lensing field, transitioning to a projected power-law form at larger radii where phase-space constraints complement lensing. Additional strong-lensing constraints are incorporated via central aperture-mass measurements, enabling full-scale mass reconstruction from the cluster core to the outskirts. We validate CLUMI+ using synthetic weak-lensing and phase-space data for a massive cluster from the IllustrisTNG simulations, demonstrating unbiased recovery of projected and three-dimensional mass profiles and achieving 10%--30% improvement in precision at large radii. As a case study, we apply CLUMI+ to A2261, combining Subaru and Hubble Space Telescope weak+strong lensing data with spectroscopic measurements from the Hectospec Cluster Survey. This analysis demonstrates the power of multiprobe, equilibrium-free modeling for robust cluster mass reconstruction.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Analytic model for Effects of Fuzzy Dark Matter Granule Perturbations on Orbital Motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In fuzzy dark matter scenarios, the quantum wave nature of ultralight axion-like particles generates stochastic density fluctuations inside dark matter halos. These fluctuations, known as granules, perturb the orbits of subhalos and other orbiting bodies. While previous studies have simulated these effects using N-body techniques or modeled them statistically using diffusion approximations, we propose an alternative framework based on representing the perturbations as a Fourier series with random coefficients, which can be applied to individual orbits, not just populations. We extend the model to finite-size subhalos, identifying a critical length scale below which subhalos behave as point-mass particles. In contrast, larger subhalos exhibit suppressed perturbations from granules due to their extended mass profiles. Using FDM-Simulator, we validate our finite-size model by isolating granule accelerations and confirming their statistical effects on subhalo dynamics.</description>

      <title>Eikonal gravitational-wave lensing in Einstein-aether theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein-aether theory provides a model to test the validity of local Lorentz invariance in gravitational interactions. The speed of gravitational waves as measured from the binary neutron star event GW170817 sets stringent limits on Einstein-aether theory, but only on a combination of the theory's free parameters. For this reason, a significant part of the theory's parameter space remains unconstrained by observations. Motivated by this, we explore the propagation of gravitational waves in Einstein-aether theory over an inhomogeneous background (i.e., gravitational wave lensing) as a potential mechanism to break the degeneracies between the theory's free parameters, and hence enable new constraints on the theory to be obtained. We reduce our analysis to gravitational waves that pass far from the lens' center and short wavelength signals, both compared to the lens' gravitational radius (eikonal limit). By applying these approximations and bringing the field equations into the form of the so-called kinetic matrix and applying a formalism known as the propagation eigenstate framework, we find that the speed of gravitational waves is modified by inhomogeneities in the aether field. However, the modification is common to both gravitational polarizations and vanishes in the limit in which gravitational waves propagate with luminal speed. This lens-dependent gravitational wave speed contrasts with the lens-induced birefringence observed in other theories beyond general relativity, like Horndeski's theory. While the potential to improve tests based on gravitational-wave speed is limited, our formalism sets the basis to fully describe signal propagation over inhomogeneous spacetimes in Einstein-aether theory and other extensions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>A Dark Matter Fermionic Quantum Fluid from Standard Model Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model of dark matter as a superconducting fluid of Cooper pairs of right handed neutrinos or of vector-like quarks. The superconducting dark matter is induced by attractive channels in the Standard Model Higgs and color sectors of the Standard Model, respectively. We show that, for each case, the solution to the gap equation provides viable dark matter candidates for suitable chemical potential values. The mechanism yields an ultra-light neutrino condensate with a mass of $m_{\rm DM} \sim 10^{-19} \text{eV}$ or a vector-like quark condensate with wide range of possible masses. Both cosmological and particle physics constraints on the model lead to a connection between the number of effective relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$, and the chemical potential and CMB temperature at the time of fermion creation. We also find a relation between the superconducting fermion and baryon densities, with implications for the coincidence between the dark matter and baryon densities in standard cosmology. Given the natural $\text{eV}$ scale of neutrinos, this mechanism may have implications for the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter induces time-dependent perturbations in the spacetime metric, enabling its gravitational direct detection. In this work, we propose using astrometry to detect dark matter. After reviewing the calculation of the metric in the presence of scalar dark matter, we study the influence of the perturbations on the apparent motion of astrophysical bodies. We apply our results to angular position measurements of quasars, whose vast distances from Earth present an opportunity to discover dark matter with a mass as low as $10^{-33} \, \mathrm{eV} $. We explore the prospects of very long baseline interferometry and optical astrometric survey measurements for detecting ultralight relics, finding that for the smallest masses, current astrometric surveys can detect dark matter moving locally with a velocity of $10^{-3}$ with energy density as low as $10 ^{ - 4} ~{\rm GeV} / {\rm cm} ^3 $.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological CPT Theorem</title>

Abstract: The CPT theorem states that a unitary and Lorentz-invariant theory must also be invariant under a discrete symmetry $\mathbf{CRT}$ which reverses charge, time, and one spatial direction. In this article, we study a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry group, in which two of the nontrivial symmetries (``Reflection Reality'' and a 180 degree rotation) are implied by Unitarity and Lorentz Invariance respectively, while the third is $\mathbf{CRT}$. (In cosmology, Scale Invariance plays the role of Lorentz Invariance.) This naturally leads to converses of the CPT theorem, as any two of the discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries will imply the third one. Furthermore, in many field theories, the Reflection Reality $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is actually sufficient to imply the theory is fully unitary, over a generic range of couplings. Building upon previous work on the Cosmological Optical Theorem, we derive non-perturbative reality conditions associated with bulk Reflection Reality (in all flat FLRW models) and $\mathbf{CRT}$ (in de Sitter spacetime), in arbitrary dimensions. Remarkably, this $\mathbf{CRT}$ constraint suffices to fix the phase of all wavefunction coefficients at future infinity (up to a real sign) -- without requiring any analytic continuation, or comparison to past infinity -- although extra care is required in cases where the bulk theory has logarithmic UV or IR divergences. This result has significant implications for de Sitter holography, as it allows us to determine the phases of arbitrary $n$-point functions in the dual CFT.</description>

      <title>No-go Theorem for Cosmological Parity Violation</title>

Abstract: A no-go theorem for parity-violation in even $D$-dimensional spacetimes invariant under $ISO(d)$ and dilatations (as well as the implications for odd $D$) is derived. For the case of real massless scalar and gravitons (as well as any massless even integer spin-$s$ field) at $\mathcal{I}^+$, the reality of wavefunction coefficients in Fourier space to all orders in perturbation theory (any order in loops) coming from a local, unitary, IR- and UV-finite theory, which start from the initial \CRT-invariant Bunch-Davies state in the infinite past, is proven. From this it is inferred that a parity-odd correlator with any massless scalar fields and even integer spin-$s$ fields vanishes in the presence of any number of interactions of massless fields. The same is true for correlators with an even number of conformally-coupled and massless odd integer spin-$s$ external fields, which is used to derive the cosmological analogue of Furry's theorem. The fundamental implications of \CRT symmetry for theories with chemical potentials, such as Chern-Simons and Axion inflation, is also discussed. Given the recent interest in parity-violation coming from observational claims of parity-violation detection, these results provide clear constraints on parity-violating models of inflation and establish the measurement of any parity-odd correlator as an exceptionally sensitive probe of new physics beyond vanilla inflation.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Modular Inflation</title>

Abstract: We investigate the role of the Higgs field as a fundamental scalar in the Standard Model within the framework of modular inflation models, where a modulus field acts as the inflaton and its interactions are governed by an underlying modular symmetry. In general, the Higgs field can participate in the dynamics of modular inflation, leading to a two-field inflationary system-termed \emph{Higgs-Modular inflation}-which exhibits non-trivial dynamics and interesting phenomenological implications. We analyze Higgs-Modular inflation both analytically and numerically, highlighting its attractor behavior and the resulting observational constraints. In particular, we find that Higgs-Modular inflation is favored by the latest data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in certain regions of parameter space. This is in contrast to both pure Higgs inflation and pure modular inflation with a Starobinsky-type potential, which tend to predict a relatively low spectral index. Additionally, we discuss the cutoff scale of this inflationary model and the reheating processes induced by the decays of the modulus and the Higgs field.</description>

      <title>Algorithm for Dark Matter-Admixed Neutron Stars</title>

Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations provide a unique window into the fundamental nature of massive objects. In particular, neutron star equations of state have been constrained due to the success of gravitational wave observatories. Recently, the possibility of detecting dark matter-admixed Neutron stars via ground-based laser interferometry have been explored. Dark matter would impact the gravitational waveform of an inspiraling neutron star system through tidal parameters, namely the tidal deformability $\lambda$, incurring a phase shift to the frequency evolution of the signal. This phase shift would depend both on the percentage of dark matter within the star and its particle nature, e.g., bosonic or fermionic. Indirect detection of dark matter through admixture within neutron stars can provide insight into the neutron equation of state, as well as constraints on the density of dark matter in the universe. In this work, we introduce Darksuite, a proposed extension of the LALSuite software framework, designed to model the gravitational wave signatures of dark-matter-admixed neutron stars. This framework employs simulations from the two-fluid, generally relativistic Tolman- Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, wherein one fluid is ordinary nuclear matter and the other is dark matter. We demonstrate interpolation of values from a bank of simulations, enabling the study of binary systems where at least one component may be a dark-matter-admixed neutron star. By leveraging existing methodologies within LALSuite for tidal phase corrections and supplementing them with dark matter effects, Darksuite provides a means to generate and analyze gravitational waveforms for these exotic systems.</description>
