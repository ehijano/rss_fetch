      <title>Theoretical Analysis of the Efficient-Memory Matrix Storage Method for Quantum Emulation Accelerators with Gate Fusion on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum emulators play an important role in the development and testing of quantum algorithms, especially given the limitations of the current FTQC era. Developing high-speed, memory-optimized quantum emulators is a growing research trend, with gate fusion being a promising technique. However, existing gate fusion implementations often struggle to efficiently support large-scale quantum systems with a high number of qubits due to a lack of optimizations for the exponential growth in memory requirements. Therefore, this study proposes the EMMS (Efficient-Memory Matrix Storage) method for storing quantum operators and states, along with an EMMS-based Quantum Emulator Accelerator (QEA) architecture that incorporates multiple processing elements (PEs) to accelerate tensor product and matrix multiplication computations in quantum emulation with gate fusion. The theoretical analysis of the QEA on the Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA, using varying numbers of PEs and different depths of unitary and local data memory, reveals a linear increase in memory depth with the number of qubits. This scaling highlights the potential of the EMMS-based QEA to accommodate larger quantum circuits, providing insights into selecting appropriate memory sizes and FPGA devices. Furthermore, the estimated performance of the QEA with PE counts ranging from $2^2$ to $2^5$ on the Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA demonstrates that increasing the number of PEs significantly reduces the computation cycle count for circuits with fewer than 18 qubits, making it significantly faster than previous works.</description>

      <title>Sorted Weight Sectioning for Energy-Efficient Unstructured Sparse DNNs on Compute-in-Memory Crossbars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $\textit{sorted weight sectioning}$ (SWS): a weight allocation algorithm that places sorted deep neural network (DNN) weight sections on bit-sliced compute-in-memory (CIM) crossbars to reduce analog-to-digital converter (ADC) energy consumption. Data conversions are the most energy-intensive process in crossbar operation. SWS effectively reduces this cost leveraging (1) small weights and (2) zero weights (weight sparsity).
  DNN weights follow bell-shaped distributions, with most weights near zero. Using SWS, we only need low-order crossbar columns for sections with low-magnitude weights. This reduces the quantity and resolution of ADCs used, exponentially decreasing ADC energy costs without significantly degrading DNN accuracy.
  Unstructured sparsification further sharpens the weight distribution with small accuracy loss. However, it presents challenges in hardware tracking of zeros: we cannot switch zero rows to other layer weights in unsorted crossbars without index matching. SWS efficiently addresses unstructured sparse models using offline remapping of zeros into earlier sections, which reveals full sparsity potential and maximizes energy efficiency.
  Our method reduces ADC energy use by 89.5% on unstructured sparse BERT models. Overall, this paper introduces a novel algorithm to promote energy-efficient CIM crossbars for unstructured sparse DNN workloads.</description>

      <title>Taming Performance Variability caused by Client-Side Hardware Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many online services running in datacenters are implemented using a microservice software architecture characterized by strict latency requirements. Consequently, this popular software paradigm is increasingly used for the performance evaluation of server systems. Due to the scale and complexity of datacenters, the evaluation of server optimization techniques is usually done on a smaller scale using a client-server model. Although the experimental details of the server side are excessively described in most publications, the client side is often ignored. This paper identifies the hardware configuration of the client side as an important source of performance variation that can affect the accuracy and the correctness of the conclusions of a study that analyzes the performance of microservices. This is partially attributed to the strict latency requirements of microservices and the small scale of the experimental environment. In this work we present, using a widely used online-service, several examples where the accuracy and the trends of the conclusions differ based on the configuration of the client-side. At the same time we show that the experimental evaluation time can be significantly affected by the hardware configuration of the client. All these provoke the discussion of the right way to configure the experimental environment for assessing the performance of microservices.</description>

      <title>DPD-NeuralEngine: A 22-nm 6.6-TOPS/W/mm$^2$ Recurrent Neural Network Accelerator for Wideband Power Amplifier Digital Pre-Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based Digital Pre-distortion (DPD) in modern communication systems necessitates efficient hardware implementations. This paper presents DPD-NeuralEngine, an ultra-fast, tiny-area, and power-efficient DPD accelerator based on a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network (NN). Leveraging a co-designed software and hardware approach, our 22 nm CMOS implementation operates at 2 GHz, capable of processing I/Q signals up to 250 MSps. Experimental results demonstrate a throughput of 256.5 GOPS and power efficiency of 1.32 TOPS/W with DPD linearization performance measured in Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR) of -45.3 dBc and Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) of -39.8 dB. To our knowledge, this work represents the first AI-based DPD application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) accelerator, achieving a power-area efficiency (PAE) of 6.6 TOPS/W/mm$^2$.</description>

      <title>MERIT: Multimodal Wearable Vital Sign Waveform Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and premature mortality worldwide, with occupational environments significantly influencing CVD risk, underscoring the need for effective cardiac monitoring and early warning systems. Existing methods of monitoring vital signs require subjects to remain stationary, which is impractical for daily monitoring as individuals are often in motion. To address this limitation, we propose MERIT, a multimodality-based wearable system designed for precise ECG waveform monitoring without movement restrictions. Daily activities, involving frequent arm movements, can significantly affect sensor data and complicate the reconstruction of accurate ECG signals. To mitigate motion impact and enhance ECG signal reconstruction, we introduce a deep independent component analysis (Deep-ICA) module and a multimodal fusion module. We conducted experiments with 15 subjects. Our results, compared with commercial wearable devices and existing methods, demonstrate that MERIT accurately reconstructs ECG waveforms during various office activities, offering a reliable solution for fine-grained cardiac monitoring in dynamic environments.</description>
