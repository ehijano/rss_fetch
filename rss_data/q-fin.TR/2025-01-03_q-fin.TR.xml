      <title>LLM-Powered Multi-Agent System for Automated Crypto Portfolio Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency investment is inherently difficult due to its shorter history compared to traditional assets, the need to integrate vast amounts of data from various modalities, and the requirement for complex reasoning. While deep learning approaches have been applied to address these challenges, their black-box nature raises concerns about trust and explainability. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications due to their ability to understand multi-modal data and generate explainable decisions. However, single LLM faces limitations in complex, comprehensive tasks such as asset investment. These limitations are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency investment, where LLMs have less domain-specific knowledge in their training corpora.
  To overcome these challenges, we propose an explainable, multi-modal, multi-agent framework for cryptocurrency investment. Our framework uses specialized agents that collaborate within and across teams to handle subtasks such as data analysis, literature integration, and investment decision-making for the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The expert training module fine-tunes agents using multi-modal historical data and professional investment literature, while the multi-agent investment module employs real-time data to make informed cryptocurrency investment decisions. Unique intrateam and interteam collaboration mechanisms enhance prediction accuracy by adjusting final predictions based on confidence levels within agent teams and facilitating information sharing between teams. Empirical evaluation using data from November 2023 to September 2024 demonstrates that our framework outperforms single-agent models and market benchmarks in classification, asset pricing, portfolio, and explainability performance.</description>

      <title>Position building in competition is a game with incomplete information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines strategic trading under incomplete information, where firms lack full knowledge of key aspects of their competitors' trading strategies such as target sizes and market impact models. We extend previous work on competitive trading equilibria by incorporating uncertainty through the framework of Bayesian games. This allows us to analyze scenarios where firms have diverse beliefs about market conditions and each other's strategies. We derive optimal trading strategies in this setting and demonstrate how uncertainty significantly impacts these strategies compared to the complete information case.
  Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach to model the presence of non-strategic traders, even when strategic firms disagree on their characteristics. Our analysis reveals the complex interplay of beliefs and strategic adjustments required in such an environment. Finally, we discuss limitations of the current model, including the reliance on linear market impact and the lack of dynamic strategy adjustments, outlining directions for future research.</description>
