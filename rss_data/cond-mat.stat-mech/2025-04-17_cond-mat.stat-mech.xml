      <title>Velocity Distribution and Diffusion of an Athermal Inertial Run-and-Tumble Particle in a Shear-Thinning Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an athermal inertial active particle moving in a shear-thinning medium in $d=1$. The viscosity of the medium is modeled using a Coulomb-tanh function, while the activity is represented by an asymmetric dichotomous noise with strengths $-\Delta$ and $\mu\Delta$, transitioning between these states at a rate $\lambda$. Starting from the Fokker-Planck~(FP) equation for the time-dependent probability distributions $P(v,-\Delta,t)$ and $P(v,\mu\Delta,t)$ of the particle's velocity $v$ at time $t$, moving under the influence of active forces $-\Delta$ and $\mu\Delta$ respectively, we analytically derive the steady-state velocity distribution function $P_s(v)$, explicitly dependent on $\mu$. Also, we obtain a quadrature expression for the effective diffusion coefficient $D_e$ for the symmetric active force case~($\mu=1$). For a given $\Delta$ and $\mu$, we show that $P_s(v)$ exhibits multiple transitions as $\lambda$ is varied. Subsequently, we numerically compute $P_s(v)$, the mean-squared velocity $\langle v^2\rangle(t)$, and the diffusion coefficient $D_e$ by solving the particle's equation of motion, all of which show excellent agreement with the analytical results in the steady-state. Finally, we examine the universal nature of the transitions in $P_s(v)$ by considering an alternative functional form of medium's viscosity that also capture the shear-thinning behavior.</description>

      <title>Integrating Neural Networks and Tensor Networks for Computing Free Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing free energy is a fundamental problem in statistical physics. Recently, two distinct methods have been developed and have demonstrated remarkable success: the tensor-network-based contraction method and the neural-network-based variational method. Tensor networks are accu?rate, but their application is often limited to low-dimensional systems due to the high computational complexity in high-dimensional systems. The neural network method applies to systems with general topology. However, as a variational method, it is not as accurate as tensor networks. In this work, we propose an integrated approach, tensor-network-based variational autoregressive networks (TNVAN), that leverages the strengths of both tensor networks and neural networks: combining the variational autoregressive neural network's ability to compute an upper bound on free energy and perform unbiased sampling from the variational distribution with the tensor network's power to accurately compute the partition function for small sub-systems, resulting in a robust method for precisely estimating free energy. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted numerical experiments on spin glass systems with various topologies, including two-dimensional lattices, fully connected graphs, and random graphs. Our numerical results demonstrate the superior accuracy of our method compared to existing approaches. In particular, it effectively handles systems with long-range interactions and leverages GPU efficiency without requiring singular value decomposition, indicating great potential in tackling statistical mechanics problems and simulating high-dimensional complex systems through both tensor networks and neural networks.</description>

      <title>Control-driven critical fluctuations across quantum trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitored quantum circuits in which entangling unitary dynamics compete with projective local measurements can host measurement-induced phase transitions witnessed by entanglement measures at late times. Adding feedback conditioned on the measurement outcomes gives rise to another type of phase transition witnessed by local order parameters and correlation functions. These transitions, known as control or absorbing-state transitions, generically occur within the area-law entanglement phase and are thought to be governed by classical physics in that their critical exponents match those of the classical limit of the model. In this work, we examine quantum features of these transitions, focusing on a Bernoulli circuit model with a well-defined classical limit. First we demonstrate that, in the local basis defined by the absorbing state, the steady-state quantum coherence undergoes a phase transition at the control transition, where its logarithm changes discontinuously from volume- to area-law scaling. Second, we analyze the control transition from the perspective of fluctuations in observables, which carry two contributions: classical fluctuations over circuit realizations (present in the classical limit), and quantum fluctuations over trajectories and states (both absent in the classical limit). Both contributions can be estimated in experiments without post-selection. The circuit-to-circuit fluctuations, the dominant contribution, carry the critical behavior of the classical limit. However, the subleading quantum fluctuations that represent fluctuations between different quantum "worlds" also go critical at the control transition. These critical quantum fluctuations at the control transition also occur in other models, and we discuss how they can be measured experimentally without post-selection.</description>

      <title>Infinite Stability in Disordered Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quenched disordered systems, the existence of ordering is generally believed to be only possible in the weak disorder regime (disregarding models of spin-glass type). In particular, sufficiently large random fields is expected to prohibit any finite temperature ordering. Here, we prove that this is not necessarily true, and show rigorously that for physically relevant systems in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with $d\ge 3$, disorder can induce ordering that is \textit{infinitely stable}, in the sense that (1) there exists ordering at arbitrarily large disorder strength and (2) the transition temperature is asymptotically nonzero in the limit of infinite disorder. Analogous results can hold in 2 dimensions provided that the underlying graph is non-planar (e.g., $\mathbb{Z}^2$ sites with nearest and next-nearest neighbor interactions).</description>

      <title>Robust Markov stability for community detection at a scale learned based on the structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection, the unsupervised task of clustering nodes of a graph, finds applications across various fields. The common approaches for community detection involve optimizing an objective function to partition the nodes into communities at a single scale of granularity. However, the single-scale approaches often fall short of producing partitions that are robust and at a suitable scale. The existing algorithm, PyGenStability, returns multiple robust partitions for a network by optimizing the multi-scale Markov stability function. However, in cases where the suitable scale is not known or assumed by the user, there is no principled method to select a single robust partition at a suitable scale from the multiple partitions that PyGenStability produces. Our proposed method combines the Markov stability framework with a pre-trained machine learning model for scale selection to obtain one robust partition at a scale that is learned based on the graph structure. This automatic scale selection involves using a gradient boosting model pre-trained on hand-crafted and embedding-based network features from a labeled dataset of 10k benchmark networks. This model was trained to predicts the scale value that maximizes the similarity of the output partition to the planted partition of the benchmark network. Combining our scale selection algorithm with the PyGenStability algorithm results in PyGenStabilityOne (PO): a hyperparameter-free multi-scale community detection algorithm that returns one robust partition at a suitable scale without the need for any assumptions, input, or tweaking from the user. We compare the performance of PO against 29 algorithms and show that it outperforms 25 other algorithms by statistically meaningful margins. Our results facilitate choosing between community detection algorithms, among which PO stands out as the accurate, robust, and hyperparameter-free method.</description>

      <title>Phase Separation in Active Binary Mixtures With Chemical Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study motility-induced phase separation~(MIPS) in active AB binary mixtures undergoing the chemical reaction $A \rightleftharpoons B$. Starting from the evolution equations for the density fields $\rho_i(\vec r, t)$ describing MIPS, we phenomenologically incorporate the effects of the reaction through the reaction rate $\Gamma$ into the equations. The steady-state domain morphologies depend on $\Gamma$ and the relative activity of the species, $\Delta$. For a sufficiently large $\Gamma$ and $\Delta\ne 1$, the more active component of the mixture forms a droplet morphology. We characterize the morphology of domains by calculating the equal-time correlation function $C(r, t)$ and the structure factor $S(k, t)$, exhibiting scaling violation. The average domain size, $L(t)$, follows a diffusive growth as $L(t)\sim t^{1/3}$ before reaching the steady state domain size, $L_{\rm ss}$. Additionally, $L_{\rm ss}$ shows the scaling relation $L_{\rm ss}\sim\Gamma^{-1/4}$, independent of $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Density-field structures in a few systems undergoing velocity ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two (off-lattice) varieties of out-of-equilibrium systems, viz., granular and active matter systems, that, in addition to displaying velocity ordering, exhibit fascinating pattern formation in the density field, similar to those during vapor-liquid phase transitions. In the granular system, velocity ordering occurs due to reduction in the normal components of velocities, arising from inelastic collisions. In the active matter case, on the other hand, velocity alignment occurs because of the inherent tendency of the active particles to follow each other. Inspite of this difference, the patterns, even during density-field evolutions, in these systems can be remarkably similar. This we have quantified via the calculations of the two-point equal time correlation functions and the structure factors. These results have been compared with the well studied case of kinetics of phase separation within the framework of the Ising model. Despite the order-parameter conservation constraint in all the cases, in the density field, the quantitative structural features in the Ising case is quite different from those for the granular and active matters. Interestingly, the correlation function for the latter varieties, particularly for an active matter model, quite accurately describes the structure in a real assembly of biologically active particles.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Quantum Master and Fokker-Planck Equation for Gravitational Systems and Gravitational Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum master equation describing the stochastic dynamics of a quantum massive system interacting with a quantum gravitational field is useful for the investigation of quantum gravitational and quantum informational issues such as the quantum nature of gravity, gravity-induced entanglement and gravitational decoherence. Studies of the decoherence of quantum systems by an electromagnetic field shows that a lower temperature environment is more conducive to successful quantum information processing experiments. Likewise, the quantum nature of (perturbative) gravity is far better revealed at lower temperatures than high, minimizing the corruptive effects of thermal noise. In this work, generalizing earlier results of the Markovian ABH master equation [1,2] which is valid only for high temperatures, we derive a non-Markovian quantum master equation for the reduced density matrix, and the associated Fokker-Planck equation for the Wigner distribution function, for the stochastic dynamics of two masses following quantum trajectories, interacting with a graviton field, including the effects of graviton noise, valid for all temperatures. We follow the influence functional approach exemplified in the derivation of the non-Markovian Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation [62,64] for quantum Brownian motion. We find that in the low temperature limit, the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix decrease in time logarithmically for the zero temperature part and quadratically in time for the temperature-dependent part, which is distinctly different from the Markovian case. We end with a summary of our findings and a discussion on how this problem studied here is related to the quantum stochastic equation derived in [77] for gravitational self force studies, and to quantum optomechanics where experimental observation of gravitational decoherence and entanglement may be implemented.</description>

      <title>Periodic Potential for Point Defects in a 2D Hexagonal Colloidal Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the statistical nature of point defects in a two-dimensional hexagonal colloidal crystal from the perspective of stochastic dynamics. Starting from the experimentally recorded trajectories of time series, the underlying drifting forces along with the diffusion matrix from thermal fluctuations are extracted. We then employ a deposition in which the deterministic terms are split into diffusive and transverse components under a stochastic potential with the lattice periodicity to uncover the dynamic landscape as well as the transverse matrix, two key structures from limited ranges of measurements. The analysis elucidates some fundamental dichotomy between mono-point and di-point defects of paired vacancies or interstitials. Having large transverse magnitude, the second class of defects are likely to break the detailed balance, Such a scenario was attributed to the root cause of lattice melting by experimental observations. The constructed potential can in turn facilitate large-scale simulation for the ongoing research.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Spectral Distribution of a non-Hermitian $\beta$-Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a non-Hermitian $\beta$-ensemble and determine its spectral density in the limit of large $\beta$ and large matrix size $n$. The ensemble is given by a general tridiagonal complex random matrix of normal and chi-distributed random variables, extending previous work of two of the authors. The joint distribution of eigenvalues contains a Vandermonde determinant to the power $\beta$ and a residual coupling to the eigenvectors. A tool in the computation of the limiting spectral density is a single characteristic polynomial for centred tridiagonal Jacobi matrices, for which we explicitly determine the coefficients in terms of its matrix elements. In the low temperature limit $\beta\gg1$ our ensemble reduces to such a centred matrix with vanishing diagonal. A general theorem from free probability based on the variance of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial allows us to obtain the spectral density when additionally taking the large-$n$ limit. It is rotationally invariant on a compact disc, given by the logarithm of the radius plus a constant. The same density is obtained when starting form a tridiagonal complex symmetric ensemble, which thus plays a special role. Extensive numerical simulations confirm our analytical results and put this and the previously studied ensemble in the context of the pseudospectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconsider the dynamics of localized states in the deterministic and stochastic discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Localized initial conditions disperse if the strength of the nonlinear part drops below a threshold. Localized states are unstable in a noisy environment. As expected, an infinite temperature state emerges when multiplicative noise is applied, while additive noise yields unbounded dynamics since conservation of normalization is violated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article deals with the existence and scaling of an energy cascade in steady granular liquid flows between the scale at which the system is forced and the scale at which it dissipates energy. In particular, we examine the possible origins of a breaking of the Kolmogorov Universality class that applies to Newtonian liquids under similar conditions. In order to answer these questions, we build a generic field theory of granular liquid flows and, through a study of its symmetries, show that indeed the Kolmogorov scaling can be broken, although most of the symmetries of the Newtonian flows are preserved.</description>

Abstract: Information processing in the brain is coordinated by the dynamic activity of neurons and neural populations at a range of spatiotemporal scales. These dynamics, captured in the form of electrophysiological recordings and neuroimaging, show evidence of time-irreversibility and broken detailed balance suggesting that the brain operates in a nonequilibrium stationary state. Furthermore, the level of nonequilibrium, measured by entropy production or irreversibility appears to be a crucial signature of cognitive complexity and consciousness. The subsequent study of neural dynamics from the perspective of nonequilibrium statistical physics is an emergent field that challenges the assumptions of symmetry and maximum-entropy that are common in traditional models. In this review, we discuss the plethora of exciting results emerging at the interface of nonequilibrium dynamics and neuroscience. We begin with an introduction to the mathematical paradigms necessary to understand nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous and discrete state-spaces. Next, we review both model-free and model-based approaches to analysing nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous-state recordings and neural spike-trains, as well as the results of such analyses. We briefly consider the topic of nonequilibrium computation in neural systems, before concluding with a discussion and outlook on the field.</description>

      <title>Hardness of observing strong-to-weak symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is the cornerstone of our understanding of quantum phases of matter. Recent works have generalized this concept to the domain of mixed states in open quantum systems, where symmetries can be realized in two distinct ways dubbed strong and weak. Novel intrinsically mixed phases of quantum matter can then be defined by the spontaneous breaking of strong symmetry down to weak symmetry. However, proposed order parameters for strong-to-weak SSB (based on mixed-state fidelities or purities) seem to require exponentially many copies of the state, raising the question: is it possible to efficiently detect strong-to-weak SSB in general? Here we answer this question negatively in the paradigmatic cases of $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ symmetries. We construct ensembles of pseudorandom mixed states that do not break the strong symmetry, yet are computationally indistinguishable from states that do. This rules out the existence of efficient state-agnostic protocols to detect strong-to-weak SSB.</description>

      <title>Liouvillean Spectral Transition in Noisy Quantum Many-Body Scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of quantum many-body systems under decoherence is essential for developing robust quantum technologies. Here, we examine the fate of weak ergodicity breaking in systems hosting quantum many-body scars when subject to local pure dephasing -- an experimentally relevant form of environmental noise. Focusing on a large class of models with an approximate su(2)-structured scar subspace, we show that scarred eigenmodes of the Liouvillean exhibit a transition reminiscent of spontaneous $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetry breaking as the dephasing strength increases. Unlike previously studied non-Hermitian mechanisms, this transition arises from a distinct quantum jump effect. Remarkably, in platforms such as the XY spin ladder and PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, the critical dephasing rate shows only weak dependence on system size, revealing an unexpected robustness of scarred dynamics in noisy quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of a run and tumble particle in a harmonic trap, with a finite run and tumble time, by a direct integration of the equation of motion. An exact 1D steady state distribution, diagram laws and a programmable Volterra difference equation are derived to calculate any order of moments in any other dimension, both for steady state as well as the Laplace transform in time for the intermediate states. We also use the moments to infer the distribution by considering a Gaussian quadrature for the corresponding measure, and from the scaling law of high order moments.</description>

      <title>A numerical study of the zeros of the grand partition function of $k$-mers on strips of width $k$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07744v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study numerically, the distribution of the zeros of the grand partition function of $k$-mers on a $k \times L$ strip in the complex activity (z) plane. Using transfer matrix methods, we find that our results match the analytical predictions of Heilmann and Leib for $k = 2$. However, for $k = 3$, the zeros are confined within a bounded region, suggesting a fundamental difference in critical behavior. This indicates that trimers belong to a distinct universality class in some finite geometries. We observe that the density of zeros along multiple line segments in the complex plane reveals a richer structure than in the dimer case. {Our findings emphasize the role of geometric constraints in shaping the statistical mechanics of $k$-mer models and set the stage for further studies in higher-dimensional lattices.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Fluctuation-Response Relations: From Identities to Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In nonequilibrium steady states of Markov jump processes, we derive exact Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs) that express the covariance between any pair of currents in terms of static responses in a notably simple form, thus generalizing the fluctuation-dissipation theorem far from equilibrium. We begin by considering perturbations in the symmetric part of the rates. We demonstrate that FRRs imply a hierarchy of thermodynamic bounds. These hierarchies prove the recently conjectured Response Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation (R-TUR), which bounds the ratio between any current's response and its variance by the entropy production rate (EPR). We furthermore strengthen this bound in two distinct ways, using partial EPR in one case and pseudo-EPR in the other. For perturbations in the antisymmetric part of the rates, we show that the ratio between any current's response and its variance is bounded by traffic, a metric representing the total number of transitions per unit time in the system. As an application, we use FRRs to explain the origin of positive correlations between currents in Coulomb-blockaded systems previously observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Universal finite-size scaling in the extraordinary-log boundary phase of three-dimensional $O(N)$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in boundary critical phenomena have led to the discovery of a new surface universality class in the three-dimensional $O(N)$ model. The newly found ``extraordinary-log" phase can be realized on a two-dimensional surface for $N&lt; N_c$, with $N_c&gt;3$, and on a plane defect embedded into a three-dimensional system, for any $N$. One of the key features of the extraordinary-log phase is the presence of logarithmic violations of standard finite-size scaling. In this work we study finite-size scaling in the extraordinary-log universality class by means of Monte Carlo simulations of an improved lattice model. We simulate the model with open boundary conditions, realizing the extraordinary-log phase on the surface for $N=2,3$, as well as with fully periodic boundary conditions and in the presence of a plane defect for $N=2,3,4$. In line with theory predictions, renormalization-group invariant observables studied here exhibit a logarithmic dependence on the size of the system. We numerically access not only the leading term in the $\beta$-function governing these logarithmic violations, but also the subleading term, which controls the evolution of the boundary phase diagram as a function of $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By decoupling forward and backward stochastic trajectories, we construct a family of martingales and work theorems for both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics. Our results are made possible by an alternative derivation of work theorems that uses tools from stochastic calculus instead of path-integration. We further strengthen the equality in work theorems by evaluating expectations conditioned on an arbitrary initial state value. These generalizations extend the applicability of work theorems and offer new interpretations of entropy production in stochastic systems. Lastly, we discuss the violation of work theorems in far-from-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nishimori point of the random bond Ising model is a prototype of renormalization group fixed points with strong disorder. We show that the exact correlation length and crossover critical exponents at this point can be identified in two and three spatial dimensions starting from properties of the Nishimori line. These are the first exact exponents for frustrated random magnets, a circumstance to be also contrasted with the fact that the exact exponents of the Ising model without disorder are not known in three dimensions. Our considerations extend to higher dimensions and models other than Ising.</description>

      <title>Deep Variational Multivariate Information Bottleneck -- A Framework for Variational Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational dimensionality reduction methods are widely used for their accuracy, generative capabilities, and robustness. We introduce a unifying framework that generalizes both such as traditional and state-of-the-art methods. The framework is based on an interpretation of the multivariate information bottleneck, trading off the information preserved in an encoder graph (defining what to compress) against that in a decoder graph (defining a generative model for data). Using this approach, we rederive existing methods, including the deep variational information bottleneck, variational autoencoders, and deep multiview information bottleneck. We naturally extend the deep variational CCA (DVCCA) family to beta-DVCCA and introduce a new method, the deep variational symmetric information bottleneck (DVSIB). DSIB, the deterministic limit of DVSIB, connects to modern contrastive learning approaches such as Barlow Twins, among others. We evaluate these methods on Noisy MNIST and Noisy CIFAR-100, showing that algorithms better matched to the structure of the problem like DVSIB and beta-DVCCA produce better latent spaces as measured by classification accuracy, dimensionality of the latent variables, sample efficiency, and consistently outperform other approaches under comparable conditions. Additionally, we benchmark against state-of-the-art models, achieving superior or competitive accuracy. Our results demonstrate that this framework can seamlessly incorporate diverse multi-view representation learning algorithms, providing a foundation for designing novel, problem-specific loss functions.</description>

      <title>W-Kernel and Its Principal Space for Frequentist Evaluation of Bayesian Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13017v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the variability of posterior estimates is a key aspect of Bayesian model assessment. In this study, we focus on the posterior covariance matrix W, defined using the log-likelihood of each observation. Previous studies have examined the role of the principal space of W in Bayesian sensitivity analysis, notably MacEachern and Peruggia (2002) and Thomas et al. (2018). In this work, we show that the principal space of W is also relevant for frequentist evaluation, using the recently proposed Bayesian infinitesimal jackknife (IJ) approximation Giordano and Broderick (2023) as a key tool. We next consider the relationship between the matrix W and the Fisher kernel. We show that the Fisher kernel can be regarded as an approximation to W; the matrix W, in itself, can be interpreted as a reproducing kernel, which we refer to as the W-kernel. Based on this connection, we examine the dual relationship between the W-kernel formulation in the data space and the classical asymptotic formulation in the parameter space. These ideas suggest a form of Bayesian-frequentist duality that emerges through the dual structure of kernel PCA, where posterior and frequentist covariances serve as inner products in their respective spaces. As an application, we consider an approximate bootstrap of posterior means based on posterior samples generated by MCMC. We show that the projection onto the principal space of W facilitates frequentist evaluation, particularly of the higher-order term in this procedure. In one of the appendices, we introduce incomplete Cholesky decomposition as an efficient method for computing the principal space of W and discuss the related concept of representative subsets of the observations.</description>

      <title>Mining higher-order triadic interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex systems often involve higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have so far been mostly neglected. In this article, we propose a theoretical model that demonstrates that triadic interactions can modulate the mutual information between the dynamical state of two linked nodes. Leveraging this result, we propose the Triadic Interaction Mining (TRIM) algorithm to mine triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data, finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions that are often ignored, yet can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to the climate.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel technique to numerically calculate R\'enyi entanglement entropies in lattice quantum field theory using generative models. We describe how flow-based approaches can be combined with the replica trick using a custom neural-network architecture around a lattice defect connecting two replicas. Numerical tests for the $\phi^4$ scalar field theory in two and three dimensions demonstrate that our technique outperforms state-of-the-art Monte Carlo calculations, and exhibit a promising scaling with the defect size.</description>

In contrast to the classical-gas experiments, where no temperature change was measured, here we observe and quantitatively explain both cooling and heating effects, which arise, respectively, due to quantum statistics and inter-particle interactions.</description>
