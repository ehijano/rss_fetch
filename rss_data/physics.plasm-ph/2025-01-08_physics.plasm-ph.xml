      <title>Hybrid simulations of FRC merging and compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An improved understanding of Field Reversed Configuration (FRC) merging and stability in high acceleration and compression magnetic fields is needed to speed up the development of the pulsed fusion concept developed at Helion Energy. All previous theoretical and simulation work on FRC merging and compression was performed using 2D MHD models. The results of novel 2D hybrid simulations (fluid electrons and full-orbit kinetic ions) of FRC merging and compression are presented. Results of kinetic and MHD simulations, computed using the HYM code, are compared and analyzed. In cases without axial magnetic compression, both the MHD and hybrid simulations show a high sensitivity to the initial parameters (i.e. FRC separation, velocity, normalized separatrix radius, and plasma viscosity), showing that FRCs with large elongation and separatrix radius either do not merge or merge partially, forming a doublet FRC. Application of a mirror coil field at the FRC ends with increasing strength is shown to lead to fast and complete merging of the FRCs in MHD and kinetic simulations.</description>

      <title>Observations of Turbulence and Transport of Energetic Particles at Interplanetary Shocks: Transition of Transport Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of energetic particles is intimately related to the properties of plasma turbulence, a ubiquitous dynamic process that transfers energy across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. However, the mechanisms governing the interactions between plasma turbulence and energetic particles remain incompletely understood. Here we present comprehensive observations from the upstream region of a quasi-perpendicular interplanetary (IP) shock on 2004 January 22, using data from four Cluster spacecraft to investigate the interplay between turbulence dynamics and energetic particle transport. Our observations reveal a transition in energetic proton fluxes from exponential to power-law decay with increasing distance from the IP shock. This result provides possible observational evidence of a shift in transport behavior from normal diffusion to superdiffusion. This transition correlates with an increase in the time ratio from $\tau_s/\tau_{c}&lt;1$ to $\tau_s/\tau_{c}\gg1$, where $\tau_s$ is the proton isotropization time, and $\tau_{c}$ is the turbulence correlation time. Additionally, the frequency-wavenumber distributions of magnetic energy in the power-law decay zone indicate that energetic particles excite linear Alfv\'en-like harmonic waves through gyroresonance, thereby modulating the original turbulence structure. These findings provide valuable insights for future studies on the propagation and acceleration of energetic particles in turbulent astrophysical and space plasma systems.</description>

      <title>Shapiro Steps Observed in a Two-Dimensional Yukawa Solid Modulated by a One-Dimensional Vibrational Periodic Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depinning dynamics of a two-dimensional (2D) solid dusty plasma modulated by a one-dimensional (1D) vibrational periodic substrate are investigated using Langevin dynamical simulations. As the uniform driving force increases gradually, from the overall drift velocity varying with the driving force, four significant Shapiro steps are discovered. The data analysis indicate that, when the ratio of the frequency from the drift motion over potential wells to the external frequency from the modulation substrate is close to integers, dynamic mode locking occurs, corresponding to the discovered Shapiro steps. Around both termini of the first and fourth Shapiro steps, the transitions are found to be always continuous, however, the transition between the second and third Shapiro steps is discontinuous, probably due to the different arrangements of particles.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the Fusion Workforce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fusion energy research and development landscape has seen significant advances in recent years, with important scientific and technological breakthroughs and a rapid rise of investment in the private sector. The workforce needs of the nascent fusion industry are growing at a rate that academic workforce development programs are not currently able to match. This paper presents the findings of the Workforce Accelerator for Fusion Energy Development Conference held in Hampton, Virginia, United States of America (USA), on May 29-30 2024, which was funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF). A major goal of the conference was to focus on bringing public and private stakeholders together to identify opportunities for partnership in fusion research and education with the goal of meeting the needs for a talented and diverse workforce. Representatives from industry, academia, and national laboratories participated in the conference through the preparation of white papers, presentations, and group discussions, and the production of recommendations to address the challenges facing the US fusion workforce.</description>

      <title>Emission Characteristics of Energetic Electrons with Crescent-shaped Velocity Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar flares release magnetic energy through reconnection, accelerating electrons into nonthermal velocity distributions, including crescent-shaped electron populations. These energetic electron distributions are crucial in driving instabilities which can lead to distinct electromagnetic emissions. This study investigates the emission properties of crescent-shaped electron velocity distribution functions (EVDFs) under different frequency ratios ($\omega_{pe}/\Omega_{ce}$), critical for understanding plasma conditions in various astrophysical environments, by comparing the emissions and intensities of waves among different cases. Here, we study and analyze three distinct frequency ratio conditions (2.2, 10, and 1, designated as cases A, B, and C, respectively). We found that the beam-Langmuir (BL) and upper-hybrid (UH) modes can be efficiently excited, leading to further plasma emissions in different cases. Our study reveals that the fundamental (O/F) emission can reach a maximum value of $\sim$$10^{-4} E_{\mathrm{k}0}$, while the harmonics (H) can extend to $\sim$$1.5 \times 10^{-5} E_{\mathrm{k}0}$ depending on the frequency ratio of the environment. The intensity of the fundamental mode exceeds previous findings for pure-ring, beam, and ring-beam distributions, highlighting the impact of crescent-shaped electron velocity distributions on wave excitation and emission processes. This effect is notably influenced by different frequency ratios, offering new insights into the way that nonthermal electron distributions affect the plasma emission process.</description>

      <title>Investigation of bremsstrahlung emission in an electron cyclotron resonance ion source and its dependence on the magnetic confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Monte Carlo (MC) code is used to investigate the bremsstrahlung x-ray emission of an electron cyclotron resonance ion source (ECRIS) and its dependence on the axial magnetic confinement. The x-ray spectral temperature Ts measured with the simulations is in fair agreement with previous experiments. The dependence of Ts on the minimum magnetic field of the configuration Bmin is corroborated, also observing that the ion extraction peak field Bext has no influence on temperature. Details on the mechanism generating the hot electron population responsible for the change in spectral x-ray temperature as a function of Bmin are proposed, based on an in-depth investigation of the electron population with the MC code using a high statistics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and modulation of cosmic ray modified magnetosonic waves in a galactic gaseous rotating plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The influence of the presence of cosmic fluid on the magnetosonic waves and modulation instabilities in the interstellar medium of spiral galaxies is investigated. The fluid model is developed by modifying the pressure equation in such dissipative rotating magnetoplasmas incorporating thermal ionized gas and cosmic rays. Applying the normal mode analysis, a modified dispersion relation is derived to study linear magnetosonic wave modes and their instabilities. The cosmic rays influence the wave damping by accelerating the damping rate. The standard reductive perturbation method is employed in the fluid model leading to a Korteweg de Vries Burgers (KdVB) equation in the small-amplitude limit. Several nonlinear wave shapes are assessed by solving the KdVB equation, analytically and numerically. The cosmic ray diffusivity and magnetic resistivity are responsible for the generation of shock waves. The modulational instability (MI) and the rogue wave solutions of the magnetosonic waves are studied by deriving a nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation from the obtained KdVB equation under the assumption that the cosmic ray diffusion and magnetic resistivity are weak and the carrier wave frequency is considerably lower than the wave frequency. The influence of various plasma parameters on the growth rate of MI is examined. The modification of the pressure term due to cosmic fluid reduces the MI growth in the interstellar medium. In addition, a quantitative analysis of the characteristics of rogue wave solutions is presented. Our investigation's applicability to the interstellar medium of spiral galaxies is traced out.</description>
