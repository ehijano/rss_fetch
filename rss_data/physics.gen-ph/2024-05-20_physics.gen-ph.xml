      <title>A Role of Fractional Dimension in Study Physics</title>

Abstract: We study physics from a fractional dimensional perspective. It is considered that the whole space is not only integer dimensions but also a superposition of spaces between integer dimensions. Space-filling between integer dimensions makes a fractional dimensional space. This happens through a rotation of the integer dimension by the fractional derivative operator (local part) to sweep all spaces between two integer dimensions. Then, we introduce six axioms which they can help us to build a mathematical framework for study physics from fractional dimension point of view. Afterward, three scenarios such as static, linear and quadratic trajectories are demonstrated. Where moving with linear or quadratic trajectories in fractional dimensional space corresponds to an inertial framework or accelerated system in physics, respectively. Also from this opinion, it is realized that the coupling of space and time (space-time) happens through the dimension platform with an interconnection role where we call it space-dimension-time. Finally, the wave equation is derived from a fractional dimensional point of view with a linear trajectory in fractional dimensional space. And the behavior of electromagnetic wave in lossless and loss mediums, Doppler effect and gravitational red (blue)-shift are also demonstrated from fractional dimensional aspect.</description>
