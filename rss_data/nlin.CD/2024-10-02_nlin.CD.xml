      <title>Data-driven prediction of large-scale spatiotemporal chaos with distributed low-dimensional models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex chaotic dynamics, seen in natural and industrial systems like turbulent flows and weather patterns, often span vast spatial domains with interactions across scales. Accurately capturing these features requires a high-dimensional state space to resolve all the time and spatial scales. For dissipative systems the dynamics lie on a finite-dimensional manifold with fewer degrees of freedom. Thus, by building reduced-order data-driven models in manifold coordinates, we can capture the essential behavior of chaotic systems. Unfortunately, these tend to be formulated globally rendering them less effective for large spatial systems. In this context, we present a data-driven low-dimensional modeling approach to tackle the complexities of chaotic motion, Markovian dynamics, multi-scale behavior, and high numbers of degrees of freedom within large spatial domains. Our methodology involves a parallel scheme of decomposing a spatially extended system into a sequence of local `patches', and constructing a set of coupled, local low-dimensional dynamical models for each patch. Here, we choose to construct the set of local models using autoencoders (for constructing the low-dimensional representation) and neural ordinary differential equations, NODE, for learning the evolution equation. Each patch, or local model, shares the same underlying functions (e.g., autoencoders and NODEs) due to the spatial homogeneity of the underlying systems we consider. We apply this method to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and 2D Kolmogorov flow, and reduce state dimension by up to two orders of magnitude while accurately capturing both short-term dynamics and long-term statistics.</description>

      <title>PREPARE: PREdicting PAndemic's REcurring Waves Amidst Mutations, Vaccination, and Lockdowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study releases an adaptable framework that can provide insights to policymakers to predict the complex recurring waves of the pandemic in the medium postemergence of the virus spread, a phase marked by rapidly changing factors like virus mutations, lockdowns, and vaccinations, offering a way to forecast infection trends and stay ahead of future outbreaks even amidst uncertainty. The proposed model is validated on data from COVID-19 spread in Germany.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap between Koopmanism and Response Theory: Using Natural Variability to Predict Forced Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fluctuation-dissipation theorem is a cornerstone result in statistical mechanics that can be used to translate the statistics of the free natural variability of a system into information on its forced response to perturbations. By combining this viewpoint on response theory with the key ingredients of Koopmanism, it is possible to deconstruct virtually any response operator into a sum of terms, each associated with a specific mode of natural variability of the system. This dramatically improves the interpretability of the resulting response formulas. We show here on three simple yet mathematically meaningful examples how to use the Extended Dynamical Mode Decomposition (EDMD) algorithm on an individual trajectory of the system to compute with high accuracy correlation functions as well as Green functions associated with acting forcings. This demonstrates the great potential of using Koopman analysis for the key problem of evaluating and testing the sensitivity of a complex system.</description>

      <title>A conceptual predator-prey model with super-long transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing on the understanding of the logistic map, we propose a simple predator-prey model where predators and prey adapt to each other, leading to the co-evolution of the system. The special dynamics observed in periodic windows contribute to the coexistence of multiple time scales, adding to the complexity of the system. Typical dynamics in ecosystems, such as the persistence and coexistence of population cycles and chaotic behaviors, the emergence of super-long transients, regime shifts, and the quantifying of resilience, are encapsulated within this single model. The simplicity of our model allows for detailed analysis, reinforcing its potential as a conceptual tool for understanding ecosystems deeply.</description>

      <title>Feedback voltage driven chaos in a three-terminal spin-torque oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report an excitation of chaos and a non-trivial magnetization switching via transient chaos in a three-terminal spin-torque oscillator (STO). The driving force of the chaos is a voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect generated by a feedback signal from the STO since the feedback effect is known to be effective in exciting chaos in a dynamical system. Solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation numerically and applying temporal and statistical analyses to its solution, the existence of the chaos driven by the feedback VCMA effect is identified. Simultaneously, however, transient chaos is also observed, where the magnetization initially shows chaotic behavior but finally switches its direction. This transient dynamics from chaos to magnetization switching was unexpected because the sign of the feedback VCMA effect was chosen so that the switching current increases and, as a result, the situation rather favors the condition for sustaining chaos. It is implied that this switching happens when narrowing a stable region of the magnetic potential energy by the feedback effect and magnetization precession pointing to a saddle point coincidentally occur simultaneously.</description>
