      <title>From Factor Models to Deep Learning: Machine Learning in Reshaping Empirical Asset Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper comprehensively reviews the application of machine learning (ML) and AI in finance, specifically in the context of asset pricing. It starts by summarizing the traditional asset pricing models and examining their limitations in capturing the complexities of financial markets. It explores how 1) ML models, including supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning, provide versatile frameworks to address these complexities, and 2) the incorporation of advanced ML algorithms into traditional financial models enhances return prediction and portfolio optimization. These methods can adapt to changing market dynamics by modeling structural changes and incorporating heterogeneous data sources, such as text and images. In addition, this paper explores challenges in applying ML in asset pricing, addressing the growing demand for explainability in decision-making and mitigating overfitting in complex models. This paper aims to provide insights into novel methodologies showcasing the potential of ML to reshape the future of quantitative finance.</description>

      <title>The entropy corrected geometric Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is widely employed for modeling stochastic processes, yet its solutions are characterized by the log-normal distribution. This comprises predictive capabilities of GBM mainly in terms of forecasting applications. Here, entropy corrections to GBM are proposed to go beyond log-normality restrictions and better account for intricacies of real systems. It is shown that GBM solutions can be effectively refined by arguing that entropy is reduced when deterministic content of considered data increases. Notable improvements over conventional GBM are observed for several cases of non-log-normal distributions, ranging from a dice roll experiment to real world data.</description>
