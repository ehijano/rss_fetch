      <title>AC-LGADs Fermilab Front-End Electronics Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08932v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterized the front-end electronics used to process high-frequency signals from low-gain avalanche diodes (LGADs) at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. LGADs are silicon detectors employed for charged particle tracking, offering exceptional spatial and temporal resolution. The purpose of this characterization was to understand how the signal resolution is influenced by the front-end electronics. To achieve this, we developed a setup capable of generating input signals with varying amplitudes. The output results demonstrated that signal processing by the front-end electronics plays a crucial role in enhancing time resolution. We showed that the time resolution achieved by the FEE board is better than $2\: ps$.</description>

      <title>Dynamic laboratory X-ray phase-contrast microtomography with structure-based prior regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray microtomography is a versatile tool allowing the measurement of the 3D structure of optically thick samples. As a non-destructive technique, it is readily adapted to 4D imaging, where a sample can be monitored over time, and especially in conjunction with the application of external stimuli. To apply this technique with the limited X-ray flux available at a conventional laboratory source, we leverage the contrast enhancement of free-space propagation phase-contrast imaging, achieving an increase in contrast-to-noise ratio of 5.8x. Furthermore, we combine this with iterative reconstruction, using regularisation by a structure-based prior from a high-quality reference scan of the object. This combination of phase-contrast imaging and iterative reconstruction leads to a 29.2x improvement in contrast-to-noise ratio compared to the conventional reconstruction. This enables fully dynamic X-ray microtomography, with a temporal resolution of 9 s at a voxel size of 10.5 $\mu$m. We use this to measure the movement of a waterfront in the fine vessels of a wooden skewer, as a representative example of dynamic system evolving on the scale of tens of seconds.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Design and Measurements of Next-Generation 4H-SiC LGADs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution presents the design, production, and initial testing of newly developed 4H-SiC Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs). The evaluation includes performance metrics such as the internal gain layer's efficiency in enhancing signal generation. Initial laboratory and Transient Current Technique (TCT) measurements provide insight into the device's stability and response to the signal.
  Due to the increase of availability provided by the industry, 4H-SiC is emerging as a strong candidate for the next-generation of semiconductor detectors. Such sensors are promising due to the inherent radiation tolerance of 4H-SiC and its stable operation across a wide temperature range. However, due to the wider-bandgap of 4H-SiC compared to standard silicon, and difficulty to produce high-quality layers thicker than 50 \textmu m, an internal charge multiplication layer needs to be introduced.
  The presented 4H-SiC LGADs, fabricated by onsemi, are optimized for an N-type substrate and epi wafer. The initial TCT and laboratory test results demonstrate fast charge collection and uniform multiplication across multiple samples produced on a single wafer.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Radiation Level and Estimation of Protection Distance of {\gamma} Mobile Flaw Detection Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective To analyze the radiation dose associated with gamma-ray mobile flaw detection, estimate the extent of the supervision and control areas, and assess the associated radiation risks. Methods A combination of theoretical calculations and actual measurements was used to compare and analyze the ambient equivalent dose rates of 192 Ir and 75 Se at their nominal source strengths. Measurements were conducted at distances of 1 m, 2 m, and 5 m from the radiation source. The extents of the control and supervision areas were estimated under three working scenarios: 1 without considering air attenuation, 2 considering air attenuation, and 3 after shielding by the flaw detection workpiece, using source activities of 3.7 * 10^10 Bq and 3.7 * 10^12Bq. Results Actual measurement of radiation dose of 192 Ir and 75 Se were measured under three different nominal activities. Theoretical calculation of radiation dose estimates at various distances were obtained for both nuclides, and the results showed that the theoretical values were basically consistent with the measured values. Conclusion The estimated scope of the supervision and control areas provided in this study can serve as a reference for flaw detection companies. Technicians can use these estimates to calculate appropriate distances for safety zones based on different nuclide activities. This enables flaw detection personnel to reduce the measurement scope on-site and to quickly and accurately define area boundaries.</description>

      <title>Comparison of an OGS/Polystyrene scintillator (BSO-406) with pure OGS (BSO-100), EJ-276, EJ-309, and M600 scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an investigation into the scintillation properties and pulse shape discrimination (PSD) performance of the new BSO-406, which is a blend of 40% organic glass scintillator and 60% polystyrene. We tested a cylindrical sample with dimensions of 2x2 inches. The study includes measurements of neutron-gamma discrimination capability, emission spectra, photoelectron yield, and the analysis of light pulse shapes originating from events related to gamma-rays and fast neutrons. The results were compared to data previously recorded using a pure Organic Glass Scintillator (BSO-100), an EJ-309 liquid scintillator, and EJ-276 and M600 polyurethane-based plastic scintillators.</description>

      <title>Nanoplastic Analysis with Nanoelectromechanical System Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy: NEMS-FTIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a photothermal infrared (IR) spectroscopy technique based on a nanoelectromechanical system, which is coupled to a commercial Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (NEMS--FTIR) as a promising solution for the chemical characterization and quantification of nanoplastics. Polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) nanoparticles with nominal diameters of 100, 54, and 262~nm, respectively, were analyzed by NEMS--FTIR with limits of detection (LoD) of 353~pg for PS, 102~pg for PP, and 355~pg for PVC. The PS mass deposited on the NEMS chips was estimated from the measured absorptance values and the attenuation coefficient of PS. The wide spectral range of the FTIR allowed the identification of individual polymer nanoparticles from a mixture. The potential of NEMS--FTIR for the analysis of real--world samples was evaluated by confirming the presence of polyamide (PA) particles released from commercial tea bags during brewing. Accelerated aging of the tea bags under elevated temperature and UV radiation showed continuous release of PA particles over time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HYpernuclei-Decay at R3B Apparatus (HYDRA) tracker is a novel time projection chamber combined with a plastic scintillator wall for timing and trigger purposes. This detector is a low radiation length tracker dedicated to measuring pions from the weak decay of light hypernuclei produced from ion-ion collisions at few GeV/nucleon in the magnetic field of the large-acceptance dipole magnet GLAD at the Reactions with Relativistic Radioactive Beams (R3B) experiment at GSI-FAIR. In this paper, we describe the design of the detector and provide the results of its first characterizations.</description>

      <title>Refining the sensitivity of new physics searches with ancient minerals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Paleodetection has been proposed as a competitive method for detecting dark matter and other new physics interactions, complementing conventional direct detection experiments. In this work, we utilise TRIM simulations to improve the modelling of track length distributions. Our findings suggest that previous studies have overestimated the number of tracks caused by weakly interacting particles, and that the lowest observable dark matter mass should be higher than previously predicted. These differences are mainly attributed to the fact that (a) the recoil energy-track length relation is not one-to-one, (b) at low recoil energies, a substantial fraction of recoils do not yield any tracks, and (c) at high energies, electronic stopping becomes dominant, resulting in a track length barrier at $\sim200$ nm. In addition to WIMPs, we also modelled tracks from generalised coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) via new light mediators and estimated the projected sensitivity for these interactions.</description>

      <title>Heatpipe-cooled in-vacuum electromagnet for quantum science experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum inertial sensors test general relativity, measure fundamental constants, and probe dark matter and dark energy in the laboratory with outstanding accuracy. Their precision relies heavily on carefully choreographed quantum control of the atomic states with a collection of lasers, microwaves, electric and magnetic fields. Making this technology available outside of the laboratory would unlock many applications, such as geophysics, geodesy and inertial navigation. However, this requires an apparatus of reduced size, weight, power use and increased robustness, modularity and ease-of-use. Here, we describe the design and implementation of an in-vacuum electromagnet able to create the magnetic fields necessary for various quantum control operations, such as magneto-optical trapping or magnetic levitation to assist evaporative cooling. Placing the electromagnet inside the vacuum chamber has significant advantages, such as fast switching times that are not limited by induced current inside the vacuum chamber metal, reduced size, weight and power usage. However, dissipating the heat produced typically requires complex designs that include bulky metal heatsinks or cooling using water or cryogens. Our design implements heatpipes in a compact, low-vibration and robust apparatus, which use a phase transition in the working fluid to achieve thermal conductivity that is more than one hundred times larger than that of typical bulk metal. We show that the setup can conduct more than 50 W of thermal power in a configuration that provides ample optical access and is compatible with the ultra-high vacuum requirements of atomic and molecular experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a streamlined framework for real-time processing and analysis of condition data from the CMS experiment Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC). Leveraging data streaming, it uncovers correlations between RPC performance metrics, like currents and rates, and LHC luminosity or environmental conditions. The Java-based framework automates data handling and predictive modeling, integrating extensive datasets into synchronized, query-optimized tables. By segmenting LHC operations and analyzing larger virtual detector objects, the automation enhances monitoring precision, accelerates visualization, and provides predictive insights, revolutionizing RPC performance evaluation and future behavior modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a high-precision, fast, robust and cost-effective muon detector concept for an FCC-ee experiment. This design combines precision drift tubes with fast plastic scintillator strips to enable both spatial and timing measurements. The drift tubes deliver two-dimensional position measurements perpendicular to the tubes with a resolution around 100~$\mu$m. Meanwhile, the scintillator strips, read out with the wavelength-shifting fibers and silicon photomultipliers, provide fast timing information with a precision of 200~ps or better and measure the third coordinate along the tubes with a resolution of about 1~mm.</description>

      <title>Choose Your Diffusion: Efficient and flexible ways to accelerate the diffusion model in fast high energy physics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffusion model has demonstrated promising results in image generation, recently becoming mainstream and representing a notable advancement for many generative modeling tasks. Prior applications of the diffusion model for both fast event and detector simulation in high energy physics have shown exceptional performance, providing a viable solution to generate sufficient statistics within a constrained computational budget in preparation for the High Luminosity LHC. However, many of these applications suffer from slow generation with large sampling steps and face challenges in finding the optimal balance between sample quality and speed. The study focuses on the latest benchmark developments in efficient ODE/SDE-based samplers, schedulers, and fast convergence training techniques. We test on the public CaloChallenge and JetNet datasets with the designs implemented on the existing architecture, the performance of the generated classes surpass previous models, achieving significant speedup via various evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Evaluating probabilistic and data-driven inference models for fiber-coupled NV-diamond temperature sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the impact of inference model on uncertainties when using continuous wave Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) measurements to infer temperature. Our approach leverages a probabilistic feedforward inference model designed to maximize the likelihood of observed ODMR spectra through automatic differentiation. This model effectively utilizes the temperature dependence of spin Hamiltonian parameters to infer temperature from spectral features in the ODMR data. We achieve prediction uncertainty of $\pm$ 1 K across a temperature range of 243 K to 323 K. To benchmark our probabilistic model, we compare it with a non-parametric peak-finding technique and data-driven methodologies such as Principal Component Regression (PCR) and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We find that when validated against out-of-sample dataset that encompasses the same temperature range as the training dataset, data driven methods can show uncertainties that are as much as 0.67 K lower without incorporating expert-level understanding of the spectroscopic-temperature relationship. However, our results show that the probabilistic model outperforms both PCR and CNN when tasked with extrapolating beyond the temperature range used in training set, indicating robustness and generalizability. In contrast, data-driven methods like PCR and CNN demonstrate up to ten times worse uncertainties when tasked with extrapolating outside their training data range.</description>

      <title>The ionization yield in a methane-filled spherical proportional counter</title>

Abstract: Spherical proportional counters (SPCs) are gaseous particle detectors sensitive to single ionization electrons in their target media, with large detector volumes and low background rates. The $\mbox{NEWS-G}$ collaboration employs this technology to search for low-mass dark matter, having previously performed searches with detectors at the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane (LSM), including a recent campaign with a 135 cm diameter SPC filled with methane. While in situ calibrations of the detector response were carried out at the LSM, measurements of the mean ionization yield and fluctuations of methane gas in SPCs were performed using a 30 cm diameter detector. The results of multiple measurements taken at different operating voltages are presented. A UV laser system was used to measure the mean gas gain of the SPC, along with $\mathrm{^{37}Ar}$ and aluminum-fluorescence calibration sources. These measurements will inform the energy response model of future operating detectors.</description>

      <title>A simulation framework for SiPMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Python module for simulating Silicon Photo-Multipliers, Avalanche Photo-Diodes, and Multi-Pixel Photon Counters. This module allows users to perform noise analyses: Dark Count Rate, crosstalk, and afterpulsing. Furthermore, the simulation framework novelty is the capability of simulating assemblies of SiPM arrays (MPPCa) for large area detectors like Ring Imaging Cherenkov detectors, Cherenkov Telescopes, Positron Emission Tomography, and any detector using SiPM arrays. Users can simulate ring- or shower-like-shaped signals based on the expected number of photons generated by the source. We validate the performance of the simulation module with data from four different SiPM: Broadcom AFBR-S4N66P024M, Hamamatsu S14160-636050HS, Onsemi MICROFC-60035, and FBK NUV-HD3.</description>

      <title>Development of a high-rate capable DLC-RPC based on a current evacuation pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05128v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Resistive Plate Chamber using Diamond-Like Carbon electrodes (DLC-RPC) has been developed as a background tagging detector in the MEG$~$II experiment. The DLC-RPC is planned to be installed in a high-intensity and low-momentum muon beam. This detector is required to have a detection efficiency above 90 % with four active gaps in the muon beam due to the limitation of the material budget. In such an environment, the high current flowing through the resistive electrodes causes a voltage drop, which reduces the performance of the DLC-RPC. This voltage drop can be suppressed by implementing a current evacuation pattern, though discharges are more likely to occur near the pattern. Therefore the pattern must be covered by a protection cover made of an insulator. In this study, electrode samples with a current evacuation pattern and different widths of protection cover (0.2 mm and 0.8 mm) have been produced, and their performance and stability were measured. The detection efficiency of a single-gap chamber for $\beta$-rays from a $^{90}$Sr source was measured to be up to approximately 60 % in both electrode samples. The target efficiency can be achieved even with a drop of 100 $-$ 150 V. On the other hand, after more than a dozen hours of operation, discharges suddenly occurred and the detector was prevented from further operation. These discharges created current paths on the spacing pillars. This serious problem must be investigated and solved in the future.</description>

      <title>Ultra-cold neutron simulation framework for the free neutron lifetime experiment $\tau$SPECT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise determination of the free neutron lifetime is of great significance in modern precision physics. This key observable is linked to the mixing of up and down quarks via the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $V_{ud}$, and the abundance of primordial elements after the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis. However, the two leading measurement techniques for the neutron lifetime currently yield incompatible results, a discrepancy referred to as the neutron lifetime puzzle. To address the systematic uncertainties arising from neutron interactions with material walls, the $\tau$SPECT experiment employs a fully magnetic trap for ultra-cold neutrons (UCNs).
  UCNs are extremely low-energy neutrons with typical velocities below $8\,\textrm{m/s}$, which can be manipulated using magnetic fields, gravity, and suitable material guides, whose surface can reflect them at any angle of incidence. To precisely study and characterize UCN behavior during production, guidance, storage, and detection in $\tau$SPECT, we have developed a dedicated simulation framework. This framework is built upon the externally developed UCN Monte Carlo software package PENTrack and is enhanced with two companion tools: one for flexible and parametrizable upstream configuration of PENTrack such that the simulation's input settings can be adjusted to reproduce the experimental observations. The second package is used for analyzing, visualizing, and animating simulation data.
  The simulation results align well with experimental data obtained with $\tau$SPECT at the Paul Scherrer Institute and serve as a powerful resource for identifying systematic uncertainties and guiding future improvements to the current experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Response to Electrons and Pions in the Scintillating Fiber and Lead Calorimeter for the Future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of the Baby Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (Baby BCAL) - a small-scale lead-scintillating-fiber (Pb/ScFi) prototype of the GlueX Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BCAL) - was tested in a dedicated beam campaign at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF). This study provides a benchmark for the Pb/ScFi component of the future Barrel Imaging Calorimeter (BIC) in the ePIC detector at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The detector response to electrons and pions was studied at beam energies between 4 and 10 GeV, extending previous GlueX tests [NIM A 596 (2008) 327-337 and arXiv:1801.03088] to a higher energy regime.
  The calibrated detector exhibits good linearity within uncertainties, and its electron energy resolution meets EIC requirements. The data further constrain the constant term in the energy resolution to below 1.9%, improving upon previous constraints at lower energies. Simulations reproduce key features of the electron and pion data within the limitations of the collected dataset and the FTBF test environment. Electron-pion separation in the test beam setup was analyzed using multiple methods, incorporating varying degrees of beam-related effects. The inclusion of longitudinal shower profile information enhanced the separation performance, underscoring its relevance for the full-scale BIC in ePIC. These results provide essential benchmarks for the Pb/ScFi section of the future BIC, validating detector simulations and guiding optimization strategies for electron-pion discrimination.</description>

      <title>APEX: Optimized vertical drift PDS for DUNE FD3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment currently under construction in the US will be a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment dedicated to determining the neutrino mass ordering and to measure the CP violation phase in the lepton sector. DUNE will also perform studies of non-beam physics such as atmospheric neutrinos, bursts from supernovae and nucleon decays in which photon detection systems will play a major role in triggering and also provide calorimetric measurements. For the second phase of DUNE, two additional detector modules will be added in the far detector complex in the Sanford Underground Research Facility. We present the Aluminum Profiles with Embedded X-ARAPUCA (APEX) concept as an advanced proposal for the photon detector system of the third DUNE far detector module. This system aims to have an optical coverage of approximately 60% made viable by the technology advancement achieved by the DUNE collaboration on the use of non-conductive optical fibers for power and signal readout of the photon detector units. Such large coverage will provide enhanced light collection capabilities at MeV-scale energy deposit level per interaction and optimal energy reconstruction resolution up to the GeV scale. The attained electrical isolation of the detector units with low noise levels allows for a complete instrumentation of the field cage walls with satisfactory segmentation as the readout scheme envisages a much larger than typical number of channels to be adopted. We discuss the main features of the system, first estimates on its expected performances, potential for physics measurements and prototyping plans for R\&amp;D.</description>

      <title>European Strategy for Particle Physics Update -- PIONEER: a next generation rare pion decay experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PIONEER is a rapidly developing effort aimed to perform a pristine test of lepton flavour universality (LFU) and of the unitarity of the first row of the CKM matrix by significantly improving the measurements of rare decays of the charged pion. In Phase I, PIONEER aims to measure the charged-pion branching ratio to electrons vs.\ muons $R_{e/\mu}$ to 1 part in $10^4$, improving the current experimental result $R_{e/\mu}\,\text{(exp)} =1.2327(23)\times10^{-4}$ by a factor of 15. This precision on $R_{e/\mu}$ will match the theoretical accuracy of the SM prediction allowing for a test of LFU at an unprecedented level, probing non-SM explanations of LFU violation through sensitivity to quantum effects of new particles up to the PeV mass scale. Phase II and III will aim to improve the experimental precision of the branching ratio of pion beta decay, $\pi^+\to \pi^0 e^+ \nu (\gamma)$, currently at $1.036(6)\times10^{-8}$, by a factor of three and six, respectively. The improved measurements will be used to extract $V_{ud}$ in a theoretically pristine manner. The ultimate precision of $V_{ud}$ is expected to reach the 0.05\,\% level, allowing for a stringent test of CKM unitarity. The PIONEER experiment will also improve the experimental limits by an order of magnitude or more on a host of exotic decays that probe the effects of heavy neutrinos and dark sector physics. This input to the 2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics Strategy describes the physics motivation and the conceptual design of the PIONEER experiment, and is prepared based on the PIONEER proposal submitted to and approved with high priority by the PSI program advisory committee (PAC). Using intense pion beams, and state-of-the-art instrumentation and computational resources, the PIONEER experiment is aiming to begin data taking by the end of this decade.</description>
