      <title>Recognition of Seifert fibered spaces with boundary is in NP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04612v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the decision problem of recognising whether a triangulated 3-manifold admits a Seifert fibered structure with non-empty boundary is in NP. We also show that the problem of producing Seifert data for a triangulation of such a manifold is in the complexity class FNP. We do this by proving that in any triangulation of a Seifert fibered space with boundary there is both a fundamental horizontal surface of small degree and a complete collection of normal vertical annuli whose total weight is bounded by an exponential in the square of the triangulation size.</description>

      <title>Nerve Models of Subdivision Bifiltrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the size of Sheehy's subdivision bifiltrations, up to homotopy. We focus in particular on the subdivision-Rips bifiltration $\mathcal{SR}(X)$ of a metric space $X$, the only density-sensitive bifiltration on metric spaces known to satisfy a strong robustness property. Given a simplicial filtration $\mathcal{F}$ with a total of $m$ maximal simplices across all indices, we introduce a nerve-based simplicial model for its subdivision bifiltration $\mathcal{SF}$ whose $k$-skeleton has size $O(m^{k+1})$. We also show that the $0$-skeleton of any simplicial model of $\mathcal{SF}$ has size at least $m$. We give several applications: For an arbitrary metric space $X$, we introduce a $\sqrt{2}$-approximation to $\mathcal{SR}(X)$, denoted $\mathcal{J}(X)$, whose $k$-skeleton has size $O(|X|^{k+2})$. This improves on the previous best approximation bound of $\sqrt{3}$, achieved by the degree-Rips bifiltration, which implies that $\mathcal{J}(X)$ is more robust than degree-Rips. Moreover, we show that the approximation factor of $\sqrt{2}$ is tight; in particular, there exists no exact model of $\mathcal{SR}(X)$ with poly-size skeleta. On the other hand, we show that for $X$ in a fixed-dimensional Euclidean space with the $\ell_p$-metric, there exists an exact model of $\mathcal{SR}(X)$ with poly-size skeleta for $p\in \{1, \infty\}$, as well as a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to $\mathcal{SR}(X)$ with poly-size skeleta for any $p \in (1, \infty)$ and fixed ${\epsilon &gt; 0}$.</description>

      <title>Oriented Spanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a point set $P$ in the Euclidean plane and a parameter $t$, we define an \emph{oriented $t$-spanner} $G$ as an oriented subgraph of the complete bi-directed graph such that for every pair of points, the shortest closed walk in $G$ through those points is at most a factor $t$ longer than the shortest cycle in the complete graph on $P$. We investigate the problem of computing sparse graphs with small oriented dilation. As we can show that minimising oriented dilation for a given number of edges is NP-hard in the plane, we first consider one-dimensional point sets. While obtaining a $1$-spanner in this setting is straightforward, already for five points such a spanner has no plane embedding with the leftmost and rightmost point on the outer face. This leads to restricting to oriented graphs with a one-page book embedding on the one-dimensional point set. For this case we present a dynamic program to compute the graph of minimum oriented dilation that runs in $O(n^7)$ time for $n$ points, and a greedy algorithm that computes a $5$-spanner in $O(n\log n)$ time. Expanding these results finally gives us a result for two-dimensional point sets: we prove that for convex point sets the greedy triangulation results in a plane oriented $t$-spanner with $t=19 \cdot t_g$, where $t_g$ is a upper bound on the dilation of the greedy triangulation.</description>
