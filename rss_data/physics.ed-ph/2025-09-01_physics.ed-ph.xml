      <title>The nox-minima dome: a tangible alternative to flat star maps for astronomy education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces nox-minima, a low-cost, three-dimensional paper dome that provides an alternative representation of the sky for astronomy education. Generated from precise astronomical data, the dome provides accurate local sky views for any date and location. Its assembly is simple, and the design is freely available at nox-minima.net/en . Initial workshops with students and teachers confirm its effectiveness as a hands-on tool to explore the celestial sphere and cultural perspectives on the sky.</description>

      <title>Project-Based Learning in Introductory Quantum Computing Courses: A Case Study on Quantum Algorithms for Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing introduces abstract concepts and non-intuitive behaviors that can be challenging for students to grasp through traditional lecture-based instruction alone. This paper demonstrates how Project-Based Learning (PBL) can be leveraged to bridge that gap. This can be done by engaging students in a real-world, interdisciplinary task that combines quantum computing with their field of interest. As part of a similar assignment, we investigated the application of the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction and benchmarked its performance against the classical Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART). Through implementing and analyzing both methods on a small-scale problem, we gained practical experience with quantum algorithms, critically evaluated their limitations, and developed technical writing and research skills. The experience demonstrated that Project-Based Learning not only enhances conceptual understanding but also encourages students to engage deeply with emerging technologies through research, implementation, and reflection. We recommend the integration of similar PBL modules in introductory quantum computing courses. The assignment also works better if students are required to write and submit a conference-style paper, supported by mentorship from faculty across the different fields. In such course interdisciplinary, real-world problems can transform abstract theory into meaningful learning experiences and better prepare students for future advancements in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>From Canonical to Complex: Benchmarking LLM Capabilities in Undergraduate Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered as tutoring aids in science education. Yet their readiness for unsupervised use in undergraduate instruction remains uncertain, as reliable teaching requires more than fluent recall: it demands consistent, principle-grounded reasoning. Thermodynamics, with its compact laws and subtle distinctions between state and path functions, reversibility, and entropy, provides an ideal testbed for evaluating such capabilities. Here we present UTQA, a 50-item undergraduate thermodynamics question answering benchmark, covering ideal-gas processes, reversibility, and diagram interpretation. No leading 2025-era model exceeded our 95\% competence threshold: the best LLMs achieved 82\% accuracy, with text-only items performing better than image reasoning tasks, which often fell to chance levels. Prompt phrasing and syntactic complexity showed modest to little correlation with performance. The gap concentrates in finite-rate/irreversible scenarios and in binding visual features to thermodynamic meaning, indicating that current LLMs are not yet suitable for unsupervised tutoring in this domain.</description>
