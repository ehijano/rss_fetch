      <title>When Less is More: Evolutionary Dynamics of Deception in a Sender-Receiver Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spread of disinformation poses a significant threat to societal well-being. We analyze this phenomenon using an evolutionary game theory model of the sender-receiver game, where senders aim to mislead receivers and receivers aim to discern the truth. Using a combination of replicator equations, finite-size scaling analysis, and extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the long-term evolutionary dynamics of this game. Our central finding is a counterintuitive threshold phenomenon: the role (sender or receiver) with the larger difference in payoffs between successful and unsuccessful interactions is surprisingly more likely to lose in the long run. We show that this effect is robust across different parameter values and arises from the interplay between the relative speeds of evolution of the two roles and the ability of the slower evolving role to exploit the fixed strategy of the faster evolving role. Moreover, for finite populations we find that the initially less frequent strategy of the slower role is more likely to fixate in the population. The initially rarer strategy in the less-rewarded role is, paradoxically, more likely to prevail.</description>

      <title>Integrating Agent-Based and Compartmental Models for Infectious Disease Modeling: A Novel Hybrid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the spatial integration of agent-based models (ABMs) and compartmental models for infectious disease modeling, presenting a novel hybrid approach and examining its implications. ABMs offer detailed insights by simulating interactions and decisions among individuals but are computationally expensive for large populations. Compartmental models capture population-level dynamics more efficiently but lack granular detail. We developed a hybrid model that aims to balance the granularity of ABMs with the computational efficiency of compartmental models, offering a more nuanced understanding of disease spread in diverse scenarios, including large populations. This model spatially couples discrete and continuous populations by integrating an ordinary differential equation model with a spatially explicit ABM. Our key objectives were to systematically assess the consistency of disease dynamics and the computational efficiency across various configurations. For this, we evaluated two experimental scenarios and varied the influence of each sub-model via spatial distribution. In the first, the ABM component modeled a homogeneous population; in the second, it simulated a heterogeneous population with landscape-driven movement. Results show that the hybrid model can significantly reduce computational costs but is sensitive to between-model differences, highlighting the importance of model equivalence in hybrid approaches.
