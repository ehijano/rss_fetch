      <title>Double-eigenvalue bifurcation and multistability in serpentine strips with tunable buckling behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serpentine structures, composed of straight and circular strips, have garnered significant attention as potential designs for flexible electronics due to their remarkable stretchability. When subjected to stretching, these serpentine strips buckle out of plane, and previous studies have identified two distinct buckling modes whose order of appearance may interchange in serpentine structures with a single cell. In this study, we employ anisotropic rod theory to model serpentine strips as a multi-segment boundary value problem (BVP), with continuity conditions enforced at the interface between the straight and curved strips. We solve the BVP using methods of continuation, and our results reveal that: 1) the exchange of the two buckling modes in a single-cell serpentine strip is induced by a double-eigenvalue and associated secondary bifurcations, which also alter the stability of the two buckling modes; 2) a variety of stable states with reversible symmetry can be manually obtained in tabletop models and are found to be disconnected from the planar branch in numerical continuation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that modulating the strip thickness across different cells leads to the initiation of buckling in the thinnest section, thereby allowing for the tuning of buckling modes in serpentine strips. In structures with two cells, the sequence of the two buckling modes can also be controlled by designing serpentine strips with nonuniform height. This work could enhance the mechanical design of serpentine-interconnect-based flexible structures and could have applications in multistable actuators and mechanical memory devices.</description>

      <title>Non-nematicity of the filamentary phase in systems of hard minor circular arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work further investigates an aspect of the phase behavior of hard circular arcs, whose phase diagram has been recently calculated by Monte Carlo numerical simulations: the non-nematicity of the filamentary phase that hard minor circular arcs form. Both second-virial density-functional theory and further Monte Carlo numerical simulations find that the positional one-particle density function is undulate in the direction transverse to the axes of the filaments while further Monte Carlo numerical simulations find that the mobility of the hard minor circular arcs across the filaments occurs via a mechanism reminiscent of the mechanism of diffusion in a smectic phase: the filamentary phase is not a {``modulated'' [``splay(-bend)'']} nematic phase.</description>

      <title>Kinetoplast DNA: a polymer physicist's Olympic dream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All life forms are miraculous, but some are more inexplicable than others. Trypanosomes are by far one of the most puzzling organisms on Earth: their mitochondrial genome, also called kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) forms an Olympic-ring-like network of interlinked DNA circles, challenging conventional paradigms in both biology and physics. In this review, I will discuss kDNA from the astonished perspective of a polymer physicist and tell a story of how a single sub-celluar structure from a blood-dwelling parasite is inspiring generations of polymer chemists and physicists to create new catenated materials.</description>

      <title>Effective and efficient modeling of the hydrodynamics for bacterial flagella</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06093v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic interactions between bacterial flagella and surrounding boundaries are important for bacterial motility and gait in complex environment. By modeling each flagellar filament that is both thin and long as a string of spheres, we show that such hydrodynamic interactions can be accurately described through a resistance tensor, which can be efficiently evaluated numerically. For the case of close interaction between one bacterium and one passive colloidal sphere, we see notable difference between results from our model and those from the resistive force theory, showing that the error arises from negligence of the width of flagellar filaments in resistive force theory can be strong.</description>

      <title>Inflation rules for a chiral pentagonal quasiperiodic tiling of stars and hexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagon-boat-star (HBS) pentagonal tilings often appear in the description of decagonal quasicrystals and their periodic approximants. Being related to the Penrose tiling, they differ from the latter by a significantly higher packing density of vertices, which, in turn, depends on the relative frequency of appearance of the H, B and S tiles. Since boats (also known as "ivy leaves") have the lowest packing density, reducing their number in the tiling leads to an increase in its packing density. The paper proposes an inflation rule for a chiral tiling, which in principle contains no boats and therefore has the highest possible density among HBS tilings. The relationship between the tiling and the real structures of crystal approximants of decagonal quasicrystals is discussed.</description>

      <title>Motility-induced crystallization and rotating crystallites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active soft matter frequently shows motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), where self-propelled particles condensate into clusters with an inner liquid-like structure. Such activity may also result in motility-induced crystallization (MIC) into clusters with an inner crystalline structure. We present a higher-order active Phase-Field-Crystal (PFC) model and employ it to study the interplay of passive (i.e., thermodynamic) and active (i.e., motility-induced) condensation and crystallization. Morphological phase diagrams indicate the various occurring phase coexistences and transitions, e.g., the destruction of passive clusters by density-independent activity and the creation of such clusters by a density-dependent activity. Finally, rotating crystallites are analyzed in some detail.</description>

      <title>Enhanced stability and chaotic condensates in multi-species non-reciprocal mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06242v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random non-reciprocal interactions between a large number of conserved densities are shown to enhance the stability of the system towards pattern formation. The enhanced stability is an exact result when the number of species approaches infinity and is confirmed numerically by simulations of the multi-species non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model. Furthermore, the diversity in dynamical patterns increases with increasing number of components and novel steady states such as pulsating or spatiotemporally chaotic condensates are observed. Our results may help to unravel the mechanisms by which living systems self-organise via metabolism.</description>

      <title>Spreading of graphene oxide suspensions droplets on smooth surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the spreading of droplets on solid surfaces is crucial in many applications such as inkjet printing, printed electronics and spray coating where the fluid is a suspension and in general non-Newtonian. However, many models that predict the maximum spreading diameter usually only apply to Newtonian fluids. Here we study experimentally and theoretically the maximum spreading diameter of graphene oxide suspension droplets impacting on a smooth surface for a wide range of concentrations and impact velocities of up to 6 g/l and 3 m/s, respectively. As the particle concentration increases the rheological behaviour changes from a viscous fluid to a shear-thinning yield stress fluid and the maximum spreading diameter decreases. The rheology for all concentrations is well described by a Herschel-Bulkley model that allows us to determine the characteristic viscosity during spreading. We use this viscosity to develop an energy balance model that takes into account the viscous dissipation and change in surface energies to find the maximum spread diameter for a given impact velocity. The model contains one non-dimensional parameter that encodes both the dynamic contact angle during spreading and the droplet shape at maximum spread. Our model is in good agreement with our data at all concentrations and agrees well with literature data on Newtonian fluids. Furthermore, the model gives the correct limits in the viscous and capillary regime and can be solved analytically for Newtonian fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a simple and novel class of stretch-limiting constitutive relations for perfectly flexible elastic strings drawing from modern advances in constitutive theory for elastic bodies. We investigate strings governed by constitutive relations where stretch is a bounded, piecewise linear function of tension, extending beyond the traditional Cauchy elasticity framework. Our analysis includes explicit solutions for both catenaries and longitudinal, piecewise constant stretched motions.</description>

      <title>On how to determine surface roughness power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytical contact mechanics theories depend on surface roughness through the surface roughness power spectrum. In the present study, we evaluated the usability of various experimental methods for studying surface roughness. Our findings indicated that height data obtained from optical methods often lack accuracy and should not be utilized for calculating surface roughness power spectra. Conversely, engineering stylus instruments and atomic force microscopy (AFM) typically yield reliable results that are consistent across the overlapping roughness length scale region. For surfaces with isotropic roughness, the two-dimensional (2D) power spectrum can be derived from the one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum using several approaches, which we explored in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate perovskite oxides from different aspects, namely their pseudoharmonic dynamical properties, their dynamical properties when strong anharmonicity exists and the intriguing functionalities arising from domain walls. Taking these viewpoints together yields a rather complex picture of this material class which was not anticipated in previous approaches. It opens pathways to novel applications and reveals the rich ground states beyond the fictitious belief in simplicity of perovskites and such structures.</description>

      <title>Nucleation and phase transition of decagonal quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the nucleation of quasicrystals from liquid or periodic crystals by developing an efficient order-order phase transition algorithm, namely the nullspace-preserving saddle search method. Specifically, we focus on nucleation and phase transitions of the decagonal quasicrystal (DQC) based on the Lifshitz-Petrich model. We present the nucleation path of DQC from the liquid and demonstrate one- and two-stage transition paths between DQC and periodic crystals. We provide a perspective of the group-subgroup phase transition and nucleation rates to understand the nucleation and phase transition mechanisms involving DQC. These results reveal the one-step and stepwise modes of symmetry breaking or recovery in the phase transition from DQC, where the stepwise modes are more probable.</description>

      <title>Dynamic hysteresis of an oscillatory contact line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During oscillatory wetting, a phase retardation emerges between contact angle variation and contact line velocity, presenting as a hysteresis loop in their correlation -- an effect we term dynamic hysteresis. This phenomenon is found to be tunable by modifying the surface with different molecular layers. A comparative analysis of dynamic hysteresis, static hysteresis, and contact line friction coefficients across diverse substrates reveals that dynamic hysteresis is not a result of dissipative effects but is instead proportionally linked to the flexibility of the grafted layer on the surface. In the quest for appropriate conditions to model oscillatory contact line motion, we identify the generalized Hocking's linear law and modified Generalized Navier Boundary Condition (GNBC) as alternative options for predicting realistic dynamic hysteresis.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the (longitudinal) thermodynamic and structural characteristics of single-file confined square-well and square-shoulder disks by employing a mapping technique that transforms the original system into a one-dimensional polydisperse mixture of nonadditive rods. Leveraging standard statistical-mechanical techniques, exact results are derived for key properties, including the equation of state, internal energy, radial distribution function, and structure factor. The asymptotic behavior of the radial distribution function is explored, revealing structural changes in the spatial correlations. Additionally, exact analytical expressions for the second virial coefficient are presented. The theoretical results for the thermodynamic and structural properties are validated by our Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Motility driven glassy dynamics in confluent epithelial monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As wounds heal, embryos develop, cancer spreads, or asthma progresses, the cellular monolayer undergoes glass transition between solid-like jammed and fluid-like flowing states. During some of these processes, the cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT): they acquire in-plane polarity and become motile. Thus, how motility drives the glassy dynamics in epithelial systems is critical for the EMT process. However, no analytical framework that is indispensable for deeper insights exists. Here, we develop such a theory inspired by a well-known glass theory. One crucial result of this work is that the confluency affects the effective persistence time-scale of active force, described by its rotational diffusivity, $D_r^{\text{eff}}$. $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ differs from the bare rotational diffusivity, $D_r$, of the motile force due to cell shape dynamics, which acts to rectify the force dynamics: $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ is equal to $D_r$ when $D_r$ is small and saturates when $D_r$ is large. We test the theoretical prediction of $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ and how it affects the relaxation dynamics in our simulations of active Vertex model. This novel effect of $D_r^{\text{eff}}$ is crucial to understanding the new and previously published simulation data of active glassy dynamics in epithelial monolayers.</description>

Abstract: This study examines the transverse and longitudinal properties of hard disks confined in narrow channels. Employing an exact mapping of the system onto a one-dimensional polydisperse, nonadditive mixture of hard rods with equal chemical potentials, we compute various thermodynamic properties, including the transverse and longitudinal equations of state, along with their behaviors at both low and high densities. Structural properties are analyzed using the two-body correlation function and the radial distribution function, tailored for the highly anisotropic geometry of this system. The results are corroborated by computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Cage Evolution in Quasi-two-dimensional Colloidal Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally explore the morphological evolution of cages in quasi-two-dimensional suspensions of colloidal fluids, uncovering a complex dynamic restructuring in the fluid. Although cages display isotropic evolution in the laboratory frame, we observe a striking anisotropy when analyzed in the displacement frame of the caged particles. Moreover, our findings reveal that particles in specific but distinct regions of the cage predominantly contribute to either its persistence or relaxation. Thus, our study provides a coarse-grained microscopic picture of the structural relaxation of these fluids through cage evolution, which has broader implications for the flow and phase behavior of complex fluids in confined geometry.</description>

Abstract: Many biological fluids are composed of suspended polymers immersed in a viscous fluid. A prime example is mucus, where the polymers are also known to form a network. While the presence of this microstructure is linked with an overall non-Newtonian response of the fluid, swimming cells and microorganisms similar in size to the network pores and polymer filaments instead experience the heterogeneous nature of the environment, interacting directly with the polymers as obstacles as they swim. To characterise and understand locomotion in these heterogeneous environments, we simulate the motion of an undulatory swimmer through 3D suspensions and networks of elastic filaments, exploring the effects of filament and link compliance and filament concentration up to 20\% volume fraction. For compliant environments, the swimming speed increases with filament concentration to values about 10\% higher than in a viscous fluid. In stiffer environments, a non-monotonic dependence is observed, with an initial increase in speed to values 5\% greater than in a viscous fluid, followed by a dramatic reduction to speeds just a fraction of its value in a viscous fluid. Velocity fluctuations are also more pronounced in stiffer environments. We demonstrate that speed enhancements are linked to hydrodynamic interactions with the microstructure, while reductions are due to the filaments restricting the amplitude of the swimmer's propulsive wave. Unlike previous studies where interactions with obstacles allowed for significant enhancements in swimming speeds, the modest enhancements seen here are more comparable to those given by models where the environment is treated as a continuous viscoelastic fluid.</description>
