      <title>A Geometric Approach To Asset Allocation With Investor Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a geometric approach to incorporating investor views in portfolio construction is presented. In particular, the proposed approach utilizes the notion of generalized Wasserstein barycenter (GWB) to combine the statistical information about asset returns with investor views to obtain an updated estimate of the asset drifts and covariance, which are then fed into a mean-variance optimizer as inputs. Quantitative comparisons of the proposed geometric approach with the conventional Black-Litterman model (and a closely related variant) are presented. The proposed geometric approach provides investors with more flexibility in specifying their confidence in their views than conventional Black-Litterman model-based approaches. The geometric approach also rewards the investors more for making correct decisions than conventional BL based approaches. We provide empirical and theoretical justifications for our claim.</description>

      <title>Modelling Non-monotone Risk Aversion and Convex Compensation in Incomplete Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In hedge funds, convex compensation schemes are popular to stimulate a high-profit performance for portfolio managers. In economics, non-monotone risk aversion is proposed to argue that individuals may not be risk-averse when the wealth level is low. Combining these two ingredients, we study the optimal control strategy of the manager in incomplete markets. Generally, we propose a wide class of utility functions, the Piecewise Symmetric Asymptotic Hyperbolic Absolute Risk Aversion (PSAHARA) utility, to model the two ingredients, containing both non-concavity and non-differentiability as some abnormalities. Significantly, we derive an explicit optimal control for the family of PSAHARA utilities. This control is expressed into a unified four-term structure, featuring the asymptotic Merton term and the risk adjustment term. Furthermore, we provide a detailed asymptotic analysis and numerical illustration of the optimal portfolio. We obtain the following key insights: (i) A manager with the PSAHARA utility becomes extremely risk-seeking when his/her wealth level tends to zero; (ii) The optimal investment ratio tends to the Merton constant as the wealth level approaches infinity and the negative Merton constant when the wealth falls to negative infinity, implying that such a manager takes a risk-seeking investment as the wealth falls negatively low; (iii) The convex compensation still induces a great risk-taking behavior in the case that the preference is modeled by SAHARA utility. Finally, we conduct a real-data analysis of the U.S. stock market under the above model and conclude that the PSAHARA portfolio is very risk-seeking and leads to a high return and a high volatility (two-peak Sharpe ratio).</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Methods for Pricing Financial Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equation (SDE) models are the foundation for pricing and hedging financial derivatives. The drift and volatility functions in SDE models are typically chosen to be algebraic functions with a small number (less than 5) parameters which can be calibrated to market data. A more flexible approach is to use neural networks to model the drift and volatility functions, which provides more degrees-of-freedom to match observed market data. Training of models requires optimizing over an SDE, which is computationally challenging. For European options, we develop a fast stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for training the neural network-SDE model. Our SGD algorithm uses two independent SDE paths to obtain an unbiased estimate of the direction of steepest descent. For American options, we optimize over the corresponding Kolmogorov partial differential equation (PDE). The neural network appears as coefficient functions in the PDE. Models are trained on large datasets (many contracts), requiring either large simulations (many Monte Carlo samples for the stock price paths) or large numbers of PDEs (a PDE must be solved for each contract). Numerical results are presented for real market data including S&amp;P 500 index options, S&amp;P 100 index options, and single-stock American options. The neural-network-based SDE models are compared against the Black-Scholes model, the Dupire's local volatility model, and the Heston model. Models are evaluated in terms of how accurate they are at pricing out-of-sample financial derivatives, which is a core task in derivative pricing at financial institutions.</description>

      <title>Portfolio Optimization with Robust Covariance and Conditional Value-at-Risk Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measure of portfolio risk is an important input of the Markowitz framework. In this study, we explored various methods to obtain a robust covariance estimators that are less susceptible to financial data noise. We evaluated the performance of large-cap portfolio using various forms of Ledoit Shrinkage Covariance and Robust Gerber Covariance matrix during the period of 2012 to 2022. Out-of-sample performance indicates that robust covariance estimators can outperform the market capitalization-weighted benchmark portfolio, particularly during bull markets. The Gerber covariance with Mean-Absolute-Deviation (MAD) emerged as the top performer. However, robust estimators do not manage tail risk well under extreme market conditions, for example, Covid-19 period. When we aim to control for tail risk, we should add constraint on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to make more conservative decision on risk exposure. Additionally, we incorporated unsupervised clustering algorithm K-means to the optimization algorithm (i.e. Nested Clustering Optimization, NCO). It not only helps mitigate numerical instability of the optimization algorithm, but also contributes to lower drawdown as well.</description>

      <title>A multifractional option pricing formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion has become a standard tool to address long-range dependence in financial time series. However, a constant memory parameter is too restrictive to address different market conditions. Here we model the price fluctuations using a multifractional Brownian motion assuming that the Hurst exponent is a time-deterministic function. Through the multifractional Ito calculus, both the related transition density function and the analytical European Call option pricing formula are obtained. The empirical performance of the multifractional Black-Scholes model is tested by calibration of option market quotes for the SPX index and offers best fit than its counterparts based on standard and fractional Brownian motions.</description>

      <title>Optimal exercise of American options under time-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the barrier that gives the optimal time to exercise an American option written on a time-dependent Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, a diffusion often adopted by practitioners to model commodity prices and interest rates. By framing the optimal exercise of the American option as a problem of optimal stopping and relying on probabilistic arguments, we provide a non-linear Volterra-type integral equation characterizing the exercise boundary, develop a novel comparison argument to derive upper and lower bounds for such a boundary, and prove its Lipschitz continuity in any closed interval that excludes the expiration date and, thus, its differentiability almost everywhere. We implement a Picard iteration algorithm to solve the Volterra integral equation and show illustrative examples that shed light on the boundary's dependence on the process's drift and volatility.</description>

      <title>Optimal stopping of Gauss-Markov bridges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the non-discounted, finite-horizon optimal stopping problem of a Gauss-Markov bridge by using a time-space transformation approach. The associated optimal stopping boundary is proved to be Lipschitz continuous on any closed interval that excludes the horizon, and it is characterized by the unique solution of an integral equation. A Picard iteration algorithm is discussed and implemented to exemplify the numerical computation and geometry of the optimal stopping boundary for some illustrative cases.</description>

      <title>Optimal market-neutral currency trading on the cryptocurrency platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research proposes a novel arbitrage approach with respect to multivariate pair trading called Optimal Trading Technique (OTT). We introduce the method to selectively form a "bucket" of fiat currencies anchored to cryptocurrency for simultaneously monitoring and exploiting trading opportunities. To handle the quantitative conflicts that arise when receiving multiple trading signals, a bi-objective convex optimization process is designed to cater to the investor's preference between profitability and risk tolerance. This process includes tunable parameters such as volatility punishment, action thresholds. During our experiments in the cryptocurrency market from 2020 to 2022 when the market was experiencing a vigorous bull-run immediately followed by a bear-run, the OTT realized an annualized profit of 15.49%. We further carried out the experiments in bull, bear, and full-cycle market conditions separately, and found that OTT is capable of achieving stable profit under various market conditions. Apart from the profitability side of the OTT, the arbitrage operation provides a new perspective of trading, which requires no external shorting and never hold intermediate cryptocurrency during the arbitrage period.</description>
