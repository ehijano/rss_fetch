      <title>A non-circular concept of number inspired by Gottlob Frege's definition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gottlob Frege ingeniously presented a purely logical definition of the concept of number. However, one can claim that his definition is, in some way, circular, as it relies on the concept of one-to-one relation. The concept of number only makes sense when it presents the property of projection/reflection or binding. When we consider a number as an abstraction of objects, whatever they may be, saying that a number that belongs to the concept F is the same as that which belongs to the concept G means there is a projection/reflection, or binding, between the objects in F and the objects in G. We present a definition based on both equivalent approaches. First, we introduce the definition based on the relations of projection and reflection; then, we present the definition based on the relation of binding.</description>
