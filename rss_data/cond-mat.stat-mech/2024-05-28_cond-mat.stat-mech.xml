      <title>Arbitrage equilibria in active matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) phenomenon in active matter has been of great interest for the past decade or so. A central conceptual puzzle is that this behavior, which is generally characterized as a nonequilibrium phenomenon, can yet be explained using simple equilibrium models of thermodynamics. Here, we address this problem using a new theory, statistical teleodynamics, which is a conceptual synthesis of game theory and statistical mechanics. In this framework, active agents compete in their pursuit of maximum effective utility, and this self-organizing dynamics results in an arbitrage equilibrium in which all agents have the same effective utility. We show that MIPS is an example of arbitrage equilibrium and that it is mathematically equivalent to other phase-separation phenomena in entirely different domains, such as sociology and economics. As examples, we present the behavior of Janus particles in a potential trap and the effect of chemotaxis on MIPS.</description>

      <title>Graph Random Walk for Time-of-Flight Charge Mobilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a graph random walk (GRW) method for the study of charge transport properties of complex molecular materials in the time-of-flight regime. The molecules forming the material are represented by the vertices of a directed weighted graph, and the charge carriers are random walkers. The edge weights are rates for elementary jumping processes for a charge carrier to move along the edge and are determined from a combination of the energies of the involved vertices and an interaction strength. Exclusions are built into the random walk to account for the Pauli exclusion principle. In time-of-flight experiments, charge carriers are injected into the material and the time until they reach a collecting electrode is recorded. In this setting, our GRW approach allows direct evaluation of the expected hitting time of the collecting nodes in the graph in terms of a typically sparse, linear system, thereby avoiding numerically cumbersome and potentially fluctuations-prone methods based on explicit time evolution from solutions of a high-dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations (the Master Equation) or from kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). We validate the GRW approach by conducting numerical studies of charge dynamics of single and multiple carriers in diffusive and drift-diffusive regimes using a surrogate lattice model. The surrogate model allows varying types and strengths of energetic disorder from the reference baseline. Comparison with results from the Master Equation confirms the theoretical equivalence of both approaches also in numerical implementations. We further show that KMC results show substantial deviations due to inadequate sampling. All in all, we find that the GRW method provides a powerful alternative to the more commonly used methods without sampling issues and with the benefit of making use of sparse matrix methods.</description>

      <title>A hybrid approach to model reduction of Generalized Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a classical model of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics accounting for non-Markovian effects, which is referred to as the Generalized Langevin Equation in the literature. We derive reduced Markovian descriptions obtained through the neglection of inertial terms and/or heat bath variables. The adopted reduction scheme relies on the framework of the Invariant Manifold method, which allows to retain the slow degrees of freedom from a multiscale dynamical system. Our approach is also rooted on the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem, which helps preserve the proper dissipative structure of the reduced dynamics. We highlight the appropriate time scalings introduced within our procedure, and also prove the commutativity of selected reduction paths.</description>

      <title>Thomas Fermi Screening Length in q-Deformed Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The q-deformed statistical mechanics for fermions has been used to investigate the Thomas-Fermi screening length at finite temperature. Considering linear response, the calculations have been made at weakly nondegenerate regime. The results show that q-deformation has significance effects on screening length at higher temperatures. It is also shown that the q-deformation effects vanish at zero temperature limit. One can find that more correction terms of deformation have more effects on screening length. The bahaviour of screening length is different for different values of q.</description>

      <title>On the Definition of Velocity in Discrete-Time, Stochastic Langevin Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically develop beneficial and practical velocity measures for accurate and efficient statistical simulations of the Langevin equation, with direct applications to computational statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics sampling. Recognizing that the existing velocity measures for the most statistically accurate discrete-time Verlet-type algorithms are inconsistent with the simulated configurational coordinate, we seek to create new velocity companions that both improve existing methods as well as offer practical options for implementation in existing computer codes. The work is based on the set of GJ methods that, of all methods, correctly reproduces the most basic statistical features of a Langevin system; namely correct Boltzmann distribution for harmonic potentials and correct transport in the form of drift and diffusion for linear potentials. Several new accompanying velocities exhibiting correct drift are identified, and we expand on an earlier conclusion that only half-step velocities can exhibit correct, time-step independent Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions. Specific practical and efficient algorithms are given in familiar forms, and these are used to numerically validate the analytically derived expectations.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation in three-state systems: Towards understanding morphology formation in the presence of evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by experimental evidence collected when processing thin films from ternary solutions made of two solutes, typically polymers, and one solvent, we computationally study the morphology formation of domains obtained in three-state systems using both a lattice model and a continuum counterpart. The lattice-based approach relies on the Blume-Capel nearest neighbor model with bulk conservative Kawasaki dynamics, whereas as continuum system we consider a coupled system of evolution equations that is derived as hydrodynamic limit when replacing the nearest neighbor interaction in the lattice case by a suitable Kac potential. We explore how the obtained morphology depends on the solvent content in the mixture. In particular, we study how these scenarios change when the solvent is allowed to evaporate.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Fast Estimation of the Continuum Limit in Path Integral Simulations of Quantum Oscillators and Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convergence of path integral simulations requires a substantial number of beads when quantum effects are significant. Traditional Trotter scaling approaches estimate the continuum limit through extrapolation, however they are restricted to the asymptotic behavior near this limit. We introduce an efficient extrapolation approach for thermodynamic properties of quantum oscillators and crystals from primitive path integral simulations. The method utilizes a fitting function inspired by the analytic solution of the harmonic oscillator (HO), or the Einstein crystal for solids. The formulation is for first derivative properties, such as energy and pressure; however, extension to second derivative properties, such as elastic constants, is straightforward. We apply the method to a one-dimensional HO and anharmonic oscillator (AO), as well as a three-dimensional Lennard-Jones crystal. Configurations are sampled using path integral molecular dynamics simulations in the canonical ensemble, at a low temperature of $T=0.1$ (simulation units). Compared to Trotter extrapolation approaches, the new method demonstrates substantial accuracy in estimating the continuum limit, using only a few simulations of relatively smaller system sizes. This capability significantly reduces computational cost, providing a powerful tool to facilitate computations for more complex and challenging systems, such as molecules and real crystals.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum thermodynamics described as a system-bath model: The dimensionless minimum work principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a thermodynamic theory applicable to both classical and quantum systems. These systems are depicted as thermodynamic system-bath models capable of handling isothermal, isentropic, thermostatic, and entropic processes. Our approach is based on the use of a dimensionless thermodynamic potential expressed as a function of the intensive and extensive thermodynamic variables. Using the principles of dimensionless minimum work and dimensionless maximum entropy derived from quasi-static changes of external perturbations and temperature, we obtain the Massieu-Planck potentials as entropic potentials and the Helmholtz-Gibbs potentials as free energy. These potentials can be interconverted through time-dependent Legendre transformations. Our results are verified numerically for an anharmonic Brownian system described in phase space using the low-temperature quantum Fokker-Planck equations in the quantum case and the Kramers equation in the classical case, both developed for the thermodynamic system-bath model. Thus, we clarify the conditions for thermodynamics to be valid even for small systems described by Hamiltonians and establish a basis for extending thermodynamics to non-equilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Phase transition in binary compressed sensing based on $L_{1}$-norm minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressed sensing is a signal processing scheme that reconstructs high-dimensional sparse signals from a limited number of observations. In recent years, various problems involving signals with a finite number of discrete values have been attracting attention in the field of compressed sensing. In particular, binary compressed sensing, which restricts signal elements to binary values $\{0, 1\}$, is the most fundamental and straightforward analysis subject in such problem settings. We evaluate the typical performance of noiseless binary compressed sensing based on $L_{1}$-norm minimization using the replica method, a statistical mechanical approach. We analyze a general setting where the elements of the observation matrix follow a Gaussian distribution, including a non-zero mean. We demonstrate that the biased observation matrix indicates more reconstruction success conditions in binary compressed sensing. Our results are consistent with the outcomes of several prior studies.</description>

      <title>Generalized hydrodynamics and approach to Generalized Gibbs equilibrium for a classical harmonic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a classical harmonic chain with nearest-neighbor interactions starting from domain wall initial conditions. The initial state is taken to be either a product of two Gibbs Ensembles (GEs) with unequal temperatures on the two halves of the chain or a product of two Generalized Gibbs Ensembles (GGEs) with different parameters in the two halves. For this system, we construct the Wigner function and demonstrate that its evolution defines the Generalized Hydrodynamics (GHD) describing the evolution of the conserved quantities. We solve the GHD for both finite and infinite chains and compute the evolution of conserved densities and currents. For a finite chain with fixed boundaries, we show that these quantities relax as $\sim 1/\sqrt{t}$ to their respective steady-state values given by the final expected GE or GGE state, depending on the initial conditions. Exact expressions for the Lagrange multipliers of the final expected GGE state are obtained in terms of the steady state densities. In the case of an infinite chain, we find that the conserved densities and currents at any finite time exhibit ballistic scaling while, at infinite time, any finite segment of the system can be described by a current-carrying non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). We compute the scaling functions analytically and show that the relaxation to the NESS occurs as $\sim 1/t$ for the densities and as $\sim 1/t^2$ for the currents. We compare the analytic results from hydrodynamics with those from exact microscopic numerics and find excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Second Law of Thermodynamics without Einstein Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials that are constantly driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium, such as active and living systems, typically violate the Einstein relation. This may arise from active contributions to particle fluctuations which are unrelated to the dissipative resistance of the surrounding medium. We show that in these cases the widely used relation between informatic entropy production and heat dissipation does not hold. Consequently, fluctuation relations for the mechanical work, such as the Jarzynski and Crooks theorems, are invalid. We relate the breaking of the correspondence between entropy production and heat dissipation to the breaking of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We propose a temperature-like variable which restores this correspondence and gives rise to a generalized second law of thermodynamics, whereby the dissipated heat is necessarily nonnegative and vanishes at equilibrium. The Clausius inequality, Carnot maximum efficiency theorem, and relation between the maximum extractable work and the change of free energy are recovered as well.</description>

      <title>Antifragility of stochastic transport on networks with damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system is called antifragile when damage acts as a constructive element improving the performance of a global function. In this letter, we analyze the emergence of antifragility in the movement of random walkers on networks with modular structures or communities. The random walker hops considering the capacity of transport of each link, whereas the links are susceptible to random damage that accumulates over time. We show that in networks with communities and high modularity, the localization of damage in specific groups of nodes leads to a global antifragile response of the system improving the capacity of stochastic transport to more easily reach the nodes of a network. Our findings give evidence of the mechanisms behind antifragile response in complex systems and pave the way for their quantitative exploration in different fields.</description>

      <title>Emergent time crystal from a fractional Langevin equation with white and colored noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fractional Langevin equation with fractional $\alpha$-order and linear friction terms of a system coupled to white and colored thermal baths using both analytical and numerical methods. We find analytical expressions for the position and the mean squared displacement (MSD) of the system using the Prabhakar-Mittag-Leffler function. The MSD exhibits long-term sub-diffusive regimes $t^{\alpha}$ driven by colored noise and $t^{2\alpha-1}$ driven by white noise. When the linear friction is neglected, periodic ordered phases emerge for small fractional orders $\alpha \lesssim 0.1$. In particular, the zero-linear friction system driven only by colored noise manifests the properties of a time crystal, with a ground state satisfying the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and a periodicity proportional to $2\pi$. On the other hand, the zero-linear friction system driven only by white noise displays an out-of-equilibrium time glass phase with periodicity proportional to $\pi$. A mixed phase with contributions from both ground and out-of-equilibrium states is encountered when the system couples to both baths. In that case, the periodicity deviates from $2\pi$ due to damping effects. We test all the analytical results numerically by implementing a discrete recursive expression, where the random forces of the system are modeled as the derivative of the fractional Brownian motion. A microscopic description for the system is also provided by an extension of the Caldeira-Leggett model.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Arrow of Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific discussions of the arrow of time often get quite confusing due to highly complex systems they deal with. Popular literature then often coveys messages that tend to get lost in translation. The purpose of this note is to demystify the arrow of time by stripping off the unnecessary complexities and thereby simplifying the discussion. We do this by providing examples that are exactly solvable and make it easy to see the root cause of the apparent "time-irreversibility". We also discuss "time-reversal" solutions, where the initial state evolves such that it reaches the state which is the same as the initial state moving backward in time. These solutions are simple enough to be comprehensible to a highschooler. We discuss the arrow of time both in the classical and quantum settings, including in the cosmological context.</description>

      <title>Integrable models on Rydberg atom chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of integrable models for spin chains with constrained Hilbert spaces; we focus on spin-1/2 chains with the Rydberg constraint. We extend earlier results for medium-range spin chains to the constrained Hilbert space, and formulate an integrability condition. This enables us to construct new integrable models with fixed interaction ranges. We classify all time- and space-reflection symmetric integrable Rydberg-constrained Hamiltonians of range 3 and 4. At range 3, we find a single family of integrable Hamiltonians: the so-called RSOS quantum chains, which are related to the well-known RSOS models of Andrews, Baxter, and Forrester. At range 4 we find two families of models, the first of which is the constrained XXZ model. We also find a new family of models depending on a single coupling $z$. We provide evidence of two critical points related to the golden ratio $\phi$, at $z=\phi^{-1/2}$ and $z=\phi^{3/2}$. We also perform a partial classification of integrable Hamiltonians for range 5.</description>

      <title>Anomaly inflow for CSS and fractonic lattice models and dualities via cluster state measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes are a class of quantum error correction codes that contains the toric code and fracton models. A procedure called foliation defines a cluster state for a given CSS code. We use the CSS chain complex and its tensor product with other chain complexes to describe the topological structure in the foliated cluster state, and argue that it has a symmetry-protected topological order protected by generalized global symmetries supported on cycles in the foliated CSS chain complex. We demonstrate the so-called anomaly inflow between CSS codes and corresponding foliated cluster states by explicitly showing the equality of the gauge transformations of the bulk and boundary partition functions defined as functionals of defect world-volumes. We show that the bulk and boundary defects are related via measurement of the bulk system. Further, we provide a procedure to obtain statistical models associated with general CSS codes via the foliated cluster state, and derive a generalization of the Kramers-Wannier-Wegner duality for such statistical models with insertion of twist defects. We also study the measurement-assisted gauging method with cluster-state entanglers for CSS/fracton models based on recent proposals in the literature, and demonstrate a non-invertible fusion of duality operators. Using the cluster-state entanglers, we construct the so-called strange correlator for general CSS/fracton models. Finally, we introduce a new family of subsystem-symmetric quantum models each of which is self-dual under the generalized Kramers-Wannier-Wegner duality transformation, which becomes a non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Ramp from Replica Trick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the spectral form factor of the modular Hamiltonian $K=-\ln\rho_A$ associated to the reduced density matrix of a Haar random state. A ramp is demonstrated and we find an analytic expression for its slope. Our method involves an application of the replica trick, where we first calculate the correlator $&lt;\text{tr}\rho_A^n\;\text{tr}\rho_A^m&gt;$ at large bond dimension and then analytically continue the indices $n,m$ from integers to arbitrary complex numbers. We use steepest descent methods at large modular times to extract the ramp. The large bond dimension limit of the replicated partition function is dominated by a sum over \emph{annular non-crossing permutations}. We explored the similarity between our results and calculations of the spectral form factor in low dimensional gravitational theories where the ramp is determined by the double trumpet geometry. We find there is an underlying resemblance in the two calculations, when we interpret the annular non-crossing permutations as representing a discretized version of the double trumpet. Similar results are found for an equilibrated pure state in place of the Haar random state.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Interplay of Attention Paths in a Statistical Mechanics Theory of Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable empirical performance of Transformers, their theoretical understanding remains elusive. Here, we consider a deep multi-head self-attention network, that is closely related to Transformers yet analytically tractable. We develop a statistical mechanics theory of Bayesian learning in this model, deriving exact equations for the network's predictor statistics under the finite-width thermodynamic limit, i.e., $N,P\rightarrow\infty$, $P/N=\mathcal{O}(1)$, where $N$ is the network width and $P$ is the number of training examples. Our theory shows that the predictor statistics are expressed as a sum of independent kernels, each one pairing different 'attention paths', defined as information pathways through different attention heads across layers. The kernels are weighted according to a 'task-relevant kernel combination' mechanism that aligns the total kernel with the task labels. As a consequence, this interplay between attention paths enhances generalization performance. Experiments confirm our findings on both synthetic and real-world sequence classification tasks. Finally, our theory explicitly relates the kernel combination mechanism to properties of the learned weights, allowing for a qualitative transfer of its insights to models trained via gradient descent. As an illustration, we demonstrate an efficient size reduction of the network, by pruning those attention heads that are deemed less relevant by our theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the correlation functions of strings of spin operators for integrable quantum circuits exactly. These observables can be used for calibration of quantum simulation platforms. We use algebraic Bethe Ansatz, in combination with computational algebraic geometry to obtain analytic results for medium-size (around 10-20 qubits) quantum circuits. The results are rational functions of the quantum circuit parameters. We obtain analytic results for such correlation functions both in the real space and Fourier space. In the real space, we analyze the short time and long time limit of the correlation functions. In Fourier space, we obtain analytic results in different parameter regimes, which exhibit qualitatively different behaviors. Using these analytic results, one can easily generate numerical data to arbitrary precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The congestion formation on a urban road network is one of the key issue for the development of a sustainable mobility in the future smart cities. In this work we propose a reductionist approach studying the stationary states of a simple transport model using of a random process on a graph, where each node represents a location and the weight links give the transition rates to move from one node to another that represent the mobility demand. Each node has a finite transport capacity and a maximum load capacity and we assume that the average. In the approximation of the single step process we are able to analytically characterize the traffic load distribution on the single nodes, using a local Maximum Entropy Principle. Our results explain how the congested nodes emerge when the total traffic load increases in analogous way to a percolation transition where the appearance of a congested node is a independent random event, However, using numerical simulations, we show that in the more realistic case of the synchronous dynamics for the nodes, there are entropic forces that introduce correlation among the node state and favor the clustering of the empty and congested nodes. Our aim is to highlight universal properties of the congestion formation and, in particular, to understand the role traffic load fluctuations as a possible precursor of congestion in a transport network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of quantum states under dynamical evolution can be investigated by studying the spread with time of the state over a pre-defined basis. It is known that this complexity is minimised by choosing the Krylov basis, thus defining the spread complexity. We study the dynamics of spread complexity for quantum maps using the Arnoldi iterative procedure. The main illustrative quantum many-body model we use is the periodically kicked Ising spin-chain with non-integrable deformations, a chaotic system where we look at both local and non-local interactions. In the various cases we find distinctive behaviour of the Arnoldi coefficients and spread complexity for regular vs. chaotic dynamics: suppressed fluctuations in the Arnoldi coefficients as well as larger saturation value in spread complexity in the chaotic case. We compare the behaviour of the Krylov measures with that of standard spectral diagnostics of chaos. We also study the effect of changing the driving frequency on the complexity saturation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent developments of machine learning algorithms pertinent to the inverse renormalization group, which was originally established as a generative numerical method by Ron-Swendsen-Brandt via the implementation of compatible Monte Carlo simulations. Inverse renormalization group methods enable the iterative generation of configurations for increasing lattice size without the critical slowing down effect. We discuss the construction of inverse renormalization group transformations with the use of convolutional neural networks and present applications in models of statistical mechanics, lattice field theory, and disordered systems. We highlight the case of the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson spin glass, where the inverse renormalization group can be employed to construct configurations for lattice volumes that have not yet been accessed by dedicated supercomputers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The circuit model of quantum computation can be interpreted as a scattering process. In particular, factorised scattering operators result in integrable quantum circuits that provide universal quantum computation and are potentially less noisy. These are realized through Yang-Baxter or 2-simplex operators. A natural question is to extend this construction to higher qubit gates, like the Toffoli gates, which also lead to universal quantum computation but with shallower circuits. We show that unitary families of such operators are constructed by the 3-dimensional generalizations of the Yang-Baxter operators known as tetrahedron or 3-simplex operators. The latter satisfy a spectral parameter-dependent tetrahedron equation. This construction goes through for $n$-Toffoli gates realized using $n$-simplex operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems generically exhibit breakdown of Lieb-Robinson (LR) bounds, motivating study of whether new locality measures might shed light not seen by existing measures. In this paper we discuss extensions of the connected correlation function (CC) as measures of locality and information spreading in both Hermitian and NH systems. We find that in Hermitian systems, $\delta\rho = \rho-\rho_A\otimes\rho_B$ can be written as a linear combination of CCs, allowing placement of a LR bound on $\Vert\delta\rho\Vert_2$, which we show generically extends to a LR bound on mutual information. Additionally, we extend the CC to NH systems in a form that recovers locality, and use the metric formalism to derive a modified CC which recovers not just locality but even LR bounds. We find that even with these CCs, the bound on $\Vert\delta\rho\Vert_2$ breaks down in certain NH cases, which can be used to place a necessary condition on which NH Hamiltonians are capable of nonlocal entanglement generation. Numerical simulations are provided by means of exact diagonalization for the NH Transverse-Field Ising Model, demonstrating both breakdown and recovery of LR bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) describes the properties of diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in the eigenenergy basis. In this work, we propose a relation between (i) the singular behaviour of the off-diagonal part of ETH at small energy differences, and (ii) the smooth profile of the diagonal part of ETH as a function of the energy density. We establish this connection from the decay of the autocorrelation functions of local operators, which is constrained by the presence of local conserved quantities whose evolution is described by hydrodynamics. We corroborate our predictions with numerical simulations of two non-integrable spin-1 Ising models, one diffusive and one super-diffusive, which we perform using dynamical quantum typicality up to 18 spins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-electron collisions lead to a T-square component in the electrical resistivity of Fermi liquids and their density of states. The case of liquid $^3$He illustrates that the \textit{thermal} resitivity of a Fermi liquid has a T-square term, expressed in m$\cdot$W$^{-1}$. Its natural units are $\hbar/k_FE_F^2$. Here, we present a high-resolution study of the thermal conductivity in bismuth, employing magnetic field to extract the tiny electronic component of the total thermal conductivity and resolving signals as small as $\approx 60 \mu$K. We find that the electronic thermal resistivity follows a T-square temperature dependence with a prefactor twice larger than the electric T-square prefactor. Adding this information to what has been known for other semi-metals, we find that the prefactor of the T-square thermal resistivity scales with the square of the inverse of the Fermi temperature, implying that the dimensionless fermion-fermion collision cross-section is roughly proportional to the Fermi wavelength, indicating that it is not simply set by the strength of the Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in the Output Distribution of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a physical system, changing parameters such as temperature can induce a phase transition: an abrupt change from one state of matter to another. Analogous phenomena have recently been observed in large language models. Typically, the task of identifying phase transitions requires human analysis and some prior understanding of the system to narrow down which low-dimensional properties to monitor and analyze. Statistical methods for the automated detection of phase transitions from data have recently been proposed within the physics community. These methods are largely system agnostic and, as shown here, can be adapted to study the behavior of large language models. In particular, we quantify distributional changes in the generated output via statistical distances, which can be efficiently estimated with access to the probability distribution over next-tokens. This versatile approach is capable of discovering new phases of behavior and unexplored transitions -- an ability that is particularly exciting in light of the rapid development of language models and their emergent capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Ising machines are dedicated hardware solvers of NP-hard optimization problems. However, they do not always find the most optimal solution. The probability of finding this optimal solution depends on the problem at hand. Using continuation methods, we show that this is closely linked to the bifurcation sequence of the optimal solution. From this bifurcation analysis, we can determine the effectiveness of solution schemes. Moreover, we find that the proper choice of implementation of the Ising machine can drastically change this bifurcation sequence and therefore vastly increase the probability of finding the optimal solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In slowly driven classical systems, work is a stochastic quantity and its probability distribution is known to satisfy the work fluctuation-dissipation relation, which states that the mean and variance of the dissipated work are linearly related. Recently, it was shown that generation of quantum coherence in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis leads to a correction to this linear relation in the slow-driving regime. Here, we go even further by investigating nonclassical features of work fluctuations in setups with more than one system. To do this, we first generalize slow control protocols to encompass multipartite systems, allowing for the generation of quantum correlations during the driving process. Then, focussing on two-qubit systems, we show that entanglement generation leads to a positive contribution to the dissipated work, which is distinct from the quantum correction due to local coherence generation known from previous work. Our results show that entanglement generated during slow control protocols, e.g. as an unavoidable consequence of qubit crosstalk, comes at the cost of increased dissipation.</description>

      <title>Metric structural human connectomes: localization and multifractality of eigenmodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the fundamental principles behind the architecture of the human brain's structural connectome, from the perspective of spectral analysis of Laplacian and adjacency matrices. Building on the idea that the brain strikes a balance between efficient information processing and minimizing wiring costs, we aim to understand the impact of the metric properties of the connectome and how they relate to the existence of an inherent scale. We demonstrate that a simple generative model, combining nonlinear preferential attachment with an exponential penalty for spatial distance between nodes, can effectively reproduce several key characteristics of the human connectome, including spectral density, edge length distribution, eigenmode localization and local clustering properties. We also delve into the finer spectral properties of the human structural connectomes by evaluating the inverse participation ratios ($\text{IPR}_q$) across various parts of the spectrum. Our analysis reveals that the level statistics in the soft cluster region of the Laplacian spectrum deviate from a purely Poisson distribution due to interactions between clusters. Additionally, we identified scar-like localized modes with large IPR values in the continuum spectrum. We identify multiple fractal eigenmodes distributed across different parts of the spectrum, evaluate their fractal dimensions and find a power-law relationship in the return probability, which is a hallmark of critical behavior. We discuss the conjectures that a brain operates in the Griffiths or multifractal phases.</description>

Abstract: In a generic random system, the coexistence of extended and localized states can be evidenced by the subextensive width of energy distribution of a physical initial state in, for example, the quantum quenches which involving the local Hamiltonian. The robust thermalization is also evidenced in terms of the microscopic canonical ensemble average in the thermalization limit\cite{Shiraishi}, which satisfies the weak eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). In this article, we study the method of two-particle self-consistency for a system without condensation, i.e., without the inaccessible localizations that violating the ETH. We provide another pespective that considering the local conservation of an nonintegrable system the stubborn correlations between the three kinds of decompositions for the four-point functions, which can be regarded as the elements in a product of the self-energy and Green function matrices (i.e., the two-particle correlations in Kadanoff and Baym notation\cite{Vilk Y M}).</description>

      <title>Distributed fixed resources exchanging particles: Phases of an asymmetric exclusion process connected to two reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and study a conceptual one-dimensional model to explore how the combined interplay between fixed resources and particle exchanges between different parts of an extended system can affect the stationary densities in a current carrying channel connecting different parts of the system. To this end, we consider a model composed of a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) connecting two particle reservoirs without any internal dynamics but which can directly exchange particles between each other, ensuring nonvanishing currents in the steady states. The total particle number in the system that defines the "resources" available, although is kept constant by the model dynamics, can take any value independent of the model parameters that define the dynamics of the model. We show how the resulting phase diagrams of the model are controlled by the parameters, which define the various dynamical update rules together with the total available resources. These control parameters can be tuned to make the density on the TASEP lane globally uniform or piecewise continuous with localized domain walls, and can also control populations of the two reservoirs. In general, the phase diagrams are quite different from a TASEP with open boundaries. In the limit of large amount of resources, the phase diagrams in the plane of the control parameters become topologically identical to that for an open TASEP together with delocalization of domain walls.</description>

      <title>A supersymmetric quantum perspective on the explicit large deviations for reversible Markov jump processes, with applications to pure and random spin chains</title>

Abstract: The large deviations at various levels that are explicit for Markov jump processes satisfying detailed-balance are revisited in terms of the supersymmetric quantum Hamiltonian $H$ that can be obtained from the Markov generator via a similarity transformation. We first focus on the large deviations at level 2 for the empirical density ${\hat p}(C) $ of the configurations $C$ seen during a trajectory over the large time-window $[0,T]$ and rewrite the explicit Donsker-Varadhan rate function as the matrix element $I^{[2]}[{\hat p}(.) ] = \langle \sqrt{ {\hat p} } \vert H \vert \sqrt{{\hat p}} \rangle $ involving the square-root ket $\vert \sqrt{{\hat p}} \rangle $. [The analog formula is also discussed for reversible diffusion processes as a comparison.] We then consider the explicit rate functions at higher levels, in particular for the joint probability of the empirical density ${\hat p}(C) $ and the empirical local activities ${\hat a}(C,C') $ characterizing the density of jumps between two configurations $(C,C')$. Finally, the explicit rate function for the joint probability of the empirical density ${\hat p}(C) $ and of the empirical total activity ${\hat A} $ that represents the total density of jumps of a long trajectory is written in terms of the two matrix elements $ \langle \sqrt{ {\hat p} } \vert H \vert \sqrt{{\hat p}} \rangle$ and $\langle \sqrt{ {\hat p} } \vert H^{off} \vert \sqrt{{\hat p}} \rangle $, where $H^{off} $ represents the off-diagonal part of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian $H$. This general formalism is then applied to pure or random spin chains with single-spin-flip or two-spin-flip transition rates, where the supersymmetric Hamiltonian $H$ correspond to quantum spin chains with local interactions involving Pauli matrices of two or three neighboring sites.</description>

Abstract: The Navier-Stokes equations are paradigmatic equations describing hydrodynamics of an interacting system with microscopic interactions encoded in transport coefficients. In this work we show how the Navier-Stokes equations arise from the microscopic dynamics of nearly integrable $1d$ quantum many-body systems. We build upon the recently developed hydrodynamics of integrable models to study the effective Boltzmann equation with collision integral taking into account the non-integrable interactions. We compute the transport coefficients and find that the resulting Navier-Stokes equations have two regimes, which differ in the viscous properties of the resulting fluid. We illustrate the method by computing the transport coefficients for an experimentally relevant case of coupled $1d$ cold-atomic gases.</description>

Abstract: When a system is brought to a metastable state, nuclei of the equilibrium phase form and grow. This is the well-known nucleation and growth of first-order phase transitions. Near a critical point of a continuous phase transition, critical phenomena such as critical opalescence characterized by universal scaling emerge. These two sets of behavior are so completely different that it might appear absurd to ask whether nucleation and growth exhibit even a slight universal scaling. Here we show that universal scaling is indeed manifested in standard nucleation and growth by introducing a non-universal initial time to a recently proposed method. This generalizes the method and provides a different perspective for studying universal scaling behavior and hence universality classes of nucleation and growth.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate the stochastic thermodynamics of Fisher information (FI), meaning we characterize both the \textit{fluctuations} of FI, introducing a parastatistics of that quantity, and thermodynamic quantities. We introduce two initial conditions: an equilibrium initial condition and a minimum entropy initial condition, both under a protocol that drives the system to equilibrium. Its results indicate a dependence of the average FI on both the initial condition and path taken. Furthermore, the results point the chosen parameter directly affects the FI of thermodynamic quantities such as irreversible work and entropy, along with fluctuations of a stochastic FI. Last, we assess the further role of FI of the distribution of thermal quantities within the context of thermostatistical inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian correlations emerge in a large class of many-body quantum systems quenched out of equilibrium, as demonstrated in recent experiments on coupled one-dimensional superfluids [Schweigler et al., Nature Physics 17, 559 (2021)]. Here, we present a mechanism by which an initial state of a Rydberg atom array can retain persistent non-Gaussian correlations following a global quench. This mechanism is based on an effective kinetic blockade rooted in the ground state symmetry of the system, which prevents thermalizing dynamics under the quench Hamiltonian. We propose how to observe this effect with Rydberg atom experiments and we demonstrate its resilience against several types of experimental errors. These long-lived non-Gaussian states may have practical applications as quantum memories or stable resources for quantum-information protocols due to the protected non-Gaussianity away from equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure and model the combined relaxation of a qubit coupled to a discrete two-level system~(TLS) environment, also known as the central spin model. If the TLSs are much longer-lived than the qubit, non-exponential relaxation and non-Poissonian quantum jumps can be observed. In the limit of large numbers of TLSs, the relaxation is likely to follow a power law, which we confirm with measurements on a superconducting fluxonium qubit. Moreover, the observed relaxation and quantum jump statistics are described by the Solomon equations, for which we present a derivation starting from the general Lindblad equation for an arbitrary number of TLSs. We also show how to reproduce the non-Poissonian quantum jump statistics using a diffusive stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. The fact that the measured quantum jump statistics can be reproduced by the Solomon equations, which ignore the quantum measurement backaction, hints at a quantum-to-classical transition.</description>

Abstract: Robots and animals both experience the world through their bodies and senses. Their embodiment constrains their experiences, ensuring they unfold continuously in space and time. As a result, the experiences of embodied agents are intrinsically correlated. Correlations create fundamental challenges for machine learning, as most techniques rely on the assumption that data are independent and identically distributed. In reinforcement learning, where data are directly collected from an agent's sequential experiences, violations of this assumption are often unavoidable. Here, we derive a method that overcomes this issue by exploiting the statistical mechanics of ergodic processes, which we term maximum diffusion reinforcement learning. By decorrelating agent experiences, our approach provably enables single-shot learning in continuous deployments over the course of individual task attempts. Moreover, we prove our approach generalizes well-known maximum entropy techniques, and robustly exceeds state-of-the-art performance across popular benchmarks. Our results at the nexus of physics, learning, and control form a foundation for transparent and reliable decision-making in embodied reinforcement learning agents.</description>

      <title>Emergent symmetries and Interactions: An isolated fixed point Vs a manifold of strongly interacting fixed points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study conditions of continuous emergent symmetries in gapless states, either as topological quantum critical points (TQCPs) or a stable phase with protecting symmetries and connections to smooth deformations of the gapped states around. We illustrate that for a wide class of gapless states that can be associated with fully-isolated scale invariant fixed points, there shall always be emergent continuous symmetries that are directly related to smooth deformations of gapped states with symmetries lower than the protecting ones $G_p$. For a 3D TQCP in DIII classes with $G_p=Z^T_2$, $U_{EM}=U(1)$ and $N_f=\frac{1}{2}$ fermions but without charge $U(1)$ symmetry, we explicitly construct a corresponding boundary representation based on a $4D$ topological state with lattice symmetry $H=Z^T_2 \ltimes U(1)$ and $N_f={1}$ fermions. Although emergent continuous symmetries appear to be robust at weakly interacting TQCPs, we further show the breakdown of such one-to-one correspondence between deformations of gapped states and emergent continuous symmetries when gapless states become strongly interacting. In a strongly interacting limit, gapless states can be represented by a smooth manifold of conformal-field-theory fixed points rather than a fully isolated one. A smooth manifold of strong coupling fixed points hinders emergence of a continuous emergent symmetry in the strongly interacting gapless limit, as deformations no longer leave a gapless state or a TQCP invariant, unlike in the more conventional weakly interacting case. This typically reduces continuous emergent symmetries to a discrete symmetry originating from duality transformations under the protection symmetry $G_p$.</description>

      <title>The Influence Functional in open holography: entanglement and R\'enyi entropies</title>

Abstract: Open quantum systems are defined as ordinary unitary quantum theories coupled to a set of external degrees of freedom, which are introduced to take on the r\^ole of an unobserved environment. Here we study examples of open quantum field theories, with the aid of the so-called Feynman- Vernon Influence Functional (IF), including field theories that arise in holographic duality. We interpret the system in the presence of an IF as an open effective field theory, able to capture the effect of the unobserved environment. Our main focus is on computing R\'enyi and entanglement entropies in such systems, whose description from the IF, or "open EFT", point of view we develop in this paper. The issue of computing the entanglement-R\'enyi entropies in open quantum systems is surprisingly rich, and we point out how different prescriptions for the IF may be appropriate depending on the application of choice. A striking application of our methods concerns the fine-grained entropy of subsystems when including gravity in the setup, for example when considering the Hawking radiation emitted by black holes. In this case we show that one prescription for the IF leads to answers consistent with unitary evolution, while the other merely reproduces standard EFT results, well known to be inconsistent with unitary global evolution. We establish these results for asymptotically AdS gravity in arbitrary dimensions, and illustrate them with explicit analytical expressions for the IF in the case of matter-coupled JT gravity in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>An integral algorithm of exponential observables for interacting fermions in quantum Monte Carlo simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exponential observables, formulated as $\log \langle e^{\hat{X}}\rangle$ where $\hat{X}$ is an extensive quantity, play a critical role in study of quantum many-body systems, examples of which include the free-energy and entanglement entropy. Given that $e^{X}$ becomes exponentially large (or small) in the thermodynamic limit, accurately computing the expectation value of this exponential quantity presents a significant challenge. In this Letter, we propose a comprehensive algorithm for quantifying these observables in interacting fermion systems, utilizing the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method. We have applied this novel algorithm to the 2D half-filled Hubbard model. At the strong coupling limit, our method showcases a significant accuracy improvement compared to conventional methods that are derived from the internal energy. We also illustrate that this novel approach delivers highly efficient and precise measurements of the nth R\'enyi entanglement entropy. Even more noteworthy is that this improvement comes without incurring increases in computational complexity. This algorithm effectively suppresses exponential fluctuations and can be easily generalized to other models.</description>

      <title>W-kernel and essential subspace for frequencist evaluation of Bayesian estimators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The posterior covariance matrix W defined by the log-likelihood of each observation plays important roles both in the sensitivity analysis and frequencist evaluation of the Bayesian estimators. This study is focused on the matrix W and its principal space; we term the latter as an essential subspace. A key tool for treating frequencist properties is the recently proposed Bayesian infinitesimal jackknife approximation (Giordano and Broderick (2023)). The matrix W can be interpreted as a reproducing kernel and is denoted as W-kernel. Using W-kernel, the essential subspace is expressed as a principal space given by the kernel principal component analysis. A relation to the Fisher kernel and neural tangent kernel is established, which elucidates the connection to the classical asymptotic theory. We also discuss a type of Bayesian-frequencist duality, which is naturally appeared from the kernel framework. Finally, two applications are discussed: the selection of a representative set of observations and dimensional reduction in the approximate bootstrap. In the former, incomplete Cholesky decomposition is introduced as an efficient method for computing the essential subspace. In the latter, different implementations of the approximate bootstrap for posterior means are compared.</description>

Abstract: A quantum random walk model is established on a one-dimensional periodic lattice that fluctuates between two possible states. This model is defined by Lindblad rate equations that incorporate the transition rates between the two lattice states. Leveraging the system's symmetries, the particle velocity can be described using a finite set of equations, even though the state space is of infinite dimension. These equations yield an analytical expression for the velocity in the long-time limit, which is employed to analyze the characteristics of directed motion. Notably, the velocity can exhibit multiple inversions, and to achieve directed motion, distinct, nonzero transition rates between lattice states are required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a quantum junction described by a 1+1-dimensional boundary conformal field theory (BCFT). Our analysis focuses on correlations emerging at finite temperature, achieved through the computation of entanglement measures. Our approach relies on characterizing correlation functions of twist fields using BCFT techniques. We provide non-perturbative predictions for the crossover between low and high temperatures. An intriguing interplay between bulk and boundary effects, associated with the bulk/boundary scaling dimensions of the fields above, is found. In particular, the entanglement entropy is primarily influenced by bulk thermal fluctuations, exhibiting extensiveness for large system sizes with a prefactor independent of the scattering properties of the defect. In contrast, negativity is governed by fluctuations across the entangling points only, adhering to an area law; its value depends non-trivially on the defect, and it diverges logarithmically as the temperature is decreased. To validate our predictions, we numerically check them for free fermions on the lattice, finding good agreement.</description>

      <title>A finite geometry, inertia assisted coarsening-to-complexity transition in homogeneous frictional systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of statistical complexity in frictional systems, manifested in broad distributions of various observables, is not yet understood. We study this problem in velocity-driven, homogeneous (no quenched disorder) unstable frictional systems of height $H$. The latter are described at the continuum scale within a realistic rate-and-state friction interfacial constitutive framework, where elasto-frictional instabilities emerge from rate-weakening friction. For large $H$, such frictional systems were recently shown to undergo continuous coarsening until settling into a spatially periodic traveling solution. We show that when the system's height-to-length ratio becomes small, coarsening is less effective and the periodic solution is dynamically avoided. Instead, and consistently with previous reports, the system settles into a stochastic, statistically stationary state. The latter features slip bursts, classified into predominantly non-propagating small bursts and propagating large bursts, which are non-trivially distributed. The statistical distributions emerge from dynamically self-generated heterogeneity, where both the non-equilibrium history of the interface and wave reflections from finite boundaries, mediated by material inertia, play central roles. Specifically, the dynamics and statistics of large bursts reveal a timescale $\sim\!H/c_{\rm s}$, where $c_{\rm s}$ is the shear wave-speed. We discuss the robustness of our findings against variations of the frictional parameters, most notably affecting the magnitude of frictional rate-weakening, as well as against different interfacial state evolution laws. Finally, we demonstrate a reverse transition in which statistical complexity disappears in favor of the spatially periodic traveling solution. Overall, our results elucidate how relatively simple physical ingredients can give rise to the emergence of slip complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) has played a key role in recent advances in the high energy and condensed matter communities. It explains how an isolated quantum system in a far-from-equilibrium initial state can evolve to a state that is indistinguishable from thermal equilibrium, with observables relaxing to almost time-independent results that can be described using traditional statistical mechanics ensembles. In this work we probe the limits of ETH, pushing it outside its prototypical applications in several directions. We design a qutrit lattice system with conserved quasilocal charge, in which we verify a form of generalized eigenstate thermalization. We also observe signatures of thermalization in states well outside microcanonical windows of both charge and energy, which we dub `generic ETH.'</description>

      <title>Revisiting the barometric equation and the extent of a planetary atmosphere</title>

Abstract: The barometric equation predicts the molecular concentration $n(z)$ exponentially decaying with altitude $z$. Because the mean free path $l=1/n\sigma$ increases exponentially, at high altitudes $z$, the equation is no longer within the domain of applicability of the standard kinetic theory. \cite{grimsditch} Here, we predict the dependence $n(z)\propto z^{-2}$ for the case $l\gg L$ in uniform gravity and $n(z)\propto [\ln(1+z/R_0)]^{-2}$ when $z\gg R_0$ for a planet of radius $R_0$. It corresponds to a non-stationary planetary atmosphere with hydrogen accretion. The accretion is accompanied by a release of gravitational potential energy that could be the elusive source driving the formation of stellar coronas. Other consequences include slowly decaying tails of planetary atmospheres and periodical hydrogen explosions of white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Analytical derivation and extension of the anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling in the transverse field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A defect density which quantifies the deviation from the spin ground state characterizes non-equilibrium dynamics during phase transitions. The widely recognized Kibble-Zurek scaling predicts how the defect density evolves during phase transitions. However, it can be perturbed by a noise, leading to the anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling. In this research, we analytically investigate the effect of Gaussian white noise on the transition probabilities of the Landau-Zener model. We apply this analysis to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model and obtain an analytical approximate solution of the defect density. Our analysis reveals that when the introduced noise is small, the model follows the previously known anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling. On the other hand, as the noise increases, a new scaling behavior emerges. Furthermore, we identify the parameter that minimizes the defect density based on the new scaling, which allows us to verify how effective the already known scaling of the optimized parameter is.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Behavior of the Mayer Series Coefficients for a Dimer Gas on a Rectangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first 20 Mayer series coefficients for a dimer gas on a rectangular lattice are now known in every dimension, by the work of Butera, Pernici, and the author, [1]. In the present work we initiate a numerical study of a very promising asymptotic form. We let $\mathcal{S}$ be \begin{equation} \mathcal{S} = \{ r , k , c_{0} , c_{1}, .... c_{r} \} \nonumber \end{equation} with $r$ an integer $\ge 1$, $k$ an integer $\ge 1$, and $c_{i}$ real numbers. For such a set $\mathcal{S}$ we define an approximation to $b(n)$, $\hat{b}(n)$ = $\hat{b}(n, \mathcal{S})$ by \begin{equation}\label{A1} \tag{A1} \hat{b}(n) = \begin{cases}
  b(n) ,&amp;\quad n &lt; k
  f(n), &amp;\quad n\geq k \end{cases} \end{equation} with \begin{equation}\label{A2} \tag{A2}
  f(n)=(-1)^{n-k+1} b(k-1) \prod\limits_{i=k}^{n}\left(c_0+\frac{c_1}{i} +\ldots+ \frac{c_r}{i^{r}}\right) \end{equation} Herein we study the limited problem with $k = 11-r$, $r \leq 6$, and d in the set $\{1,2,3,5,11,20\}$. In this situation we also choose the $\{c_{i}\}$ such that $f(n) = b(n)$ for $n \leq 11$. This determines the $ c(i)$ uniquely, We hope further exploration in many directions will follow. We have not explicitly indicated $d$ dependence of many of the variables. We will see that $\hat{b}(n)$ is a good approximation to $b(n)$, in a sense we will define. We will present some physicists' intuitions behind the form of our approximations. Theoretical analysis of these approximations, we envision, will be very difficult. We will indicate the form of theorems we should want to have proved.</description>
