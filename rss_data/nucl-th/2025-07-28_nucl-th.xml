      <title>Bayesian optimization and nonlocal effects method for {\alpha} decay of superheavy nuclei based on CPPM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have integrated nonlocal effects with the Bayesian neural network (BNN) approach to enhance the prediction accuracy of $\alpha$ decay half-lives. The results indicate that incorporating nonlocal effects significantly impacts half-life calculations, while the BNN method substantially improves prediction accuracy and demonstrates strong extrapolation capabilities. Using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), we conducted a quantitative comparison among the four input feature parameters in the BNN, revealing that the $\alpha$ decay energy $Q_{\alpha}$ is the predominant contributor to $T_{1/2}$. Leveraging the BNN robust extrapolation capability, we predicted $\alpha$ decay half-lives for the isotopic chains (Z=118, 120), revealing a significant shell effect at N=184 of neutrons.
  Keywords: $\alpha$ decay, half-lives, nonlocal effects, Bayesian neural network, Coulomb and proximity potential model.</description>

      <title>Classification of flavor dependence of Chiral Magnetic Effect with Deep Neural Network using multiple correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the flavor dependence of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) by analyzing two key charge-separation correlators used to characterize the charge separation effect: the conventional $\Delta\gamma$ and the recently proposed $R_{\psi_2}$. Using the AMPT (A Multiphase Transport) model with an initial-state centrality-dependent charge separation, we evaluate the sensitivity of these correlators to 2-flavor ($u,d$) and 3-flavor ($u,d,s$) quark scenarios. While both correlators exhibit modest flavor dependence in mid-central (30-50\%) collisions, their discriminative power varies significantly with centrality and transverse momentum ($p_T$), limiting their utility disentangling the flavor dependent scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we develop a neural network classifier trained on final-state hadronic observables (e.g., $dN_{ch}/d\eta$, $p_T$ spectra). The model achieves $&gt;90\%$ accuracy in flavor classification by leveraging multi-observable correlations, with $p_T$-differential features proving particularly discriminative. Crucially, by incorporating background contributions directly into the training data, our approach provides more reliable flavor estimates than correlator-only methods.</description>

      <title>Non-Efimovian two-neutron halos with an $s$-wave core-neutron resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two-neutron halo nuclei in which the neutron core subsystem displays a resonance close to threshold. Such resonances can be generated in an effective field theory in which the scattering length and effective range are summed to all orders. We show that no three-body parameter is required to make predictions in this case and map out the universal features of such systems. We furthermore study the dependence of these universal features on the core mass. We apply our framework to the two-neutron halo nucleus ${}^{22}$C.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Moments of Inertia of Forced Split Fragments for Nuclei 232Th(n,f) and 238U(n,f)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses modern methods for estimating the moments of inertia of fragments formed during forced fission of the isotopes 232Th(n,f) and 238U(n,f). The study analyzes two fundamental approaches -- statistical and microscopic. Special attention is given to their implementation within both classical and superfluid models, enabling a more detailed description of nuclear dynamics during fission. Various physical factors influencing the calculation of moments of inertia are examined, including transverse vibrational modes and nucleon exchange mechanisms. These effects significantly impact spin distributions and the interpretation of experimental data. The analysis also addresses the role of nuclear models that vary with fragment deformation, allowing key regularities in internal structure to be identified. Emphasis is placed on comparing theoretical predictions with experimental results, which remain essential for model validation. This approach not only deepens understanding of fission mechanisms but also supports the broader study of fundamental nuclear properties.</description>

      <title>Adressing the p{\Omega}- interaction and di-baryonic states via femtoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental measurements of the p$\Omega^-$ correlation function and the concurrent theoretical efforts to describe the strong interaction among hadrons in the strangeness sector, we present a data-driven approach for fine tuning of a meson-exchanges potential for the p$\Omega^-$ system. Using femtoscopy data from the ALICE and STAR collaborations, we constrain the strength of the interaction, encoded in the tunable short-range parameter introduced in the potential. The resulting model provides a good description of the measured correlation functions and favors the existence of a bound state in the \({}^5S_2\) channel with a binding energy of approximately \(0.5\,\mathrm{MeV}\). The role of the \({}^3S_1\) channel, however, remains poorly constrained due to the absence of an accurate model accounting for its inelastic contributions.</description>

      <title>Modeling direct and pre-equilibrium processes of neutron-induced reactions with noniterative finite amplitude method and distorted-wave Born approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a calculation method for describing the direct and pre-equilibrium processes in neutron-induced reactions based on the framework of noniterative finite amplitude method (FAM) and distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA). The noniterative FAM is used to derive equations of quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) for neutron-induced inelastic scatterings to both the discrete and continuum states in a consistent manner. The Skyrme force is employed as an interaction between the projectile neutron with nucleons inside the target nucleus. We apply this method to the neutron-induced reaction on 208Pb. We demonstrate that the calculated differential inelastic scattering cross sections to low-lying states reproduce available experimental data without any phenomenological parameters that are often introduced in conventional DWBA calculations. The calculated double differential cross section to the continuum state also agrees with the experimental data in the energy region relevant to the direct and pre-equilibrium processes. These results are used to investigate the spin distribution of the populated states in the residual nucleus.</description>

      <title>Dominance of scale anomaly in confining pressure inside pions on light front in the top-down holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the energy density and the stress distribution inside the pion derived from gravitational form factors in top-down holographic QCD. In particular, we show that the dominance of the scale anomaly in the confining pressure, previously observed in the instant form for the nucleon, also holds for the pion in the light-front form. Furthermore, we find that in large-$N_c$ QCD described by this approach, the scalar glueball plays a mediating role in transmitting the confining pressure. These findings support the universal role of the scale anomaly in the stability of hadrons.</description>

      <title>Color-glass condensate beyond the Gaussian approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the high-energy limit, perturbative calculations in QCD are conveniently done using the dipole picture which factorizes the scattering amplitude into a perturbative part and the nonperturbative scattering off the nuclear target, described using correlators of Wilson lines. These correlators can be computed in the color-glass condensate effective field theory by using a Gaussian model for the color density of the target. In this work, we generalize the Gaussian model to a generic function that is local in the transverse coordinates and the light-cone time, and show how to compute physical Wilson-line correlators in this model. We also consider a simple model for the color density based on stable probability distributions and show that the small-dipole behavior of the dipole amplitude is modified from quadratic to a power law, where the power is given by the stability parameter of the distribution. This generalization of the Gaussian model is suitable for numerical applications in the high-energy limit and can be used in future phenomenological studies of the nuclear structure.</description>

      <title>Freezeout at constant energy density and spin polarization in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the local equilibrium density operator, we develop a geometry-informed linear response theory that takes into account the parameterization of the freezeout hypersurface before the gradient expansion is carried out. Assuming local equilibrium on an iso-energy density hypersurface, we study the $\Lambda$ hyperon spin polarization, and compute corrections to the isothermal case due to finite density. We argue that corrections to isothermal freezeout should be small, and that even in heavy ion collisions with energy as low as $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 11.5$ GeV they constitute at most a $10\%$ effect. They may, however, become relevant for local polarization observables.</description>

      <title>Particle Correlations in Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study particle correlations in high energy jets by comparing the measured energy-energy correlator (EEC) with that constructed from two individual energy flows with respect to the jet axis. This comparison demonstrates that genuine correlations exists for small angle and moderate/large angle, indicating that they are coming from correlated splitting. This method will provide a unique tool to disentangle different physics, by comparing the genuine correlations in jet EEC between heavy ion collisions and proton-proton collisions. It will help to expose the medium modification of parton splitting in hot QCD medium. On the other hand, the medium responses are expected to be canceled out in the genuine correlations.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Network Driven Simulation Based Inference Method for Pole Position Estimation under Model Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation Based Inference (SBI) is shown to yield more accurate resonance parameter estimates than traditional chi-squared minimization in certain cases of model misspecification, demonstrated through a case study of pi-pi scattering and the rho(770) resonance. Models fit to some data sets using chi-squared minimization can predict inaccurate pole positions for the rho(770), while SBI provides more robust predictions across the same models and data. This result is significant both as a proof of concept that SBI can handle model misspecification, and because accurate modeling of pi-pi scattering is essential in the study of many contemporary physical systems (e.g., a1(1260), omega(782)).</description>

      <title>Structure of heavy quarkonia under strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural modifications of heavy quarkonia in the presence of strong magnetic fields using a constituent quark model. By incorporating the effects of spin mixing and quark Landau levels, we employ a nonrelativistic Hamiltonian that captures the essential features of quark dynamics in a magnetic field. The two-body Schr\"odinger equation is solved using the cylindrical Gaussian expansion method, which respects the cylindrical symmetry induced by a magnetic field. We extract the corresponding light-front wave function (LFWF) densities and analyze their transverse and longitudinal structures, revealing characteristic features such as transverse momentum broadening. While the longitudinal structure is only slightly modified within the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian, we discuss some corrections that can significantly affect its longitudinal structure. Furthermore, we discuss the structure modifications of excited states and find notable changes in the LFWF densities, and state reshuffling near avoided crossings. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of hadron structure to external magnetic fields and help bridge our understanding to relativistic approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, as experimental data on the excited $\Xi(1620)$ and $\Xi(1690)$ states have accumulated, theoretical analyses based on chiral dynamics have also been actively pursued. In this study, we construct theoretical models within the chiral unitary approach to reproduce recent experimental data, and perform a model interpolation to examine the relationship between the poles appearing in different models. We then calculate the invariant mass spectra of the $\pi^+\Xi^-$ system in the $\Xi_c \to \pi\pi\Xi$ decay, using the scattering amplitudes obtained from each model, to investigate how the distinct pole structures influence the observable spectrum.</description>

Abstract: We extend our previous work on the spin alignment of the $\phi$ vector meson in the hadronic phase of the Quark Gluon Plasma, by including effects of nucleon scatterings. The emission rates are calculated in a realistic hydrodynamic background simulated with the code Fluid$u$m, for different beam energies. We find that all the effects taken into account cannot explain the out-of-plane spin alignment of the $\phi$ meson observed experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the directed flow of $\phi$-mesons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3$ GeV, is sensitive on production and the absorption cross section of the $\phi$ in a nuclear medium. This provides a new observable to constrain the in-medium properties of the $\phi$ which is independent of its absolute production rate. It is shown that the STAR data disfavor any significant $\phi$-N absorption in dense nuclear matter and are consistent with a very small cross section of the $\phi$ comparable to the vacuum cross section. The similarity of the $\phi$-meson and proton directed flow also indicates that the $\phi$ is produced in conjunction with a baryon.</description>

      <title>Pushing the hybrid approach to low beam energies with dynamic initial conditions from hadronic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While hybrid approaches of relativistic hydrodynamics+transport have been well established for the dynamical description of heavy-ion collisions at high beam energies, moving to lower beam energies is challenging. In this work, we propose dynamic initial conditions for the viscous hydrodynamic evolution in heavy-ion collisions at low to intermediate beam energies. They are comprised of core hadrons based on the local energy density during the pre-equilibrium hadronic evolution. The SMASH-vHLLE hybrid approach is then applied to lower beam energies, achieving good agreement with measured bulk observables between $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 3$ and $9.1\ \mathrm{GeV}$, thus providing guidance for measurements in STAR-BES and CBM at FAIR. This framework has the advantage that the equation of state of dense QCD matter is a direct input to the calculation, so the current results can be regarded as a baseline with respect to future studies of the phase transition.</description>

Abstract: The $\Lambda$ spin polarization is a crucial probe of the gradients of velocity and temperature in the quark-gluon plasma generated in heavy-ion collisions. However, it is still not systematically used to tune hydrodynamic models. In this work, we investigate the influence of different initial conditions and parametrization of the bulk viscosity on $\Lambda$ polarization, showing that they affect the local polarization significantly. These results highlight the impact that the use of local polarization can have on refining theoretical models. Finally, we compare our results, including feed-down corrections, with experimental data from high-energy heavy-ion collisions at STAR and ALICE, and demonstrate the crucial role of bulk viscosity in generating the correct sign of longitudinal polarization at LHC energies.</description>

      <title>Robust ab initio predictions for dimensionless ratios of E2 and radius observables. I. Electric quadrupole moments and deformation</title>

Abstract: Converged results for E2 observables are notoriously challenging to obtain in ab initio no-core configuration interaction (NCCI) approaches. Matrix elements of the E2 operator are sensitive to the large-distance tails of the nuclear wave function, which converge slowly in an oscillator basis expansion. Similar convergence challenges beset ab initio prediction of the nuclear charge radius. However, we exploit systematic correlations between the calculated E2 and radius observables to yield meaningful predictions for relations among these observables. In particular, we examine ab initio predictions for dimensionless ratios of the form Q/r^2, for nuclei throughout the $p$ shell. Meaningful predictions for electric quadrupole moments may then be made by calibrating to the ground-state charge radius, if experimentally known, or vice versa. Moreover, these dimensionless ratios provide ab initio insight into the nuclear quadrupole deformation.</description>

      <title>Impact of spin polarization on transport and thermodynamic coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the influence of parton spin polarization on effective transport and thermodynamic coefficients in noncentral light- and heavy-ion collisions. To model this influence, we consider two sources of spin polarization: thermal vorticity, induced by angular momentum, and thermal shear, arising from local velocity gradients. Using a novel kinetic theory framework, we find that transport and thermodynamic coefficients -- including the speed of sound squared $c_{s}^{2}$, specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$, specific bulk viscosity $\zeta/s$, and mean free path $\lambda$ -- are substantially modified by spin polarization effects. Among the two sources, thermal vorticity-induced spin polarization dominates the modifications to these coefficients. Moreover, both $c_{s}^{2}$ and $\zeta/s$ exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on the collision energy, and the associated scaling behaviors potentially serve as indicators of the critical phenomena of QCD.</description>

      <title>Gaussian generally covariant hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a version of fluctuating relativistic hydrodynamics in a way very different from the usual derivation: Instead of treating it as a coarse-grained deterministic theory expanded in gradients of equilibrium quantities, we treat it as a stochastic theory, characterized by partition functions in each cells, expanded in cumulants. We show that the Gaussian ansatz allows us, via the gravitational Ward identities acting as a constraint between the variance and the average, to maintain full general covariance, with hydrodynamic flow emerging as an approximate Killing vector. If the symmetry of relativistic hydrodynamics, volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, is preserved, we show that linear response formulae are also generally covariant. We discuss our results and argue that in this approach, the applicability of the effective theory is parametrized around a very different quantity than the Knudsen number, offering hope of understanding the applicability of hydrodynamics to small systems.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flavor instabilities in a binary neutron star merger remnant: Roles of a long-lived hypermassive neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the post-merger evolution of binary neutron star merger (BNSM) requires accurate modeling of neutrino transport and microphysics including neutrino flavor conversions. Many previous studies have suggested that fast flavor instability (FFI) and collisional flavor instability (CFI) pervade inner regions of BNSM remnant, and they could impact on fluid dynamics and r-process nucleosynthesis. In this work, we re-examine prospects of occurrences of FFI and CFI using Boltzmann neutrino transport, assuming a frozen fluid background obtained from a numerical relativity simulation of BNSM. We pay special attention to a case involving a long-lived ($&gt;1\,$ s) hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). Apart from confirming the claim that these flavor instabilities can occur in BNSM remnants, some new insights are revealed. We identify multiple mechanisms responsible for generating electron neutrino lepton number (ELN) angular crossings, corresponding to a key indicator of FFI onset, which differ notably from those in black hole (BH) accretion disk systems. We argue that the appearance of positive chemical potential of electron-type neutrinos plays important roles on generating ELN angular crossings. For CFI, their growth rates are generally lower than FFI, but they can persistently occur in most of the accretion disk up to $\sim 1\,$ s. We also find that neglecting contributions of heavy-leptonic neutrinos results in overestimating growth rate and area of unstable regions of CFI. Our result suggests that FFI (CFI) tends to occur transiently (persistently) and locally (widespread in the disk), and FFI is more sensitive to the central compact object (HMNS or BH) than CFI, though more self-consistent simulations with incorporating effects of flavor conversions are needed to confirm these claims.</description>
