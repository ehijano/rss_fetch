      <title>Distance Distribution Functions and Probabilistic Metric Spaces on C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by using the concept of positive elements of $C^*$-algebras instead of the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, a generalization of distribution functions, with a particular focus on distance distribution functions has been introduced as a novel approach in statistical mathematics. Also, by applying this concept, probabilistic metric space on $C^*$-algebras is defined and some properties such as topology and fixed point theorems have been investigated. Finally, some examples and applications to integral equations are given.</description>

      <title>Commutativity of operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call an operator algebra A reversible if A with reversed multiplication is also an abstract operator algebra (in the modern operator space sense). This class of operator algebras is intimately related to the symmetric operator algebras: the subalgebras of B(H) on which the transpose map is a complete isometry. In previous work we studied the unital case, where reversibility is equivalent to commutativity. We give many sufficient conditions under which a nonunital reversible or symmetric operator algebra is commutative. We also give many complementary results of independent interest, and solve a few open questions from previous papers. Not every reversible or symmetric operator algebra is commutative, however we show that they all are 3-commutative. That is, order does not matter in the product of three or more elements from A. The proof of this relies on a rather technical analysis involving the injective envelope. Indeed nonunital algebras are often enormously more complicated than unital ones in regard to the topics we consider. On the positive side, our considerations raise very many questions even for low dimensional matrix algebras, some of which are of a computational nature and might be suitable for undergraduate research. The canonical anticommutation relation from mathematical physics plays a significant role.</description>

      <title>Real decomposable maps on operator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate and study the theory of ``real decomposable maps" between real operator systems. (Formally, this is new even in the complex case, which hitherto has restricted itself to the case where the systems are complex $C^*$-algebras.) We investigate how the definition interacts with the existing theory (which it generalizes) and with the complexification. A surprising term appears in the `Jordan decomposition' of real decomposable maps. This term constitutes a new class of completely bounded maps, a class that also showed up in disguised form in our recent study of real noncommutative (nc) convexity, and whose theory is likely to have applications in that subject. We also check the real case of many important known results related to decomposability, for example about the weak expectation property or injectivity of von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>Strategies for Cantor games and Operator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study no-signalling correlations over Cantor spaces, placing the product of infinitely many copies of a finite non-local game in a unified general setup. We define the subclasses of local, quantum spatial, approximately quantum and quantum commuting Cantor correlations and describe them in terms of states on tensor products of inductive limits of operator systems. We provide a correspondence between no-signalling (resp. approximately quantum, quantum commuting) Cantor correlations and sequences of correlations of the same type over the projections onto increasing number of finitely many coordinates. We introduce Cantor games, and associate canonically such a game to a sequence of finite input/output games, showing that the numerical sequence of the values of the games in the sequence converges to the corresponding value of the compound Cantor game.</description>

      <title>Matricial ranges, dilations, and unital contractive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $J_n$ be the Jordan block of size $n$ with all eigen values zero. Arveson introduced the notion of the matricial range of an operator in his remarkable article called Subalgebras of $C^*$-algebras II (Acta Math, 128, 1972) and established that every unital positive map on the operator system generated by $J_2$ is completely positive. This describes the matricial range of $J_2$ as the set of all matrices with numerical radius at most $\frac{1}{2}$. Later, Choi and Li generalize this result of Arveson and prove that every unital positive map on the operator system generated by any $2\times 2$ matrix or any $3\times3$ matrix with a reducing subspace is completely positive. After fifty years of the above result of Arveson, the matricial range of $J_n$ for $n\geq 3$ has not been characterized. This article aims to investigate this long-standing open problem for $n=3$. We begin by establishing a structure theorem for a dilation of an operator $B$ satisfying $BB^*+B^*B=I$ and then investigate whether every $B\in\mathbb{M}_n$ satisfying $BB^*+B^*B\leq I_n$ admits a dilation $\widetilde{B}$ for which $\widetilde{B}\widetilde{B}^*+\widetilde{B}^*\widetilde{B}=I$. This study plays the central role to the development of this paper. We use this to prove that every unital contractive map on the operator system generated by $J_3$ is $2$-positive and obtain some partial results towards characterizing the matricial range of $J_3$. Next, we study unital contractive maps on operator systems generated by $4\times 4$ normal matrices, and show that this is equivalent to studying a unital contractive map on the operator system generated by $T=\text{diag}(\lambda,-1,i,-i)$, where $\Re{(\lambda)}\geq 0$. We prove that every unital contractive map on the operator system generated by $T=\text{diag}(1,-1,i,-i)$ is completely positive.</description>

      <title>Invariant Random Subgroups, Soficity, and L\"uck's determinant conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend L\"uck's determinant conjecture from groups to invariant random subgroups (IRS) of free groups, a framework generalizing groups where a non-sofic object is known to exist. For every free group, we prove the existence of an IRS satisfying the determinant conjecture that is not co-hyperlinear, and hence not co-sofic. This provides evidence that satisfying the determinant conjecture might be a weaker property than soficity for groups, and consequently the conjecture possibly holds for all groups. We use techniques from non-local games and $\mathsf{MIP}^* = \mathsf{RE}$, showing more generally when the latter can be used to narrow down when a von Neumann algebra (or IRS) contains a non-Connes embeddable object.</description>

      <title>Relation morphisms of directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Associating graph algebras to directed graphs leads to both covariant and contravariant functors from suitable categories of graphs to the category k-Alg of algebras and algebra homomorphisms. As both functors are often used at the same time, finding a new category of graphs that allows a "common denominator" functor unifying the covariant and contravariant constructions is a fundamental problem. Herein, we solve this problem by first introducing the relation category of graphs RG, and then determining the concept of admissible graph relations that yields a subcategory of RG admitting a contravariant functor to k-Alg simultaneously generalizing the aforementioned covariant and contravariant functors. Although we focus on Leavitt path algebras and graph C*-algebras, on the way we unravel functors to k-Alg given by path algebras, Cohn path algebras and Toeplitz graph C*-algebras from suitable subcategories of RG. Better still, we illustrate relation morphisms of graphs by naturally occurring examples, including Cuntz algebras, quantum spheres and quantum balls.</description>

      <title>Deformations of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces on Homogeneous Subvarieties of the Unit Ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationships between a subvariety of the open unit ball in the complex $d$-dimensional space $\mathbb{C}^{d}$, the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) obtained by restricting the Drury-Arveson space to the variety, and its multiplier algebra.
  We show that if two such RKHSs are almost isometrically isomorphic as RKHSs, their multiplier algebras are likewise almost completely isometrically isomorphic as multiplier algebras. In such cases, the underlying varieties are almost automorphically equivalent. For tractable homogeneous varieties, we further show that if the corresponding multiplier algebras are almost completely isometrically isomorphic as multiplier algebras or one variety is almost the image of the other under a unitary transformation, then the associated RKHSs are almost isometrically isomorphic as RKHSs.</description>

      <title>$K$-Theory of Adelic and Rational Group $C^*$-algebras via Generalized Winding Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take the following approach to analyze homotopy equivalence in periodic adelic functions. First, we introduce the concept of pre-periodic functions and define their homotopy invariant through the construction of a generalized winding number. Subsequently, we establish a fundamental correspondence between periodic adelic functions and pre-periodic functions. By extending the generalized winding number to periodic adelic functions, we demonstrate that this invariant completely characterizes homotopy equivalence classes within the space of periodic adelic functions. Building on this classification, we obtain an explicit description of the $K_{1}$-group of the rational group $C^\ast$-algebra, $K_{1}(C^{*}(\mathbb{Q}))$. Finally, we employ a similar strategy to determine the structure of $K_1(C^{\ast}(\mathbb{A}))$.</description>

      <title>Algebra bundles, projective flatness and rationally-deformed tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that isomorphism classes $[\mathcal{A}]$ of flat $q\times q$ matrix bundles $\mathcal{A}$ (or projectively flat rank-$q$ complex vector bundles $\mathcal{E}$) on a pro-torus $\mathbb{T}$ are in bijective correspondence with the \v{C}ech cohomology group $H^2(\mathbb{T},\mu_q:=\text{$q^{th}$ roots of unity})$ (respectively $H^2(\mathbb{T},\mathbb{Z})$) via the image of $[A]\in H^1(\mathbb{T},PGL(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))$ through $H^1(\mathbb{T},PGL(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))\xrightarrow{\quad}H^2(\mathbb{T},\mu(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))$ (respectively the first Chern class $c_1(\mathcal{E})$). This is in the spirit of Auslander-Szczarba's result identifying real flat bundles on the torus with their first two Stiefel-Whitney classes, and contrasts with classifying spaces $B\Gamma$ of compact Lie groups $\Gamma$ (as opposed to $\mathbb{T}^n\cong B\mathbb{Z}^n$), on which flat non-trivial vector bundles abound. The discussion both recovers the Disney-Elliott-Kumjian-Raeburn classification of rational non-commutative tori $\mathbb{T}^n_{\theta}$ with a different, bundle-theoretic proof, and sheds some light on the connection between topological invariants associated to $\mathbb{T}^2_{\theta}$, $\theta\in\mathbb{Q}$ by Rieffel and respectively H{\o}egh-Krohn-Skjelbred.</description>
