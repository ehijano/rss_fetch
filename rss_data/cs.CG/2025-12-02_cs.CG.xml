      <title>Computing the Bottleneck Distance between Persistent Homology Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Persistent Homology Transform (PHT) summarizes a shape in $\R^m$ by collecting persistence diagrams obtained from linear height filtrations in all directions on $\mathbb{S}^{m-1}$. It enjoys strong theoretical guarantees, including continuity, stability, and injectivity on broad classes of shapes. A natural way to compare two PHTs is to use the bottleneck distance between their diagrams as the direction varies. Prior work has either compared PHTs by sampling directions or, in 2D, computed the exact \textit{integral} of bottleneck distance over all angles via a kinetic data structure. We improve the integral objective to $\tilde O(n^5)$ in place of earlier $\tilde O(n^6)$ bound. For the \textit{max} objective, we give a $\tilde O(n^3)$ algorithm in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and a $\tilde O(n^5)$ algorithm in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for N-Dimensional Visualization and Simulation: Implementation and Evaluation including 4D Boolean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01501v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a unified framework for simulation and visualization of intuitive exploration of phenomena in N-dimensional space. While specialized libraries offer powerful geometric algorithms, they typically lack integrated environments for interactive trial and error, creating a barrier for researchers. The contribution of this research is the integration of Quickhull-based mesh generation, visualization via hyperplane slicing, and computationally expensive Boolean operations into a single, extensible platform, while maintaining interactivity. To validate its effectiveness, this paper presents a 4-dimensional implementation and introduces a new interaction design, termed `High-Dimensional FPS,' to enable intuitive high-dimensional exploration. Furthermore, as a case study to demonstrate the framework's high extensibility, I also integrated a non-rigid body physics simulation based on Extended Position Based Dynamics (XPBD). Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving real-time rendering (80 fps) of complex 4D objects and completing Boolean operations within seconds in a standard PC environment. By providing an accessible and interactive platform, this work lowers the entry barrier for high-dimensional simulation research and enhances its potential for applications in education and entertainment.</description>

      <title>Gold-Medal-Level Olympiad Geometry Solving with Efficient Heuristic Auxiliary Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated theorem proving in Euclidean geometry, particularly for International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level problems, remains a major challenge and an important research focus in Artificial Intelligence. In this paper, we present a highly efficient method for geometry theorem proving that runs entirely on CPUs without relying on neural network-based inference. Our initial study shows that a simple random strategy for adding auxiliary points can achieve silver-medal level human performance on IMO. Building on this, we propose HAGeo, a Heuristic-based method for adding Auxiliary constructions in Geometric deduction that solves 28 of 30 problems on the IMO-30 benchmark, achieving gold-medal level performance and surpassing AlphaGeometry, a competitive neural network-based approach, by a notable margin. To evaluate our method and existing approaches more comprehensively, we further construct HAGeo-409, a benchmark consisting of 409 geometry problems with human-assessed difficulty levels. Compared with the widely used IMO-30, our benchmark poses greater challenges and provides a more precise evaluation, setting a higher bar for geometry theorem proving.</description>

      <title>Fast, Robust, Permutation-and-Sign Invariant SO(3) Pattern Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the correspondence-free alignment of two rotation sets on \(SO(3)\), a core task in calibration and registration that is often impeded by missing time alignment, outliers, and unknown axis conventions. Our key idea is to decompose each rotation into its \emph{Transformed Basis Vectors} (TBVs)-three unit vectors on \(S^2\)-and align the resulting spherical point sets per axis using fast, robust matchers (SPMC, FRS, and a hybrid). To handle axis relabels and sign flips, we introduce a \emph{Permutation-and-Sign Invariant} (PASI) wrapper that enumerates the 24 proper signed permutations, scores them via summed correlations, and fuses the per-axis estimates into a single rotation by projection/Karcher mean. The overall complexity remains linear in the number of rotations (\(\mathcal{O}(n)\)), contrasting with \(\mathcal{O}(N_r^3\log N_r)\) for spherical/\(SO(3)\) correlation. Experiments on EuRoC Machine Hall simulations
  (axis-consistent) and the ETH Hand-Eye benchmark (\texttt{robot\_arm\_real})
  (axis-ambiguous) show that our methods are accurate, 6-60x faster than traditional methods, and robust under extreme outlier ratios (up to 90\%), all without correspondence search.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Cost of Straight Lines: Quantifying Misallocation Risk in Voronoi-based Service Area Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voronoi tessellations are standard in spatial planning for assigning service areas based on Euclidean proximity, underpinning regulatory frameworks like the proximity principle in waste management. However, in regions with complex topography, Euclidean distance poorly approximates functional accessibility, causing misallocations that undermine efficiency and equity. This paper develops a probabilistic framework to quantify misallocation risk by modeling travel distances as random scaling of Euclidean distances and deriving incorrect assignment probability as a function of local Voronoi geometry. Using plant-municipality observations (n=383) in Extremadura, Spain (41,635 km2), we demonstrate that the Log-Normal distribution provides best relative fit among alternatives (K-S statistic=0.110). Validation reveals 15.4% of municipalities are misallocated, consistent with the theoretical prediction interval (52-65 municipalities at 95% confidence). Our framework achieves 95% agreement with complex spatial models at O(n) complexity. Poor absolute fit of global distributions (p-values&lt;0.01) reflects diverse topography (elevation 200-2,400m), motivating spatial stratification. Sensitivity analysis validates the fitted dispersion parameter (s=0.093) for predicting observed misallocation. We provide a calibration protocol requiring only 30-100 pilot samples per zone, enabling rapid risk assessment without full network analysis. This establishes the first probabilistic framework for Voronoi misallocation risk with practical guidelines emphasizing spatial heterogeneity and context-dependent calibration.</description>

      <title>Shelling and Sinking Graphs on the Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a promising approach to efficiently morph spherical graphs, extending earlier approaches of Awartani and Henderson [Trans. AMS 1987] and Kobourov and Landis [JGAA 2006]. Specifically, we describe two methods to morph shortest-path triangulations of the sphere by moving their vertices along longitudes into the southern hemisphere; we call a triangulation sinkable if such a morph exists. Our first method generalizes a longitudinal shelling construction of Awartani and Henderson; a triangulation is sinkable if a specific orientation of its dual graph is acyclic. We describe a simple polynomial-time algorithm to find a longitudinally shellable rotation of a given spherical triangulation, if one exists; we also construct a spherical triangulation that has no longitudinally shellable rotation. Our second method is based on a linear-programming characterization of sinkability. By identifying its optimal basis, we show that this linear program can be solved in $O(n^{\omega/2})$ time, where $\omega$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent, assuming the underlying linear system is non-singular. In addition to these main results, we describe a reduction from morphing shortest-path embeddings of 3-connected planar graphs on the sphere to morphing triangulations, and we describe an efficient algorithm that constructs morphs where each intermediate edge has at most one bend. Finally, we pose several conjectures and describe experimental results that support them.</description>

      <title>Further Results on Rendering Geometric Intersection Graphs Sparse by Dispersion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Removing overlaps is a central task in domains such as scheduling, visibility, and map labelling. This can be modelled using graphs, where overlap removals correspond to enforcing a certain sparsity constraint on the graph structure. We continue the study of the problem Geometric Graph Edit Distance (GGED), where the aim is to minimise the total cost of editing a geometric intersection graph to obtain a graph contained in a specific graph class. For us, the edit operation is the movement of objects, and the cost is the movement distance.
  We present an algorithm for rendering the intersection graph of a set of unit circular arcs (i)~edgeless, (ii)~acyclic, and (iii) $k$-clique-free in $O(n\log n)$ time, where $n$ is the number of arcs. We also show that GGED remains strongly NP-hard on unweighted interval graphs, solving an open problem of Honorato-Droguett et al. [WADS 2025]. We complement this result by showing that GGED is strongly NP-hard on sets of $d$-balls and $d$-cubes, for any $d\ge 2$. Finally, we present an XP algorithm (parameterised by the number of maximal cliques) that removes all edges from the intersection graph of a set of weighted unit intervals.</description>

      <title>Edge-Constrained Hamiltonian Paths on a Point Set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let S be a set of distinct points in general position in the Euclidean plane. A plane Hamiltonian path on S is a crossing-free geometric path such that every point of S is a vertex of the path. It is known that, if S is sufficiently large, there exist three edge-disjoint plane Hamiltonian paths on S. In this paper we study an edge-constrained version of the problem of finding Hamiltonian paths on a point set. We first consider the problem of finding a single plane Hamiltonian path pi with endpoints s, t in S and constraints given by a segment ab, where a, b in S. We consider the following scenarios: (i) ab in pi; (ii) ab not in pi. We characterize those quintuples (S, a, b, s, t) for which pi exists. Secondly, we consider the problem of finding two plane Hamiltonian paths pi_1, pi_2 on a set S with constraints given by a segment ab, where a, b in S. We consider the following scenarios: (i) pi_1 and pi_2 share no edges and ab is an edge of pi_1; (ii) pi_1 and pi_2 share no edges and none of them includes ab as an edge; (iii) both pi_1 and pi_2 include ab as an edge and share no other edges. In all cases, we characterize those triples (S, a, b) for which pi_1 and pi_2 exist.</description>
