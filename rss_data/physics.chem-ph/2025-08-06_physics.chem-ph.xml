      <description>arXiv:2508.02696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By measuring a small circularly polarized component in the scattered light, we report the first observation of Rayleigh optical activity (RayOA) for typical chiral molecules, namely the two enantiomers of $\alpha$-pinene. Our work validates fundamental theoretical predictions made over fifty years ago and expands the chiroptical toolkit.</description>

      <title>Endpoint slippage analysis in the presence of impedance rise and loss of active material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The endpoint slippage analysis can be used to quantify the reduction and oxidation side-reactions occurring in rechargeable batteries. Application of this technique often disregards the interference of additional aging modes, such as impedance rise and loss of active material (LAM). Here, we show that these modes can themselves induce slippage of endpoints, making the direct determination of parasitic reactions more difficult. We provide equations that describe the slippages caused by LAM and impedance rise. We show that these equations can, in principle, account for the contribution of these additional modes to endpoint slippage, enabling correction of testing data to quantify the side-reactions of interest. However, the challenge with this approach is that it requires information about the average Li content of disconnected active material domains, which is, in many cases, unknowable. The present work explores mathematical connections between measurable quantities (such as capacity fade and endpoint slippages) and the extent of LAM or impedance rise endured by the cell, and discuss how the tracking of endpoints can better serve battery diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-grand canonical molecular dynamics via volumetrically controlled osmotic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are typically constrained to have a fixed number of particles, which limits our capability to simulate chemical and physical processes where the composition of the system changes during the simulation time. Typical examples are the calculation of nucleation and crystal growth rates in heterogeneous solutions where the driving force depends on the composition of the fluid. Constant chemical potential molecular dynamics simulations would instead be required to compute time-independent growth and nucleation rates. While this can, in principle, be achieved through the addition and deletion of particles using the grand canonical partition function, this is very inefficient in the condensed phase due to the low acceptance probability of these events. Adaptive resolution schemes, which use a reservoir of non-interacting particles that can be transformed into solute particles, circumvent this problem, but at the cost of relatively complicated code implementations. In this work, a simpler approach is proposed that uses harmonic volumetric restraints to control the solute osmotic pressure, which can be considered a proxy for the system's chemical potential. The osmotic pressure regulator is demonstrated to reproduce the expected properties of ideal gases and ideal solutions. Using the mW water model, the osmotic pressure regulator is shown to provide a constant growth rate for ice in the presence of an electrolyte solution, unlike what standard molecular dynamics simulations would produce.</description>

      <title>Is the Electron Hydrated Through Covalent Sharing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrated electron ($e_{aq}^-$), a key species in radiation chemistry, is traditionally modeled as an interior electron confined within a solvent cavity and stabilized by electrostatic interactions. However, this picture fails to account for its high binding energy and discrete excited states, as the cavity lacks sufficient dipole strength to support deep electronic confinement. Using \textit{ab initio} methods that capture resonant interactions between the free electron and water, we show that the hydrated electron is stabilized through covalent delocalization. Existing approaches misrepresent this as electrostatic trapping within a cavity -- an interpretation rooted in assumptions of a pre-bound electron and the omission of the resonant character of the initial interaction between the free electron and water. Our results reveal that the electron forms transient negative ion molecular states through resonant attachment to neighboring water molecules, where it is initially captured, and delocalizes over them via an intermolecular bonding network formed by the superposition of $a_1$ valence orbitals. This covalent delocalization yields cavity-like structures without requiring electrostatic trapping and naturally explains observed spectral features, including higher-nodal excited states and enhanced binding energies. In short, cavity formation is initiated by \textit{associative electron attachment (AEA)} -- a molecular process driven by a resonant interaction between the free electron and its neighboring water molecules, and wherein the electron becomes covalently shared to them -- during the energy dissipation phase of the free electron preceding full solvation.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics of ice-active solutions at ice-water interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small molecules that interact strongly with water were the subject of this molecular dynamics (MD) study. These solutes include a cryoprotectant (DMSO), a polyalcohol [CH$_2$(OH)$_2$], carboxylic acid conjugates (HCOOH and HCOONa), an ammonium salt (NH$_4$Cl), and two alkyl halide salts (NaCl and NaF). MD simulations were carried out for bulk supercooled liquids and solutions in contact with ice. Solute and water hydrogen bonding, orientational and translational order, and hydrogen bond jump dynamics were compared in bulk and as a function of distance from the solute molecules. Reverse non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (RNEMD) simulations were used to determine interfacial widths, friction coefficients ($\kappa$) with ice, and solution phase viscosities ($\eta$). Ionic solutes were found to reduce orientational and translational ordering near the ice interfaces. However, in bulk liquids, we find a correlation between orientational ordering and the statistics of water hydrogen bonds -- a donor-acceptor imbalance in water has the greatest impact on ordering in the bulk liquids. Although ionic solutions exhibited similar effects on the water structure, the effect on dynamics depends most directly on donor-acceptor imbalance. Solutes that are hydrogen bond acceptors were found to slow hydrogen bond lifetimes relative to hydrogen bond donors. We also observed a direct correlation between the liquid phase hydrogen-bond jump times and shear viscosity. Finally, of all the solutes studied, only DMSO and sodium formate exhibited increased friction at the ice-water interface.</description>

      <title>FlowBack-Adjoint: Physics-Aware and Energy-Guided Conditional Flow-Matching for All-Atom Protein Backmapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) molecular models of proteins can substantially increase the time and length scales accessible to molecular dynamics simulations of proteins, but recovery of accurate all-atom (AA) ensembles from CG simulation trajectories can be essential for exposing molecular mechanisms of folding and docking and for calculation of physical properties requiring atomistic detail. The recently reported deep generative model FlowBack restores AA detail to protein C-alpha traces using a flow-matching architecture and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in generation of AA structural ensembles. Training, however, is performed exclusively on structural data and the absence of any awareness of interatomic energies or forces within training results in small fractions of incorrect bond lengths, atomic clashes, and otherwise high-energy structures. In this work, we introduce FlowBack-Adjoint as a lightweight enhancement that upgrades the pre-trained FlowBack model through a one-time, physics-aware post-training pass. Auxiliary contributions to the flow introduce physical awareness of bond lengths and Lennard-Jones interactions and gradients of a molecular mechanics force field energy are incorporated via adjoint matching to steer the FlowBack-Adjoint vector field to produce lower-energy configurations. In benchmark tests against FlowBack, FlowBack-Adjoint lowers single-point energies by a median of ~78 kcal/mol.residue, reduces errors in bond lengths by &gt;92%, eliminates &gt;98% of molecular clashes, maintains excellent diversity of the AA configurational ensemble, and produces configurations capable of initializing stable all-atom molecular dynamics simulations without requiring energy relaxation. We propose FlowBack-Adjoint as an accurate and efficient physics-aware deep generative model for AA backmapping from C-alpha traces.</description>

      <title>Photochemical Haze Formation on Titan and Uranus: A Comparative Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of haze layers in planetary atmospheres play a critical role in shaping their chemical composition, radiative balance, and optical properties. In the outer solar system, the atmospheres of Titan and the giant planets exhibit a wide range of compositional and seasonal variability, creating environments favorable for the production of complex organic molecules under low-temperature conditions. Among them, Uranus -- the smallest of the ice giants -- has, since Voyager 2, emerged as a compelling target for future exploration due to unanswered questions regarding the composition and structure of its atmosphere, as well as its ring system and diverse icy moon population (which includes four possible ocean worlds). Titan, as the only moon to harbor a dense atmosphere, presents some of the most complex and unique organics found in the solar system. Central to the production of these organics are chemical processes driven by low-energy photons and electrons (&lt;50 eV), which initiate reaction pathways leading to the formation of organic species and gas phase precursors to high-molecular-weight compounds, including aerosols. These aerosols, in turn, remain susceptible to further processing by low-energy UV radiation as they are transported from the upper atmosphere to the lower stratosphere and troposphere where condensation occurs. In this review, I aim to summarize the current understanding of low-energy (&lt;50 eV) photon- and electron-induced chemistry, drawing on decades of insights from studies of Titan, with the objective of evaluating the relevance and extent of these processes on Uranus in anticipation of future observational and in situ exploration.</description>

      <title>A neural network machine-learning approach for characterising hydrogen trapping parameters from TDS experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrogen trapping behaviour of metallic alloys is generally characterised using Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS). However, as an indirect method, extracting key parameters (trap binding energies and densities) remains a significant challenge. To address these limitations, this work introduces a machine learning-based scheme for parameter identification from TDS spectra. A multi-Neural Network (NN) model is developed and trained exclusively on synthetic data to predict trapping parameters directly from experimental data. The model comprises two multi-layer, fully connected, feed-forward NNs trained with backpropagation. The first network (classification model) predicts the number of distinct trap types. The second network (regression model) then predicts the corresponding trap densities and binding energies. The NN architectures, hyperparameters, and data pre-processing were optimised to minimise the amount of training data. The proposed model demonstrated strong predictive capabilities when applied to three tempered martensitic steels of different compositions. The code developed is freely provided.</description>

      <title>Estimating Trotter Approximation Errors to Optimize Hamiltonian Partitioning for Lower Eigenvalue Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trotter approximation in conjunction with Quantum Phase Estimation can be used to extract eigen-energies of a many-body Hamiltonian on a quantum computer. There were several ways proposed to assess the quality of this approximation based on estimating the norm of the difference between the exact and approximate evolution operators. Here, we explore how different error estimators correlate with the true error in the ground state energy due to Trotter approximation. For a set of small molecules we calculate these exact error in ground-state electronic energies due to the second-order Trotter approximation. Comparison of these errors with previously used upper bounds show correlation less than 0.4 across various Hamiltonian partitionings. On the other and, building the Trotter approximation error estimation based on perturbation theory up to a second order in the time-step for eigenvalues provides estimates with very good correlations with the exact Trotter approximation errors. These findings highlight the non-faithful character of norm-based estimations for prediction of a Trotter-based eigenvalue estimation performance and the need of alternative estimators. The developed perturbative estimates can be used for practical time-step and Hamiltonian partitioning selection protocols, which are needed for an accurate assessment of quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: II. Modeling the dynamics of radiationless transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15425v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To determine the effect of nonradiative excitation energy transfer on the fluorescence of a rigid multicomponent solution, a new analytical method was developed by treating this transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain (TRMC). In the TRMC approach, we assume that the Markov chain under consideration is governed by bivariate joint probability mass-density functions. One of the random variables is discrete and represents the state number to which the process passes at a given step, while the other random variable is continuous and determines the moment in time at which this transition occurs. In general, the time distributions of this second variable can be arbitrary, continuous or discrete, and not just exponential, as required by the method known as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC). The agreement between the basic expressions of the TRMC method and the analogous expressions of the renewal theory has been demonstrated. The correctness of the TRMC method is confirmed by the fact that the time courses of fluorescence intensities calculated by this method agree with those calculated using ordinary analytical methods. In the section on calculating the quantum yields of individual components, the suitability of a method known as discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) was found. However, we argue that the DTMC method does not refer to time and propose to rename it as time-unspecified Markov chain (TUMC). The results generated by TRMC, when integrated over time, become equivalent to those generated by TUMC. The fluorescence cases of binary and ternary solutions are discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Convex envelope method for T, p flash calculations for mixtures with an arbitrary number of components and arbitrary aggregate states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $T, p$ flash calculations determine the correct number of phases at phase equilibrium and their compositions for fixed temperature and pressure. They are essential for chemical process simulation and optimization. The convex envelope method (CEM) is an existing approach that employs the tangent plane criterion to determine liquid phase equilibria for mixtures with an arbitrary number of components without providing the number of phases beforehand. This work extends the CEM to include also vapor and solid phases. Thus, any phase equilibrium of a given mixture with an arbitrary number of components and phases can be calculated over the whole composition space. The CEM results are presented for various vapor-liquid and solid-liquid phase equilibria examples of up to four components. We show how the CEM can be used for parameter fitting of $g^E$-models. As an outlook, we demonstrate how the CEM can be combined with a machine learning-based tool for property prediction to construct phase equilibria.</description>

      <title>Neural Scaling Laws Surpass Chemical Accuracy for the Many-Electron Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, that neural scaling laws can deliver near-exact solutions to the many-electron Schr\"odinger equation across a broad range of realistic molecules. This progress is enabled by the Lookahead Variational Algorithm (LAVA), an effective optimization scheme that systematically translates increased model size and computational resources into greatly improved energy accuracy for neural network wavefunctions. Across all tested cases, including benzene, the absolute energy error exhibits a systematic power-law decay with respect to model capacity and computation resources. The resulting energies not only surpass the 1 kcal/mol "chemical-accuracy" threshold but also achieve 1 kJ/mol subchemical accuracy. Beyond energies, the scaled-up neural network also yields better wavefunctions with improved physical symmetries, alongside accurate electron densities, dipole moments, and other important properties. Our approach offers a promising way forward to addressing many long-standing challenges in quantum chemistry. For instance, we improve energetic properties for systems such as the potential energy curve of nitrogen dimer as dissociation is approached and the cyclobutadiene automerization reaction barrier, producing definitive benchmarks, particularly in regimes where experimental data are sparse or highly uncertain. We also shed light on the decades-old puzzle of the cyclic ozone stability with highly accurate calculations for the cyclic-to-open ozone barrier. These results provide near-exact reference calculations with unprecedented accuracy, universal reliability and practical applicability, establishing a foundation for AI-driven quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>PET-MAD, a lightweight universal interatomic potential for advanced materials modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have greatly extended the reach of atomic-scale simulations, offering the accuracy of first-principles calculations at a fraction of the cost. Leveraging large quantum mechanical databases and expressive architectures, recent ''universal'' models deliver qualitative accuracy across the periodic table but are often biased toward low-energy configurations. We introduce PET-MAD, a generally applicable MLIP trained on a dataset combining stable inorganic and organic solids, systematically modified to enhance atomic diversity. Using a moderate but highly-consistent level of electronic-structure theory, we assess PET-MAD's accuracy on established benchmarks and advanced simulations of six materials. Despite the small training set and lightweight architecture, PET-MAD is competitive with state-of-the-art MLIPs for inorganic solids, while also being reliable for molecules, organic materials, and surfaces. It is stable and fast, enabling the near-quantitative study of thermal and quantum mechanical fluctuations, functional properties, and phase transitions out of the box. It can be efficiently fine-tuned to deliver full quantum mechanical accuracy with a minimal number of targeted calculations.</description>
