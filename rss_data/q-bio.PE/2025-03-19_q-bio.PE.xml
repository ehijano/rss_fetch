      <title>Impact of network connectivity on the dynamics of populations in stream environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the impact of network connectivity on the dynamics of a population in a stream environment. The population is modeled using a graph theoretical framework, with habitats represented by isolated patches. We introduce a change in connectivity into the model through the addition of a bi-directional or one-directional edge between two patches and examine the impact of this edge modification on the metapopulation growth rate and the network biomass. Our main results indicate that adding a bi-directional edge often decreases both measures, while the effect of adding an one-directional edge is more intricate and dependent on the model parameters. We establish complete analytical results for stream networks of three patches, and provide some generalizations and conjectures for more general stream networks of $n$ patches. These conjectures are supported with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Functional Motifs in Foodwebs and Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When studying a complex system it is often useful to think of the system as a network of interacting units. One can then ask if some properties of the entire network are already explained by a small part of the network - a network motif. A famous example of an ecological motif is competitive exclusion in foodwebs, where the presence of two species competing for a shared resource precludes the existence of a stable equilibrium for the whole system. However, other examples of motifs with such direct impacts on stability are not known. Here we explain why small motifs that allow conclusions on systemic stability are rare. Moreover, we show that another dynamical property, reactivity, is naturally rooted in motifs. Computing the reactivity in motifs can reveal which parts of a network are prone to respond violently to perturbations. This highlights motif reactivity as a useful property to measure in real-world systems to understand likely modes of systemic failure in foodwebs, epidemics, supply chains and other applications.</description>

      <title>Modeling Epidemics with Memory Effects: an Open Quantum System Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a quantum-inspired epidemic model to study the dynamics of an infectious disease in a population divided into compartments. By treating the healthy population as a large reservoir, we construct a framework based on open quantum systems and a Hilbert space formalism to model the spread of the infection. This approach allows for a mathematical framework that captures both Markovian and semi-Markovian dynamics in the evolution equations.
  Through numerical experiments, we examine the impact of varying memory parameters on the epidemic evolution, focusing in particular on the conditions under which the model remains physically admissible.</description>

      <title>A generalized Price equation for fuzzy set-mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Price equation provides a formal account of selection building on a right-total mapping between two classes of individuals, that is usually interpreted as a parent-offspring relation. This paper presents a new formulation of the Price equation in terms of fuzzy set-mappings to account for structures where the targets of selection may vary in the degree to which they belong to the classes of 'parents' and 'offspring,' and in the degree to which these two classes of individuals are related. The fuzzy set formulation widens the scope of the Price equation such that it equally applies to natural selection, cultural selection, operant selection, and even selection in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equlibrium inference of feeding rates through population data from generic consumer-resource stochastic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical models are often structurally unidentifiable, because different sets of parameters can lead to equal model outcomes. To be useful for prediction and parameter inference from data, stochastic population models need to be identifiable, this meaning that model parameters can be uniquely inferred from a large number of model observations. In particular, precise estimation of feeding rates in consumer-resource dynamics is crucial, because consumer-resource processes are central in determining biomass transport across ecosystems. Model parameters are usually estimated at stationarity, because in that case model analyses are often easier. In this contribution we analyze the problem of parameter redundancy in a multi-resource consumer-resource model, showing that model indentifiability depends on whether the dynamics have reached stationarity or not. To be precise, we: (i) Calculate the steady-state and out-of-equilibrium probability distributions of predator's abundances analytically using generating functions, which allow us to unveil parameter redundancy and carry out proper maximum likelihood estimation. (ii) Conduct \emph{in silico} experiments by tracking the abundance of consumers that are either searching for or handling prey, data then used for maximum likelihood parameter estimation. (iii) Show that, when model observations are recorded out of equilibrium, feeding parameters are truly identifiable, whereas if sampling is done solely at stationarity, only ratios of rates can be inferred from data (i.e., parameters are redundant). We discuss the implications of our results when inferring parameters of general dynamical models.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing semi-directed level-1 networks using few quarnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-directed networks are partially directed graphs that model evolution where the directed edges represent reticulate evolutionary events. We present an algorithm that reconstructs binary $n$-leaf semi-directed level-1 networks in $O( n^2)$ time from its quarnets (4-leaf subnetworks). Our method assumes we have direct access to all quarnets, yet uses only an asymptotically optimal number of $O(n \log n)$ quarnets. When the network is assumed to contain no triangles, our method instead relies only on four-cycle quarnets and the splits of the other quarnets. A variant of our algorithm works with quartets rather than quarnets and we show that it reconstructs most of a semi-directed level-1 network from an asymptotically optimal $O(n \log n)$ of the quartets it displays. Additionally, we provide an $O(n^3)$ time algorithm that reconstructs the tree-of-blobs of any binary $n$-leaf semi-directed network with unbounded level from $O(n^3)$ splits of its quarnets.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of macroscopic dynamics by fine-grained disorder in many-species ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central feature of complex systems is the relevance and entanglement of different levels of description. For instance, the dynamics of ecosystems can be alternatively described in terms of large ecological processes and classes of organisms, or of individual species and their relations. Low-dimensional heuristic 'macroscopic' models that are widely used to capture ecological relationships -- and commonly evidence out-of equilibrium regimes -- implicitly assume that species-level 'microscopic' heterogeneity can be neglected. Here, we address the stability of such macroscopic descriptions to the addition of disordered microscopic interactions. We find that increased heterogeneity can stabilize collective as well as species fluctuations -- contrary to the well-known destabilizing effect of disorder on fixed points. We analytically find the conditions for the existence of heterogeneity-driven equilibria, and relate their stability to a mismatch in microscopic time scales. This may shed light onto the empirical observation that many-species ecosystems often appear stable at aggregated levels despite highly diverse interactions and large fluctuations at the species level.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic enumeration of normal and hybridization networks via tree decoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetic networks provide a more general description of evolutionary relationships than rooted phylogenetic trees. One way to produce a phylogenetic network is to randomly place $k$ arcs between the edges of a rooted binary phylogenetic tree with $n$ leaves. The resulting directed graph may fail to be a phylogenetic network, and even when it is (and thereby a `tree-based' network), it may fail to be a tree-child or normal network. In this paper, we first show that if $k$ is fixed, the proportion of arc placements that result in a normal network tends to 1 as $n$ grows. From this result, the asymptotic enumeration of normal networks becomes straightforward and provides a transparent meaning to the combinatorial terms that arise. Moreover, the approach extends to allow $k$ to grow with $n$ (at the rate $o(n^\frac{1}{3})$), which was not handled in earlier work. We also investigate a subclass of normal networks of particular relevance in biology (hybridization networks) and establish that the same asymptotic results apply.</description>

      <title>An SIRS model with hospitalizations: economic impact by disease severity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-timescale SIRS-type model in which a fraction $\theta$ of infected individuals experiences a severe course of the disease, requiring hospitalization. During hospitalization, these individuals do not contribute to further infections. We analyze the model's equilibria, perform a bifurcation analysis, and explore its two-timescale nature (using techniques from Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory). Our main result provides an explicit expression for the value of $\theta$ that maximizes the total number of hospitalized individuals for long times, revealing that this fraction can be lower than 1. This highlights the interesting effect that a severe disease, by necessitating widespread hospitalization, can indirectly suppress contagions and, consequently, reduce hospitalizations. Numerical simulations illustrate the growth in the number of hospitalizations for short times. The model can also be interpreted as a scenario where only a fraction $\theta$ of infected individuals develops symptoms and self-quarantines.</description>
