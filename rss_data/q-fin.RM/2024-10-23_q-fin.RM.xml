      <title>Beyond the Bid-Ask: Strategic Insights into Spread Prediction and the Global Mid-Price Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research extends the conventional concepts of the bid--ask spread (BAS) and mid-price to include the total market order book bid--ask spread (TMOBBAS) and the global mid-price (GMP). Using high-frequency trading data, we investigate these new constructs, finding that they have heavy tails and significant deviations from normality in the distributions of their log returns, which are confirmed by three different methods. We shift from a static to a dynamic analysis, employing the ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1) model to capture the temporal dependencies in the return time-series, with the normal inverse Gaussian distribution used to capture the heavy tails of the returns. We apply an option pricing model to address the risks associated with the low liquidity indicated by the TMOBBAS and GMP. Additionally, we employ the Rachev ratio to evaluate the risk--return performance at various depths of the limit order book and examine tail risk interdependencies across spread levels. This study provides insights into the dynamics of financial markets, offering tools for trading strategies and systemic risk management.</description>

      <title>Is the difference between deep hedging and delta hedging a statistical arbitrage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent work of Horikawa and Nakagawa (2024) claims that under a complete market admitting statistical arbitrage, the difference between the hedging position provided by deep hedging and that of the replicating portfolio is a statistical arbitrage. This raises concerns as it entails that deep hedging can include a speculative component aimed simply at exploiting the structure of the risk measure guiding the hedging optimisation problem. We test whether such finding remains true in a GARCH-based market model, which is an illustrative case departing from complete market dynamics. We observe that the difference between deep hedging and delta hedging is a speculative overlay if the risk measure considered does not put sufficient relative weight on adverse outcomes. Nevertheless, a suitable choice of risk measure can prevent the deep hedging agent from engaging in speculation.</description>

      <title>A new paradigm of mortality modeling via individual vitality dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The significance of mortality modeling extends across multiple research areas, ranging from life insurance valuation to optimal lifetime decision-making. Existing approaches, such as mortality laws and factor-based models, often fall short in capturing the complexity of individual mortality, hindering their ability to address specific research needs. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach to mortality modeling centered on the dynamics of individual vitality. A four-component framework is developed to account for initial conditions, natural aging processes, stochastic fluctuations, and accidental events over an individual's lifetime. We demonstrate the framework's analytical capabilities across various settings and explore its practical implications in solving life insurance problems and deriving optimal lifetime decisions. Our results show that the proposed framework not only encompasses existing mortality models but also provides individualized mortality outcomes and offers an intuitive explanation for survival biases.</description>
