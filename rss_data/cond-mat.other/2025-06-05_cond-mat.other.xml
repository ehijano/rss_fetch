      <title>Flat-band compactons in a two-dimensional driven-dissipative Lieb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study the effect of inter-particle interactions on the flat-band states of a two-dimensional Lieb lattice with drive and dissipation. Exploiting the giant nonlinear interactions of exciton polaritons we observe compactly localised solitons (compactons) embedded within the continuum of propagating state bands -- a form of nonlinear bound state in the continuum (BIC). The driven-dissipative nature of the system leads to a sudden self-localisation into the compacton state above a threshold power. The experimental results agree well with numerical simulations. These results have implications for the physics of interacting quantum particles in flat-band systems and for generation of quantum-correlated light and spatially multiplexed coherent information transport.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Degradation of Unentangled Polymer Melts under Uniaxial Extensional Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex flow fields govern the deformation of polymers in various manufacturing processes. However, high flow rates may trigger reaction events (i.e., bond breaking or undesirable reaction of mechanophores) in raw polymeric materials, leading to the mechanical or functional debasement of manufactured structures. Additionally, it is difficult to fully characterize such molecular-level flow in the laboratory due to time- and length-scale limits. In this study, we perform non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations to explore the rheological and mechanical degradation of unentangled polymer melts under uniaxial extensional flow (UEF), allowing for chain breaking. Our simulations demonstrate shear thickening-thinning-thickening stages with the increase of UEF extension rates, resulting from flow-induced changes of chain conformation. With further increasing UEF extension rates, a bond-breaking potential leads to another flow thinning stage. Interestingly, fracture kinetics is originally first-order owing to the need for highly stretched polymer chains before bond fracture. It is no longer first-order when bond fracture is instigated before chains are stretched. Our computational work provides insight into the optimal design of the manufacturing process for polymeric materials.</description>

      <title>Mixed state concurrence for symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method to quantify entanglement in mixed states of highly symmetric systems. Symmetry constrains interactions between parts and predicts the degeneracies of the states. While symmetry alone produces entangled eigenstates, the thermal mixed state (density) which contains all of the eigenstate densities weighted by their Boltzmann factors is not necessarily as entangled as the eigenstates themselves because generally the mixed state can be re-expressed as a sum over densities which are less entangled. The entanglement of the mixed state is the minimum obtained by considering all such re-expressions, but there is no well-defined approach to solving this problem generally. Our method uses symmetry to explicitly construct unentangled densities, which are then optimally included in the thermal mixed state, resulting in a quantitative measure of entanglement that accounts for the reduction of entanglement arising from degenerate states. We present results for several small spin systems.</description>
